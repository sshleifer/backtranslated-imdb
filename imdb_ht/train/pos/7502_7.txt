Even though I really did not feel anything for Lance's character, and felt his wife could do better with anyone else. It could be a stronger movie if they spent more time on character development, perhaps with Lance-I'd love to read it better. However, I have completely disagree with DoyleLuver, when saying "And to Character's character Glenn Quinn: 'I'm the star here in it, that's right I'm one talent!'" If you watch the movie, just watch Him, even when he's in the background ... just his face expression, all of the eyes you know to ensure what motivates Ben, exactly how he feels about commenting, even though it's a quick look back a character. Great acting in a fair movie.
