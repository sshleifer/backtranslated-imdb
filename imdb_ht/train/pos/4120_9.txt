<br /> In 1970, after a five-year absence, Kurosawa did what would be his first film in color. Dode 'Ka-Den is a movie that focuses on many interval stories that go to a small Tokyo suburb. The title comes from the sound of a mentally timid boy doing as he imagines he is operating a train. We slowly get to know more of the people in the small community, the circles that trade their wives because they are not happy with what they have. The old man is the center of the city that helps out a burglar who tries to steal him. Father is very poor and son who can never afford a home, imagining one up to their own. At the end of the movie, the stories all come full circle, some turn out happy, others sad. Since this was the first Kurosawa film color you can see that he uses it to his advantage and shows. Maybe too much. This movie goes in many different directions and it's hard to settle down and get into it. But do not get me wrong, Dode 'Ka-Den may not be the best Kurosawa, but comes from the greatest director of all time, it's better than 99% of today's films.
