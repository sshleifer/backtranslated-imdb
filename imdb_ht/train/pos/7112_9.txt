A very good movie ever while showing off the war on a native boy who stumbles over Guadalcanal and has to come home and re-adjusts himself with the help of family and friends. An excellent cast of the actor helps make this movie very fun. Eleanor Parker's role as the girlfriend was worthy of an Oscar nomination. He has such an innocent man in this film. Ann Doran's role was equally satisfying as she had every role to support her. I especially love the city Aura in Phildelphia pre-war. The hunting scene is very good. Of course, the War Guadalcanal scene really showed the horror facing by our soldiers during this epic battle. A well-deserved film with one that should not be forgotten
