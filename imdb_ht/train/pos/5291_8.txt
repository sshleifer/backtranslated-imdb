It was only a week since I first saw John Waters movie (Female problem), and I did not know what to expect the second time. <br /> While the previous movie was scandalously on the top, Pecker is actually a comic movie that satirizes the art critics of New York to a T. Anyone who can not imagine what they "Experts" get to do appealing to modern art, will enjoy seeing these pretest snobbers get so full of heads on Pecker, a boy who just found a broken camera and start shooting his friends and neighbors. Edward Furlong (Pet Sematary II, Terminator 2: Judgment Day) was amazingly good Pecker. There were not many meat on any of the roles in this movie, but it really shines. Christina Ricci (Prozac Nation) comes in with another great performance as Pecker's girlfriend. In fact, it was a banner year for Ricci (Buffalo '66, the opposite of Sex, and Pecker. Lili Taylor, who had only good role in the Ante, was also an important part of the film and really did it's fun. <br /> There are many funny scenes, but I said the best was when a crown gathered shout, "We want bush!" "We want shrubs!" "We want bush!" I thought It was a Republican convention until I saw the police transported into the dancer. <br /> I'll have to look for more of Waters' work, especially Hairspray, now that's what's up to the news.
