This is the kind of photo John Lassiter should do today, if he did not for the CGI advances. And it's just to say that it should be forgotten, too, if technology has not made these sexy things and kewl since 1983. _Twice ..._ had the same understanding, imagination, and sense of real stimulation that you would get in a pixar flame, only executed under the restrictions of the medium c. 1983. Innovative animation techniques combine with a great script and excellent voice to produce a movie that appeals to many levels. It should speak of the same breath with _Spiritited Away_ and _Toy Story_.
