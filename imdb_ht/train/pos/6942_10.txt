Of the fiftieth age restrictions for films in Brazil were: no restrictions, 10 years, 14 years old and 18 years old. Usually westerners were permitted for ten years, when they had a little more of their violence going to 14, but it was rare to see a west restricted for youth than 18. Winchester 73 was one of those people, and I think this explains very well how this film was considered different from average. The hero James Stewart fought against his own brother who killed his father. He was looking for revenge and seemed quite traumatized, far from the good guy guy. Anthony Mann tried to variation on this kind of character in the next movie she was doing with Stewart. Shelley Winters, the leading lady was far more vigilant, holding these men who stayed with the rifle. Dan Duryea as Waco Johnnie Dean is one of those great bandits who will always remember. The story of the movie, which always follows the remaining man and the rifle, is one of the best suited for a west. It must have been done in a movie Fritz Lang, which did not come in. When he offered to Mann he made a point of starting out from zero again and did not take anything that was prepared for language. With Winchester, Mann creates a different conception in the west, but it still maintains its traditions. Winchester still is a great movie to see again and again, but nothing will be comparable to the impression he has made to those who have seen it when it was originally released.
