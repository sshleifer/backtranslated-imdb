This version of House Bleak is the best adaptation of a classic novel known to me. The court's representation of chances as a 'character' of the drama is magnificent. The act is wonderful, from the disaster Tulkinghorn, to the dedlocks, snacks, Crooke, Miss Flyte, and two young lovers. But the Spider's web site is chancery that holds everything together, and the cinematography is superb. What BBC error does on copyright mean that this version can not be seen in the UK on either video or DVD for many years? I tried to get out of them, but was facing a stone wall. At the end I received a copy of DVD in Canada.
