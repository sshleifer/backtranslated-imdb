This is an excellent example of what can be done on a small budget film. The act is excellent regard to the script & the whole atmosphere of the film is very foreboding. The Gore is well made and used little (look out for the excellent death wire wires) and the action is punch when used. It is true that there are dodgy lines in the script at times, but compared to other movies about the same (or bigger) budget, it's hardly apparent at all. In general, this is recommended. Believe me, it's better than it looks! 8/10
