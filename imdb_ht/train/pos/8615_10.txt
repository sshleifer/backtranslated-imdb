I waited for this movie out for a while in Canada, and when it finally did, I was very excited to see it. I really like it. Of course, in the beginning, it is a very sad movie (and it was New Years Day - to make it even sad) - however, it sticks to you. The next day, I thought about it again, because although it revolves around something so emotionally dry, you realize after a few days that it is such a beautiful story. How can one see this as a link to many people, but sometimes you can hide so much. And how Diane Keaton's character saved the rest of them not just being there. And how to save it in the process too. It was such an excellent movie, and Chris Pine (one of my favorite actors) to give the perfect funny rescue. It is definitely a movie that will need a box of tissues, but they will really stay with you for a long time.
