Radiofreccia is a movie about us all, about our dreams, our friends, our obsessions, our addictions, our fears. It's a brilliant movie where a group of friends like us all have life in the struggles of growing up in a small town in one of the most important decades of the last century. The movie does not take a happy or sad approach to things, it just tells us a story, one that everyone of us could have experienced. One of happiness and excitement, sadness and grief. This story is in that we grow to love the characters, it is one of those movies you will look over and over again, feeling closer to the small town of Emilia Romagna where it takes place. Hope a day to finally walk his streets next to Freccia and his friends, listening to the music that has changed the world of the crackling sound of an old radio playing Raptus International Radio, playing their dreams, our dreams. Radiofreccia will make you laugh, it will make you cry at times, it will shock you and console you, it will give you and take from you. I personally believe that he plays an important part of my life, and that of my friends, and I suggest you all look at it and let it become a part of you.
