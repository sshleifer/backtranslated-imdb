This is Emma is the best of existence in my opinion. When you saw the other version (1996) that is good, and read the book, I think I can safely say with confidence that this is the true interpretation and is the most loyal to Jane Austen's chief. The film in 1996 and G. Paltrow is good too, it's just that it's almost like a different story altogether. It's very light and fluffy, you do not see the darkest edges of the characters, and if you just want a nice movie, one will make fine but the intricacies of some of the draw points, such as Churchill / Fairfax Quake is so much glossed over as to be virtually non-existent. But if you want the meat characters come out a bit, more real and multidimensional, the TV version 1996 is superior. Emma is a remarkable person, but it is flawed. Kate Beckinsale is mastery of little shows of whim of the character. You see she looked disgustingly at some of the simplest conversations in Harriet Smith, but she did not show any remorse for her losing Harriet's proposal until that action had the effect of damaging her own marriage happiness at the end. You see his narcissism and Frank Churchill's mirror in that they would hurt the others to achieve their own goals. For Emma, ​​she played matchmaker and got a new friend while away from the time and after suffering the loss of her governor at marriage. For Frank Churchill, he secures the promise of the woman he loves while treating it with other abominable people to keep the secret. In the book, he achieved all of this in a breaking awakening of all the blunders he did. Both Kate Beckinsale and Gyneth Paltrow are convinced of their regrets but the Paltrow is more childish and corrupt while Beckinsale's awakening is rather real and serious, and you see the transition from child-behaviors to selfishness and thoughtful adults. Both versions are pretty good but I prefer this one.
