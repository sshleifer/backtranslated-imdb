An angry boy was tragically losing his parents looking after his grandfather. Together they find common ground in the Gaelic galleries that have gone down oral from generation to generation of islands. Although tragic episodes, such as Clearland Highland, are presented in the stories, there is a surprising amount of humor and winner of them. It's all filmed in Skye, so there is a double dose of beauty. The mountain scenery is breathtaking, and it is a rare chance to hear Scottish Gaelic speaking. I'm English, so I've read the subtitles, but the Gaelic speaking sound is however wonderful. Performances are just what you would expect of carefully selected non-actors - in other words, you will look the real thing - those who care deeply about Gaelic tradition and history. The Gaelic community, especially on Skye, has worked a lot of minor miracles to make this film. Anyone who has the slightest interest in Gaelic, folk stories, folk music, oral culture, Scotland, British history, multi-cultural or social justice should go and see this movie.
