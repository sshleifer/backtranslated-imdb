And I absolutely worship Isabelle Blais !!! He was so beautiful in this film, and far different from his role in "Quebec-Montreal" where he was more like a managing eater. I think he should have been nominated for a Jutra. I mean, Syvlie Moreau was good, but Isabelle was far superior, IMO. Pelletier did fine work for her first time, and I noticed it snuck in a couple of copies from Rock and Beautiful Oreilles, Guy A. LePage & Andrew Ducharme. It was fun to see them in this I did not know they were going to appear. <br /> I do not think I've seen a romantic comedy from Quebec that I did not like, and this one is as good as any I had the pleasure to see. But if you're in the state and wonder how you can get a copy of the DVD, www.archambault.ca release it with me in less than a week.
