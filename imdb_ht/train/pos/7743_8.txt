I went to see her 2 times this film, a friend I went to see her in the release part, and she told me she was so great, that I was hoping so much about the movie, mutch, i'm not could enjoy it because I did not look at nutrients position. The second time I knew what to expect and I enjoyed it more than the first time. After the second time I felt so in the mood there was a party. I love the music it's just great. <br /> If Tom Barman improves its direct talent it will be a director where everyone is talking about. If you can save this movie as your first, you must be talented. The act performed by some big Belgian stars (Dirk dochter) and a bunch of talent upcomming like Titus De Voogdt. <br />
