This - and not a little overwhelming Southern Soap Opera - was the greatest season from Hollywood's greatest year, 1939. I will not resume the obvious-Cary Grant, Victor McLaglen (who was a Bengal Lancer) , and Douglas Fairbanks Jr. provide superb performance. However, I want to remember two other, less understood elements of this masterpiece. The ultimate sequel to the battle, as Sam Jaffe's handsome riding workers to the pinnacle of the temple bugle him and warned the regiment, is simply grand. She never enthrall me. But another underrated element of the movie is Eduardo Ciannelli's performance as the Guru. This is not caricature Fu Manchu, but a well-traced, articuler, historically informed ("Have you ever heard of Chiangruputra Maurya? He defeated the army left in India by Alexander Great") the villain. Indeed, one can see parallels between this mysterious, evil nationalist and a certain well-known figure in the thirty (A German, not an American). Gunga Din, Anti-Nazi Devices? Not good. But still, a tremendous, funny, moving season.
