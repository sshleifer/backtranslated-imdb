There's something wonderful about the fact that a movie made in 1934 can top and shoulder above each Tarzan film that follows it, including the butcher and boring Greystoke's 1980s piece. Once the viewer gets past the first three scenes, which is admittedly dull, Tarzan and his Mate take off as a shot, offering no action, humor, and romance. Maureen O'Sullivan is good and beautiful as Jane and walks off with the movie. Weismuller is solid as well. Very recommended.
