This was obviously the prototype for Mick Dundee but the Adventures of Barry McKenzie is funnier. I was amused and laughed many times. Terrible central performance by Barry Crocker in the title role, an Australian invading England mad poms and its free flowing ways. Some Britons will be angry by Barry's often-cruel observation on his army. The relationships between the two countries are trees but friendly and this is marked by the final film line, delivred by a bit of hesitating McKenzie as it boards the plane home. "I just started to love the poms."
