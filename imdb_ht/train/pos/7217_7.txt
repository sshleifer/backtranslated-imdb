Adaptation steps often have a major fault. They often come looking like a movie camera was simply putting on the stage (Such as "Mother Night"). Sidney Lumet the direction to keep the movie alive, which is especially difficult since the picture offers it no real challenge. Still, it's good look at what it is. The chemistry between Michael Caine and Christopher Reeve is quite brilliant. Dynamic relationships are surprising. Caine is fantastic as always, and Reeve gets one of his few chances to really act. <br /> I confess that I never saw Ira Levin's play, but I heard that Jay Presson Allen's loyal passionate. The script is incredibly complicated, and it keeps you guessing. "Deathtrap" is a fun film that is fun, and it is recommended for almost all fans of stage and screen. <br /> 7.4 out of 10
