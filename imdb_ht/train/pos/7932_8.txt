When I look at a budget movie I know what to expect. I hope act does not have to be as good (budgetary reasons), I expect the lighting not to be as good (budgetary reasons) I hope the sound does not have to be as good (budget again). Stop judging these low budget movies as a big budget movie !!! I am a self-employed myself so I understand the budgetary constraints on a low budget film. Stealing places, vaccine etc. ... The list goes on and off. I do not mean all the act was bad. Jose Rosete, Chris Angelo, Victor Zaragoza are good. Raul Martinez is a natural one. Do not sell on Carl Washington again. He understands that each line is not important, some who throw lines. I say if a movie makes you want to see what's happening next, it's a good movie. I liked this movie. I gave it a 8. I wanted to see what was going to happen next. Great Quiroz brothers work!
