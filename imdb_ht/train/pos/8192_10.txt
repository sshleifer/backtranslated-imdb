This two-party was excellent - the best since the back series. Bits of the circle of the story were trapped in previous films, but TV shows do not do these days. What we got here was a split good sci-fi story. A great (really scary) monster captive at the base of a deep pit, some superb aliens in the Ood - the best "new" aliens the revived series come up with, a sympathetic and credible fundamentals human characters (complete with a couple of people who do not name "spending" securities in true Star Trek star), some large-scale philosophical themes (love, loyalty, faith, etc.), and some special self-drawers. love this minute.
