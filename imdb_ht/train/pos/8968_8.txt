This film was like any Jimmy Stewart movie, witty, good and very enjoyable. Novak's performance as Gillian, the beautiful witch-long to be man, is splendid, his subtle visual expression, and every move and gestures all create unique Gillian with a bit haunted character, she left us hanging on her every word. I should not fail to mention Ernie Kovacs' and Elsa Lanchester's very gratifying performance as the skotch loves the writer obsessed with the world of magic (Kovacs) and letters As the lovable attempt who can not seem to stop using magic even when prohibited. Romantic scenes between Stewart and Novak are very well done and the chemistry between them is great, but then again when is the chemistry between Jimmy Stewart and any bad ladies!
