I saw this show about 3-4 years ago. It was funny bar! When I first saw him playing on ETV (Estonian TV) and I started to love her. Too that shows is when it's bad for me. Hyde is like a cool guy who loves Frank Sinatra! And he comes to mind stupid. It has these glasses that are brown. I love it. And there's FeZ. Pervert the group. We all know what it does when it's alone ..... He wants to get put badly. He even had it and his boss in one episode.His from India. And there is Michael, the stupid guy on whole group, probably stupid in town and a cop! She is so stupid that I remember this: Hyde says: Did you call cops? - No Michael comes in and says. Anyone know how to close mermaids? It is a city playboy. Then comes Jackie, who is ex-girlfriend of Michael and then she's Hyde's girlfriend. Then Eric is the son of veteran warrior wars and son's housewife Kitty. One big pussy it. But he loves Donna, his girlfriend and whom they plan to be wedding. Donna is one hot girl. Hmm what i forget? He Hyde lives in a basement.
