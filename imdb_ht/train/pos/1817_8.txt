All dogs go to heaven to play on the criminal criminal midfielder. The movie is a fun for kids who have a funny and dark-but-satisfied and happy-ending story with lots of songs and dances. It features downgraded Charlie, a criminal criminal criminal who is murdered, but returns from the dead. She meets a girl homeless who looks like her, and in this relationship, she realizes the meaning of life and self sacrifice. This is a wonderful beloved animation in my eyes as a child. I would highly recommend this movie to the kids. I'm not sure how adults would react to it. (I tried to watch her a few years ago on VHS, but these not long-awaited recordings, are they?)
