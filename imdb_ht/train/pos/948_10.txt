This is simply one of the best performances of Dicken's classic story. The script is very well followed by the original story penned by Dickens, and captures a perfect balance between a movie atmosphere and a play atmosphere. Fans viewers in any format will get enough of the root history in their presentation style of choice. George C. Scott brings a delightful realistic approach to Scrooge, and it is very compelling in the development of characters instructed by the visits of ghosts. I found that he could win me to the point where I sympathize with the ancient dead, something rarely done in other versions. The superb work done by the supporting actors adds much to this production, which is simply the most enjoyable of all Christmas Carol versions I've seen.
