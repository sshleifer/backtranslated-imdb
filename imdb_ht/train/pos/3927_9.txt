OK, first an editing of the tag posted on this main page of this movie. Abe Lincoln did not walk with his sister in the movie, nor was he suspended by his sister's grave. The person in question is Ann Rutledge who was a close friend of Lincoln in his new Salem day. Some say that Ann was, in fact, Lincoln's girlfriend, but there is no evidence to support her. Now there are fabrications and fiction of this movie. Hollywood has always taken dramatic licenses and anything under the sun, and "Young Mr. Lincoln" is no exception. However, the court room that is in the movie is based on a real event: the charge of murder against William Armstrong "Duff", and even though it's largely fictitious in this movie with many names, it will still be viewers riveted the screen. This is the Golden Golden Hollywood, with its finest drama, and Henry Fonda gives possibly Lincoln's best played by anyone.
