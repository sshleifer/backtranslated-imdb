Hi, im scott (A.K.A woody7739) I love the movie Twisted Desire, and I love watching Melissa Joan Hart on the tv as I think it's fine. I'm a real fan of the young wizard sabrina too, so this helped me look (no wonder). I love the way that Nicole plans out his parents to kill many crafty, as he assures that someone else pulls the trigger and practice on the bottles, so he will not give away his fingerprints (a very well planned idea out) , back I guess it all backfired on nicole as he kept as his old companion comes along and puts a hidden camera under his shirt. I give this movie a nine out of ten, and put it in my top 10 movie list. And last but not least if someone sees in this movie in the shops please tell me how I see it on TV and did not write it. bye
