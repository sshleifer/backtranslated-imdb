I liked this movie. It was so well done! Great acting and drama and historically accurate. I love Romy Schneider movies. This rock stone, not as big as Sissi but still rock! <br /> <br /> And Scorpiolina, she commented and told French dubbing. Well this is an original German movie by French. So yes. The second of all had a draw, perhaps you're not familiar with history. Oh and her mom played part of her governor, by her teacher. And the storyline was actually by Cinderella but Queen Victoria, maybe u missed that detail. <br /> But anyway .... yes the story of this movie is great, I love historical movies and Queen Victoria is very fascinating! I love all the historical things. As a guy who tried to manipulate his mother. And when she ran away and met her future husband and showed her the "new type of dance" waltzing. When Waltzing was new he was considered scandalous because the dancing couple so close. Yes, his governor was like oh my god! <br /> And also the clothes, I love the clothes. The styles are great, the skirts of the skirts awesome. And of course Romy always looks very nice.
