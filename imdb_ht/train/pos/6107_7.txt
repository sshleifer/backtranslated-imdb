Then I watched these films ... I thought, "Why did the film be such a successful success at the Korean Box office?" Even thought the film had a smart / unusal storyline, the act was not that good and the characters were not very interesting. For a Korean movie ... I love scene in battle. If you want to watch a movie without thinking, this is the movie for you. But I got to admit ... The movie was kind of childhood ... 6/10
