After racism, rural exiles - also known as migration from the countryside - is another socio-political issue in the 1960s. WestSide Story has been dealing with racism by a love party in an artistic view. Now Contra Cowboy Midnight and rural exoral are not a friendship tragedy in a psychological view. He had a deep sadness that we witnessed to one of the two companions in fate. <br /> <br /> Director Jan Schlesinger skillfully delivers us to think deeply about secrets, dreams, imagination, fear and evaluation of New York City's discharge. While beautiful Joe Buck (voight) dreams of all beautiful women in the world begging him to share a wild love fantasy, poor Ratso Rizzo (Hoffman) dreams of a better life and health of clean and sunny Florida . Accordingly, Joe becomes a hustler to turn his imagination into reality; and Ratso has become a catcher in collecting enough funds to emigrate to Florida. In addition to Ratso help Joe find his way to doing everything he can. They start sharing things in life. They share foods, share medicines, share a uninhabited home, share their salaries and thus share a destiny. Unfortunately as the story progresses, Joe realizes that being beautiful is not the only thing to do all the beautiful women begging him to have fun; and more Ratso can not see Florida since his heart fails to beat his illness while on the bus to take him there. <br /> <br /> The power is always right, and the Feeble has no right in the daytime. Since, "Midnight" gives the real eye. Despite the tragedy, there is no melody of Midnight Cowboy. Each aspect of each character is the reality of the poor that brings inevitable fate. Thanks to this, Midnight Cowboy is a provocative view of a socio-political issue, rural exile.
