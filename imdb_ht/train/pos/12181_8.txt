"Lady from Shanghai" is well known as one of Hollywood's most troubled productions. Welles' original cuts were taken by the producers and cut ribbons. This made the mystery story already broadcast even harder to keep track of. They advertise armed a good number of dialogues because of the dense accent of Irish, and the dubbing is all too noticeable and wrong to do. Most disastrous at all, Welles and his screen and real life leading lady Rita Hayworth have fallen apart from their relationships, and their tame chemistry comes in on screen. <br /> Fortunately, this is all overcome by just how fantastic Orson Welles' direction is. It makes the movie incredibly stylish and atmospheric - every scene just seems to breathe down your back from the screen. Also, the characters and scenes are so scary borders on dreams and surrealism. The essence of etirdness elevation scenes are often found in these films, such as the sequences in the courtroom in the middle. I typically find a court room, but Welles' direction and original touches make them just as fascinating as everything else. The end of the carnival reminds one of David Lynch almost. <br /> <br /> The act here is also very good. Despite failing relationships, Welles and Hayworth both provide decent performance - their interactions however are just a bit lacking. Everyone else is superb and delightful to watch though, especially Everett Sloane and Glenn Anders. "Lady from Shanghai" obviously has its problem, but it's worth looking just to see one of the master cinema in his finest. (8/10)
