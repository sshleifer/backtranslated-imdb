This is the best movie version of Dicken's classic story. I've seen it over and over on VHS, and has recently acquired the DVD version, which is TV format (not wide-screen). What I find interesting about this teleplay is thrown by English actors who now recognize since many have appeared in other films / shows in North America since 1984. My biggest surprise is Edward Woodward, the "Equalizer", as the Holy Spirit at Christmas present.
