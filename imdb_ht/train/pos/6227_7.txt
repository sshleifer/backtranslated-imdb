Definitely one of the youngest of the Astaire / Rogers musicals. It's just pretty wrong with rhythm. It only runs a few minutes longer than time to swing, for example, but it feels a heck in a lot more. This is partly due to the high romance between Randolph Scott and Harriet Hilliard. Scott is rarely interesting. I love Hilliard. It's sweet, and I love at least one of her songs, "But where are you?" ("Get You Behind Me Satan", her other number, is a weak rest of Top Hat, thankfully cut out of that masterpiece). Follow the Fleet would actually be a bad movie if not for at least three brilliant dance sequences between Astaire and Rogers. The competition is dancing for the top spot in any of the numbers. The dance is just fantastic. "I put all my eggs in one basket" featuring recurrence of a dance that they did not properly perfected. Its impetus makes it all the more perfect. And "Let's Face Music and Dance" is easily one of Irving Berlin's best songs. So the movie is well worth watching for its great moments.
