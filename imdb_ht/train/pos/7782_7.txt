The photography was nice but I had difficulty understanding what happened ... there was a lot of symbols? ... the goldfishes 2 - they mean something in Thai culture? There's not much draw, not much happens and it just meanders together. There is no real start, there is no real way and no real end. Instead does not really satisfy. <br /> It was difficult to get into the characters as you never feel got to know them ... it was hard to know which scenes were imaginative and were real. The move felt chaotic and disoriented. I do not know what my brothers were expecting to achieve. Perhaps if I was Thai he would make more sense ...
