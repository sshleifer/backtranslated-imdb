I was quite surprised by some of the comments on this work, honestly. Some people have been looking for a draw ??? OK, when this video came out about a decade ago, I watched it for what it was: a collection of music videos. It's not a movie. It does not have a conspiracy or a central storyline. It is a rather artistic anthology of mostly long formal videos, all of them rather smartly or creatively done. Michael Jackson may consider a freak these days, but, after all, this was the man who gave us Thriller (considered by many to be the greatest music video of all time) and putting trends with Billie Jean and beat him . With Moonwalker, he and the filmmakers and artists who collaborated with him once more took his music and dance moves to create some awesome fun things, incorporating claymation, special effects, live performance footage, and even self your parody ("Badder" sequence). And for those who asked what Joe Pesci had done, this video came out just a tad before it became a home name, and was one of his most memorable appearance on film. And, IMHO, I think the criminal criminal sequence (the choreographic section) beat anything else Michael Jackson has made up to that point!
