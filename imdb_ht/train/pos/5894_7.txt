A Brother's Promise is a wonderful family movie. This is a biography of Dan Jansen, an Olympic skater champion champion. The film painted the life of the athlete from a young age to adulthood. Love and support family members are obvious at all. How Dan and the rest of his family are busy winning and losing race is a life lesson for all of us. Commitment and determination of the Dan coach and his teammates show what it takes to make a real team. How Dan and his family deal with a devastating illness of someone you love to show without recurring feelings or sugarcoating. Family trust is shown in basic terms and is obviously an important part of life. This is a powerful family movie that can be meaningless for anyone with any age.
