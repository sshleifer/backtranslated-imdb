This movie is very touchy. I do not care for those people say about this movie, this is a very good movie. Performance by Amitabh Bachchan's role in having the dead father is great, because he wants to teach his son how to handle life in case something happens to him and Akshay Kumer was great in his role as the gateway to Aditya Thakur. The role played by Shefali Shetty who played the role of Sumatra Thakur was magnificent. Priyanka Chopra was good in the role she had in the movie. Ragpal Yadav as the Brain-Dead Brain and Boman Irani as show-off-father in law have a very good connection with the comedy scene being hilarious. The direction is very good.
