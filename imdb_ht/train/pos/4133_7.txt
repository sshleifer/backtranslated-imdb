An incredible little English movie for many reasons. First it is a rare look of Laurence Olivier in a light comedy. While performing it is by upgrading the standard it would be letter set as one of the greatest actors of the 20th century, it is perfectly credible as the hoodwinked stopper. Historically this film is of great interest because of both sides and when it's shot. His English had not had the big budget of the Hollywood films in the same era and it often shows, but it's more interesting is the reality of this film filmed just before the war and shows an England that would soon go. When we look at it today we think in terms of modern morality and to look at the fact that this movie and its closest US counterpart "It happened one night 'being in the days as risky as` Fatal Instinct It was in our time but after watching and enjoying this movie the first time I can not help but feel sad when I look it today. With the film shoot halfway before 1950, saving the remaining movie means Tough choices, and unfortunately movies like this are often spent on to save movies that we all consider important. The shifting color, lack of contrast, and generally poor quality of scripture is most often seen is heartbreaking. This movie along with `It happens one night 'are perfect to curl up with one love under a blanket over a cool evening and look, or better still why not a double feature.
