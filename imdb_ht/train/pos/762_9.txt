I love watching the extinction, especially if they do it as well as in the best scenes of this film that took you to a disco club called "Roxy". Especially at Christmas time, because there is also a "MC Santa Claus". Though this is an old movie, and even though I was the video from TV, when the State Movie Archive in Finland showed this in the summer of 2004 on their own big screen, I went there to check it out. It's more enjoyable on the big screen than on TV. Though many people here think that watching this big screen is a waste of money for the fare, I agree with this and I think when I've paid my ticket I got the money See this, as it is on the big screen, especially sitting on front of the movie, an unforgettable experience, and better than just about video.
