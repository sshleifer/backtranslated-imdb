I remember watching Gothic Americans when he first revealed, he went into my mind lately, all I could remember was the same guy appearing in midnight Caller, which is Gary Cole, I do not watch much television, but I watch American Gothic, I purchased the Complete Series on DVD this week, & it's always as good as ever, This is one of the best TV series ever, why I do not watch a lot of television is because it's just rubbish that's about, except for Derren Brown, it's all TV reality or soap, like fat, Big Brother etc., I fed up with it, I got the Fill in the Gothic American for Â£ 16.97 to form the Asda website, That's the cheapest I can get it.
