I stumbled on this movie on the cable and was totally tuned. The story of a group of surfers that rises to the huge waves, which monstrously great waves, the wave that would make anyone rational to run in fear is one that manages to be spectacular and makes you understand why people spend their lives chasing the waves. There is nothing special about the movie, other than it brings together some very interesting people who are in love with what they do and allow them to speak. Make sure you have the browsing scenes, but that makes this movie special is the people. Here are a bunch of guys who are so enthusiastic about what to do that they cross over to the people they watch. Halfway through this movie you will want to go and learn to surf as well. Some documentaries have never managed to covey the passion that these people have with its filmmaking capabilities make us feel that makes this a great movie. See it.
