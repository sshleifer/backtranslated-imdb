I thought the movie all played out pretty well with cool images and interesting movies all the way into it. The actors were on top of the characters in almost perfect distribution and look great. The music was lush and well-thought-out. He even had a decent twist to an end. So this and everyone voted it down? The story was not entirely fresh (felt like a remnant of "Running Man" and the idea of ​​the entire TV show), but the attitude towards Christianity and Judaism about how the public chooses the mesi certainly reminds true enough. It made sense to follow the one man who was put before a modern crowd and put it on a pedestal because of his opportunity. It is possible that Christians or other religious people choose this up because the movie has the word "God" in it, but shows what the filmmakers were trying to do is to teach a possibility to those who may never have seen the world like This, especially in modern world where Christianity was more and more accepted and forgotten by some. <br /> I gave it a 7/10 star here on IMDb. I thought every ounce of the movie was fun and original, for the most part-. Check it if you are not too late to see an entertaining movie in Madrid, Spain, about the possibilities of the Messi coming modern in a TV near you.
