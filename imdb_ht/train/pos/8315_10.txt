Standard up to fame story with a few high points. Single number, Lonette McKee as a Sister who gives a stunning, performing star. The fact that he never became a great sensation later this is beyond me. Unfortunately, it is a support character and we are forced to focus on Irena Carter's bold character, Sparkle, whose rise in fame is easy, boring, and compelling. However, every time the girls go on stage and make, the movie goes back to life. The original music by Curis Mayfield is praised. The copy I saw was a very old VHS tape. The picture quality was very low, as well as the output values ​​I guess. All in all, it's worth a clamp.
