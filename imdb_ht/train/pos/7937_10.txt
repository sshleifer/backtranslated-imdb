I thought the film "I did not" was fantastic. In the past I looked at Rob Estes about "Suddenly Susan" & "Melrose Place" as well as Josie Bissett on "Melrose Place" and liked to see them again in "I do not." They have great chemistry together (I guess they were married in real life to help that!) - In the movie they both widows and their kids and careers and they fall in love and try to mix their already busy chaotic families together without casting the ball . Of course they stumble, but they keep it together that is what works and raises a family is all about. So many people have been talking about this movie - indeed! - and the movie let us want more. This would make a great set - appealing to many ages! - It would be so nice to see a real life, down to earth, showing families like this showing the reality of many of our lives today - instead of the so-called "TV reality" that all the stations are overwhelming with these days. Someone tells the people of ABC Families have the start of a new set here!
