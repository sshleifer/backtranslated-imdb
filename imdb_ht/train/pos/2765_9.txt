This is the French and Belgian doing their best. It's original, visually inventive, exhilarating and emotionally tough. Director Jaco van Dormael takes us to the world of Georges, a Down Syndrome's suffering and demands for a meaningful relationship with someone, just anyone. This is not done in a patronizing way, but with a great sense of pleasure and honesty. Georges' interplay with corporate management guru, Harry is stunned to handle - shifting from comedy tragedy back to comedy again with breathtaking facilities. <br /> <br /> The eighth day puts the same Hollywood fare as Oscar winning Man Barry Levinson or Robert Forrest Zemeckis at Gump well and really in the shade. At times, she recalls the humor of Milos Forman's one flying on the cocoa's nest and shades of Dennis Potter cast in for good measurements. As yuppie's emotionally blunted and desperately lonely, Harry, Daniel Auteuil turned into another sublime performance. But it is matched by Pascal Duquenne's brilliant as Georges. It is a film and performance of exactly the strong and many, memorable set pieces - the scene of the shoe store, scene scene scene, George 's dance' Jesus Jesus knows, 'the stage scenes, scenes of fireworks. If you have not seen it, there is only one thing to do. Just rent it or go to a screening in a retro movie near you and see what you missed. Better yet, buy this movie. Jeni Sheer .....
