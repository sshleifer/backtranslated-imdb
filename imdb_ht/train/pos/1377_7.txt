In the area where overlapping this fine film is light year before 2004 innocence, which gave the impression of a rheumy eye and heavy respiratory teen gestures. Here the effect is much more realistic and truly gets inside the heads of the three protagonists as they falter their way through a riddled adolescence and pitfalls. Three principals, all unknown to me, are sure-footed, the kind, in fact, that can be so natural that it will be difficult to replicate this type of act in other films so I should not be too much wonder if they do not hear anymore. It would be good if this could get away from the Art houses and in the multiplex where there's just a chance out there it might be 'talking' in the bubblegum crowd it does not target.
