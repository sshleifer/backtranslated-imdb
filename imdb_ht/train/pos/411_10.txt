This film is well done on many levels that I am sad that the score is as low as it is (5.9 / 10 (576 votes) and this writing). This film has incredible special effects, a true storyline, great complex character interaction, and mind-blowing battle - they have to be seen to be believing! My only complaint is the subtitles on the DVD DVD version I received (some lines have not been translated - ???). <br /> I just do not understand when I read & hear from various sources: "It's a confusing scheme ....", "I could not track the story ...." or "Character from any where ... ". From the first time I watched this movie, I understood it, followed it, knew why the characters were there, and I absolutely loved it! I watched it over 8 times already and every time it is pure fun. Oh, and this is not just my opinion, because I showed this movie many fellow Americans (who never saw a previous HK film) that feel the same way. None of them fail to follow the storyline and each one has declared their love for this movie. Oh, why can not we have things like this from Hollywood? At least the Lord of the Rings had a beautiful wedding in special effects, character development, and storyline. This is not coming from Newbie Newbie lover movie lover. I own an extensive library of Asian films and I must say that this movie is one of my biggest DVDs. When you look it you will blow away by the amazing amazing effects and epic feeling of this movie. You will be trapped in this fantasy world and you will not want to leave! I saw both versions in 1983 and 2001 (both performed by Tsui Hark), and 2001 is far better in IMO comparisons. In addition to the subtitles, I have another complaint about this movie: I did not want it to end .... I begged you Mr. Hark - can we please have an end?
