I was very moved by the story and because I'm going through something similar to my own parents, I'm really connected. It is so easy to forget that a person with a body will not once feel vibrant and passionate. Then there are the mistakes they have made and have to live with them. I loved Ellen Burstyn's performance and is Christine Horne? It's fantastic! A real find. There is probably the most erotic scene I've ever seen in a movie, but nothing has been shown - it was just so beautifully done. Overall the look and feel of the movie was stunning, a real emotional journey. Cole Hauser is very pretty good in this picture, he imminizes a spiral decline man. I liked the way the movie approaches this woman's life, never sentimental, never too much - just enough to be trapped in, but not enough to haul down.
