I saw this movie about 6 times now. And every time I see it, I'm more impressed by the story and act. It's like watching a wreck train trained in motion. Its subtlety in its approach, but very effective in reaching its goals. <br /> <br /> Spoilers-> In the center of the story is a pretty beautiful trotototomy. On hand from us has the largest Deputy, Eddy Calhoun (Cusack) unknowingly worn into the old boys' networks that form the toughest of New York's administration and on the other hand we have the crowded Zufati deliberately try to maintain the status of all the necessary means. This situation precisely finally at the end when Zappati ordered Alselmo to make it easy on himself not to kill himself and Calhoun commanded Pappas to do the same, politically speaking. The film also contains some really great one-materio as (a personal weakness): - You do not sum up a man's life in one moment - The only new thing in this world is the story you do not know <br /> all in all, a big movie that deserves a higher rating.
