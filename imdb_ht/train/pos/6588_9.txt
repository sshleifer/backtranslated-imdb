After watching several episodes in this series, I came to the conclusion that TV producers are completely devoid of any form of originality. Here is a stand-alone science fiction science, ingeniously wrapped in the form of a truly original concept - and still can only - almost - to do it work. <br /> <br /> The dialogue is good! Men actors are reasonably competent in their profession. Most of the characters are well drawn, and the special kudo hero and more than him than side-kick side. And most of the epic plots come in every taste. So what could be wrong? How about the, the female characters and the actress actress perfect to choose them. <br /> <br /> The producers insist on portraying the female characters in this - almost good - series, in a way that the finished product appears to be a deplorable cheerleader. Why, I ask, why? The episodes all fall flat every time the star invites the girl or recurring characters to come on the screen. These actresses are totally incredible in their role, and you do not actually have to see they know they are incapable of acting. A blind man could say. Just listen to them. They delivered their dialogue with the drama and the effect of a 16 year old at the high school bullet. Who would believe these women are PhD scientists, senators, corporate executives and medical doctors? <br /> In a dark rooster, if the producers have their choices in a Channing Stockard or Morgan Fairchild, guess who they will choose - each time? And of course, the series suffers for it. Too bad!
