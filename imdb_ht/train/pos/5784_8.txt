I have noticed that a lot of people posted on the "Kerching!" Chart seems to hate this show, which I actually get very surprised. I think it's one of the best kids show British. It's a shame it ends because it's very funny (if a bit cheesy sometimes) and it has great characters. The main character is a little like Del Boy, although quite a lot smarter. With her 2 best friend she tried to make a million pounds for her mum by starting an online business and adopting a pseudonym of "Rudeboy". His friends Seymour (who likes to cook) and Danny (who are simple minded and funny rescue character). Throughout the show, some characters left and new were coming in, but it was always fun and improved.
