Let me state at the start that I have cerebral palsy and I entered this film awaiting to be performing for lead performance. I left the theater half convinced that they would throw an actor who had cerebral palsy in the role, even though I knew that was not the case. Their performance was generally excellent, with a special nod to Brenda Fricker and Hugh O'Conner (I believe it is his name) as Christy Brown's young. Christy is talented, brash, arrogant, vulgar and petulant-in other words, human. This film, along with Gaby: A True Story and King Gimp's documentary, are excellent portraits of life with CP. There is no denying a complete portrait, but good examples of handicaps as human beings. Most highly recommended.
