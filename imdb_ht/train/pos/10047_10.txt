For all miserable people who have done everything out of complaining about the dialogue, the budget, this and this .... who wants to hear it? If you miss this movie beyond-cute movie, you lose. The rest of us who deeply love this movie do not care what you think. I'm a thirthysomething guy who has seen thousands of movies in my life, and this one stands in its own entities, in my book. He did not assume a documentary, or a completely real account of what happened this night. It is the amazing love story that ever tries. I know it's 90's cynical and the millions have everyone in a tizzy, but come on. Someone on this board commenting complained that he had done too much money! How is lame is that? He made bundles of money in each civilized country on the planet, and the film is grossing top of the planet. I'm going to be happy around the majority this time around. Well, cynical, time to pull back under your rocks, I do.
