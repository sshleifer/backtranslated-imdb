Blonde and Blonder have Pamela Anderson and Denise Richards in almost every stage and if you want more from a movie you will be completely unreasonable. It feels like a late era carrying on, when the series has no longer lit trail, but it was still more funny than not, thinking behind or England and you will not be too far from the mark. Pamela and Denise are bland, good and clearly conscious this is not a chef they are doing, although you can give me lots of things I said love. Throw in the energetic supports, though some of them are not particularly good; I can not see a couple of duff turns into a movie that is already practically forgot to make much difference in anything, so just smile. I really think blond and blonder are ace and I hope you hate me for it.
