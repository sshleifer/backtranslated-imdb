I agree with another user here and must say that this is one of the best kung fu movies ever! I watched this as a kid and absolutely loved it! The scaffolding scenes are brilliant and you can really sympathize with this guy because it is treated as a release. Nice humor and fantastic kung fu rock this movie! If you love kung fu you would like this !!!
