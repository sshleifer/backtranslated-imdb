The Perfect Fantasy Movie. a group of kids go accidentally in space and have to get back down, but, make sure they do. This would not be a family movie if they were all killed. Then it will be all sad. You do not want Kate Capsaw, the leading lady to perform a Golden Globe performance, but sadly, she and Lea Thompson won one. This sucks for bad. I can not say it enough, this movie is so great, Lea Thompson, a perfect girl for this movie. This movie is the best for sure. <br /> <br /> Sorry, but better than Star Wars. Star Wars is so under-rated and space camp was so under-rated. It should be the other way around <br /> <br /> excellent 10 / 10- 0r maybe 11/10. I'm not good at math
