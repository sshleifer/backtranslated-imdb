This is a very unusual movie by director / entertainer Richard Williams. Everyone who knows William's work knows it's a bit off-kilter (if not inventive), but this one takes the cake. It features two hapless ragdolls that have to save the new French owner dolls from a lustful toy ship and find themselves at the mercy of several rare characters along the way. The strength of this film lies mainly in its aesthetic quality; its unusual characters, its powerful animation, and its strong contrast to the sweet and scary. Williams's brilliant animation featured Raggedy Ann and Andy as real doll shorts, flickers and darts, rather than the simple cartoon version of the dolls, which made it much more credible (at least in a visual sense). The bright animation brings us with camel-and-a-wrjen-knee, whose market body and two different personality control each end, chasing silent-films and Sir Leonard Looney and, of course, the greedy. <br /> The vicious animation, on its own, is perhaps the most exquisite psychic animation I've ever seen. There's something about this animation that just makes your jaw drop - and every second it's something new. Living in what was deemed "the Taffy Hole," the vicious is a massive patty man who lives in and pity eating sweets. He sings a song that I can not help but feels to keep some sexual abuse, then try to kill Raggedy Ann for her candy heart. <br /> <br /> The only complaint I have about this movie is that there are too many songs. It continuously bends down the movie speed because there are systems in them. There are approximately six good songs (which should have been the only salt) including "I look, and what I see?", "No Girl's Toy", "Blue" (though they did not need to make him sing twice), "I never get enough," "Because I love you" and maybe "I'm home." Others seem to be unnecessary and not too surprised to listen. This is a strange and luxurious movie, but if that's what you're looking for, you will not get better.
