I saw this movie earlier today, and I was amazed at how accurate the dialogue is for the main characters. He did not feel like a movie - he felt more like a documentary (the part I loved best). The leading lady of this movie seemed to be real to me as any fifteen old girls I know. <br /> In all, a very enjoyable movie for those who enjoy independent films.
