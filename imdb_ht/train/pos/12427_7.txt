This film has a lot of raw potential. The sharp script, the dialogue is (usually) excellent (though it could stop losing the cheezy voice-overs), the direction and cinematography are amazingly good, though some of the experiment just does not work. The main problem here is David Duchovny. Once a geek-boy, always a geek-boy; And sadly, the simple fact is that she was incapable of playing anything but Fox Mulder. She hips, she tries to be slick, poses, she tries to be macho. At the end it just tries too hard. She overplays her character, overspeaks her line, and she just outplayed in every way by Timothy Hutton and Angelina Jolie, who each of her classes above her in terms of acting skills. Timothy Hutton was (as always) really good. There was a moment or two where it over-dramatized its role, but you might say it was fun with it. He watched the party, and it became the character both physically and atmospherically. Angelina Jolie was also really good. He did not have much in common; In fact, I though he could have used a stronger one ... his character was not nearly developed enough, though he did remarkably well with what he had. And the chemistry between it and Hutton was apparent (gee, maybe that's why Uma left him ...;) All in all, it was rough around the edges, but a solid effort was not a good cast and great role support. If David Duchovny did not tear her role in pieces she'd * be * best. 7/10.
