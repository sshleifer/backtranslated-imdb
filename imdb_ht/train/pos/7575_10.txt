Resident Evil: Veronica Rope is a great video game well done, it has great graphics, very comfortable controls, a great storyline and high fun factor.The series of this is Claire Redfield taken in an island for treshassing on umbrellas, The havoc will be the main laboratory while looking for his brother. Veronica's graphics are very good, the fire and rain effects are great looking. The controls are comfortable, but the button pattern does not fit the Dreamcast control, making it difficult they get used to. It's always fun going around somewhere disturbing disturbances, shooting the bowels from zombies.Code: Veronica also has a little bit of "romance" between the two main characters.You also get to play as Chris Redfield, from Resident Evil 1 .The sound of this game is better than ever, for example, though I hate the new feature, when the giant spiders pull them, they're feet making a disturbing disturbing sound, and The sounds are much more realistic. Graphical graphics, outstanding history, control controls, and real sound stic makes Resident Bad Code: Veronica a definite love. I give it a 10 out of 10.
