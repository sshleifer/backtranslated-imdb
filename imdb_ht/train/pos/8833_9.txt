I was intrigued by the title, so during a little bit of insomnia (fueled by my curiosity ...), I stayed with her watch. I check my TV list and watch it again! There is a very obvious realization that happened to me when I saw this movie - in spite of politics, tradition, culture, etc., teenagers usually virtually the same. Children's Characters from Belgrade could be transported to, let's say, somewhere in the Midwest American during the same period, with differences in language aside, would be impossible to say apart from any of the local youth in that era a. They certainly seem to be the same pain and preoccupation, political aside: music, sex, film, music, drinking, sports, music ... As a matter of fact, many things that care for my time growing up in Southern California in 1970. <br /> This was a bitter story, but the joy of teens made it very enjoyable. Characters, especially the young actors, were completely credible too. I will not say this was the Yugoslav "Indian graffiti," but I'll say it fits in nicely with other 50's-themed movies.
