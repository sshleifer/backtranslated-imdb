Etienne Girardot is just a character actor - the sort of person almost never would know by name. However, he once again played the Coroner - one of the only actors in Philo Vance films that played his role more than once. I have already seen her two times and love her every time because she was so funny with a breath of fresh air. This film is also great to watch because in addition to Girardot, there are many other wonderful character actors together for the ride - including Grant Mitchell, Gene Lockhart, Henry Walthal, Kent Smith, H.B. Warner and Nat Pendleton. This is quite an impressive cast, and they are sure to make the task easier for leading men and women Edmund Lowe and Virginia Bruce. These great character actors are one of the great reasons I like these old B-movies. While the mystery itself is rarely that terrific, because of writing in noise and acting, these films really satisfy. As for this film, Vance is playing nice in Lowe but, as I said, the mystery itself is only a post-thought - and a funny plot that involves hypnosis and suicide. Unfortunately, you can not hypnotize anyone doing anything in the sort - I have training in clinical hypnosis and if I could do anything like the wrong guy can do in the movie, I'd have to do it! Seller used cars and a few of my old bosses would have been obvious goals !! <br /> <br /> Overall, while not the best Philo Vance film, it was pretty good and it's a shameful humor only played this role once. In fact, aside from William Powell (who played Vance five times), the series was prevented by a long succession, actors such as Basil Rathbone, Wilfred Hyde-White and Warren William (and many others) play Vance. This is a similar problem that also plagued the Bulldog Drummond series - just too many different actors playing the leading man. <br /> <br /> Well worth seeing and interesting - though also quite impossible.
