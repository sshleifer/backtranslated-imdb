Beautiful romance drama comedy on a Italian widow (Cher) who plans to marry a man he is comfortable with (Danny Aiello) until he falls for himself, angry brother (Nicholas Cage). The sharp script and many great lines, the act is wonderful, the accents (I said) is the perfect letter and the symmetry is beautiful. New York never looked good on the screen. A must-see mostly for Cher and Olympia Dukakis - they're both fantastic and rich worthy of the Oscars they got. A beautiful, funny movie. A must see!
