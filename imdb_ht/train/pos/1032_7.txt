A message movie, but a good rather good. Outstandingly cast, top to bottom. Interesting in Bette Davis's plot line is essentially back tale! The reviews are very negative (names sent to the scenario / playwright, this associate somehow and very negative comment on 'Angle of America', etc. etc.) The movie object being too preachy about Germany in WWII. Gosh, this is just a bit too sophistically a moral understanding for me. <br /> Theater and movie-making, and acting acting varies over time and of course 70 years later this particular film should not be done in this way. Yes Casablanca is a better movie (I guess), but although made in the same year and both with the Nazis in them, Casablanca is mostly a love story. The love story of this movie takes second place in the spy sketch - plus in a thriller. Both have a rather big number of accents a bit cheesy and wonderful character actors. Children are somewhat tiring and could be edited
