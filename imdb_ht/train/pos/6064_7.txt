I started by telling you how I came across this movie. It was winter in Alaska in the 1990s. A friend of mine from Australia stayed with me and my girlfriend friend in a shoe box at an apartment. Winter in Alaska can be somewhat brutal and most people are indoors, drinking heavy and looking at anything that comes on the TV. I found this movie out in a thrift store laying in a snowbank and right away new was a treasure.It is quite possible best everer movies ever.We spend the next two weeks watching this movie and drink like fish.We watch it many times in fact that we would sometimes turn the TV on its side or top down for a full full effect. It's a true dream. The rays will come nonstop and the memories last forever. If you see this movie for rent in a video store, steal it. You will not regret it!
