The film 's films about Philip (Leslie Howard) is a reliable but disabled drug student .He falls fatal in love with a tender waitress, called Mildred (Bette Davis) .He leaves her, engages with others (Alan Hale, Reginald Denny). While she is romance with another pretender (Johnson house, Frances Dee) but she goes back to a mutually destructive affair. <br /> <br /> Easy the best and first of many movie versions of the Roman Somerset Maugham. Bette Davis as Correct croissant waitress has yet another beautiful interpretation with a catchy and smoldering performance, absolutely hypnotic in his account of the slavery that occurs from the beginning of the final. Davis wakes up the limelight and performs it. His role as Hard and Slight Women Dominators will be repeated several times in posture acting. Leslie Howard as the essentially good and decent student destroying student has given an excellent and melancholy performance. She was an awesome actor (Gone and Wind) besides producers and writers and killed in plane crash during WWII. Both playing again in the foreground forest (1936). The atmosphere film is elaborately recreated at the RKO (Radio Foto Inc) studio is completely compelling. Removed in 1946 by Edmund Goulding, and Eleanor Parker and Paul Henreid; and in 1964 by Ken Hughes and Kim Novak and Laurence Harvey. The motion picture will love classic classic movies. Rating: Very good, but a little dated.
