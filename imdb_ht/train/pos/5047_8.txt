Pacton actor made his first director with a traveling mechanic who made him a mechanic widow (Paxton himself) whose ropes of his sons were involved in wild rape violence, stating that the victims were not human beings but "demons", and being chosen by God to destroy those "demons". This is all said in flashback by one of the sons, now grow (Matthew McConaughey) to uncertain FBI agent (Power Boothe). <br /> <br /> Hard to automatically forget this movie; Better than most serial killer features, it's a twisty and disturbing story said in straightforward fashion and a minimal make of GIMMICS movies. Paxton, praiseworthy, barely shows no blood all until the end. Well does not all, especially children of children (Jeremy Sumpter of the last "Peter Pan" and Matt O'Leary in "Kids 2 Spy" and "Domestic disorder"). The only reason I deduct any point at all is because I can understand that some people can find all the stomach difficult things. In any event, it's an atypical thriller with a decent script. <br /> <br /> 8/10
