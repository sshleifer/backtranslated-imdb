This movie is weird and unusual, and it is almost unusual and rare in a very good way. I give this a short 7 just because it's so unique and off-the-wall, but much of the time it looks as though it's been scarce just for the sake of being scarce. If the movie has managed to integrate its most rare moments into some pretense of a scheme then it would really be fantastic. <br /> <br /> The main problem here is that it looks as if the creators just jumbled along a bunch of crap on spatula, then dropping into a whole bunch of more crap that sounded as if it would sound Funny come out of the mouth of a spatula. <br /> <br /> This is definitely worth checking out, but not the top rate by any stretch of the wild imagination creators.
