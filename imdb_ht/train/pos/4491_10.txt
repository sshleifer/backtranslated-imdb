I love this spring movie and wine port '. I was born in Leigh, a town about 7 miles away from Bolton, and I moved to Bolton in 1965 when I was 20. My place of work was daily via small lever at Farnworth, sometimes on a bicycle but then , in the car when I was able to pay it. The film brought back all the memories of the working class neighbors who were almost always crushed but who would always help you if they could. Fred Dibnah has rounded the corner of Bromwich St. was my bed. If you did not see the movie when first released then you can be forgiven for comparing it to a soap like St. Coronation, well I agree it is a soap, but then it is called 'Dye Kitchen Detector! 'Watching this film for the talent throw that shortly thereafter became the home name in the role of television frequently, I look especially for the vaccines in the locality and feel good factor in those who were poor but happy!
