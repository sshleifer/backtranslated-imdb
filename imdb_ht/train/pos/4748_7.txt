The story would never have awards, but that's not what it's about ... The script was just entertaining and thrilling enough to make room for the incredibly choreographing battles scene. Who needs a story and fight like that? Really, it's worth to look for this alone. IF you can handle the gore, in which there is a lot ... none of it's doing really really enough to be hard to look at. I gave it a 7.
