I saw this film when it was released, and when I was 12 years old. And I still shine to remember the wonderful scenes of how the hero / heroine escaped every time when faced with danger :) And The best feature of the film was painted by the villain! I think so many films are called copies of many "escaped scenes" in this movie !! And not only does he ever impress me when I see those cheating, it always raises my appreciation for this masterpiece! :) The lead actors have acted pretty. Slowly and realistic development of chemistry b / w heroine and heroine was very natural and beautifully portrayed. As children, we felt that the love that developed b / w was very natural :) ways to deal with overcome all the trials and tribulations together was something that can make even the children realize the value of love, sacrifice and take care. I recommend that everybody sees this movie by giving a chance! --Vijay.
