Back to the day of the big studio system, the Darndest casting decisions were made. Good old Americans James Stewart looks like a Hungarian in the shop around the corner. Had I filmed the movie, the part of Kralik would be perfect for Charles Boyer. Its emphasis was mixed in with all other European accents would have nothing. Stewart had some of the same problem in the Mortal Storm as well as Margaret Sullavan. Margaret Sullavan was often the leading lady on the screen, she made four films with her. But only this one where neither of them dies. Sullavan and her husband Leland Heyward knew Stewart back to the day when he was a horrific player in New York. In fact, Sullavan's husband is Henry Fonda Stewart's best friend, then. I think that only Clark Gable could bring to being an American in a cast of Americans who are not Americans on the bounty. Stewart of the Dead Storm was German, but all other players were American as well so nothing stands out. <br /> But if you can accept Stewart, you will see a fine film from Ernest Lubitsch. The plot is very simple, a man and woman working in a department store in Budapest do not get together in person. But it seems that they are bringing about a correspondence with some anonymous admirers who turn out to each other. Also employer Frank Morgan suspects Stewart sick of kanodling with his wife. <br /> <br /> Even if the drives are fine and Frank Morgan comes out of his own self, the two players from the best are Felix Bressart and Joseph Schildkraut. Bressart has my favorite moments in the movie when it takes off after Morgan begins to ask people for input. It makes itself very rare .. <br /> Joseph Schildkraut, who is always good, is just as great as the little worm that constantly kisses up to Frank Morgan. You really hate people like that, I knew many tiles like Schildkraut in real-life in office politics 24 hours a day. Sorrow that he pays a good deal at the moment.
