I just saw the detention last night and I loved what I saw. It was a fun movie movie.Dolph look superbly cool on the bike.It also looked good in this movie as compared to other contemporary movies.It is now in a very good form. The story was ok with the other actors they were also bars .I would not call this movie the best but still a good movie. <br /> But she also had her share of problems. The first was the way bullets were flying everywhere and even when they were shot at empty empty points to miss the target. They should have shown the ppl escape bullets in a better way. Another problem I had was the way the students swore. I do not know which school students can swear to their teachers and even in the classroom. The third problem was that the bad guys were very few in number. There would have been more bad guys. Recent issues were definitely the fact that the set of cheese look, but that was due to the small budget. In addition to the movie was a good movie. I liked it. I would recommend others to watch it. P.S. Now you are a beating cop dead. (Some of the materials were also fresh) <br /> <br />
