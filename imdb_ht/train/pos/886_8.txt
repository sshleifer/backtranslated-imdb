This is one of the DVDs I've recently bought in a six series called "Frenchfilm" to brush up our French before our planned holiday in this beautiful Provence this year. So far, as well as improving our French, we have considerably increased our appreciation of French movies. <br /> <br /> What a breath of fresh air in stale, predictable, inimaginable, harmful bang injuries to being churned out of Hollywood. What is a good example of script writers, actors, directors and scholars to follow. It was also interesting to see two characters identified in the lead roles without having to be glossy face covering magazines. <br /> <br /> Other things I liked about this movie were the slow and draw character built that kept you guessing about how it all went to the end. Is there any good good in this selfish Thug that always treats its beneficial nayifre beneficiary and the kind of contempt which a former constitution would show? Are we sexually frustrated poor little heroine half to prove himself in the response of his dreams and the fate of what he fears? The viewer intrigued by these questions and the actors to unravel the responses slowly and compelling as they face challenging events and forms feel towards each other. <br /> Once you've seen this movie, like me you may want to see it again. I still have to work outside the psychological director's directorial for the sub conspiracy in the role of the free officer and some of the subtle nuances of camera work are worth a second look. The plot requires a little imagination by giving our hero a chance to help our heroine and excessive paddling at the office. You should also be great for believing in reading his brilliant lip and how some of the action falls into place. But if you go along for the thrilling ride with this example of French cinema at its best you will come out more than satisfied. Four stars out of five for me.
