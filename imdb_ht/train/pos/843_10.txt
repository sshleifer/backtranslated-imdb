Not to mention Pierce Brosnon's best performance. Of course Greg Kinnear is still great. Really, when it's really bad? I think this movie is incredibly underrated! The use of color in this movie is something very different in today's movie world where every other movie has Payback Blue filter. I also like the way to use this song by Asia. Prove that even that was once thought of as cheesy cheesy can be really cool put correctly. <br /> I did my first feature then came out. When my movie was a hit-movie movie, I had to check out anything in the genre that was released. After seeing it, I'm sure he has some effects on me in the process. It was very cool when my movie got on the IMDb that it would recommend this movie if you liked me. How any of the others are related I have no idea, make a coincidence even more interesting. <br /> <br /> http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1337580/
