I often asked just how much CASPER was meant for kids ... and all the problems revolved around his identity (in this film we are leading to believing that it is the spirit of a dying child, like her home is a plot plot), as well as the disturbing message that brought in this particular film. Maybe Casper meant more like a Morality play, or famous Studios felt like breaking new ground into cartoons 'reality'. <br /> <br /> Having a good TONIGHT is a well-animated project - no doubt there. But the development of the scheme involving the fox (who gets Casper's friends, but meets a tragic end) is anxiety. <br /> <br /> Give the famous Studios credit - to tackle death and respect ... but the image of the casper castle is rather graphic and disturbing to the kids (though the denouement offers a happy end, but I'm not will give away the finish), and the violence is rather steep, even for the normal 1940s. /> This could be a better idea for parents to use in helping explain child death - but I would not pop it into the VCR for a cartoon break.
