Renowned Tian is not good. I only click on his remix documentary to see Wei Wei, the original actress back in the classic 1948 film tells a few words of the crew. We'll meet Wei Wei this Sunday (28/3/2010) after the Xiao Cheng Zhi Chun show at the Hong Kong Film Archie. Wei Wei is almost 90 years old in silver hair, his comet appearance in Hong Kong film is still a surprise to her fans. At Hong Kong Film Festival this year, a special program dedicated to Fei Mu, director of this epic film and Wei Wei still shot in the movie being seen all around in Hong Kong. My son, who turned 21 this year, is surprised Wei Wei was so nice then.
