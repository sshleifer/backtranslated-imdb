A Christmas set actually came before my time, but I was raised on John Denver and the songs from this special was still Christmas my family. For years we had a crackling tape made out of a file which meant it was Christmas. A few years ago, I was finally able to track down a video of her on Ebay, so after listening to all the music for some 21 years, I got John and Muppets in action for myself. If you ever get the chance, it's a lot of fun - great music, heart-warming and cheese. It's also interesting to see the version 70 of the Muppets and compare them to their newer versions today. I believe Denver actually took some heat to make a show like this - I guess normal performers do not compromise the images by making songs-a-longs with the Muppets, but I'm glad it did. Even if you can not track down the video, the band is also worth it. It has some traditional Muppified Favorites, but also some original Denver tunes as well.
