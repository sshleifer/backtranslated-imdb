After Fatih Akins's first job "In July", which was fairly good, he created a truly gorgeous Italian family season. It's a German film, which is unfortunately a bad precaution, causing us to rarely produce more than moderate movies;). But this movie makes some pretty good bets in the time then. "Solino" is about an Italian immigrant who came to the Ruhr region in Germany during the 60s. The immigrant and his family then begin the first Pizza Restaurant in the region. Characters are excellent draws. Especially Gigi, the main actor. You live every second, every sentiment. His brother, played by Moritz Bleibtreu, is not that good. Well, you just do not believe him the role. But the character is balanced and fits perfectly into this script. I feel an urgent need to compare the style of this movie with the style of the "godfather". Many people will probably hate this film, telling its boring. Not much tension? - yes, but an outrageous movie. 9 out of 10.
