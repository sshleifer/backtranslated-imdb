I can never remember this show. I used to watch it when I was 8. I remember staying late when I was not supposed to just so I could watch this show. It was my best show. From what I remember in it, it's still great. This was shown star Lucas Black to make him the first boy I ever had a break on. I'm out of the country, that's why boy with an accent has no appeal to me, but for him I would definitely make an exception. Which after seeing crazy in Alabama, Night Lights Friday, and Tokyo Drift you should see why. She is a great actor and has since been a kid. I miss this show and wish it would come back. If anyone ever saw the season selling season please email me. kywildflower16@hotmail.com
