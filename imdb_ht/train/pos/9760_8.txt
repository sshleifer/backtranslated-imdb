I have many memory fans in this movie, as I've seen it with my younger sister when she first showed teatrically in 1977 and I was eight years old. Apparently he has been judging a failure - and is now practically forgotten (pan-and video-excited - never fairly in the picture or it's ambitious Panavision composition is now out-of-print.) The movie is highly stylized ( shades of yellow submartine) and admire them unmatched. Some of the characters and sequences are exquisite while others are a bit juvenile and undistinguished. The sad abandoned blue camel (shades of Eeyore) and his blue songs are truly heartwarming. Joe Raposo is singing for the most beautiful part simply beautiful. Definitely a refreshing curiosity that will probably (unfortunately) fall into total obscurity.
