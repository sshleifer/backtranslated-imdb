Not for those who are quick to think or without a drop in blood clots in the veins. If you do not have any of these you can not understand it. But if you do not understand, you can not enjoy it. :) For example if you think Picasso is a name in a car produced by Citroen, you probably will see Picasso's paintings just walking in it, deciding it's a waste-work in some street painters. :) So do not judge before you try to understand it :) In the end I think it's a MUST for every person with open mind. Still N1 I remain Shawshank the redemption! And remember that not all of this can be put into frames. Because there are things in this world, that any frame just will not fit.
