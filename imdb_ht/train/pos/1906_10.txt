Unfortunately, 8 Simple rules, for dating my teenage daughter, is the last sitkon that Jan Ritter was forced to work after his tragic death in 2003. He was one of my favorite actors ever. He had it all, comedy (who can forget it at the Company's three) but it was also an excellent dramatic actor (Unforgivable ?? worth watching TV movie) As many I liked all the members casting to the show (Katey, Amy, Kaley and Martin) As the star was, he was very much the reason I was drawing on the show in the first place, and it was his perfect comedy delivery that could crack me every time. /> I liked how the show was not all sweet (as I liked the Cosby show, coming over, being too nice to each other lol) to describe the typical family dynamics brilliantly. It was realistic enough with all the rivalry of sibling and anger between parents, but still keeping it funny. A lot of American sitcoms try and complete the shows entirely with moral and non, and this show did not do that. Yes, there were some, such as tackling important issues, such as drugs and intimidation, but they did not try and be anything other than a fun family comedy. <br /> How to write John's death in show was brighter to do, I still sob like a baby every time I see it. You can feel how emotions were during these episodes extremely difficult. <br /> I'm sad show off, I still enjoy watching the reruns, and I never get tired of it. <br /> John Ritter, you will still be remembered for your illustrations of this protective father, who would rather lock her daughter up in the rooms than they have a boy's date =) You rock knight!
