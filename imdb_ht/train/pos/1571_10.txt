Not since Spongebob Squarepants I've seen a larger cartoon on television. Colors are great, the voices could not be better, the characters are so original, great big cartoon. Hope Nickolodean continues to develop this cartoon. Hope the DVD season comes out fast !!! I like cartoons like this and I hope that more people tune in is this great design. It is very difficult to get the DVD season, so if someone finds a store that sells it please let me know. Only the Catscratch merchandise available on Nick Shop is a great lookin shirt but very very expensive !!! If you love spongebob; and who never? you will love Catscratch too!
