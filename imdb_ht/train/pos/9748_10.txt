I saw this film when it came out when I was 17 years old and in classic rock (still am) .. <br /> I never liked opera before because I hate soprano voice, but it all changed so. She was adorable to the movie and was such an amazing voice. I heard from CNN that he died home tonight in pancreatic cancer, he will miss, and he definitely leaves his mark on this world. <br /> I hope to buy this movie if I can get it, watch and enjoy. * Smile * Perhaps I should head up on Amazon.com and have a look before it's sold out.
