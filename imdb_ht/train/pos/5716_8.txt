Do not see any of the Japanese films, but I really enjoy this one. I rarely get SCARED when watching movies. I can jump, if the effect and sound are thrilling enough, but getting scary out of a movie is very rare for me. But I found fear out of Grudge. Perhaps because I did not expect anything at all when I looked at her. I did not expect getting scared. I did not know anything about it either. That was probably a good thing. <br /> This is a movie that you, apparently, either love or hate. Most people seem to compare it to the Japanese-Grudge films, but even though I have not seen them, I believe it's not good to compare any movie, actually. This movie stands on its own. The story is weak, most people say. I do not agree. The story is minimalist, and doing so on purpose. The storytelling techniques used to use - the broken time frame for example - is perfectly done. The director knows exactly what he's doing, and I think he's got her vision of how he wanted it. <br /> I gave this movie 8 to 10. It's a movie you'll enjoy watching, or hating. It's as simple as that.
