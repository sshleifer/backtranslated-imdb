Josef von Sternberg directed this magnificent silent film on Hollywood silence and the former Imperial General of the Czar in Russia which found himself. Emil Jannings won a well-deserved Oscar, in part, for his role as the general that ironically drift into a bit part of a silent picture as a Russian general. The film shines back to his day in Russia leading up to the revolutionary country. William Powell makes his first big screen as the Hollywood director who projects Jannings in his movie. The film serves as an exciting look in the fall of Russia and in an imitation of the Tinseltown behind-scenes in the early days. From Sternberg again rescued another classic, and one is filled with the great elements of romance, intrigue, and tragedy.
