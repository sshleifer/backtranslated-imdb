"It's my mouth" says in a strange symbiosis that develops between a socially ill-faced female office (Devos) and trainee work, a great excon (Casel). As the film violates this Duo easily descended into the idiots to become involved in a merging of spirits, each using the other for selfish reasons and an extraordinary result. Good thing for anyone in the movie-driven movie with strong psychodramatic undercurrents. In French and easy to read the translation and good translation. (B +)
