Music Albums invaded this film. Once and for a while it is played with original originals (such as piano, but never full of orchestras), but often it is re-worked with various contemporary (e.ggitar) assemblies and treatments (such as jazz piano). Only occasionally the music is focused on the sole of the film: the vast majority of the time is the music set in various dance, often flamenco, but not always. I would guess that there are 12 ?? 14 scenes, which are not united by a plot. Not all scenes will reach the height of a viewer. In my case about half to the pinnacle, though the rest was in their own way very well. Those who have worked for me have moved me to taste aesthetic meat; Well, the final stage let me cry with joy. And in some very magical ways it brings you deep into Spanish culture. If you do not like subtitles, do not worry. The movie is usually wordless, though each scene brings a title to an album. Seeing this movie pretty much sharp my complaint that virtually none of the films in Saura are available on DVDs in the USA. I think here particularly in his flamenco version of "Carmen," a spectacular work of art available in Europe, but not here (the European DVD will not play on American DVD players). This is a scandal.
