New York never looked so good! And neither have anyone in this movie. While the script is a bit lightweight you can not help but like this movie or any of the characters in it. You almost like people like this really exists. The appeal of the actors is what really puts it on (John Ritter, Camp Colleen and late Dorothy Strates are particularly good.) Go ahead and rent or buy this movie you'll be happy to have done.
