Well, so I've come a long way out of Houston by now, but every time I see this film, I take back to a little cowgirl's dream one day to ride the bull in the Gilley. (It burned before I was in the age of drinking.) <br /> If you grew up in East Texas, then you know this movie is a precise exact in contemporary life at that time. If you did not then trust me and watch the movie. Either you will join many people who like it (and at the same time weirdly reproduce), or at the very least, you can make fun of the wheels. (There are many materials for pleasing fun.) This movie does not try to be P.C. (that's in the 80 's) or hide the white garbage element and it is honest in the time and place. <br /> <br /> gotta be a 10 for me!
