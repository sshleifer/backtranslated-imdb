I saw film at Film Festival Film Nashville. He was very well done, from the cinematography acting. It's the story of a father and son, and how they come to appreciate each other during a family crisis. The writing and dialogue that has never been forgotten, the talent showers acting in Paul Reiser and Peter Falk, among others in this exceptional cast. The movie begins with the aging father (Peter Falk) trying to figure out why his wife (Olympia Dukakis) left her. The father introduced himself, unannounced, on the doorstep of his son and daughter-in-law. The father and son took in the next day to look into some properties and end up taking a classic road trip. They are fish, play pools, watch a baseball game, get drunk, participate in a crucible brawl, and dance with strange women. But more important, each confronting the insensitive tensions that can affect any family. It's the kind of movie that touches the heart and makes one appreciate the closest people.
