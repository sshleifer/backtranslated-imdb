I scooped up this title by accident with the Grindhouse Vol. 1 collection of cinema Euro-trash pies. But this movie has a nice stamp of approval and should deserve a better transfer than that out there. Stupednous it does not ... it is! Watching this movie I could not help wonder ... how did Sergio Sergio not make this flick? This has his signature all over it and punctuated by Edede Fenech (unlucky as well known as it should but he did get a nice comedy in Hostel II). Double-cross and triple-crossed underly and cemented this film from the beginning to end with Lee Van Cleef cause frozen under pressure from the second to 1st. Does this guy have to go to Italy finally reach his potential or did the studio system leave this guy slipping off? In addition to Lee's most recognizable film, the film-goers should try this on for size and see how Sergio Leone would have lowered his season scale down once on a half-time America in the run-time (with 1 / 4 of the budget) this is what it would have turned out to be like. So refreshing, it should take in during the day at home and make it for a couch massage
