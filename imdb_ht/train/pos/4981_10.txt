I feel this film is a rare treasure. Not only is it the start of Shirley Temple's career, but a rare look at how our society has changed. You must understand, some things we today would consider as sexual, back then would be considered innocent. For example, parents of children in the movie as well as many parents who took their children to see this movie, saw this as mimicking adults only. Most people did not think of anyone who looked at children sexually attractive, other than teenage boys lusting on teenage girls. They were not sexually. Your mind was before we had Internet, TV, etc. ... Most sexual offenses were not openly brought. Occasionally there is a whisper on the kid and the "funny uncle." But that was all that came out of it. Yes very sad. But it's a sad day today, for even I can see this movie as anything else than it intended, innocent and funny. When I saw Shirley dance like that with the boy's eyes balling her, yes I felt disturbed. I must remind myself that this time took place! Those people did not know what sex. Parents knew that, both of these children in the movie and those who watched it. The thought can not even come into the mind. In the eyes of the average adult back then, this was no more sexual then if Shirley was playing the home. Even today the kids will go into beauty contest, many dress up very mature, for a three year old. However the child is merely pretending. I do not blame the child for wanting to act like an adult. Or the old movies that show this. In all honesty, our media did a lot of things to look back then seem sick and evil. This can sometimes be the best. But I really believe that this movie is not one of them. It gives a rare look to an innocent mentality, that we have lost time.
