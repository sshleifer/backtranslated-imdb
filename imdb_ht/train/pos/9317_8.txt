I saw this movie criticized and the statement, "If you can get past the moralize ..." That missed the point. Moralizing is in the consciousness of the beholder, as it was. This is a decent movie with a murderous standard of mystery, but with a distinct twist that's Midway's surface. The resolution leaves the viewer asking, "What would I do in this position?" And I must believe that's exactly what the cinema is intended. For this, and at the end of the amusing audience, the film succeeded. I also like the way that the violence is never on stage, but just in the camera. We know what happened just; It just does not serve up in front of us, then brush in our face, as it should be today with contemporary and gore dresses. In addition, violence is not the point. The point is the moral dilemma protagonist, which is cunning, albeit cloudy, resolved.
