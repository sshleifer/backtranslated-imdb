I saw this movie on Hallmark Hall and thought it was beautiful, especially since it was based on a real man. Pierce Brosnan was very good as the English English man who took over the character at Gray's Owl half crosses. The photography was beautiful. This film made me perform more research into this known Archie Belaney character such as Gray Owl. I want it as long as I can. At the time I did not know Richard Attenborough headed it. But I'm not surprised. I love all its films if it acts or guides. I gave it the highest rating. However, I would like to see more of the film about why he took on this character as he only showed the two aunts that raised him and his room at home. <br /> <br /> You can not go wrong with this movie if you are like me and enjoy a nice story without hearing the language and conflicting effects every few minutes.
