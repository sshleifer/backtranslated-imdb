Cinderella .... <br /> <br /> I did not watch this movie for about five years the last time I saw it. The magic remains. There is something that definitely has that feeling storybook, the songs to entertain and the high character to all please. The bandits in stage soccer forms are perfectly evil and vile. Then there is the most magical of all Disney, the mice do the dress and well you know the rest. Sum up four of the Disney Princess movies are all great but this is a good magic experience, look and enjoy. Oh and of course, Cinderella is wonderful as the main character of the movie. <br /> <br /> If you think about it Disney cinema can really lose the charms. With Elene Wood and others the movie has such a feeling, you simply can not help but smile <br /> <br /> They say the morale of this story is that dream come true. Of course in the real world some people believe that others are the Hoper. In this movie it's even more magical when its rainbow comes smiling. <br /> <br /> And of course the rest is ... Cinderella
