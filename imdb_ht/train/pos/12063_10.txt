The Woman of Darkness (1989) is a TV adaptation of Susan Hill's classic ghosts, released just a few years earlier than the movie was made. Unfortunately, this movie has not been released on DVD, and as far as I know it was deleted on VHS. It is available in direct contrast to its popularity among those who are aware of horror movies. The turret story of events in a seaside community in the early 20th century where a young mayor sent by his firm to conclude the affairs of a recently deceased widow, who died in its swamp estate real estate. What she thought would be a routine and probably tedious work turn into a nightmare as she discovered that the old woman had hated her death, and that the ghosts of past were not content to rest. The story is said in a subtle, but short, never being independent self, flashy or over-exposure. The budget obviously tight can contribute to the no-nonsense approach, but it's just what the story needs, and why it works well. It's what you do not see that crisis. After saying that, there is a particularly stressful scene that depends on the visual, and it works in perfection. I watched this movie during the day, and it was still my nightmare almost a week later. If you love being scared, do what you have to get caught and watch a copy of the Woman in Black.
