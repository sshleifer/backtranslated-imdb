there are no films and dennis hopper, gary busey, erika eleniak, tom berenger, dew stockwell, marilu henner worth a rating below 5 over here. This is a poor wife version of movies such as 16 blocks or running at timeless minutes except the prisoner being transported here is very easy on Ms.Eleniak's eyes. Tom Berenger plays another gray, maverick military well with William Mcnamara playing rookie-on to be dumped well. The plot on her face is absurd because I lost counting twice the Eleniak should have and could escape, but this is an amusing movie-fine movie and has good cameras from all the highest actors who hold the movie rolling . This is not really a family movie as some have sworn with a naked and elastic nude scene but this is a lot better than some of the other guffs that came out around that time.
