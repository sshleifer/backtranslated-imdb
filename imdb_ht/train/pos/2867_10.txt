I lost my dad at a very young age. So young in fact, that I have no recollection of it. Over the years I've learned a lot about it. One of those things was that he loved the west, and watching Bonanza every Sunday evening was an absolute ceremony for her. I, myself, remembering that the series' run, they were 8 years old adult when the show stopped production in 1973. Watching this show during these years somehow made me closer to my dad long lost.It had all the right elements to make a successful show, laughter, tears , the edge of your seat suspension, and even upset you at times. The most lively memory of running the original show, came shortly after the death of our dear "Hoss" Cartwright, Dan Blocker. A particular episode , and at the end of the credit close, shine a photo of Blocker, and faded black, and I can also remember my oldest sister and a tears in front of her eyes I can remember this as if he yesterday. In my late dad's name, who is not here to say so, we like Bonanza.Long live the Cartwrights.
