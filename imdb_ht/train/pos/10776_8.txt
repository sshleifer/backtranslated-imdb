"Radiofreccia" is still a good surprise in Italian movies. The film is based on an Italian songwriter Luciano Ligabue, who also directed the film and writes the musical notes of course. The film is a portrait of northern Russia, in Emilia Romagna region. We are in 1975, the first time the free radios - one of the boys in the movie created "Radioraptus". Youth wants, friends, love, sex, individual plays and unemployment is among the themes, but the film also speaks about drugs -Freccia, the main character, is a victim of slavery slavery. and moralists, the story flows very well; The spontaneous actor is strong and the way to lead. Obviously Luciano "League" League is neither Fellini nor a professional film, first of all it is a musician. But it succeeds in making a good product. Unfortunately he will not repeat success with his second film "Da zero a dieci" -not good at all. <br /> <br /> In the "Radiofreccia" actors are generally not very popular, the only star is Stefano Accorsi - one of the most popular Italian actors. Looking at the role of another Italian songwriter - Francesco Guccini, it is the nice communist bomber and football coach!
