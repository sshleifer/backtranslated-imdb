The end of the "Kingdom" is blood and even more twisted. I only saw half (I was exhausted and could not sit in all 5 1/2 hours) but I loved what I saw. Zombie, blood, murder, poisoning, baby mutations, voodoo ... this is it all! If you have a strong belly and such strange cinema this is for you. <br /> Also, you do not need to see Part 1 to understand that ... you'll figure it out! > <br /> Is anyone who knows whether Kingdoms 1 and 2 are available on DVD? Sitting in these movies in a theater is tedious. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, there is probably not a "kingdom 3" - Ernst-Hugo Jaregard (Sig) died a year later that was filmed. But you never know!
