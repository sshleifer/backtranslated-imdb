Beautiful movie again dealing with the trials and tribulations of World War 11 England. What makes this movie so good is touching the human element.This film is definitely in the tradition of British classics such as "Mrs. Miniver" and "Hope and Glory." As is the case with this film, we see the desperation of people in the time of war. Their performance is exceptional here especially by John Thaw's interpreter, who assigns a child who has been evacuated from London to the bombing. <br /> <br /> We soon see why this child is using his bed. She came from an absolute mother who abused him terribly. <br /> <br /> The old man takes in the child and brings happiness to his sad life. When the child returns to his mother, this old man goes to London and finds him out only finding tragedy. She literally kidnaps the boy and is able to persuade a higher upward that the child is best with her than being at boy's home. <br /> <br /> The picture is so good because it deals with building on endearing relationships.
