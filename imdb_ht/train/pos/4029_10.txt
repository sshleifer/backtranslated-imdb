I have no words to describe how good this film is. Only one genius like Amrita Pritam could write as a real illustration of the days of partition. The movie keeps haunting me for many days. <br /> <br /> Urmila has made the role of her life in this movie. He puts life in the role of Puroo and Manoj Vajpai was not less in his role as Rashid. It's hard to imagine anyone other than those doing the role of Puroo and Rashid. The Punjabi costumes looked so naturally on Urmila and Manoj looked like a natural Punjabi Mussalmaan. <br /> <br /> Sandhali Sinha as Lajo and Suri as Ramchand did fabulous work. Priyanshu Chattarjee did good work as Triloki. Some of the scenes you just can not get out of your mind. When Puroo meets Lajjo for the first time, she brings tears. The bigger point is just killer. I was expecting a tragic end but fortunately, the finish was wonderful. <br /> <br /> This movie is in the same category as Pakeezah, Mughal-e-Azam, Banaras etc. Do not be missed.
