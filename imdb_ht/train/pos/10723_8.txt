I have read in some of the other user comments and decided to put one in the same. Some of the users are stuck in a 'realistic' kind of mentality. This movie was meant to be a 'fantasy' .... a 'that if' fun movie. It never meant to be 'real' or serious. It was quite enjoyable for everyone I knew when he came out - though it shadows the tragedy into the Challenger explosion ... I was 30 at the time and totally enjoyed this one - young I loved it too! And I shared it with my daughter and he, too, loved it. SpaceCamp is a fun family movie that should be fun for just that - fun. All the 'realisers' of the world should lighten up or stick to watch documentaries or docudramas and avoid any other kind of movie. So, sorry for those young people who watched this movie first and then they were able to go to the real spacecamp (one in Alabama and one in Vandenberg AFB in California) - They had to go Waiting to find the same kind of environment described in the movie and then felt 'deception' ... I guess the parents did not explain the difference between fantasy and reality. Oh well. If you like fantasy-fun movie and you do not see this one, I highly recommend it! Enjoy!
