Kudos director and cast for such a realistic film. The gravity, lack of glamor and despair drew me to the movie and caught me there. I was really impressed by how date and information were transferred to the movie; ie newspapers, letters, etc. She kept the movie moving at a speed so I did not feel prompt to fast forward once. Personally, I thought all the principles had made a tremendous ... it was nice to see Bosworth and Kudrow in these tough roles. She made me want to cry at times. Val Kilmer did not surprise me ... His performance in this nature usually left me in awe. In general, this is a brilliant film not to be missed!
