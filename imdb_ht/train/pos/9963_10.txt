I saw this movie when I was a girl. And I enjoyed it every time. Insured graphics are a little cheese, compared to now, but back to the 70's was great. I've seen it in the original Spanish version only and thought it was wonderful. It was how I remember my Christmases were with my family - magic. Santa Claus was amazing and I could not wait to come back every year. <br /> <br /> If you have a kids / kids and speak Spanish, bring them up watching this old fashion version of "Santa Claus". It's a different version than we've used today, but who say there is a way? <br /> It's a fun movie to watch. It teaches good and evil kids. I do not know how the English subtitled version is or if there is only one English in this, but the Spanish is the best. Enjoy and Happy Holidays! Feliz Navidad!
