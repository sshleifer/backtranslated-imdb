I think the 'third blackadder' is one of the best in the series. Actually all the funny episodes, personally I really love the episode and the 'French invasion', but the one with the superstitious actors, in 'MACBETH' is also really funny, the Rowan way to keep playing on and are really (English) Humor at the highest level. <br /> <br /> Actor: 'Never say that again, always calling it the Scottish Play; Blackadder: Oh, so do you want me to say the Scottish play? Actor: YES Blackadder: Rather than MACBETH ...! <br /> I'm a big fan of Rowan and I have the majority of her work, but I think she did the series of Blackadder especially good. /> <br /> I hope Rowan is going to continue his great style, but I think we can count on it, because it is already working on a movie 2 Bean, which will come out this year, I can not wait . I give this 3rd Blackadder a 9 out of 10 rating.
