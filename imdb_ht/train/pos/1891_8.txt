When you see this movie you begin to realize that a very advantageous advantage of using Dudley Moore is late. It should have a dozen movies like this in our archive. He had previously talented talent before he went to Hollywood, both as a comedy and a musician. But most of all, he is remembered to be with Peter Cook, on TV and in one or two indifferent British films. Perhaps the best of these was 'Bedazzled'. He still tends to be eclipsed by Cook, who is in jealousy and softness rifted their partnerships and allowed Moore to realize his true potential in America. 'Arthur' is the result. <br /> <br /> This is a really splendid movie. Moor's comedy comedy as a drunkard is undeniable. The script is perfectly suited to his way with the other in hilarious, almost surrealist digressions conversation. There is something so British about it that I'm actually surprised to find such a call to American flavors. Tommy Cooper, an anarchist comedy after the same fashion trends draw a blank. It is Moore's almost impaired that is so entertaining. <br /> <br /> Liza Minelli and John Guilgud tend to play right roles on her, but still have some excellent one-linen maternity. John Guilgud in particular delivers him with a sarcastic and acerbic authority which is a treasure to watch. She invariably steals any stage in which she features and well deserves his Oscar. Correcting me if I'm wrong, but she never played any other funny role. There is a follow-up movie called 'Arthur 2 - On The Rocks'. It never reaches the same sublime levels of fun that this one happens, but it's still quite the same. Guilgud only gets a comic appearance at the beginning and as a ghost. It is darker. And some interesting souls seek. It will disappoint if you look at 'Arthur' first. <br /> <br /> Hollywood seemed to liberate interest in Dudley cuddly after the two trips. He eventually returned to Great Britain, which had been damaged and apparently dead. But 'Arthur' is a sample of what could be. We can only imagine the other great movies he should do. <br /> <br /> You're Unfortunately missed, Dudley.
