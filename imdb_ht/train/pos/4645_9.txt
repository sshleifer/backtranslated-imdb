This movie is very interesting. I saw it twice and it looks like Glover hit the nail on the head and what he claims he wants to accomplish. Here for someone to relate to the outrage that the film maker clearly expresses the current corporate intuitive drive that is an offensive to every media center, and the things that we as a culture are supposed to "think" on account of control media venture. Outrage that Glover expressed in "outrageous" elements of the films both is clear of its visionary insults and the splendor of its poetic potency. I'm glad I saw this movie and it is even clear that Glover is up to something interesting and part of what will be a trilogy. It's fine! ALL TAGS. See also. People who reject this movie as "fearless" or "firefighters" really miss the boat. This is a smart movie. If you can see it with live shows it does before with its books, which is also very angry while. The way you get in her mind is really something. You will have an experience!
