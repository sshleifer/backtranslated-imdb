A beautiful Shirely Temple short. Children of the actors screaming their line seemed to be the norm for that day and time. Maybe they "saw and did not hear" need to be made up for. Aside from this is fun. Given the film era there are some aspects of the thing, from a social point of view, which strikes me as both highly progressive and liberal. I will not go into these here, I would rather not spoil it for you, but let you look it for yourself and see if you spot these elements. As early as it was easy to see out of this passion that was already developed for temples. This makes it worth seeing if you are a fan of temples. For others it's a cool way to kill ten minutes while waiting for your glass night warm up on the stove.
