I enjoy this movie for two reasons. The first is that it provides an insight into the world of loyalists in northern Ireland, which is very rarely treated in movies, most of which tells us about the Republican struggle. The second reason is the performance of the actors. I thought they were very honest and convinced portraits of a very tired midfielder that not many people heard out of my native shores. <br /> <br /> All in all, it is a fun gang movie movie with stellar performance in a person who's in the north Irish actor at cast. It will not move the earth, although it can slightly open some eye to the noble world of paramilitary loyalists.
