An evil, cleverly clever piece of work from the gifted British writer Hanif Kureishi has written "my lovely Laundrette", (this is the best thing she's been doing since then). It's about smart people whose life does not add up much. They were wasting what they were given and hugely empty vessels. The only character on screen who is alive is the mother of the title yet she feels inside inside until a rough handyman shows her some affection and lift her to the joys of sex. He has his own motive but Kureishi treated him with a good deal of compassion. This is a movie in which people and places feel familiar, where characters exist beyond the boundaries of the screen. In some respects it's a bit like "Sunday, Bloody Sunday" but it's a piece of unprecedented work. The director, Roger Michell, allowed the scenes to build instinctives. And it is very good to act. As the eponymous mother Anne Reid betrays life wasting her in every gesture. No fake scores of extraordinary he lived-in performance, and very good actor Daniel Craig shows his character shadow than even Kureishi was not tapped into. If the movie hits a fake note it is, perhaps, of the talentless daughter's character, caught in a roomy affair with the mother's mother seduced (or should be round the other way) and even messier life but It is so well played by Cathryn Bradshaw he hooks you in any way. The film is also very nice to look at (DoP Alwin Kuchler) and be rank, unhesitatingly, as the best British film of the year.
