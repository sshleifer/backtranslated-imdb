After 'Aakrosh', this was the second film for Govind Nihalani as a director.Till this film was made there was no documentary hearing in India. This film proved to be a point that a documentary can satisfy the requirements of a commercial film without meaningless delusions. He was one of the successful movies of the year in which he was released. This film was challenged against the big Bollywood like'COOLIE ',' BETAAB ',' HERO 'in 1983. <br /> <br /> SmithaPatel, in this movie acted more like a consciousness of the hero every time he was drifted away or lost consciousness he had reminded him. He did not like a usual heroine doing the usual thing to run around the trees and bushes. At one time, he even gave up his love when the hero's heroine touched the roof top. There was another character in this film, which was played by Om Puri contemporary, Naseeruddin Shah.I was playing as an inspectors-spin-alcohol. The role of targeting the message in the end result of an honest cop that rubbed the wrong side of the system that also gave the viewers a chance to forecast the unfinished hero. In his debut film, Sadashiv Amrapurkar captivated the audience with his role as a role model who finally won him the best actor supported by the film.Japon in the movie was not a complete personality forward he could adjust the system at a level. The anger that left half handedly continued in Govind Nihalani's film "Drohkaal". Even after two decades, this film is just because of the director and the whole crew. Each was played by excellence.
