I can not really condemn the movie because it works. There are enough movie noir elements to consider it a noir movie, but I think it's just just in the category. <br /> <br /> There is nothing disaster in this piece, and that's where the noir elements fail. Sure, the disease can be considered disaster, but I have a hard time seeing it. The film suggestions on a dark side: Blackie can traffick human beings, New Orleans police are just too willing to seize a reporter, the viewer of the epidemic hangs on everyone in the movie ... but these are really just hints. <br /> There are no attempts to make Reed's motivation, as one to do with Marlowe or Spade, or who have any attempts to bring a Blackie side, which would make him even more despicable if human trafficking was actually play outside <br /> <br /> That lack of depth is what fails to the movie at the end. <br /> The story is decent, the act is a good thing, the writing and the directions are well done ... but nothing to do this a movie you should return to over and over. Worth it will look once, maybe twice if you do not remember it in years ago, and then put out.
