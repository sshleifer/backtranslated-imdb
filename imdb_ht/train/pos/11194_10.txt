Wrong script, wrong direction, on the top performances, top dialog. What more can you ask for? To laugh, it just does not get any better than that. The over-acting Zadora combined with the stereotype scenarios he finds himself in making for a hilarious parody of the "Hollywood" car. Almost as funny as "Tap Spin" even though it was clearly not intended as such. Do not miss Ray Liotta's movie line, "looks like a penis."
