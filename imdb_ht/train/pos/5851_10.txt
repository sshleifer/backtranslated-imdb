* SPOILERS * <br /> <br /> This is just the second pay-per-view I gave a perfect 10, the first being to the 1991 Royal Rumble. She was full of exciting matches that were not memorable, fun just thrown. And that's why I love it. The match is open between Razor and DiBiase, as well as Ludvig Borga vs Marty Jannetty was the only low score. They were OK matches, but DiBiase deserved the best of his latest paid match match. These days, a match like this would have run-ins and a larger score for Biggest Babyface's razor's push. With Jannetty, cool in a run Intercontinental title, could have been a better match with Borga. But I do not think anyone really cares. They just need a Borga push on pay for every TV view. IRS and the Kid were great, as were Michaels and perfect. I wish perfect could have, but Michaels lay down for no one. Notice about how right then, she left the WWF so she would not have to work razor. Bret Hart has two big brawls and Doink (noting how best to match everyone is against the hit-man) and then Lawler. Their rivalry was a classic; That's why Feud Year of the Year was an arm-no. How often do you see two legions of FID this year late in their careers? <br /> <br /> Steiners-Heavenly Match corresponds to being one of the best of the year. Who knew their body would keep their own against one of the best teams ever? Many people say that Andertaker-Giant Gonzalez's match was a waste of time. But I loved it. Remember, what made the old WWF (as in, pre-WWE) great was the mixture of athletics and freak shows. Is there a soul out there who did not like Akeem? <br /> <br /> The main event was not bad, although nowhere near to match the year's status. They put Lex Luger on well, but made a wise choice to have Yokozuna hold the waist. He was the first heel since Superstar Graham to hold the belt for more than two months. Nowadays, heels are champions all the time. But from the beginning of the WWWF to the WWF in the 90s, if you blinked, you miss a heel king title. <br /> As an old school literary fan, one with SummerSlam '88 are my favorites.
