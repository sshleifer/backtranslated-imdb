Excellent movie. The entire photo was filmed in Budapest, so I feel proud. My little problem was that the tracks in the film belonged to the Hungarian State Railway (M√ÅV), and it is clear to see that they were used in large trains, not on the local train - according to the story of Chikatilo pick up his victim at local train stations. Apart from that, the movie is superb.
