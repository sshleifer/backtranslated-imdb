The dentist was doing on the time when almost every profession had it in psycho. We were angry police officers, ambulance men, the secret and that was just for starters. The dentist came suprisingly late because going to dentist is usually nightmare nightmare. <br /> <br /> Draw the twist. Super Cleansing Doctor Doctor Feinstone lives perfect life in his "white" palace, has beautiful blonde wife and good place to work as a dentist. Blacks are coming to her horizons in the form of nasty IRS guy (Terminator to Earl Boen), pool cleaning room "cleaning up" his wife and suddenly everybody seems to have gone to black filter. It goes nutso and begins to take care of people in nasty nails. And you do not want to come in his path. <br /> <br /> Crew were professional. Producer / director Brian Yuzna has produced stylish horror movies like Re-Animator and from Beyond. He led the sequel to Re-Animator and his first film society was pretty spinoff from the John Carpenter to Live. The film producer Pierre David is known in movies such as Scanners. Throw was great. Corbin Bernsen really surprises me. I knew her from Law and Major League, but I could further dream him as a psychologist dentist. It was actually great in her role and was the kind of sad person. Linda Hoffman was beutiful and mute as his wife Feinstones. Micahel Stadvec did not have much line, but after I saw him and lady in the neighborhood I knew my future profession. Ken Foree (Dawn of the Dead, from Beyond) was beautiful eyes as cop on the case. Virginya Keehne was the innocent teenager who is on the next customer of Feinstone. <br /> <br /> Final Warning: If you are like me and you have problems with the dentist then maybe you should skip this one. But if you want to try to spend you should prepare yourself with black humor and many nasty drillings.
