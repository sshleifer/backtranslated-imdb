Anbarrassingly, I just watch this movie for the first time, 13 years after its release. It's a story that any father or brother can relate to ... one brother is a bit 'wild,' the other brother is typical of the older child. Craig Sheffer is a little too unemotional as the oldest brother, but Pitt is amazing, and Skerritt is perfectly cast like the father. Fishing portals that were filmed in Montana are absolutely breathtaking ... I had no idea that flying fishing could be so attractive. The film closely follows the book, and only a few modifications make it more suitable for a movie format. Unlike most books in movie history, this one measures them. It's a perfect movie for anyone who wants a quiet night with a powerful movie and somewhat emotional.
