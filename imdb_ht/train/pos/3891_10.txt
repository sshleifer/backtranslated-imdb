One of the best comedy ever. I saw this show about 10 times and will probably look at it at least 100 more. My friends and family quote from this DVD often, you'd think we did nothing else than watching it. The beginning of Alcatraz is a little slow, but either walks in or reads on in the party where Eddie is on stage. Look for part of "Cake or Death" (playing on the England Church) and the "Hitler / Pol Pot" party (Hard to explain, just watch it). The best part of the show can be Eddie's facial expressions. He can really say so much to his eyes. (Mascara, eyeliner, and eyeshadow probably help, huh?) Fairness Warning: Eddie has a tendency to throw a lot of four-word words in.
