Eddie Murphy Delirious is by far the funniest thing you'll ever see in your life. You can compare it to any movie, and I guarantee you will decide that Delirious is the Funniest movie ever! This film is about 1hr. 45 min, and at all times, there was barely a moment where I was not laughing. You will laugh for hours after passing, replaying the punch lines on and over and over in your head. Eddie Murphy has given many funny comics on his career (48 hours, where trading, Beverly Hills Cop, Raw, comes to America, Nutty's teacher, Shrek, etc.), but this is not far worse. I've seen this movie many times, and it is funnier every time. He never lost his edge. From this day forward, all great performance stands will be imitated from Delirious. ***** and two thumbs up!
