This cordial comedy encountered a few rare characters. Specifically, of course, the two leading characters. Jack Lemmon plays Felix, a hypocondriarch whose wife has lost him because he could not stop his cleansing and cooking again. So he tries to kill himself, but each attempt fails. Walter Matthau plays Oscar, his friend, an unreliable, unreliable sports-reporter who lives in divorce from his ex-wife in an undergraduate apartment. He offered his friend Felix a new home in his apartment. And soon the problem begins because these two controversial characters can not live together for a long time. Felix spin Oscar's flat chambers into a neat showroom. It cleans and bakes the whole time. After a while, Oscar feels persecuted by felons ... Films in a theater and excellent way to act. Above, playing Jack Lemmon is wonderful. It is the perfect basket. It makes us laugh but in a tragic-humorous manner. Look for the wonderful scene when both men invite the female neighbors to eat because Oscar has earned something more smoother than a bowling ball. While preparing the drinks, Felix sat down with the two girls in the living-room. To get out of this nasty situation, he begins to talk about the weather. One minute later, he changed the subject and talks about his ex-wife and children. Suddenly she starts to cry and when Oscar comes back with drinks, there are three people crying in the living-room. This movie is full of these fun and at the same time touching scenes. A smart, funny comedy and lots of hearts. 10 out of 10!
