As I said in my comment on the first part: The two films are better than most confessed science fiction fans. The scenario of the second film is not moving as we do not see the destruction of human civilization, but consequences, thousands of refugees are saved in small space boxes, protected by one powerful vessel. <br /> But when Battlestar Pegasus appears, the story shakes up, bringing the battle back to the Cylon Planets. Well, he has a little bit of angry Max because all those fights are fueling the vessels traveling on to find the Earth far, but it works for me. It is surprisingly science fiction science featuring fine actors and decent special effects (even though people tend to repeat themselves, they say least :-)). I would like a continuation with Starbucks and Apollo on board. Instead, we got a second end with no name character that proved that the story worked first because the character features were so well selected ... <br /> So thumb down for production in 1980, but tipping in for the two movies from 1978.
