With a special telescope, Dr. Janos Rukh (Boris Karloff) successfully proved that a year ago a meteorite landed in Africa with an unknown, but very powerful component. Dr Benet (Bela Lugosi) forms an expedition led by Rukh to find the element. Suddenly, Rukh discovered "Radium X," even more powerful than radium and very radioactive and Karloff gets contaminated and can kill anyone by just touching them. The Sparks really fly between Lugosi and Karloff in this classic science fiction film during the Second World War II era. Director Hillyer used a few set up in the "FLASH GORDON" series which was filmed at the same time as well as some elements of electric car from Frankenstein. Universal to keep the public unaware of the special effects being used in this great classic movie. Karloff and Lugosi were at their best and they both enjoyed working together and going to enjoy the next generation.
