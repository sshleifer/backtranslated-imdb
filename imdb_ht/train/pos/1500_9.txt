Now, most people do not watch classic movies, like this. Most friends only watch movies in the '90s featuring. This kidnapped scum. <br /> <br /> Most old movies like this are masterpieces, unique in their own way. Only because, back when these movies were thought of and made, that's when the ideas were cool. Now people strain just think of new ideas. <br /> <br /> Anyway, in the movie. For true fans of classic horror. This is for you. The film is based and an investigator from Scotland campus investigates the disappearance of a movie actor, and breaks on three other strange events with past residents of the same house. <br /> I will not say again, because I will ruin the movie much more than I already have. But it is a terrific movie for old as it is. And never should watch it again!
