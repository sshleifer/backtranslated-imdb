I just can not understand the negative comments about this movie. Yes it is a typical girl-romantic girl romance but it is done with the Flair and Polish that the time just flies by. Henstridge (talking about winning young-pool lottery!) It's like magnetic and catchy as ever (telling the golden age of dead movies?) And Vartan keeps his own. <br /> There are chemistry studies between the two behaviors; The movie is most lively when sharing a scene - so much! It does well as you find yourself wanting to get together ... <br /> <br /> Ignore the negative comments - if you feel a bit blue, watch this flicker movie, you will feel better . If you are already happy, then you will be euphoric. <br /> (PS: I am 33, Men, from the UK with a romantic romance always looking for her princess ...)
