I love this show. Now, I'm not a big fan of many science fiction shows, so if it bares any resemblance I did not notice. I like the quality of movie history books. I even love the love story, though as I enjoy it I'm amazed at the back of my mind how heck in the part of the story can really develop to see as Ned can not handle Chuck or anything else ... well, you know . I even love Chuck, I do not get harassed at all, and I generally hate so sweet, beautiful, perfect characters. I even love the voice of the narrator, even though it bothers one of my family members and coffee some resemblance to some Walgreens advertising. I could nitpick everything else about Ned's situation and how the writers will be addressing it in the future but I just rather look and wait and see what writers' story tied.
