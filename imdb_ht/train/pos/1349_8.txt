RKO has a reputation for making American girls in their populations. Anne Shirley (as Dawn O'Day) was in film since she was a toddler. By 1933 she was in limbo - played Ann Dvorak as a child at "Three on a Match" (1932) and a "flower girl" in both "This Side of Heaven" and the "Key" both. 1934. George Nicholls Jnr remembers Anne's work from a previous film and is as he received this part. He also adopted Anne Shirley as his stage name. The memorable stories are - Lady of Shallot in a ships that shed, "The Thief" pins, the "red hair" incident. Anne was so good for the role of the orphan, heated. She was heartbreaking in her intensity, she felt impressed and also tempered fire. O.P. Heggie was wonderful as Cuthbert's understanding of Matthew and Helen Westley was fine as the company Marilla. Tom Brown was an excellent Gilbert Blythe. Gertrude Messinger, who was also in film as a toddler was good as Diana Barry. Sara Haden has proved that she could play someone other than the Andy Hardy Award series, Mrs. Barry.
