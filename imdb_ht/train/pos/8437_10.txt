*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** Well, seeing that I'm a big H: LOTS fan, maybe I loved the movie more than normal people would. However, this movie is still excellent. He had tons of surprises, and gave some more closing in the series. While I was sad that Bayliss returned to a murderer, the overall feeling I felt was dissatisfied.
