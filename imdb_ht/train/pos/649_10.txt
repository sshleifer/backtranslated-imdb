We do not have to lose this film, this is one of the greatest I've ever seen. Jean Pierre Leaud is amazing (more than normal) and the movie is one of the most unforgettable of the New Vogue. Jean Eustache is no more on this earth, we just have black and white images to remember one of the greatest and most valuable directors. You just have to love this prince. I will never forget it. <br /> <br /> PA: sorry for the English ...
