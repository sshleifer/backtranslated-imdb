When people ask me why I love so many movies, I usually answer, "Did you see the art gallery in Palma's dress to kill?" This scene alone, pretty much represent everything I want to see in a movie. If I were a movie director, what would be the kind of thing I would like to do. "The Most Cinema" is a way to describe sequences, and it's really amazing to see how the movie director De Palma works at the same high artistic frequency in that scene. It's a dream-like movie, smart as hell, and with more zest and intelligence than a dozen films put together. I think the film raises an important point that will always be a topic of heated discussions: could a movie count only on techniques and still be regarded as an artistic success? The movie has no message to speak, acting is great but it is in the service of the style, and the script is brief about logic. The two Palma films make a really good case that style, when handled properly, can sustain a feature film film. Sure, Michael Caine, Angie Dickinson, Nancy Allen and Keith Gordon give Supreme performance, but this is the movie director all the way to the fadeout. It is a sensational demonstration of the possibilities of the medium movie. I will not tell you that Hitchcock movie film pays homage (I do not want to spoil any surprises), but I think Palma transcends the story's arc, and she managed to create a very beautiful movie summary of her entire career. Not for the faint of heart!
