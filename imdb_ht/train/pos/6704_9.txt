For the first three seasons, Sabrina was a jester hidden away on TGIF (and later, early-school reruns). Each episode has a maniac, energy and rapid-fire rhythm that struck the occasional awkward joke. Melissa Joan Hart exudes a keen talent for physical comedy, particularly in his facial expressions. From her aunt, playing "the guys right," or as straight as two witches could, there was great humorous distribution and general chemistry with Hart. Salem, as a chat speaker, was free to dabble in whatever crap crap he was interested in, and one can laugh and take it all in stride because it was, after all, a talk chat. Sabrina's friends round out social experiences at the school, which also housed the typical "cheerleader evil" and "totalitarian director." Perhaps the most interesting and unique aspect of the show was the ability to enter pop culture (eg, bands of the era, Jerry Springer), archetypal humanities / morality (eg, the importance of friendship, the spirit of Christmas) , and literally representation of metaphor related to these real estate in magic. Unfortunately, as many other shows in all broadcasts, the show hits its picks during the first three years, similar to Sabrina goes to high school. Beginning in four seasons, the college move marked what would become a general decline in the overall quality of the show, particularly when the writers chose to present Josh as Harvey's rival, and compiled a thorny excuse for aunt Hilda and Zelda to stay on screen as key players. The final season, where Sabrina works in a pop culture magazine, was incredible disappointing. Still, in the end, Sabrina (particularly high school years) remains a unique entry as a hybrid hybrid committee and magic elements that elevate it above the shooter's cost to this genre every year.
