After seeing all Jesse James, Quantrill, jayhawkers, films etc. in fifty soldiers, it is quite a thrill to see this movie with a new perspective by Ang Lee director. The scene of the attack in Lawrence, Kansas is awesome. Romantic relationship between jewelry and Toby McGuire turns out to be one of the best parties with Jonathan Rhys-Meyers is outstanding as the bad guy. All the time this movie makes you feel the horror of war, and the desperate situation of the main characters who do not know if they will survive the next few hours. Definitely worth seeing.
