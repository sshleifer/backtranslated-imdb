Much as the comedy Duo in its title, "The Sunshine Boys" has become a classic 30 years amazing later. It is hardly mentioned along with other great comedy films in the 1970s. This does not make any sense to the specialty of this film, perhaps Neil Simon's best ever written. Walter Matthau plays Willy Clark, once a quarter of a legendary vaudeville comedy known as Lewis and Clark, now a bitter 73-year-old solo act that can not find a job in a commercial chip potato. His nephew with agent Ben (Richard Benjamin) is ensuring he can get work if Willy will only agree to meet his alien partner Al Lewis (George Burns) for an ABC-TV celebration in business nostalgia show. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < to "Make a clown". Then there's the present day's movie environment in Manhattan, where pants clip and wide polyester link has a lot. The collision times of Willy's glorious power chore in a Manhattan apartment, where pictures framed with the design of long dead celebrities stare out in the walls of serious tidbit magazine and bag Zabar empty bag. If you were alive in the 1970s like me, you might even feel like you were in this apartment. <br /> <br /> Willy clearly has been living too long. He slept in front of the television when the kettle in the other room nails. Willy wakes up and takes the phone. <br /> <br /> "Hello, who is this?" A pause. "Never mind, it's been there." Some men who live alone can be sad materials from almost anyone else, but Simon's clay and sensation for characters turn this adaptation in 1972 to kick it into gold comedy. The amazing thing about the "Sunshine Boys" is how much it rubs your nose to Willy's almost existential condition without turning you off at all. "89 years old and just like that, he died in nothing '" Willy says in an old friend composition, before deciding the man probably killed by writing a song that rhyme "lady" and "baby ". Burns was an Oscar for his understated performance as gentle, but Lewis Lewis, but she is Matthau who brings this one-made, make-up and proud home, but to get rid of it really to sell you The idea was already 73 when he did. Willy is reckless in extreme, completely deserving Ben's description of "old man mad", but you root for him at all, enjoying his little victory even when coming to the price of other people's patience. It's your death line, too, especially when it's trying to kill Lewis, so people reunion on television turns out to be a bad idea. <br /> <br /> "You are out of touch!" Willy tells Lewis at one point. "I'm always in demand ... I'm always hot!" <br /> "If this room was in fire you would not be hot," Lewis replied. Herbert Ross launches everything in a very casual and understated way, with low lighting and mid-range shots even at emotional times as leaving room for the comedy and overall movie message in favor of accepting quiet. You never get the feeling you're watching a movie, one of the "Sunshine boys" many charms, and Ross's direction, such as the acting of three directors, goes a long way towards achieving that end. Comedy is difficult, especially when subjects are people who watch life than not, but the "Sunshine Boys" make it all a pleasure, because, for us watching, it is.
