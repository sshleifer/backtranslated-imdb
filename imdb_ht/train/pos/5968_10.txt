When you come to a movie in a movie like this, you realize why '80 have been the greatest decade to live. The rock music was directed, and for making movies ... especially horror movies. Filmists knew how to entertain us, & "Trick or Treat" is obvious. When Sammi Curr rocker, who was most likely to write after W.A.S.P. singer Blackie Lawless, dead at a hotel fire, his # 1 fan Eddie, is unpleasant. He goes to friends & local DJ Nuke (Gene Simmons) for support. Nuke gives him a copy of the latest recording that Sammi did; This is the only copy available. He gave the radio station to be played live Halloween night. When Eddie plays it, he somehow brings back Sammi. It helps Eddie and bullies to school, but then goes out of control. It is definitely one big movie. The bad thing, this movie is printed out. I paid $ 25.00 to finally get it off on eBay. You should be too ... $$ well spent!
