Yes, the cameras were in the right place at the right time. It is so interesting to see how a world leader (like Chavez) who supports the poor in his hometown can be held at such as bar in the United States. Worst "sin", in my opinion, cares about people in the bottom of the barrel. What can be so bad about that? I have always been captivated by the US government + media reaction to Fidel Castro. First, Castro was a good guy (around 1959) when he supported Batista. Soon, however, Castro began to turn the corporations into Cuba toward the poor needs instead of the fat cats. We are a decent country, but why do our media and government have such a problem and share with the poor? If these guys are "dictators", then we could use more "dictatorships" especially where the poorest of the poor live in the world.
