This movie is wonderful. What separates it from the Sci-Fi 50 is the fact that the alien has no features, no face, eyes, anything, yet it can not die. I especially love the idea that this film does not take place on a few days, it takes place in one night, lasting supposedly past the night. It also feels that once the blob gets over you, you can not find it there. You're stuck in it, as it melt your body and slowly devour your body. The ever-favorite 50-movie sci-fi movie, and what is sometimes considered the one excellence. I can see why this rocketed Steve McQueen starred. All this with a catchy theme song! How can you go wrong?
