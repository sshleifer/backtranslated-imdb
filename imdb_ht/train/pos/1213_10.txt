This film contradicts the first one as far as the origins of the Care Bears and the Bear Care Cousins ​​go. I will not refuse it. However, if you look at "Part II" as a separate movie, then it's a very good movie. I remember watching this in the early 80's (with fitting of his targeted audience targeted then), and absolutely loved it more than the first movie (not that I did not enjoy one too, it's just that this one seemed to have a little something extra in it). Be sure to be darker than the first one, but perhaps maybe that's why it's so good. And it's dark in deeper manner subtle ways too (that kids can not fully understand but can still be somewhat scary because of the atmosphere it provides, and adult watching will surely get faster as I have now watched this movie again now in mid-twenties) where you basically have a young girl make a deal with a devil / devil in exchange for something else. Find the picture? But simply watching that as a child, make sure I said he could be a little scared, but there is nothing traumatic. In fact, if anything he gave me another fantasy game I could play when I was older. I can not tell you how many times I used to pretend black heart wanted in my prison, make me help him take the Care Bears, tried to make me turn to his dark side, and stuff like that etc. So this movie was also good for my imagination. And it also got its high emotional toll. I used to look at her at least once a week. <br /> <br /> Also, Hadley Kay was the perfect choice for the voice of black heart (I still think it and I'm still). <br /> <br /> <br /> Now it's just too bad that they're never making a band available. Sometimes I just want to hear growing up without looking at the movie, as good as it is. <br /> <br /> "What good is love and care if it can not save it?"
