Why not? I kind of think it must be a little garbage since it was not. How bad a girl can be! This movie is, in a word, enthralling. <br /> You will be captivated. It keeps your attention from the start and its speed never slows down. The final part of the movie, the "episode" as it (not to give anything away, you saw that in the trailer) is also incredible. You will choose a favorite, you will be shocked, you can go and make a cup of coffee because you need to know what's going on. Adrenaline is up and you can not look. Cudos actors, it's very credible. And do not stop there, they have a final trauma for you. It also makes you reality television questions and if you would look. And how far is this, really? Endemol (making big fees) makes a TV show in Holland last year offering a dead woman to death patients who need a transplant. The show was revealed in the end to be a fake, officially raising awareness of organ donations, but are we getting too close for comfort?
