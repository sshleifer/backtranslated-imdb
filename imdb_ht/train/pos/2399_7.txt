This was a hit at South Film Festival in South By (SXSW) in Austin last year, featuring a fine cast directed by Gloria E. Robinson E.R., and a landscape-grinder John Glover. Though injection on a small budget in NYC, the film looks like fabulous sounds, and takes us on a whirlwind scene of the repetition and mounting of what actors call the "Play in Scottish," as a reference to the word "Macbeth" is thought to bring about the ancient curse of the play. The acting company shows all the emotions of playing in itself, lust, jealousy, rage, suspicion, and a bit of fun as well. The games begin when an accomplished actor (in the role of lead) by a well-known "beautiful figure" of the TV soap TV scene in order to draw larger crowds. The green-eyed monster takes over from there, and the drama unfolds nicely. Fine band, and good performance all around. The DVD includes the principal's and some deleted scenes.
