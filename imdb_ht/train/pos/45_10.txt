Home Room was a great movie if you ever had drama in your life. It keeps you wanting to see more. Ask Alicia the Secret Secret. I think I watched movie 6 times in a row and never lost interest. Plus I usually do not cry about movies, but this one makes me cry every time. I wish I could get more movies like one. All in all I thought it was a great movie. The more you look at it the more you become part of it. The very end is the party that really got me when she cried when getting her diploma, because she had her daughter's name on it. My heart felt as if it had broken just then. And how his new friend came to encourage him when he did not get it anymore. I loved it very much.
