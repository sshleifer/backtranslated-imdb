I took my 10-year-old daughter to see Nancy Drew on the weekend and found me well entertained. The first, it was clean, and I mean by my standards. Most children's movies today are full of bitumen humor and jokes-from jokes giving good laugh out to the pre-young people. Nancy Drew is smarter than that, however, and the humor is subtle and smart. The title role is played by a refreshing vivasness by Emma Roberts, who is tokyo and politely without ever becoming annoying. Unlike the Brady bunch film, where the anachronism characters are jerked and ridiculous, Nancy's style is treated with respect and dignity. It's a great moment when the LA "style-conscious" girls and Paris Hilton streetwalker attire are dismissed by the boutique owner, while Nancy, in her penny penny and homemade butterick pattern, is embraced. This film shuns our-need-to-be-lightening-this-wonderful-girls tack many Hollywood movies to take. Nancy remained true to herself and her values ​​everywhere. <br /> <br /> Mystery is just enough tension at times to be engaged. There were several suspectful moments where my daughter nervously grabbed my arm, but there was no free kick scene. It's all based on tension and mood and is a lot of fun. Throwing in support is a good thing, particularly Marshall Bell as the Guardian premiere. There are some great cameras by Eddie Jemison, Chris Kattan and Bruce Willis and many moments that will make adult smiles. This film deserved more evaluation than some gave it. Not only was I happy not to be dragging yet another computer animated movie where talking animals burp and gasping all over the place, but I was also very entertained. Had I had to be without a child, I would still enjoy the movie. This is one DVD that will have my daughter's name on it under the Christmas tree.
