I have totally agreed with other comments regarding this movie. The visual effects complement the supernatural themes of the movie and do not detract from the plot additionally I liked how this move was unlike Crouching Tiger because this time the sword action had no strings attached to most At the time you can see the action up close. I think western audiences will be very confused with the two scenes one involving a monk trying to burn himself alive and the other regarding the village singles that it is the end of the world. The scenes mentioned are derived from certain interpretations of Mahayana Buddhist texts (Mahayana Buddhists can be found in China, Korea and Japan) and the other stage deals with a cirque of the Japanese calendar ... those who are back then really thought that the world would come to an end ... Gojoe has the story, story and visual of fascinating any viewer. I strongly believe that with some skilled editing it can be sold in the US One of my complaints in the last battle scene (I can not give anything away - sorry).
