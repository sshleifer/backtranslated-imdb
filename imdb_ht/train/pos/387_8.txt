This movie is good. It's not the best of great CG kung fu flicks but its nice. The first thing first, the story is actually good. The whole idea of ​​God vs Fall Deal deals with God and super power is very cool. My problem is to have too many characters! It was very confusing when it changed the scene! The special effects were incredible! The fighting scenes were very fast and complex. This movie practically all computers have produced. The act is superb, as always hoping in these high profile players. Ekin Cheng makes an excellent protagonist, character stretched. Zhang Ziyi did nothing to me in this movie. I thought he would have a bigger part but he made a single battle scene with a whole lot of yapping. The bad guy, all the skull army and all these black clouds is very scary. The music is excellent. For me this story deserves at least one mini-series and not just one movie. So too much history wrinkled in 2 hours. Perhaps if there was a book or something, I would be able to keep up with all the characters and details. This film sacrificed history integrity for action. I gather storm rider on this any day.
