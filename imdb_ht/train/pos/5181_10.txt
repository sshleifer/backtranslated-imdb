I enjoy this movie in general, but four things really stand out: Sam Raimi's perfect perfect and performance as the handheld (?) Person, Alan Arkin's features of the camp owner, and the best of all, the cinematography. The beautiful golden tone of the exterior scene draws me to films like a sunset in the lakeshore to draw me into my own summer memories. The dialogue and attitude feel very natural and credible. Some reviews criticize the lack of a "script" more. For me, it is exactly the lack of doing this movie work. Characters and problems seem like real and therefore I care about what's going on. <br /> <br /> The bottom line is that all parties come together to create a whole feel good.
