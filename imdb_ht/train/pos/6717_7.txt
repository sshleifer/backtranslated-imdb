This documentary was very good and exposed, and at the same time entertaining, which I thought was rather impressive. I felt as though they had done a very good job covering the sport from its origins until present day, but there is a reason I did not give such a high score to this movie ... <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />) I felt as though the documentary had more to do with the nature of the sport, ideology of the sport, etc. it would be best (although this course was covered, I do not think it got time as it justified). <br /> There are so many people who are not absolutely black on surfing, at times heard on and on specific sides and specific surfers can become boring. Although the video clip and the in-depth search is well-respected, it might have been presented in a way that would be best for those who do not surfer surfers. <br /> <br /> In addition, my biggest disappointment was at times being talked about how amazing and miraculous certain events in browsing history were still not having the actual footage of these events unfolding, and all the time you are waiting to see on this amazing screen, this breath-taking event that these boys are talking about as time-changing times, and in the end all you get is a lot of people talking about it, and not the actual footage. It was too tantalizing myself to hear these stories, and then be able to see them. I understand difficulty finding footage of everything, but please: do not make a great event up, and do not show it. <br /> Overall, a very cool documentary that I loved watching; Not the best documentary due to the above reasons, but being very cool and having some very interesting feet and a good soundtrack, it is a documentary that I would advise everyone to check out.
