This movie is one of my favorite. It's hard to explain why. Perhaps it's innocent of Corin Nemec and his discomfort is awesome with the conviction of Cheryl Pollak, but he definitely has something to do with the band. Also, some of the characters have small lines or movements or moments that are fun in and in themselves. Finally, the story is one that always tugs into my heartstrings, and the last scene is so worn out. All in all, I love this movie; It's perfect for a gooey, sentimental night.
