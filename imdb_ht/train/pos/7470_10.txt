I went to see vanilla sky with a big, big, big !! .. Tom Cruise fan, my extremely mynik friend and my girlfriend ... what I can say .. I was totally hauled by the film and especially the TC performance, I thought it was a very moving movie and it was not 'of all I expected. <br /> I've read reviews and have decided not to go and see it, I'm so happy that I've been 'coerced' to see it. The strange thing I can not tell why, all I can say is that I get it totally involved and could not stop thinking about it the next day. As for what I felt about the movie, all I can say about is, is not the story (fantasy, psychodrama, regardless) it's about people and events that shape their lives and how little events, such as getting into a Cars can change everything ...... <br /> <br /> As the critics have written, yes maybe the original was a stunning 2th film for Alejandro Amen√°bar, but this was a totally different interpretation of the subject , and does not mean a narcissistic reminder for the benefit of Tom Cruise and Penelope Cruz. <br /> I can not even consider writing a couple of sentences, glibby phrases to describe the movie just to go and see it !!!! <br /> Yes I know this is not a balanced refinement but this is not the kind of movie.
