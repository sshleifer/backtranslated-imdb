I guess every time I see one of those old movies out of the 80's and put me back in a simpler time, no matter how corny they can look like today. This movie is good. I remember seeing it as a kid and thinking it was the greatest movie ever. It has all the heroic characters that a young cowboy wants to do. Now, as an adult, I can look back and laugh and still feel sad, but this time I actually know what's going on. I found one thing weird. How many people can move to Houston and hook up with Sissy, get married, move on to a trailer, have a fall out, scam, have an untimely death, then come back together, all in the course of a month? Only in America.
