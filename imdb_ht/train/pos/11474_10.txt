This movie is one for ages. First, I said after seeing this once, he became one of my favorite ever-movies. Why? Simple; Ben Coccio (writer, director) has put together a true piece of art. Where 99.9% of these cinemas are purely entertainment, director Ben Coccio gives us the truth, gives us realities, gives us a tool to learn why this happened. The mainstream media turns and turns, but Ben Coccio seems to shoot the right school in the face, unable to go where there is no other form of media ever before, in the minds and hearts of two young men planning to kill their classmates. While it surely is graphic and anxious, how could not it be? The gloves are out, lies and the sugar layer of our media meter is rubbed sideways and we are taken to a place where we can find truth in what happened. Sometimes it's not just a loose loop like everyone loves to think, no, sometimes hate and insulate them deeper, they are more human, we are showing that these boys are us and ours. Society left behind and the consequences are terrible and real. <br /> <br /> Respect and love your fellow man. A lesson we all should learn, thank you very much for doing this movie by Mr. Coccio, I hope with great anticipation that you will continue to film your film career.
