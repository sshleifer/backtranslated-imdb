Gandhi, the Great: <br /> <br /> Granite in the world associated with people like the great Alexanader, the Ashoka Great for the magnitude to lie in being glorified as more than humans. Gandhi is called great for actually not being a great, but being more human, because I still believe that bringing humanity to us is where the magnitude of human lies.Gandhi was a human and humanity with someone who made a lot of effort Humanity is ready to succumb himself to the battle for mankind, but not to his enemies. Let me go to the movie review now. About My Grandpa Gandhi: <br /> My grandfather Gandhi is a film not on Gandhi, but about his son Harilal Gandhi. On the story of a son whose father was one of the greatest men in this landmark, the director succeeds in displaying the story. The film succeeds in telling the story of a deceased son of a father who leads a great nation. The film appealed as a critic of Gandhi's failure as a son to her, I prefer to say that she is in a Gandhi sacrifice made as a father of a son of justice as a father of a nation. <br /> I wish the essence of this movie is not only in India, Gandhian country, but in the hearts of all this people in the world. <br /> The true human gandhi. Yes.
