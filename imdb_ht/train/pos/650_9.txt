A great movie, rather difficult than really fun. Unfortunately, there are no memorable quotes here, but that's my favorite thing: Alexandre: If you're leaving someone you love, you must say what I'm telling you now: "Farewell, I'm going." But they disappear, hide like a criminal, is ignoble. (did not look at it with the English translation) <br /> <br /> In my opinion, this is the expression it all. There are many tactics involving the relationship between Alexandre and others, and yet everyone longs for a little more truth. However, knowing truth can hurt even more, as Alexandre experiences. Common interpretation is that the film criticizes the only possibility of "liberating love" by describing the unwanted implications of those involved. It does, indeed, shows this in a compelling way, but I would appreciate it if the reason was treated a bit more in depth: it's not what liberated love is in itself ending in failure, but people ( especially men, I think) should work on themselves and try to overcome the prevailing moral morale and not to practice liberating love. <br /> <br /> That said, realistic movie though and really worthwhile watching.
