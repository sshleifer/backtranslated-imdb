Canadian creator Mary Harron is a cultural film that has films before performing some artistic exercises in the sixties and the low-Eighties. With "Notorious Bettie Page" he spotted his eyes in Fifties America, a cloaked era of the moral justice of Joe McCarthy, while experiencing a sexual awakening that would result in the free love of the next decade. Harron and his co-writer Guinevere Turner are clearly not interested in the standard biopsy of an unknown symbol. This is a movie about the underground icon in an era and how his sexuality more unashamed reveals both the predatory instincts and bad thoughts in an intact culture by the beauty of a naked body. If the details of Bettie's life the whole movie was concerned about, then why end it before the most tragic period it was about to begin. Clearly, Harron is more interested in America's attitude toward sexual imagery then and now. Along with a fearless lead performance by Gretchen Mol and the atmospheric atmospheric sinograms of W.Mott Hupfel III, he accomplishes this marvelous goal, keeping up a mirror in the past while making the audience examine their own "enlightened" 21th mood century towards this so-called pornography. As America suffers from a new conservatism, this is a movie that needs more than ever.
