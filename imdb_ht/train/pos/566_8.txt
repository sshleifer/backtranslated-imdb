Cunningly interesting West from a director who had some peers in the genre. Much like Anthony Anthony's photos, the country is far mixing a pot boiling pot pot and a well-known adroit of landscape scenery. Both of which play out amongst some of the peccadilloes man in honor, integrity, betrayal and of course, death! The story is seen by Fortune Hunt partner Jeff Webster {James Stewart} and Ben Tatum {Walter Brennan} traveling to Oregon Territory and a herd of cattle. Aware of the golden-boom flower, they plan to make a private profit selling their animals in a town of Klondike. Arriving at Skagway is found by the law enforcement officer named Mr. Gannon {John McIntire} ready to meet Webster's justice on Webster's account that has been violating the law, all for him and honestly, on the road. In Gannon's punishment the pigs partner in hand, but they stole them back and head through Canadian Dawson-Gannon and his men in hot pursuit. Here are beautiful women and a city that is flattering and without law will fill the destinations of all involved. <br /> <br /> Interesting to begin ending, the country has far more benefits from James Stewart's bombardment of the {anti} hero waiting to paint with the gilded Man Man in securing the Borden Chase script. The camera from William H. Daniels is supreme, does not favor any actual DVD imagery, and the movie has a few surprises and a "will read it?" The core refreshes the viewers. Paying dividends on re-watches for exercise genre fans, it always remains something of an essential look for first ventured timers in the wonderful, yet dark, Western world of Anthony Mann and James Stewart. 8/10
