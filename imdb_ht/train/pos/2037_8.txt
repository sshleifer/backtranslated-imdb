Christopher Smith is an obvious horror fanatic and this is made clear in his horror 'Creep' horror. 'Creep' although a little loose on information, proves herself worthy of a classical classic gor. A little less brilliant than the recent Americans (Amityville horror rumors, Home of Remy Waxes) this dark story and the wonderful things go Kate (Franka Potente) through the maze of underground tunnels and chaos mess as it, and a number of others on the road, try and run a murderous attacker. Though some bad reviews have been looking for this movie, I really believe on a tight budget and for a UK production from Smith's first time director who 'Creep' really lives up to its name. It delivers fast-paced action gory more or less from the beginning, sometimes too fast that the story is patchy in some areas, but with a perfect location and best-response-in-the-end character I've seen in a small Time, 'Creep' delivers some scenes that definitely the thing of nightmares.
