I hope something different: more passion, drama ... Again another failed attempt of originality. I'm sorry to say that the movie falls into the old clich√© of 'cheesiness'.15 year old teens can appreciate it though the act was not very compelling with common lines, missing any wit. Remain, the sound was good and well suited. I can not say that this movie is a total flop because people watch it but it did not meet the public expectations and the flow of mediocrity. So, in conclusion, the production keeps you in front of the TV for almost an hour and a half, which is a great thing. So, I guess worth it to see if you Do not get annoyed
