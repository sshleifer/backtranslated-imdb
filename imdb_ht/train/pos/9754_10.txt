This Ann Raggedy and Andy movie are so adorable. We like to watch Ann and Andy singing and dance, along with the camel and the ride knees. This film is what made the camel and the shore knees so popular, singing it, "I nobodies I love you". If you like Raggedy Ann and Andy Watch the movie and you will see why it's a movie, kids and adults!
