Bertrand Blier is indeed l 'awful babies in French movies and in the seventies he could still shock the public. Filmed with her defective duo (Depardieu and Dewaere) and the usual dose of sex (Miou-Miou plays his typical role, at least one from the sixties as little we might know that a decade later it would be the best French actress all the time) . The first "Les Valseuses" is also one of the first Roadmovies as the viewer is just taking off some trips to two criminals. People only meet with family life, or simply know nothing more, the movie should be quite a shocker but this movie is more than just that, it just leaves you thinking of all the usual things in life ( working for the car, being limited to work etc.). It is a sort of critical towards the hypocrite society we live in. Great work and it just makes you want to do things: Dewaere has died just too young as it was a topactor and of course Depardieu, it would be best to should have to stick to French movies as it proves here that no one can beat it. Timeless classic and 20 years later it will still be some shock.
