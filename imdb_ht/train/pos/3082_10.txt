What is really sad, shows as the six Degrees and Brothers & Sisters are the true reality TV, not that garbage that has nothing more than glorified toys. I think the swell ground of dissatisfaction has been there for the past few years and many too early to cancel in many shows and a cult track. But with the more vocal vocalists in Jeriko (which I am loving) and other shows, networks can begin to reverse this trend. I'm like other people, I will not support any new shows until they were given a second season. I will then be able to make a decision to look and catch up through the DVD and online watch. Until then ABC, you've lost me as a viewer for any new show.
