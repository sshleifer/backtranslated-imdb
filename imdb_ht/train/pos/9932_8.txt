If you go to this movie waiting something not, you'll be ashamed, just like any movie. This film has what Hemmingway has described as the "iceberg effect". On the surface, simply its a cache of film movie movie smashing together to make a movie. If this should be written in a book, it would be a short story, because the action of the movie is very fast paced, and unless you actually try to catch it, the reasoning behind the plot (along with some subtle preferences) can be pretty well than you do not. Definitely a movie you will have to see twice in order to fully appreciate. Cinematography experience describes this film. The camera-work and post production adds much to the overall taste of the movie, making it quite artistic at some point and opening to the interpretation of others (something to be desired in American movies as the end). Although, in some parts it can get a little raunchy, gruesome and too heavy for some audiences, the film never becomes completely unrealistic. The only aspect of the movie that I would write in as "improvement needs" is the Soundtrack selection. There is no movie that is good without a band fitting, and although the band is quite fitting, the opening is a little too long, and the other rap songs in the movie really might have been replaced with something more proper (heavy, grungy stone or psychedelic electronics would make this movie a real trip). The flood of imagery and dynamics ... color palette adds another "artistic" aspect to it, also combined with the events that occur throughout the movie, this is not a movie you can miss any part and always understand. However, which also makes it much more of a desirable film to watch, and not one you will quickly get bored. 8.5 / 10
