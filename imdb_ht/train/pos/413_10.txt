Make sure this movie is not historically accurate but it's great fun. Most DeMille pictures especially the later epics are slow and plodding but the action here moves into a clip. The story is basically a series of top and very little moments. The action takes us from an American attack on a cabin; one of the best parts of the movie with Jean Arthur excellent while trying to appease the war-painted natives. This was followed by his and Cooper being taken to the war camp and being tortured. Later came an extensive battle with the Cheyenne. Everything is ridiculous but great fun and entertaining from start to finish. Jean Arthur is one of the best actresses of this era and it shines here.
