This latest Dutch movie speaks of Verhooven makes me laugh well. As a movie scrub looking for all the details and cross references etc. in any movie I can assure anyone interested in film art that this piece amuses all their senses. I do not read Gerard Reves's book, on which the movie is based, but I still believe we find a picture of a slightly self-titled poet / writer who gets it (in a way - there is no spoiler here ). An anti-hero surrounded by characters whose intended limits, as it were. All this in a superbly packed video, Paul Verhopven managed to turn their place rather beautifully "singer (?)" To the Dutch in a movie movie movie movie, impressive work!
