This is definitely one of the biggest Disney movies ever performed. It's a real pleaser for anyone. It will make you laugh, it will make you cry, and it will put you in suspense. <br /> <br /> Basically, what Homeward Bound is about is three pet who is sent to live on a farm while their masters go on vacation. They do not know what's going on, and desperately want to go home, they escape from the farm and try to find their way home to the desert. <br /> This is one of the latest movies that Don Ameche starred in. He gave the voice in shadow, the old retriever, the wisdom and the golden friendship. Also starting in this movie was Sally Gardens giving the voice of sassy, ​​the Himalayan cat. But seriously, what this film is all about is lucky! Voice by Michael J. Fox (my all-time favorite actor), odds are basically all you would expect of a dog, lovable, playful, energetic and jumpy, and every time I crack up when watching movies that's because of luck; It's like the comedy never ends! <br /> <br /> This movie is also very sad many times. It sometimes reminds people at times that you were alone or when they lost their pets. <br /> A scene that always puts me in suspense is the stage where the trio tries to escape from the book; I especially feel shocked in the party where luck gets her necklace caught in the fence and almost does not do it. The film had other suspended moments, but no one seemed more suspicious than that one. <br /> In general, it's a wonderful family movie. If you enjoyed this movie, you'll probably enjoy the end as well. I give this movie a 9 solid out of 10!
