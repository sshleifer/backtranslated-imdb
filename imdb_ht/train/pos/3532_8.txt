Scott Henderson, the engineer who engages Carol Richman, as his assistant, makes a point called it "Kansas", every time he talks to it. It shows us that Carol, who effectively plays by Ella Raines, is supposed to be a babe in the woods, as far as Manhattan in the 40s was concerned. Only a woman, from the city, would follow the shadow bartender on a private elevated train. Even so, only a naive girl can embark on an adventure. Robert Siodmak directed this fine noir movie. It shows a flair for the story's infusion and a lot of raw sex that was surprising for those days. How else can we justify the way the drummer in the orchestra of the music, where Scott takes the mysterious woman with a strange hat, make such a bra bra in a lady on a date? The drummer played with high voltage by Elisha Cook Jr. Do not hide his desires for any of the ladies sitting in the front row of the hit music where he plays. It was a real explicit invitation, first of the "ghost woman" in the story, Fay Helm; Then the cliff drummer, insinuates herself very openly Ella Raines who goes to the disguised theater as the boss Dame her work took originally. This is a movie that will hook any viewer from the beginning. There is something not explained in it, but it keeps one's interest at all. The assassin is not revealed until the end. <br /> <br /> Ella rain and eye expression she was an estimated actress. It keeps its own against more experienced actors. Franchot Tone, a New York stage actor, working in Hollywood, has never been found in this mediocre's name. It's as effective as best friend's accused. On the other hand, Alan Curtis, comes across as a man, who when framed, accepts his fate and is saved only by the tenacity of the woman who secretly loves her. Thomas Gomez, as Inspector Burgess, is an advantage in the film as a detective whose doubts the police had held the man who committed the crime. <br /> <br /> This movie will not disappoint.
