I have a feeling of musicians Depression Warers Bros-era will become a lot more important in the next couple of years. Yes, we are in the economic doldrums (or you've been living under a rock) and times look weak. But we still have these films as a way to save our problems. In the 30's, film-gone was largely popular even at the height of gloom economy. "Footlight Parade (1933)" was one movie like the audiences gathered. While Lloyd Bacon-led music does not quite take away social problems at the moment as "Gold Diggers in 1933 (1933)" does, it's still a wonderful showcase of talent. We have to wait until the end of the movie for three men Busby Berkely Extravaganza, but boys are worth waiting for me. Yes, Little Ruby Keeler is a terrible singer and actress, and typing it so-so but Busby's magic "not a cascade" whisks him, and what seems to be a hundred other choral girls, in a dizzying dwarf ginger . Of course, busy numbers can never really occur on a scene (they challenge gravity, for one thing), and they are contrasted terrifically and realistically in the scenes, with non-musical senses that are difficult. And "Footlight" also had James Cagney in one of his over-the-counter musicals (really, what could not the man do?). She even had to take from the leading men, donate cakes and swag on Shanghai Lil sex (who is really little Ruby in China-girl wigs!) She co-stars with Joan Blondell, her adorable, worshiping secretary Cagney somehow donated in favor of other women (until the final bowl, that is). Apparently Blondell was the only other woman that Cagney loved apart from his wife. And you can see the mutual worship of each scene.
