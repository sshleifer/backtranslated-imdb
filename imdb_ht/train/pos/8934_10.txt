Two things haunt you at all L'Intrus (The Intruder): who is the hack and is a movie or a dream you are watching? The end is so shocking that for a while you are at a loss for a response to either of these questions. The intruder appears as different characters, different men in different instances that are not part of the scene, so they are out of it, sweet or brutal, but often without emotional involvement. The main character, Louis, is a contemptible person. It has rough ways, some work means and does not have a heart. He needs one and goes after it. He has a heart transplant and then decides to start a new life. Will this man succeed in his quest for redemption? A guy like that would cut your throat in the drop of a hat. You know it but Claire Denis does not urge you to judge him. Occasionally, there is a young Russian woman - a pretty girl who looks somewhere between heaven and earth - who judges her. It can even be punished. But by Denis. There's the character playing by Beatrice Dalle who wants no business with him: do not touch me, he says. But Denis allowed the man to himself, his film in his self-absorbed quest. I do not know if it's film is the heart or the spirit, but not the fundamental conspiracy of the traditional. Whatever it's movie, you get it to the end. You know who's the "hackers, you know why, more or less, and some scenes come back to yourself and their full meaning. But was it a movie or a dream?
