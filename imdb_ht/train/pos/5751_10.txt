What can I say about this movie? I saw it quite a few times since the first time I was around 6. I saw the English version and it's done pretty well. It's a great movie for all ages, but it's more direct to the kids. I love the kids humor and appreciate it. If you have not seen it, you should try to rent a copy, you will not be disappointed!
