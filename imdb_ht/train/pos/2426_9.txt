"Once in Life" is a very good movie. However it is not good for everyone, due to the extensive use of vulgar language and violence in some of the situations. The film manages to represent an anecdotal, "life-style" belief in the neighborhood of New York City where drug problems are important. Describing this is in turn used as the decor for a most thoughtful drama and suspense backed up by powerful dialogues (however I had a difficult time understanding some of them because English is not my mother tongue .. On her video OK). There is a little device sometimes, but I think it fits well into the overall orientation of Fishburne gave the film, which provides subjects for reflection more than just being a good style exercise, notably in the time management / action management. Characters, though not simple, are easy to relate to and actors perform a fine job of imitating them. By the way I enjoyed the band (B. Marsalis). If you are not too prudent, you should enjoy seeing that movie once, twice, three times. I rated the movie 9/10.
