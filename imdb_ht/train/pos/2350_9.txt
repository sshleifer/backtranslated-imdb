I for one was versa enjoying every episode of Pushing Daisies this season, and hoping that the strike writers will not be brutally finished their start at a very good show. Ned is a pie maker who owns a restaurant in the middle of town and has a secret talent. Emmerson is a private investigator who has her own unique career as her love in knitting. Charlotte (Chuck) is the once-dead-but-not-yet-friendly friend and sunny place in Ned's life. Olive is the waitress, but good-hearted waitress. Oh, and add the dog. Jim Dale brings all the characters along with his beautiful narration to the show. Chuck, Ned, and Emmerson along with Olive and occasionally the dog solves multiple murderous mysteries and assistance in Ned's special gifts to bring people back to life. The show is funny, clean, and romantic in a very nice and good-hearted way, and I would recommend it to anyone.
