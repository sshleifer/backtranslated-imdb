Better than the made-to-television movie, the HELL invitation is blessed with excellent casting (Urch, Luksi, Cassidy, McCarthy, Pre-Murphy Brown Joe Regalbuto, Sun Moon Frye) and a high-accredited Faustian plot concept. Urch is likable as always with Lucci is particularly sought and devilishly on the head of the mother in all femme femme roles. Types of a hybrid version of STEPFORD WIVES and LIVE, the movie commits early in its apocalyptic Miltonesque vision and horror fans will likely not have many complaints until soppy, maudlin denoument. 7/10
