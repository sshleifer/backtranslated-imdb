Thre is not a single Scorsese movie I'd put on a list of my favorite movies. But this is the best thing I've been running in my DVD player over about five years. Scratching the elimination puzzles at the favorite movie time, and how Hollywood works is extremely merciful, calm and intelligent. <br /> It's 3 DVD-locations worth of materials. It should be a British production, since everything about American corporate culture has been trampled thoroughly, methodically, there is no header, the focus-on-content approach that has been taken here. And an American production would say he liked only movies that were popular favorites. I wish everyone took a page of his love in movies. You should love the movies you make for personal, interesting and specific purposes. Not only more "May-too" vote for the godfather, etc. People have no signs that the ideas were explored in their favorite movies. If they did, movies would be more fun than them. Scorsese says that the ideas are exploring, and that makes him a compelling, involving speakers on the topic. I really appreciate its articulates, generating interviews over the last decade. On a negative note, Scorsese is best when it is excited to show you some dark film, rather than when teaching you something well-established on movie history. And I want to pull out these three hairs from the bridge to his nose. It's very distracted.
