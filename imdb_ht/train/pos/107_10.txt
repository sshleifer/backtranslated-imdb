Lars Von Triers Europa is a very good movie. How is that? From Trier there is a highly stylized way of telling a story, at least with Europe. For me the movie was all an experience though I saw it on a small TV screen. Even with all the tricks, in my opinion, this movie is the most complete, REAL and moving pieces of movies then most of the movies on the top 250 list. I think it is perhaps more hideous, the most gothic movie and completes around. All right there are other good too, but this one is my favorite. The final scene is one of the most exciting scenes ever.
