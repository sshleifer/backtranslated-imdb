Although a water jerk it is definitely a "feel good" movie. All actors were excellent with Will Smith as always, doing the job and doing it well. I could go on hand picking any ten of the "10" ratings and saying it as well and much better than I could. <br /> But since I have to have at least 10 lines for posting a comment I'll say that Rosario Dawson was widely unknown to me as a viewer. His performance was more enjoyable and I looked forward to seeing it in many films coming up. <br /> AK, this film demonstrates that Will Smith has nothing more to prove in terms of his ability as an actor.
