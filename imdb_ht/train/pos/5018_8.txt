if you are like me then you will like this great coming at age movie.i teen thinks it is standing there with harm / book of love / high school usa / call / girl calendar / crybaby / All the big movies set in the early 50s and 60s early and have a wonderful soundtrack.not like many songs as in some of these kind of movies but still great.it is all very funny at times and has an interest dear.all the young cast is great.I want to have been more kind of these wonderful movie cinemas. My favorite of all is back in the future when Marty mcfly goes back in 1955 well in those movies Wonderful thing to stay in the Fab 50s (early 60s) has some movies in this type of better than this but not much.
