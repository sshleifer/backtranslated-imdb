Another person for the Babes & Bullets crowds. The story is more edgy than any other music I've seen: cannon hides up the missing legs of women and puts each generatively on the other in a way that comes closer to smart comments than we might expect locally. More effective than contemporary 'drama.' It is difficult to identify with a woman holding a cannon up his pants - in luggage luggage. Very remarkable if you consider the context. Despite the cannon up things that ever gave 90% of the surprises, this film also stories as greed supersedes all other considerations in the lives of a yakuzas group who pursues a woman who keeps up her leg a hidden cannon / rocket-launcher (hence no sound group or thongs scene) The hidden-launcher hidden from behind the protagonists back, seemingly in no place, at Miike's Dead or Alive (1999), the torch is carried out by thin air by heroine in the direction of the end of the original Tomie (2000), or the flamingo-incense scene of Sunny Gets Blue (1992), all testified to an almost third-world cantinflas-sculpting influence in the contemporary Japanese cinema, in which I am at a loss explained, but can not complain. <br /> <br /> You will not see the quality of movies in this sense made in Hollywood, it all disappears and the cheap they pump out for a cheap thrill, it's all but ridiculous. This is a true film and while its great in its entirety, the finish is a brilliant, if not dressing rip-off certain photos by Sergio Leon, involving cannons where leg should, and certainly appropriate !
