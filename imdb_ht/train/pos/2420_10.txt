If you enjoy the subtle (yes, I told subtle) action and reaction to John Candy, you can not help but like this movie (pronounced "fillum" by Salvatore DiPasquale). Unobservant (and uninformed) vigilant still sees candy as a great actor - a great buffalo. And sometimes it was (see "Stripes" and "Splash"). But when given the opportunity, it could really be razor-sharp and subtle assets. It's too bad he has been cast in many roles that only show his age, because we will never get to see more of the other. Oh, yes, the movie. One can watch "Go Berserk" over and over (I know I have) and the frequency of "Caddyshack." That's just so good. The plot, although slightly complicated, is actually deep to a farce of this kind. It allows Joe Flaherty's candy and still down-rated and Eugene Levy bounces off of candy ... and they bounce hard. Definitely worth a glimpse for anyone who likes SCTV or other Candy's work.
