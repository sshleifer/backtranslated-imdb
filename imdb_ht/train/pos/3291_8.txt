A great movie of this, with a shame that it will receive little attention from Arthouse circles and students who stay up to two in the morning to watch it on Card Chains. <br /> <br /> The draw is a simple but very effective task, the bomber between fantasy children and hard-hitting nightmares is very disturbing. The budget looks very low, but in the credit of those involved it does not show too often. It also did not date so much either. <br /> I was lucky enough to tape this in the TV when it was about a few years ago, and it has now been demonstrated half-a-dozen look. He is one of those films that will not appeal to all; though as usual, people with a more thoughtful approach to movies would find a lot out of this. Charlotte Buerke puts in a tight performance as Anna, the brat is spoiled and she is a shame she seems to have gone through the act act. Cross is also very good, bringing high in his character very well into the context of the picture. Some really (and I do not say that lightly) disturbing moments in this film, both half second and more tense-out strains. Look at it and light them out! <br /> <br /> Very recommended. <br /> <br /> 9/10 <br /> <br />
