As a human who lived with celandine palsy for more than forty years, I found this film to be inspirational. If someone with a serious case in CP as Christie Brown could do a lot, then there is no reason that I could not realize my own dreams. Daniel Day-Lewis and Brenda Fricker both provide awesome performances. <br /> <br />
