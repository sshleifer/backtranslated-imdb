Saving Grace is a good movie feel with her heart in the right place. Grace recently widows and realized her late husband left her with a lot of debt. He could lose his beautiful home and see no other solution to his misery than to begin growing marijuana. He lives in a beautiful village where most viewers would like to live with the villagers, all the wonderful ones most viewers would like to have as neighbors. There is only one thing wrong with this picture and that is how it portrays the marijuana effect on its user. It is evident by one of the actors or writers of this film actually ever smoked the stuff. The ways in which villagers act after smoking is ridiculous and only supposedly funny. It's precisely in the scenes that are understood to be replaced by English slapstick, and that is a pity of a movie that is no less pretty enjoyable.
