I participated in a small mini production this time when I was 8 at school and my mom bought the video for me. I loved it ever since !! When I was younger, she was singing and spectacular dance sequences that I enjoyed but since I watched it when I got older, I appreciate more fantastic acting with painted characters. Oliver Reed and Ron Moody were brilliant. I can not imagine anyone else playing Bill Sykes or Fagin. Shani Valais' Nancy is the best character for me. She puts it so much for these boys, I think it's like a strong character and her final scene when ... Well, you know ... Always make me cry! Best music in my opinion of all time. It lasted all this time, it will live on for many more years! 11/10 !!
