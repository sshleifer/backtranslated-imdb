I enjoyed this movie again hated it because I wanted to help this guy! I am in my fifties and I have a lot of friends in music business ... who are now trying to become adult .... there are no more fans, groupies, etc etc ... and they have such a tough time adjusting to a regular life ... as seen by the new elements etc. is getting the spotlight ... it is almost like they have to start again ... this movie is a testament to what a lot of The old rokers from the 70's and the 80's are going to now .... and that's where I find the movie sad and depressing.BUT it shows the life of an old rock-abandoned stone and lost- in a credible way. The girl who comes to his disgusting house reminds me of Hollis Maclaren (outrageous) ... and she's only one lady in a movie you'll cheer for. This movie is a must have for the 50's that has seen the rise and fall of bands, who knew their members, and they looked as smart as the bigger rush, and fals popularity. This is a film almost perfect ... .sad but in a positive way .... because of the candles. You must see!
