If the Man in the White Composition was born in America, can not you see either Danny Kaye or Jerry Lewis trying on Sidney Stratton's Alec Guinness for size? This is one of the best of Guinness's movies and certainly one of the best that Ealing Studios in the United Kingdom ever turned out. It's so perfectly suited to the time frame of the new Labor government and society he's trying to build. It's amazing how in times of capital crisis and work can be agreed. <br /> <br /> Guinness Guinness This little little dip in a man obsessed with the idea that he can invent clothes that will never need to clean up, which in fact repel all kinds of foreign affairs to handle the clothes. <br /> It's a persistent bed and it succeeds. Of course the implications have not really been thought of on the type of impact radish like that will be on society. At the end everyone is chasing him down like they would be saved, almost like Peter Lorre from M or Orson Welles in the Stranger or even Robert Newton in Oliver Twist. <br /> It's the brand of a great comedy movie that a potentially serious situation like that pursues as described in some of the serious films I've mentioned can play for laughing. Poor's delicious Guinness is not only white and mosquito repellent, but it becomes like a neon sign. <br /> <br /> Other than Guinness's best performances from Cecil Parker as yet another firefighter OU, Joan Greenwood as his mermaid's daughter and Ernest Thesiger's largest clothing manufacturer in the UK> <br / > <br /> Come to think of it, did Paramount borrow that suit from Ealing and give it to John Travolta for Saturday night?
