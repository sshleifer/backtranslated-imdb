Is it a good idea to use live animals for store store store departments? <br /> No, and here why .... <br /> <br /> In the "Hare Conditioner" sale that Bugs is helping to promote is over and the store manager (Nelson) will transfer it to a new Department: Taxidermy. Of course, objects bugs and fun are starting. <br /> Use almost every department of the store (wearing kids, sports, shoes, costumes, women's napkins - do not ask.), Bugs from top to bottom, even referring to the manager as the "GilderSNEEZE Great" . Even when trapped to the limit of an elevator, Bugs do the best of the situation. Director Jones is on top of his image image as always, as is Blanc (as Bugs, Nuts) and Nelson (The Manager - which sounds like Gildersleeves Mainstays radio - goes to ask your grand parents). <br /> And a mage word of advice: when confronted by a soft-looking woman wants to try on bath towels, always check her ear. <br /> <br /> Ten stars for "Hare Conditioner", the best argument for livestock.
