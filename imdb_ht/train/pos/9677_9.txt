This film looks on the surface to be a movie movie movie movie that parents can regretfully watch with children especially entertained little. The film resembles and is primarily geared towards children yet it does not stop on that level. I watched this movie first as a toddler and found it to be funny, fun, and happy and did not see it again for many years. I watched it again at age 18 and found it to be almost as funny but just as heartwarming and entertaining. This film is very disgruntled and has many messages in real life. This film is an inspirational quest story that is made for children again season in its own right. I recommend this movie to anyone of ages.
