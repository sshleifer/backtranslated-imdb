(No sportsbook, details only draw) I can not understand such hate for this episode. Do you want to watch a bad episode in Smallville? See subterranean - now there's a bag of crap. Tom Welling gives a good performance (I'm not saying very often), and Michael Rosenbaum is great, but it is most of the time. The alternate universe scenario seems realistic. The Martian Manhunter, who first appeared in "Statik", returned and told Clark that the doctor who is the head of the insane asylum where they were caught is actually a Phantom from the Phantom area, and if Clark wants returning to his universe, he must kill him. A great episode in general, and good acting with a decent pace.
