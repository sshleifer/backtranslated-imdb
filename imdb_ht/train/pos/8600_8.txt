There was some hesitation in my part about what this movie has to offer. For starters, the casting did not seem right. Kiefer Sutherland has already done very well in "24" and the preview did not seem to offer anything difficult to him or the audience. Eva Longoria appeared out of place, and the rest did not seem very interesting. When the movie finally ended, I was not completely wrong because I saw a decent comedy that could be best, had the responsible parties to take a little more care to look for the narrative holes and give a little more care in character development. We have seen the threats of this kind before, and made the main conflict more difficult for the writers. As a hearing, we do not want to sit in the same old story again. We want to see something different, be thrilled and entertained. <br /> There is nothing wrong with the casting. From the delicious Kim Kim Sch√∂ninger's first taste. She brings herself with enough grace and sex appeal to make the party memorable. Michael Douglas has been and has done so before. Unfortunately, the president is very much in an entity that does not even care about his fate. Sutherland rehashes her "24" hard guy approach and enough power to make it big enough for the big screen, and Eva does a work beam, as the new. <br /> <br /> Do not expect as many twists and fireworks as some of the classics are established ("North by the Northwest" and "Fugitive" come in mind). Let's expect you out and enjoy the ride for whatever it might be. It's o.k.
