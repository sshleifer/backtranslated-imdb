Warning! Spoilers ahead! <br /> <br /> I saw the German movie, so it might be, that I missed some clues. <br /> <br /> Despite some weaknesses in the draw, it's a movie that came to me. I liked Especially Lexa Doig Acting. Sometimes I got the impression, that he * is * Camille. But I can not stop asking, what happened to the end with Bob, Cassie and baby. I belive, he, after initially placed on Bob, eventually ended his love and regretted what happened to his brother, was forced to lie to him. Otherwise it's a bit strange, that it would bring her baby and love her. It's up to the viewer to decide - and I do not like these endings. Dean Cain was good at all, Eric Roberts .. well, I saw him better, but also worse. <br /> I believe that the film is more an analysis of human relationships and reacts to unexpected situations than a crime story. <br /> <br /> bottom line is, I loved it very much.
