I am a housework writer and assassination Diary is companion rest with everyone - good, neat fun, good humor and nostalgia for the days of the Dick van Dyke show. How innocent we were all (and how innocent is Diagnosis Murder). I particularly enjoyed the episodes and other nostalgia figures like Joe Mannix. The bad guys always get caught, the guys are good to wear. The stars clearly enjoy themselves and have a ball without worrying too badly. <br /> One beef: why were many of the bandits women or at least bitches? Amanda was too dizzy. It's hard to imagine she really carries out anything as rude as an autopsy. <br /> I hope we have not seen the latest of Dick Van Dyke and family on our screens, esp. at lunchtimes !!
