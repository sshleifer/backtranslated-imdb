JÃ¶rg Buttgereit goes a little too far with his movies and the liver theme, even for my taste, but his movies are always something special and difficult to classify. They are artfully made, and often deeper meaning in its terms. This movie is a perfect example of its work. It is also really difficult to label this film. It's not really a movie and a story, in a sense of having a start, middle and ending it. It also does not have a primary character but rather focuses on 7 different suicides and killings, over 7 different days. <br /> <br /> All different stories have been said and many classes, though some of them are of course more 'interesting' and realistic than others. They do not necessarily connect but still tell a story. The movie does not feel disjointed at all. All different stories have a different feel about it and Buttgereit tells the story without hardly using any word (also typical of his style) but instead allows the images and obvious sensitive tender of the characters to tell the whole story. It helps to make this movie one effective to watch. Again, the value of their outputs is not too high and this could be something that could scare off some people. It however helps to make this film in particular to put the right tune and atmosphere to the entire movie with its dark, disturbing and depressing themes. <br /> A buttgereit movie that I 'enjoy' watching. <br /> <7/10
