Dana Andrews is one of those actors that I was probably seen in a dozen films, but never really registered for me. Often stolid, ratify, play the same type of role and look somewhat like Glenn Ford's symmetry too, it is an actor who takes some really appreciated efforts; but once you hit the right movie .... <br /> And this is it. The first look at New York's Looker is as dirty and seduced as just about any 50's noir, and Andrews is in her element as too difficult cop Dixon Mark who just does not know how to play the game to get ahead: she hated too many criminals always played by the rules. Earlier in the film, he accidentally killed the witness of a murder involving an illegal game illustrated by a mobster who Dixon hated for personal reasons, and spent the rest of the movie trying to cover up his involvement and bring the mobster its kind of "justice". Along the way, she gets involved in the fashionable wife of the man he killed (Gene Tierney) and also has to try to find her father in the hook for the murder. <br /> <br /> Stunningly photographed by Joseph LaShelle, with tough and brilliant dialogue by Ben Hecht and a really powerful finish with elements of tragedy and found favor in just a minute or two, this is another noir for the ages and might be my favorite Preminger movie so far - it's all the bit as good as Laura's more-announced.
