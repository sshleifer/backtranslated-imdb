One of the most unheralded tasks in animation. Even though it makes the most sophisticated use of "off-out" methods of animation (the "South Park"), the real talent behind "Twice over a Time" is the vocal characterization, and the Lorenzo Music (Carlton Out on the television "Rhoda") Woody Allen is the Ralph-all-bi-beast being the centerpiece. The "Nightmare Secrets" crash is questionable one of the best pieces of animation ever filmed.
