There is no relationship at all between Fortier and profiler but the fact that both are police enforcement agencies. Profiles seem crispy, fossils look like classic. Profile of the cemeteries is quite simple. The Fortier's draws are far more complicated ... Fear looks more like First suspect, if we have in place similarity ... The main character is weak and weirdo, but there is "clairvoyance". People love to compare, judge, evaluate. How about just enjoying? Funny things too, the writers of Fury look like Americans but, on the other hand, argue they prefer American series (!!!). Perhaps it's the language, or the spirit, but I think this series is more English than Americans. By the way, the actors are really good and funny. The act is not superfluous at all ...
