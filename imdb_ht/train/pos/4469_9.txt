Generally musical in the 1940s was in a series of formulas - and if you study your movie you know what I'm talking about - a certain running run, very "tin" performance that was great on the surface but never got up to the real personalities in the character etc. <br /> <br /> This is one different - with best light and well worth its nomination for best photos of the year - 1945 (although there was no chance to beat the winner Eventually - Weekend Objects). /> <br /> Gene Kelly was probably in the best form of his career - yes I know about "Americans in Paris" and "Singing in the Rain". This is different. She really gets into her character in a "Wolf Wolf" think (at first) that "picking up any girl while on leave" is nothing more than a bark. And if you made up a "story" to get it - so be it - until. Clowns like the Musical Man when he becomes "his feet caught by the door". The hilarity eventually in the movie stems mainly from her and her new (Sinatra) in attempt to make the "good story" in order to "get the girl" that she really and unexpectedly falls in love with. You will have to see the movie to see what I mean. Besides that there are many other great movie elements in this one, it's a good story, Nostalgia at a time when WWII was almost over (the war ended about a month after release of film), a realization of a guy which always laughs in life can find that it really is a great person to have, great singing and probably a few other elements of the classic movie that I can not think of now. <br /> Why not a 10? Near the end - at almost 2 1/2 hours start to feel temporary. There is a small balloon number that Gene Kelly does to be a sensation in 1945 but seems dated and feels like it just adds minutes now. But in general, this is a definite winner on each level.
