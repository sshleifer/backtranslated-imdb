I really liked this Summerslam due to looking at the terrain, the curtains and just looking in general was interesting to me for some reason. Anyways, this could be one of the best summerslam ever if the WWF did not have Lex Luger in the main event against Yokozuna, now for it when he was ok a big man fat vs a strong man but I'm glad the times have changed. It was a terrible event just like every match Luger is in terrible. Other matches on the map were razor Ramon vs Ted Dibiase, Steiner Brothers vs. Heavenly Bodies, Shawn Michaels vs. Curt Hening, this was the event where Shawn was named his great monster in a body diamond guard, IRS vs. 1 -2-3 Kid Bret Hart first took over Doink then took over Jerry Lawler and things with the Harts and Lawler were always very interesting, then Ludvig Borga destroyed Marty Jannetty, Undertaker took over Giant Gonzalez in a The other terrible match, the Gunns Smoking and Tatanka took over Bam Bam Bigelow and the Headshrinkers, and Yokozuna advocates the world title against Lex Luger match that was boring and has a terrible ending. However it deserves 8/10
