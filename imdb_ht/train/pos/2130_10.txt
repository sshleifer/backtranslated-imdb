A wonderful movie, full of great understated performance and sharp, intelligent dialogue. What really distinguishes the movie, however, is that undercurrent of sadness at all. The story is stressed by artifacts, loneliness, suicide, deception, fear of losing jobs in a world where there has been disaster consequences. Most of it was put into a world that does not exist, being torn apart by the beginning of World War II. In fact, the film is barely a comedy at all if you compare the percentage of serious scenes in the comic scene. But her comedy is - listen to Margaret Sullivan's intruder at Jimmy Stewart and watch her pained expression as she replies that her comments were a remarkable mix of poetry and warranty. It's funny, pointing, and sad all at once. A remarkable success with one of the top 10 screen candles made.
