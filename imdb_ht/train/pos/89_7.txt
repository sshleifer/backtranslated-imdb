To be honest, I had no idea what this film was about when I started reading it. So I watch movies whenever possible. No preconception. I thought this was going to be a movie about stoners in the woods or something. I was wrong, kind. <br /> Charge was kind of boring first but once he started to get it he really tuned me. I know feel they are sucked into a dangerous place where you feel helpless but doing things that you do not want to do. <br /> Another user commented on how this movie was funny and implausible but I begged differently. These kinds of things happen. I'm sorry, but not everyone lives in a dream world where nothing bad can happen and crazy situations are "implausible". Really sorry but the reality of the world is that they happen to happen. The creator of this film as well as actors have done a great job in showing how things can just go wrong and how people can make really bad choices. Sometimes things turn out well, sometimes they turn out bad and that's life. <br /> I highly recommend this movie.
