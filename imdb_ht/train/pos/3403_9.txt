Gorgeous Techicolor production tells the weird story of the romance between a woman of strong religious faith and a monk Trappist who left her monastery, breaking his vows. The film opens in a convent in Europe, where an alumni prays - a solitary beauty of black named Domini (Marlene Dietrich). He is advised of the Superior Mother to go to the desert and "find himself" and lose his grief over his father who has recently died. In the subway car on the road in the Sahara it sits opposite a very, troubled man (Charles Boyer) - our former brown. It's soon in a hotel near a palm-tread oasis where he saw our mysterious troubled man as it is stumped about what to do when confronted by a seductive dancing girl. Domini gets friends with her, though knowing nothing of her past - romance soon to follow. This film is sympathetic, melodramatic, and different (in a way, almost surreal and even a small farmer) - I found it to be quite fun and fun. The photography of this is really interesting - it is full of extreme facial lock-ups and beautiful color shots in the horse caravans crossing the desert, silhouette figures against a sunset sky. Marlene Dietrich gives a nicely done, though delay, performance here and looks gorgeous. Charles Boyer - not usually one of my favorites - is actually pretty good at this, I think the party part of his costume looks like young and beautiful too. Basil Rathbone is fine here, except giving very little to do. Another great orchestral score by Max Steiner helps keep the drama rolling - all in all, a very enjoyable movie.
