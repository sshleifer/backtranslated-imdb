I really like BATMAN: Last year, I thought he had a theater feeling and gave a chance to Collora could make a fine movie. This trailer did not quite give me the same impression. The story line, or potential story line, was quite good, but due to the acting and special effects let me feel like this would make a good TV movie or TV show. <br /> First, Michael O'Hearn is not that good a superman. I actually thought it, in his brief appearance, made a decent Clark Kent. Sorry, I just do not think of SuperMan as being. Kent's costume has masked her size. Batman can have the body of a bodybuilder, but not superman. The tone is tone is no doubt, but not essential. Anyway, I did not care for all of her poses and her transformation from Kent to Superman seemed cheezy. Now this may not just be O'Hearn's fault, Collora can take some of the credit for poor scripting and direction. <br /> Second, the special effects of flying were cheezy. Superman flies in the sky. If it was obvious that this Superman flew near the ground, with the telephone cables and buildings visible above it. I do not think there was any full body shots in superman flying. Obviously the harness and manipulation supported O'Hearn must have been focused on lower his rig. <br /> In all that it was a good trailer. I would probably pay to see a movie, if ever made, and should make sure you keep it on TV. The storyline, an alliance between Lexcorp and Wayne Industries, Superman is jealous of Lois's attraction to Wayne, Lex and Twoface teaming up Superman and joining forces between Batman & Superman is a good one. I'm sure with a bigger budget and approval for a full movie collora with companies, even O'Hearn could save a decent movie. Certainly a better than most of the comic based based on Hollywood lately.
