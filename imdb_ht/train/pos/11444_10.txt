Go to this film for gorgeous imagery in Andy Goldsworthy's sculpture, and treat yourself to an open and relaxing experience. The music perfectly complements the foot, but never draws attention towards itself. Some commentators call the interpreter and the artist a weak spot, but consider this: why you would expand on this in a movie, if you can read Andy's musings in the length of his book, or go to one of the lectures excellent it? This medium is much more suitable for displaying ephemeral nature in the artist's work, and is used expertly in this respect.
