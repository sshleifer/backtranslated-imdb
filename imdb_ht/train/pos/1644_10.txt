I saw half of the letter in this film about a year ago and was very happy to finally find it available on DVD. Recently, I've watched several of the reality series about PBS on ranching, etc. None of them became as close to the storytelling as this movie does. Based on reality REAL, pulling no punches, weak, happy, tragic and enlightening, this is a movie that should show students or anyone interested in life sooner. Fine acting on both sides of Rip Torn and Conchata Ferrell adds to a well-made script. Credits are open states that he has made even though the funding provided by National National Humanitarian Aid. If this is the kind of product tax could go to I'd be happy to see more. I highly recommend it and would encourage people to tell a friend if you saw it and enjoyed the movie.
