Paulie sounds like the most sacred sacrament, and sentimental films you might ever find, but it's actually better than you might expect. Daftness of the plot could thus easily have put the tone for the entire movie, but actually in most other film departments is good. <br /> In case you're wondering, Paulie is a parrot. Buying for a girl with speech difficulty, Paulie gets her best friend and goes all around with her. She even sits on her shoulder during speech therapy lesson, and eventually becomes a super-smart speaker himself. However, Paulie is sending the girl's mother to send and spending the rest of the movie trying to get out of NYC in LA to be re-united with her. So why does this horrible-sounding movie sounds relatively good? First of all, it has a lot of interesting and impressive animatronic effects. Secondly (and far more significantly) it has the courage to embrace it to humorously humorously and tells a truly moving, often human history without worrying too much about the obvious flaws of the storyline. Thirdly, he has many powerful performances, including Jay Mohr as a wily thief, Gena Rowlands as a kind of old lady, and Cheech Navy (yes, the dope-smoking Chech Navy!) As a Muslim immigrant . It might not be a classic, but Paulie is the entertainment sound for kids of all ages.
