First thing first, the female lead is too gorgeous to be missed. Now actress Wang Zu Xian, the one who played Xiao Qian in the movie, is 42 years old and well-aged. It is always good to review these glories of times when they see Hong Kong's old school production like this. The film is one of the most influential titles that took place in the 1980s. Art of decoration decoration and other asetical facets are all mesmerizing. The more fantastically the movie has a dark black aboard in it. It feels like a horror movie but ultimately it's not horrible, but only fun. <br /> I had the experience translating the second script into "A Chinese History Ghotst", and I thought that script was a decent writing. However when I saw the movie, I was primarily disappointed in seeing the movie different from the script, as in a smaller scale and involving more funny roles. However, it turned out to be best executed in terms of being fun. <br /> <br /> If you've seen the Lord in the Rings, you will notice the similarities in this LOTR movie. The highest score is like a mirror in Miranda Otto fighting with the Ring Witch. It's definitely a laugh-out loud. Bravo!
