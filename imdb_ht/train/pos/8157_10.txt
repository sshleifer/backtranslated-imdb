Rated R for strong language, violent content and some nudity. Quebec Rating: 13 + Canadians Home Video Rating: 14A <br /> Fear of a Black Nut is one of the comic comics, most original I've ever seen. It basically a gangsta rap version of this movie is Spinach Tap. a shame by many people have heard of this gem in a movie.If you manage to get this movie anywhere do not hesitate to buy it even if you do not like rap music. There are not so many comedy films that I give a perfect 10 / 10 to.The only I can think of at this time are the movie, grafting the world According to Garp, the 40 year old Virgin and chasing Amy. This movie is a hilarious stereotype of the gangsta culture rap. is about a woman named Nina Blackburn conducting a documentary on the NWH Fictional Group (N **** z and Hats) .They are basically the stereotypes of a rap group making lots of controversial rap songs about being killed and being a gangsta.Fear of a Black Nut is an excellent comic movie and I recommend it even if you are not a fan of the gangsta rap scene. It's a shame this movie is not in the Top 250. <br /> Runtime: 88min <br /> 10/10
