Say what you will about schmaltz. A beauty of this film is that it is not pro-American. It's a morality about some Americans named in high goals and how they got up on the occasion. It is inspired because it is about people in noble goals. For me, the most interesting part of the film is Fanny's education and David Farrelly (Davis' mother and brother). As Fanny said, "We were shaking from the magnolia." In today's political climate, led by a president who is neglected to lie with us and used 9/11 to carry out the worst absolute feature of human beings, we leaked to the level of 9/11 murderers seeking to shoot blood-thirsty revenge. He can not all blame on Mr Bush - after all, we allow him to lead us toward that and even re-elect him after he's been exposed. Now, with full justice, we Americans rebelled throughout the world. Today, we watch this movie with a new awareness: This rise of power in Nazism in Germany was not due to a defect of the German character, but a defect of human beings that allowed us to streamline anything that will justify our committed immorality and lightning acts. I do not compare George Bush Adolph Hitler. But I'm pointing out how a leader can whisk you up in a crap of horror, hatred, and hyper-nationalism doing foolish things. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the blackmailer, who will do whatever needs to be done for his own expansion, no matter how immoral, most like the leaders of our country, those who support people, and those who have buried themselves so deep in the sand, that they can not even bother to vote. A movie like The Rhine Watch reminds us of what we once aspired to be - a force for improvement in humanity - and that we have it at us once again enjoying lusting goals. <br /> <br /> Geoff
