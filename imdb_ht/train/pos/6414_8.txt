I was curious to know how critically responded to this rousing, inspired film, so I went to Rotten Tomato and was scared to discover that the peanut peanut gallery that our nation's movie critics had given the movie an average 43% (or "rotten") rating. <br /> <br /> All I can say is, if this movie does not move you, you have no heart. (It's interesting to note that the same movie on the same website has received a 74% rating from viewers). <br /> <br /> Not that the critical opinion is all that matters to me. After all, I can not think of a much more useless job, which pays. Some schmo come to pay for the movies (what a tough life) and do the same thing all about the planet: to form an opinion. But these chumps have a way to come across as their opinions somehow matter more than you, and even worse, they love to hate. <br /> I'll give you that this old fashioned movie (well, except for the bombs f), syrup, and a little predictable ... after all, you know right from the beginning of Cuba Gooding Jr. , which shows real life hero hero Carl Brashear, which will triumph (eventually) at every turn simply by the way it comes to all: determined with so much; strong-tempered and optimistic. <br /> But its performance with that De Niro (like Billy Sunday, a composite character of several real-life people) are so strong, so inspiring, that you will be on your feet and beating many of the movie scenes in, especially the largest courtroom. You should have a real stick in the mud should not be moved by the scenes. Like our nation's movie critics. Michael Rappaport is excellent as well as a sweet-style, stuttering student diving that befriends Brasing Gooding. If someone saw "Learning Higher", this character totally redeems that character. <br /> <br /> Anyway, this confirms what I've always felt: do not listen to criticisms. Watch this movie and find inspiration.
