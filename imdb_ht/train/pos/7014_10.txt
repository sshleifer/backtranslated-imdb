Wow ... I do not know what to say. I just look at seven books. No one can make me cry like Will Smith. The man is very in-tune with the vast range of human emotions. This film was skillfully and very well done. Raws are found as intense humanity in Hollywood today. I would compare it to "Pay it Forward" and "Crash" as far as the show both light and black in such a raw way. Definitely stick to you for a long time and give you a lot to think about. I have a deep love for passion for movies like this one. Not usually one for a "bad end" but rather a truth seeker embracing emotions, raw life and something more than the absolute that exists in abundance all around. Therefore, I do not mind a little pain at the end. It's true in life that there is still joyful ending. Sometimes it just does not end up happily you think it should be. Many people could live happy life if love and life in one were lost. If you are someone who looks a little deeper than the rest you will love this movie!
