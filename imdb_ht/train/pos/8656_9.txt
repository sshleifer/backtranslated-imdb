In the same vein as Natural Terrorist, another film is not so popular with criticisms because of its excessive violence, but that I also love, California is a film that glamorizes violence, but I like to think it Turn around around the final act. Types like how the jigsaw magazines are glamorizing the first drug, but showing the wrong side at the end of the movie, which is far worse than good side is good. David Duchovny plays Brian Kessler, an artistic yuppie and an even more articulate yuppie girlfriend, who in that violent sexy black and white photography generally reserved for, I do not know where, where nudity passes for art. Perhaps it really does and I just do not understand it. At any speed, Brian and Carrie (Duchovny and Michelle Forbes, who adapt the role of impeccable), make the perfect couple going on a documentary trip to popular killings sites. Brian, the writer, will write the book, Carrie can take pictures. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />, Adele Corners (Brad Pitt and Juliette Lewis). Happiness is at liberty and assigns to janitorial work at the local university by its officers speaking, seeing the announcement on a bulletin board, and deciding to leave the state for a while, violating his freedom, but also leaving the scene to murder masters his house so he will not have to deal with a murder murder investigation. Two birds with one stone, you know. The movie has a curious ability to show the stereotypes, the artsy yuppies and the garbage trailer fat, without resorting to shit or even ending caricatures of either type. Brian and Carrie are artsy leaders, but while Carrie captures on Early and Adele, Brian is captivated with the Earl's status as a bandits, as seen in the scene where Brian launches the Early War. Never fired a gun before, it's as fascinating as a kid. While Adele and Carrie are back in a hotel with Adele revealing things in ways that her children are like the fact that Early "breaks her" to smoking and that she is not allowed to drink (Early Do not Think Women Should), Early and Brian are from the local bar. Brian reacts strangely to a drink trying to start a fight with him, and Early first gives Brian advice on what to do and then the stage and dishes out a quick lesson for the guy. "Knock it, roar, it's comin '." This is one of my favorite scenes in the movie, in part because it's funny that Early gleefully says as the guy's guy dragged him away, bloodied and beating, but also because as he is off with the girls back In the hotel, we learn so much all at once about the two couples, differences, and conflicts that are most likely to come because of them. And besides, because Brian benefits from Early's actions and Carrie is hungry by what she hears from Adele, she also shows different ways that Carrie and Brian react to happiness with Adele. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Clearly, by now, you can say that this is not typical typical of your type of thriller, the popular city popularly featured in the country with all kinds of stereotyped endemic destroys. On one hand it seems a little too convenient that Brian and Carrie go on a tour of murder sites and just come accompanied by a real life bandit, but on the other hand it's a great way to overhaul the murderous murder inherent in a cross-country tour designed to bring fame to murderers and crimes. While studying the actions of past killer, Brian and Carrie finally find themselves facing face with the many material that they are studying, and realize that murders are not as beautiful or morbidly fascinating when it's in your face as it is in disconnecting science of past murder. <br /> I'm still amazed at Brad Pitt's versatility as an actor. Consider, for example, his role in movies such as California, 12 Monkeys, Fight Club, and the 11 and 12 Ocean. Pitt is like Tom Hanks in that it can change its appearance quite high or just enough to fit a given character, and it is completely credible. Incidentally, I tried in vain to be Earlier this year's Halloween, but just could not get the hair and right beard. I even had the hat, which initially I thought would be the most difficult part. <br /> It's easy to understand why a lot of people who do not qualify for California or why they think it glorifies violence and murder, but I think it's glorifying it with the intent to clarify the audience's understanding of its subjects. A movie that did not glorify violence, at least initially, could never be as effective as California, but its film structure is perfect. The glory is all embodied in Brian's and Carrie's passions and the idea of ​​murder and the auras in places of what has happened, but their realization, and we are embodied in the real things, which they meet with Happiness and Adele. The film's goal is to describe the difference between idealized violence and seeing horrors in it up close and real.
