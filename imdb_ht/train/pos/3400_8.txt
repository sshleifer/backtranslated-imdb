Domini Enfilren (Marlene Dietrich) spent most of his life caring for his father. Now that he's dead is free - but he does not know what he wants. Boris Androvsky (Charles Boyer) is a monk who has fled a monastery into more flavors of life. They are accidentally dissatisfied in Algiers, falling in love with couples. But he can not leave his past and he can not live without him ... <br /> <br /> WAY delayed romance full of bad dialogue bad and situation. Dietrich and Boyer do their best to perform good performance but NOTES can get away with some of the lines! Still, in a way, it is a classic. It's injection of gorgeous Technicolor (try to see it on DVD) where each frame is breath-apparently cute. Dietrich is still dressing the 9s (even in the middle of the desert) and hitting hysterical poses in the clothes and body. Boyer is just walking around looking (no trauma). Still I'm never bored. It was wonderful to look in with the dialog that did not stop stupid to keep me from pointing. The end almost made me fall from my chair because I laughed so hard! Now I love romance romance and give them lots of space, but really --- this is incredible! He also runs a very short 80 minutes. <br /> As a classic camp I give this an 8. As a serious movie - a 1.
