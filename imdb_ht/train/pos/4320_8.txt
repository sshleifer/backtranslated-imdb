This movie is very disgusting (me) that good writing in a movie should be all about. Kasdan takes the search for meaning in our lives and puts it out for everyone to see and wonder at.

Claire asks "What kind of world throws away something precious as a human life?" Mack is not as immune as it asks' Is it possible to pass beyond the limits of race and (an even more difficult stage) finances? These are of course not cited in the film, but generalities.

We make our whole life to find answers to questions that we will never fully respond, and in certain cases we have to make good answers for you. need and self-esteem.

This movie does not respond to it; it simply reminds you to keep looking for answers. <br /> <br />
