Did you know that Anthony Kiedis, (singer from the Red Hot Chili Peppers) father is in this movie. Blackie Dammit, father Anthony. I noticed this after reading the "Scar Tissue" Anthony's autobiography, and saw a picture of her dad. I thought, "Well, that guy looks like this guy who I saw in the eighties. Then I read more and he said his father was an actor who had a few small roles .. After checking this site, and compared to a research on the net, I realized he really is his father in the movie. It's funny, because nowhere in the book he mentions him being in this movie .Maybe his son was ashamed to work acting his father in this movie, but he does not think I think his father, Blackie, did a good job at the show.
