I liked the movie, but as everyone said, there were some bits that were not developed enough. I thought personally that the girls were very steam before they landed in prison; Sure, they were supposed to be innocent Indian girls but still ... I felt like they were missing that bond that best friends would have. For example, in the montage where they see-see, the way they kept each other for the photo was very awkward. Then some parts have been very ambiguous. I think it's pretty much understood that Danes' characters did not do it, but I can see how that would be confusing. Also, why the camera stays on Manat brings a very grim expression after it puts the bags in the trunk of the cabs? I thought he had suggested something, but it turned out to be nothing. <br /> <br /> Apart from this, the movie was great. I called when Claire Danes took the blame; she is a GREAT actress. <br /> <br /> Also, I wanted to see that captive Thai prisoner found his ass kick. Talk about the lack of closure ...
