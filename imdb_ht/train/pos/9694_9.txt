I was drawn by this film touching and hilarious, not to mention wonder. I was also surprised that Paulie's voice was made by Jay Mohr. The performance was so nuanced, did not dive into schmaltz, nor was it too hard under New Jersey's swagger, that I thought that this must have some projections of pro pro, not Mr-Mohr's baby-faced. A very impressive performance, indeed, and it's enjoyable to see his talent was taken seriously in a matter of original independent films.
