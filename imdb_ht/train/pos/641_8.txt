This show has a few clich√©s and a few on top of the Dawson Creek-like moment (a 16-year-old talking about how to back when life has made sense?), But overall it seems like a decent show . Most of the characters seem very real, and the story seemed to move along well into the pilot - to finish with a good lesson at the end. I just hope each episode does not turn out to be life-changing as the first, that would be just traumatic drama for this machine. Jeremy Sumpter does an excellent job as a teenager and a passion for baseball, I believe that a lot of us might have to deal with her vision and vision tunnels sometimes for the team that she always wants to be part of.
