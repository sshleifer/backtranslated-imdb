I really thought this was not that bad. Not a great work of art but Dermot M was the most staged scene. Patricia Arquette has been overacting at the time. He actually plays violoncelle that was very impressive, and his line was never forced. Moreover, it is an incredibly beautiful man. Really sexy. Adding this to the talent, and most anything it was in is a lot more tolerated. He still gives it all though some of the projects he participated in did not quite hit the highest brand .. Not the fault of the actor in most cases. He was unfortunately in some strange films that just did not remember in the box office. Always with A-list actor but just not always a "hit". But it is "worth every penny" to any DVD rent or purchase. See Date Wedding and Debra Messing - one of her best films in general. BEFORE PENNY! ; ) (if you have not seen it yet, do, then you will understand that quote!)
