OK, this movie is stupid. I mean that in a great way though. It was stupid about goals, and it was one of the best "stupid" movies I had seen. The jokes and gags are reasonably bad, but deliver in such a way that he hit all the right notes with me. The characters supported were very fundamentally and mediocre. There is a very weak scheme, but it works just fine. Elvira's character is the focus here.It is lovable and adorable. Cassandra Petersen has a world of talent acting just rolling in this movie. On top of that talent act he has physical attributes which was frankly, stunning. Some men could agree with that. The parts shown in his face were also some of the funnier scenes of the movie. <br /> I had an ear smile ear from the first stage to the last. <br /> <br /> Very recommended for fans of comedians, and fans of beautiful women. I wish they had made a dozen more Elvia movies.
