The Sica has become one of my favorite directors, but this one was a hit-and-miss for me. A whore kid becomes a leader in a community of illegal colonists in a desert area outside Milano. It's a detailed and brilliant story of the innocent masses of the masses, complete with evil capitalist and trigger-happy police forces, but slowly it evolved into a fabulous magic story, as the boy surprised Toto develops unlimited superhero powers . I was up to here with Toto ever-smiling after 10 minutes, and when the magic was taken over, I left in the dirt. There were many wonderful orchestrated shots, so many good characters among the settlers, that I kept thinking it was a movie waste was not more serious with its material. The movement of neurorealism and fantasy out more as an experience of "look-what we can-also-do-mummy" sort of pass as a fully developed piece of work / art.
