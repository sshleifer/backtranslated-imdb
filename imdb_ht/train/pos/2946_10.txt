I never laughed and giggled so much in my life! The first half kept me from pointing; The last half made me completely unglued! I think I giggled for 15 minutes after the tape ended. <br /> <br /> Its timing and delivery for its history is almost unmatched. And even if it speaks fast, you catch every joke. Which is probably why my "smell smell" was so overwhelmed; It took an extra 15 minutes to laugh at everything. <br /> <br />
