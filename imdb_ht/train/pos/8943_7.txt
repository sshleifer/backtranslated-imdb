TV series in 1960 is accustomed to this idea from this film. This is the movie that Jimmy Stewart & Kim Novak made right after being thrown together in Vertigo by Alfred Hitchcock. This is not as obsessive as one but Novak is just as fascinating. This was Jack Lemmons 10th film and is good at supporting here as well as Ernie Kovacs. The film has lots of good things about it. Hermione Gingold is very good at this movie, almost as good at supporting here as she was in the Music Man. Throw is very solid. This film has a 1950's end of New York City feeling with a cat that is like hexing as any feline in any movie. It is well worth watching as it is a love story with all the emotions of any, & a little magic too boot. <br /> It is not vertigo but I think it follows that movie, then watched it did not miss it as good as it deserves - I'm sure I'm glad William Asher saw it, so that's the 1960's was created. I'm not so happy about what Will Ferrell did on the big screen, this movie is better than that.
