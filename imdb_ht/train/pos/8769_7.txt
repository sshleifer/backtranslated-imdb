Gentleman Jim is another can print the legend, and Errol Flynn plays the legendary boxer as a brash climber, but social charisma at a Rollicking entertainment that barely ceases to breath. It's as freeware looking for historical accuracy here as it is in Flynn's charge of the Light Brigade - this is absolute hokum and all stops are pulled out, filmed on a surprisingly prodeteable scale and gives a real sense of energy by direction of Raoul Walsh. Flynn is still at her height (you would never guess she suffered a mild heart attack during the production), and Alexis Smith is a beautiful romantic romantic partner and ever sidekick Alan Hale together for good measure, this time as dad The Flynn (Jack Carson takes this time sidekick). Indeed, even the pirate gallion from Flynn's earliest movies makes a bit out-of-place host to a dorside bout! 103 minutes are just breeches.
