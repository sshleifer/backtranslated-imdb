Telemundo should definitely consider making a collection of DVDs in the novel Xica! I know tons of people including myself who would like to be able to buy the novel Xica! It is a very entertaining Novela which is set in Brazil. The costumes worn by the actors are beautiful and the city in which the novella takes place is beautiful. Xica has a lot of history in that time period. I wish Telemundo would televise it again though it was a 2 in the morning. I would highly recommend watching Xica if it is still showing again on Telemundo. I was e-mailed Telemundo a million times already to show the novel again, but pleaded I was falling into deaf ears. The only statement on Xica is that it occasionally has some harsh scenes so I would recommend that children under 14 do not watch Xica. Overall Xica merits a 10 out of 10!
