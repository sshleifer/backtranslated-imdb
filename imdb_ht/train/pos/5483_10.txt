I enjoyed the "Revolution will not televised". He gave me once more, a positive sentiment on the power of the people to decide for themselves how they want to be governed. <br /> <br /> It is unfortunate that in Venezuela twenty percent of wealthy citizens have made all the decisions for eighty percent of the poor for decades, if not centuries. However, when the coup fails; After the federal government dissolved the Supreme Court, the Constitution, and the Ombudsman, and the Electoral Boards, and the Civil Rights, no one was taken to the outside outside a barn and fired. They do not even go to prison. The largest plotters live in Florida, carrying on. And the safeguards being the "Bolivarian Constitution" pass by a large majority of the Venezuelan people. Not only stories that bite. Democracy can give you a hell of a nip if you loose it loose. And in Venezuela it is loose.
