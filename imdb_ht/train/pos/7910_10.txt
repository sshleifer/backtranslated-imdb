When this first came out, my father carried it home-we were surprised by it- It was different from what we had seen before. I was looking for a specific film last night, and I found 'Mind Mind' again. The box will fall apart, and I'm surprised that the tape is still working! Although it does not 'Find Nemo' quality graphics, it's still pretty good. This should be sold again - it's a landmark for computer animation imagery. Highly recommended!
