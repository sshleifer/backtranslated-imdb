Scientists working hard in intimacy find a way to get the impact crater on a meteor to bring a new radioactive component. All (pseudo) science and technology tools tools in the 1930s have the right, including the idea that radioactivity can cure any illness if properly trained. When he called his rivals - who had thrown him out of the scientific and ridiculous community - he witnessed his discovery, proposed a 'joint' expedition in Africa ... of course to steal much of dr. Rukh's original discovery, giving him only residual credit. In addition, a faint-like weakness that looks like a comedy actor supported from Abbot worst & Costello (Lawton) literally steals dr. Rukh's wife steals wife (Drake), who falls head on heels for such scrap of someone. Having grown horns like a deer did not want to dr. Rukh (Karloff) any favorable, so he went into a craft revenge mission ... kill 2 of his enemies and DR friends. Benet (Lugosi), the only one who helped him ... finally robbed deadly radiation that allowed him to enter his revenge to start with hand (in my utmost discontent) spitting the adulterer and poor excuse for someone he married. Acting is especially fine, and Karloff & Lugosi being very good. Check out the scenes of surveillance scenes ... Other characters are not worth mentioning ... Recommended, much like all universal horrors adults ...
