Now this is more like it! The first movie had some iffy dialogs and some weaker acting, but it looks like the team behind this got things together for the end and put out a solid, quite enjoyable, hilarious and creative comedy that will keep everyone on the edge of the seat the entire road. <br /> Seriously, this is just full of great, exuberant and creativity, and it's less of a parody about 80s movie at the same time. The scene of Hell is great, and these are the ones in heaven. There's really no lack of fop adventures upset this adventurous one promise, and you'll never see another movie like this. Even the final movie films of the movie is not as bad as the first one, being generally heartwarming and enjoyable in its brightest repertoire of fun movie families Bliss. And even Keanu Reeves, despite looking at 30, is not that bad here. Sounds like a good deal for me.
