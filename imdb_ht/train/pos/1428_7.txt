There are some spectacular, heart-stoppingly beautiful photography here in a series of scenery and animals, from Arctic tropics and everything in between. The camera techniques are varied and stains out of closed ups in aerial work. Correct is tremendous and the next is spot on too, with just the right tone and some dramatic reality and telling about our world. Where the movie falls down somewhat is in trying to cover with embedded four - theme templates, climate change, individual animal history and hunters / hunt interaction across multiple settings. Eventually it all gets a bit bitty and disjointed. In general, well worth seeing specifically given issues are covered, but do not expect Oscar material.
