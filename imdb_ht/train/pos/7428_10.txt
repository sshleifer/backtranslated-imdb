I swore when I saw this first movie, I called my eyes out! An STAR held is the movie that lets you know what love is really like despite the obstacles Jan Norman (Kris Kristofferson) and Esther (Streisand) face. You also experience what it's like to lose a love like this at the end of the movie. Streisand and Kristofferson have such great chemistry along with the music is fantastic! When Streisand songs With a more look at you / Look good now, it's just magic pies! This movie makes evergreen songs in one of my favorites, and Queen Bee is such a fun song. Also, I love the fashion of the '70s (except the Afro Streisand.) In addition, it's a beauty. A star designed is my number one favorite movie. This movie is a pleasure to watch and is a heart-breaker in the end.
