World of War is perhaps the greatest documentary series of all time. Historical research is usually flawless. Even after a quarter century, it is the most accurate and definitive documentary on WW2. An interesting historical work that includes interviews with some of the most important and fascinating figures in the war. I highly recommend it as a learning experience.
