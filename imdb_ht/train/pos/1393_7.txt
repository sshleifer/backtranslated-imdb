Probably the most capricious quarter of the first quarter, 'Shore Leave' has its UPS and Downs; Some parts drag on too long and the others unambitiously cut short, but one can not refuse to throw in everything, but the proverbial kitchen sink does this a fun episode. Kirk and crew seem to have found the perfect planet for leaving shore after an extended trip to duty has left everyone on board in need of rest, relaxation and so on. It appears for all intentions and purposes to be an uninhabited Earth, with beautiful scenery and an ideal climate. The first indication that things can go just a little curve is when McCoy, leading an advance team, sticks Alice (from Wonderland) after a big rabbit white wearing a vest. Kirk crosses down and finds others as fascinating as bizarre and encounters. The one thing they all have in common is that each crew member thought about the person / place / thing to discover their rights before they discovered it. This does not immediately flow through and Kirk or anyone else. More strangeress, including signs of Don Juan, a Siberian Tiger, a WW2 plane plane, etc.; Kirk meets with Ruth, a gorgeous old girlfriend (of course) and a bully on his Academy day, Finnegan. The chase scene / battle with Finnegan goes on too long, but at the same time, McCoy is running off with a shootout by a horse knight and apparently killed. Finally, an elderly man appears and explains what happened. Planet is a park 'futuristic entertainment' where visitors have only imagined something they have to appear. There is nothing permanent; McCoy does not really die. Once this explains, Kirk decides to order the shore for everyone after all. Although 'it was all a dream' sort of ending, 'Shore Coast' kept up as another first-rate episode of the first Star Trek.
