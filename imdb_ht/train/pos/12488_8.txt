I'm not at all serious about horror movies, and I want to look pretty much any of them. This does not mean that I want to re-look at them, or I will not be critical of them. This film is crawling, and it is very well done. In fact, I think this movie would make an excellent double-billing and sessions 9. <br /> I should specify, before I get my comments, that I've watched this alone. I began to watch it before going to bed, and got about 15 minutes before I realized it was too ineffective, so I saved the rest of it for the morning. Even while watching it in the broad daylight, it was still creepy. However, I can not pay for how effective it would be when looking at a larger group. <br /> After the death of their daughter, a couple moved to a remote cabin as a means to try to come to terms with this death. Let me score this death - this is one of the rare movies that does not shy away from a child's death. This is much more important, as it both sets the tone, as well as explains much of the act that perceives the movie. <br /> <br /> The couple does not do well. The woman distinguishes herself from the relationship, and the husband does what he can to try to bring back. While some of the comments complained about their acts - one specifies that they act more like a father and daughter than husband and wife, and that's legitimate. She tries to give her more direction. It's a role that men sometimes take over. There are a variety of crises in the movie, and pure non-violent justice, though grotesque in some ways. The story itself feels very straightforward for most of the movie, and takes an odd turn near the end. While the turn is not absurd, it is certainly not what you expected in the way things have progressed. <br /> Moody, atmospheric, and very well done for something that appears shooting on video.
