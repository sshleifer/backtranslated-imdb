Sincerely intended as a satire of D.W. Grifolite intolerance, three years Buster Keaton's first attempt was to take a full-length comedy feature. The only similarities in intolerance are the "pound" opening scenes and the fact that similar stories of the ages are edited together in a complete movie. Keaton's reasoning to affect this style was that if it did not succeed as a feature film, it could be reduced to three of the reelers. Fortunately, Three Ages have been successful as a comedy and have some of the funniest routines I've seen in any of Keaton's films. There is nothing unique or daring on the story line. They are simple boy-meeting-girl, boy-lost-girl, boy-gets-girl-cemetery, but the satire periods are digging and setting the standard for future work by Mel Brooks and film this genre. However, I do not think anyone has ever topped this comedy. No one can play the lovable goof like Keaton and this movie show is some of her best. In addition, Wallace Beery's appearance as the rival Keaton adds to this movie appeal. Anyone who thinks that comedy in the 1920s can not be appreciated by modern audiences need to see this movie.
