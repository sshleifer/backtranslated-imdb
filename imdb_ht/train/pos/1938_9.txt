The big bad swim has a low budget, indie feels about it. So many times I start looking at independent films that have really good reviews just to find out they are pretend to crud, voted for by those who are so blinded by the idea of ​​the movie and its potential to be provocative that they forgot the movie is a form of entertainment first and foremost. <br /> I do not know if the big bad swim has any message or higher significance or metaphor, if it does so I miss it. From the get away BBS felt right, it was easy and warm and human, there was no major play or significant insights, I just connected to the characters straight. But when, like all the good movie the end came around I felt sad at the loss of this connection. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for something great, or fast or perspicaces look elsewhere, look for a movie trying to deliver more than it can. BBS delivers a solid, enjoyable, real experience and I felt rewarded and satiated to have her look.
