I liked this movie. It was almost the same as the first (cabin by the lake), only instead of just killing women and killing too. And the scenes are much more interesting, 2 of my favorite scenes is primarily when Stanley and Allison are in the dance club and he is describing Kimberly's latest moments before he is thrown into the water, and secondly, when Stanley visiting Allison in his basement, right before head down to the series, when he kisses him. These scenes, for me, were very intense and steady. I gave the movie a rating of 8/10, not because the movie was bad, but because the film was bad, I mean, there were times when you would notice nothing was wrong, as it was shot road A movie is usually shot, you would not see the "live" camera shot, but then, very little, you would notice the filming mistakes. what is wrong?
