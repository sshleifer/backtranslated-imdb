I remember Casper funny books, but do not remember any animated cartoon. Maybe they were not memorable; I do not know but in my advanced age, here I watch this Casper early animated short yesterday. And I was shocked by the user-comments here. Is anyone missing? <br /> I have to learn all over again that Casper is not like the other ghosts, who likes to go out every night and scare c - p from everyone. "He does not see any future in that," according to the narrator here. Instead, one night he goes out of town rural, inadvertently scares some animals and can not find any friends. He carried it into tears, until a small fox heard him bawling and befriends him. Two are warm but quickly, the fox is running for his life with a fox hunt in progress. Other <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Other are all mentioned what's happening, so I'll earn on that, too. The Rena died by hunting dog (not shown) and Casper is in tears to lose "my only friend ever." But nobody mentioned the happy end of this story. The "Ferdie" fox gets a spirit-face like Casper, jumping on her leg, she gets her face and comments to the narrator "they've lived happily ever after." Both characters look very happy. <br /> <br /> What is sad about that? This is a beautiful story with a beautiful, happy ending.
