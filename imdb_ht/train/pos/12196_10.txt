Orson Welles manages to hit me on my donkey and all the photos in it I see. Lady in Shanghai is on the same level as his other masterpieces, the magnificent Ambersons, the Touch of the Evil, the Judgment, and the Midnight Caries. The plot may tend to be confusing sometimes, and sometimes it seems to move maybe a little bit too fast (about an hour in it has been edited out when testing tests went wrong). It does not matter, however. You can not watch Welles' movie and manage to focus too much on the draw. His direction defines which great direction is. Almost any scene from this movie can hold and any other stage she has directed. Check out the scene in the courtroom. Usually these are scenes of stock that I can not stop them. In fact, try to sit down in Welles' own speech near the end of constraints. At Lady from Shanghai, just pay attention to the level of detail at the courtroom scene. See jury that always sneezing and interrupting the procedures. Or just take a look at the lighting in that scene. I know, it's just a simple Venetian blind, and that he used to be constantly in movie noir and movie crime in the era, but Welles gave it a beauty all its own. The dialogue is also remarkable. Welles had the skill, a skill that no one else seemed to have, to make a crime movie that exemplifies the magnitude of poetry. If he spoke Shakespeare or spit out hard-boiling line, he had power to stir the soul. 10/10.
