In the beginning of this film, one of the commentators said he had two strikes against him: he is black and male. But in addition, he has a third strike: it is gay. "You'll have to be stronger than you ever imagined," he said. "Paris is burning" is a documentary about gay black and Spanish people who are transvestite or transsexuals. The miracle of "Paris is burning" is that director Jennie Livingston takes a subject that might have been very easy to become a freak show and allowing people to read humanity. We learn the views on homosexuality, men, women, hopes, disappointments, dreams. Some of these dreams are so irreplaceable it's tragic. Many people are seriously in refusal; <br /> This is not a movie for everyone. There are shots in this movie in naked transsexuals. If you have a problem with homosexuality, then this movie is not for you. But if you see this film you will realize "Paris is Burning" is not really about men wearing women's clothing, it's about a group of people who routinely marginalized and put down into society at large, and what they do get a sense two communities in their lives. <br /> I've watched this movie four times since it was released in 1991, because it says a lot: it's a next on materialism in our culture, on roles, on rich and poor, on the media and celebrated, fame and adultery. "Paris is burning" is one of the most humane, and one of the infamous, movies I've ever seen.
