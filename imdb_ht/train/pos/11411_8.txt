IF Van Dine must have been a cunning businessman in dealing with Hollywood. Most of the movie series' from the studio days were usually confined to one or two studios. But apparently Van Dine must have sold his rights to each book on Philo Vance one at a time. Note that Paramount, MGM, Warner Brothers, and more all Philo Vance films released. Only Tarzan seemed to get around Hollywood more. <br /> <br /> MGM produces the Garden Murder Cage and starred Edmund Lowe as the fashion detective. Of course MGM had the original Philo screen under the contract, but Bill Powell was busy making the Slim Man at the moment and I guess Louis B. Mayer decided to focus it. Edmund Lowe is a beautifully accepted Philo Vance. Lowe started out very great at the end of the tail in the era of silence and What Glory Price and then with a string of film and Victor McLaglen and Flagg's characters and whores. But after McLaglen received his Oscar for the informer, Lowe seemed to wither in the B photograph. <br /> <br /> The death of the murder could involve three separate victims, Douglas Walton, Gene Lockhart, and Frieda Inescourt . The disaster atmosphere around the type of crime committed by giving it away, the mystery is really how all killings are connected and how to accomplish. <br /> I'll say this though. Vance takes a very great chance to expose the villain and the last 15 minutes are worthy of Hitchcock.
