This early movie has its flaws - a predictable plot and some unusual scenes of dubious importance - but it has clearly demonstrated Hitchcock's mastery of correction and use of powerful images. It's also among the expressionist of its film stilistically; notes, for example, unusual distortions it used during the sequence of parts and echoes are often in both titles and drawings of the prints. <br /> <br /> Its core, though, remains the final match, which is still among the more exciting examples of boxing cinemas. Even if you know that the hero has to win, he becomes quite credible that he will lose, with the move of his wife from the corner of the champion of his, motivating the final pay-off scheme, very well inclined with the progress to match. The files in the stopwatch do exactly what they should; you can almost hear the ticking (though this is a silent film, the visuals often have an amazing feel about them). The gathering becomes astonishingly quick, and the viewer gets sucked into the excitement and brutality of both the match and sexual jealousy under it. <br /> <br /> Two of the only DVDs with which I'm familiar is that of laser, a public domain company. Like every silent Hitchcock they have been released, they have attached various musical selections, mostly orchestras, to the action. Correcting the sound is often sloppy, and the sound quality varies widely, but some genuine care seems to have gone through most of the actual choices, and the music accompanies the final match works pretty well; It is unlikely that this sequence will ever be better accompanied than it is here. This is a much more impressive film than present presentations it suggests. It deserves an honorable place in both the Canon Hitchcock and the slender list of valuable paper films.
