Psychotic transxcellular Bobbi tied to the patient (Angie Dickinson) to an important physician (Michael Caine) and then prosecuted the high-priced prostitute (Nancy Allen) who holds a glimpse into Bobbi in the elevator. Liz (Allen) comes under suspicion of the crime and team up with the patient's son (Keith Gordon) to catch the killer. <br /> It can be summed up in a couple of words: it's very sexy (Dickinson and Allen look great), it's very bloody - and the type of gore usually reserved for movies splatter, and boy is well-crafted. Writer / director of Palma script is OK but it really takes a backseat movie-making ability. It is very successful on a visceral level and I actually get involved with these characters. I can point out De Palma's tender / ripoffs standard in Hitchcock - at least in one of the Master's photographs. <br /> And with it all, it has a professional and credible throw. <br /> This was the third movie of Palma and former wife Nancy Allen (after "Carrie" and "Home Movies"). By the way, dancer-turn-actress Rachel Ticotin was one of the assistant producers. There's a bit of trivia for you. I would not think that a gay can be stylish and bloody at the same time, but this picture pulls it. The best thing about it is a typically hit Pino Donaggio music note. <br /> <br /> 8/10
