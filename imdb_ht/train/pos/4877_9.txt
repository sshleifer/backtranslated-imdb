Actually a particular person / character is not "right there," but my resume lines refer to the power of the movie. And this all achieved without any fancy camera motion and / or large series of outputs, but with a great and very good (credible) story and good actor transmitting the story (arc). <br /> You can call it a great companion of Japan's great movies / movies (like Tokyo History etc.), not so much history-wise of course, but more attentive-wise! Great acting, the nuances of performances are really gems. If you want to experience a touching story and want to see a movie touching you emotionally, than this is the one to go. As you've noticed (just as much of my comment), I do not find in the story. There are places here at IMDb where you can watch these ups, I'm not one to unlock the story too.
