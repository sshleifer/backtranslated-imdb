It predicts that between 2000 and 2020, 68 million people will die prematurely as a result of AIDS. The predicted toll is greatest in sub-Saharan Africa where 55 million additional deaths can be expected. In addition to the weak statistics is the personal story that we rarely hear about. Christophe Honor√© describes one of the most moving in Close to Leo, a film that produces French TV as part of a series of issues facing young people. Even if fictional, it faced with a situation that is unusually too common - the effect of a HIV diagnosis on a loved one's pre-tricks. <br /> <br /> When twenty-one year old Leo (Pierre Mignard) tells his parents and two young brothers, Tristan (Rodolphe Pauley) and Pierrot (Jeremie Lippmann) that he has AIDS, the family is devastated. Out of concern for his youth, they decided to retain information from his younger brother, 12-year-old Marcel (Yannis Lespert) but he heard the conversation and began sulk with irregular acting. When Leo goes to Paris for treatment, he takes Marcel with him, but the boy meets Leo and demands to know the truth. Leo tells him that he is ill and Marcel is sad but accepts. When she brought Marcel together to meet some ancient gay friends, however, tension between the nail surface, setting the scene for a fixed conclusion. Even though I was uncomfortable with the scene scene involving physical contact between the brothers, I felt the sincerity of Leo's closing and the brilliant performance performed by Lespert and Mignard over the balance scales in favor of it. Seeing events from the young perspective gives the film an authenticity that reminds me of the movie LeBebes Quebecois and Truffaut's 400 Corps. Unlike some American films that dance around the bitterness of AIDS, Close to Leo tells a harsh truth but does so in a way that is sensitive and pretty real.
