Every once in a while in the wonderful world of horrors, the diamonds are fabricated, and one gets completely awestruck by its absolute brilliance. This is not less than a diamond !! This is a lot of movie films, looking for anticipation, and black atmosphere, and I think it's safe to say, one of my favorite favorite movie ever! And of course it has probably the most salted, flattened scary sequences throughout the history of horror! Whenever I see the movie, and it gets up to the point where you know inevitably will happen, I try to remember exactly when I'm scared from my blood, but it never neglected to happen; I never found it right, and I find myself as terrorizing as the first time I saw it !! Now, it must be said, scare a horror fanatic jaded like that, which is nothing short of perfect perfection. Unlike the Americans, the British know their subtlety, they take pride in the art of act, they do not need any special effects in order to convey their atmosphere, they rely on the power of the potent, and criticized (the this case) in hints and anticipation. Each single element is impeccable, from the pieces together, the act, the story, to the ominous atmosphere. Pauline Moran surely could make the devil snore, that's for sure !! As a late note, if you are for some reason next to love this piece of craziness, then you honestly do not know what horror is all about, and honestly do not deserve to know it either. Thanks!
