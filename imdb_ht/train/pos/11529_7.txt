As a biographical film, "The Lady and Red Hair" (the story of As Director / Producer / Drama David Belasco transforms the notorious divorce society Madame Leslie Carter to an international stage star) is certainly not in a league with that other biopic Warner's Same as former, "Yankee Doodle Dandy" (what?), but "Lady" is an enjoyable movie of its own right - AK shares quite a few features in common with the classic Cagney. <br /> Like "Yankee Doodle Dandy," the "Lady and Red Hair" brims over with old-time show-business tastes. (Among other things, both films feature delicious commercial ceremonies of the theater and the inevitable scenes of racing and theater theater boards.) Also, in "Lady" such as Cohan's biopsy, cast in support made up In the familiar and acting dear character of the period, all make the head-to-head work we remember for them. <br /> <br /> Need to add that, yet like "Yankee Doodle Dandy," the "Lady and Red Hair" do not let the truth get in the way to tell a good story? But also like "Dandy," "Lady" managed - Glory! - To convey the essence of her-hero-show-business personality to its greatest-than-life personality. Everyone knows that Cagney lit Cohan forever in his brilliant paintings and his affection of "Yankee Doodle Dandy" - but some singamen realized that Claude Rains had done a service similar to David Belasco in the "Lady and Red Hair" - and he made it with a panache that almost equal to Cagney. <br /> <br /> Rain-like-Belasco perfectly captures that personality galaxy showman legend of its outsized glory. Rain gives a very enjoyable, superbly observed, and remarkably true-to-life performance as the whole Broadway man once called the "Wizard." To watch Claude Rains in action (looking at every shot as if he's a good time helluva!) In the "Lady and Red Hair" is to see David Belasco grow in life on film as if he can not wait to shake things up on the Main stem once again. <br /> <br />
