It is hard to play a queen. On the one hand, the actress has to be majestic and helpless, and on the other, he showed vulnerability in a difficult situation as well as the rally and courage to overcome their chances, since almost all Queens movie draws basic lines lan. Emily Blunt is quite curious as Victoria, but not as a complete performance as I would like, no blame her. I can not help but feel like this is an adaptation of Mills & Boon compared to a more dramatic movie movie about another young Queen, Elizabeth. Blunt does not get running gamut of the queen's emotions, at least not throughout the limit, since it's y'know, the young Victoria. To see the old Victoria, check out Mrs Brown. Jean-Marc Vallee is an interesting choice of directors for the movie. It lasted for C.R.A.Z.Y., which was excellent and launched his fame. It was quite a different movie but I remember it looks gorgeous and that's probably the main similarity between the two movies. But while Vallee wrote C.R.A.Z.Y., this one was by Julian Fellowes, and even though I really enjoyed Gosford Park, the story for this movie was much less interesting. I soon lost all government policies. Maybe it was less engaged because there was no potential defense of the monarchy. I just say.
