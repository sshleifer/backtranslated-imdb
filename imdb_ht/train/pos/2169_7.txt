OK, first of all, ignore the last person's review. They are admitted to fall asleep in it so it's not surprising they did not understand what was going on !!! As thriller / horror goes, this film is not too bad, it is certainly very watchful. Right from the open scenes you get an overall idea exactly what will be the cause of all the folly that follows, and come to your end to prove right and everything made clear. <br /> I enjoyed this movie, it was quite strange at times and as old movie gone it was beams. Great to look late at night! I give it a generous 7 out of 10.
