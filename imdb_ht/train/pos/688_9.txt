I had the pleasure of seeing this movie at the Rhode Island International Film Festival and was very impressed. Tess Nanavati is clearly a great senarist and I would like to see more of his movie. If he could do what he did with the budget of this movie, I'm very worried to see what he can do with a great picture. The Kudos cast for their terrific performance (which was gold), and those who composed the music. Worn to "row your boat" did me away. Very creative movie all around .... I really hope to see it out on video or DVD because I would buy it in a second time. If you get the chance, you should definitely see this movie.
