I remember that the trailer for the Zu Zu legend was quite impressive and was a fan of a man named Hero (my favorite ever), my Storm Rider decided that I must watch this too. I know there is a lot of criticism about Ekin Cheng's acting everywhere, but it's my favorite Hong Kong moviestar too far (way better than Nicolas Tse anyway) and it's one of the factors that I enjoyed this movie. Without a doubt this film is a work of art from the beginning to the end. I even thought that only the actors were real and everything else was computer generated at the end of this movie. They must have put a lot of work into this one and they deserve good credit for that. The scenario of the movie was a fair and evil fairies with a love story thrown in (I guess Ekin Cheng pulled the girls easily) .The story is not very intellectual and deep but this is not yours expectations when doing a movie action. I wanted to have more martial arts actions with points and points instead of fighting with magical abilities, but well in life and never go in the way you want it. And why were they sound like supersonic aircraft in the heavenly battle in the end? This way too funny. Legend of Zu can not be a man called hero in my eyes but it flows like a videogame and that's not a bad thing at all. If a company decides to publish games on this movie I will not get suprised as it brings all the videogames elements. Good job. Please do more fantasy fantasy like this
