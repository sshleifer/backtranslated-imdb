The first movie ever made. Workers streaming into a factory, some cycling, most busy, moving right or left. Together with Melies, the Lumieres both begin with the point of departure for movies - and Melies begin narrative fiction, movies, fantasy, artifice, spectacle; and the lumieres are pure, unadorned, observation. Verite a. There are many intellectuals who regret the ossification of movies in the letter of the tired formula in the former. But consider this again short. There is nothing 'goal' about it. The movie is full of action - a static, painful scene of life, activity, and the quiet harmony of the frame is stream, desantred from the back of the right or left (but never, of course, the front, where camera a). But the camera stands still stock, has the energy, the possible subversion, subordinate to its will. The cinematographer can be a revolutionary invention, but it will be used for conservative purposes - from maps out of the world, modify it, restricts it, limiting it. <br /> <br /> worse is the historical fact of the movie. These factories are employees of Lumiere. Employers are spying on their workers, the eyes unseen about their anonymously. The film therefore describes two types of jail. Behind the gates, the workers are close to their workplace. Opening the gate looks like an image of freedom, escaping, but facing another wall, the fourth wall, further confirmation. The first movie is also the first example of CCTV surveillance, an image of unseen, all-seeing authority to deprive its servants. A pair, all too prophetic movie.
