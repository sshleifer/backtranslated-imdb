Like the Arabian Nights this movie plays with conventions telling stories to make us feel that there is drawn, plotted and more drawn: it opens and what appears to be the frame device of a blind man tells the story of his life, Then plunge into a flashback that takes us until now to the blind person, where we discover that about half of the story is still coming. (It must be admitted that the second half does not quite live up to the promise of the first.) Like the Arab Nights it tries to bash like many Medium-Eastern popular motives as possible in one job. A liberated genius, a beautiful princess, a flying carpet, fantastic game mechanics, sea travel, a crowded market, a wicked vizier, jewelery ... I do not know why it all works, but it does. Everything is just so beautiful. The beautiful compositions. Jen Duprez is beautiful. Rozsa's point is especially nice. As usual, it sounds Hungarian; but somehow he managed to persuade us that he was Hungarian in a Persian way.
