I like this movie. It's one of those movies that you can watch over time and still get engaged. Congratulations !! I believe everyone involved in making the movie and the script should be proud of themselves. It's so strange, you feel like you're watching a real life band. I would like to see more movies like this. I'm glad to have not chosen the famous Hollywood star to be in this movie because it probably would not work. And even though Billy Connolly is well-known, she really was stuck in the role and I could not imagine anyone else playing it. Congratulations again, I really believe that this movie deserves Peter Sellers Comedy Award for Bill Nighy. But when you come to the final stage ..... well what I can say !!!!
