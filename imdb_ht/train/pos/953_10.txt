Far from the richest of texture and character than even the classic from 30 to 50 years. George C. Scott was designed for Scrooge, as he was designed for Patton. Mr. Scott will be known as one of the greatest 20th century actors. The character of Scrooge as played by Mr. Scott seemed to fly on the screen. Scott as Scrooge brought a richer, more robust, yet a much scarget moving Scrooge to the screen than any of his predecessors in the role of those who meant in London 18th. Mr. Scott seemed to bring Scrooge to a more personal level, understanding yet very controversy; His role was to act with the great Scott authority still bearing on the screen: his usual vocal vowel might sometimes bring to a whisper, almost as a soliloquy, as he would berate the Christmas holiday in one breath, again revealing his own human frailty in his next line. He could show the scrooge back and crispy, with a sympathetic, sympathetic Scrooge all at the same scene. <br /> <br /> Surely a remarkable performance by a giant in his generation.
