Well, after long anticipation after seeing a few clips about Bravo in the 100 films these films were long lasting to see this movie. The plot was simple, beautiful model Alison Parker (Cristina Raines) moved to an apartment building that is a gateway to hell. The Sentinel is a movie right crawling down, even though it's a bit slow. It's a mix of Ommen and Baby Rosemary. The act is fine, and some bits are really disturbing as the late oral scene with the dying father and the chubby woman in the middle of the dumplings eating cake and Laugh Fini is a strange mix of deformed men and cannibals. It's a very odd, camp, but in the end I really believe a big movie! One of my favorites comes from the 70's, though it has nothing so much original. It's wacky and very creepy! Probably one of my favorite time. 9/10
