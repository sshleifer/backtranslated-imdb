When you saw Charley Boorman in Long Way Round with Ewan McGregor, I was very interested to see how Charley would be in his own show. I thought Charley was coming across as a handsome guy who is very seated and down on the ground. It's nice to see that celebrity struggle with their weight and abilities, it just shows in humans too! I do not know much about bicycles, but this show has spread me right from the start. Preparing and organizing for this event looks immense. The event itself seems very dangerous and I'm fascinated to see why Charley and everyone else do it and how far he gets. I love the pace of the show with the optimistic music fast. I can not believe he broke his necklace collar, I really hope it's not the end, I cant wait to see the next episode ...
