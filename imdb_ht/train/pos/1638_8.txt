Heartland was in production at the same time as Michael Cimino's Gate of Heaven - Heartland cost a fraction but 10 times film pieces. <br /> <br /> Gate in the sky was "the biggest and most expensive ($ 40 thousand in 1980!) Hollywood flops at all times, its failure that caused the sale of Art Artists to the MGM" - IMDB entry <br /> <br /> Heartland costs a few hundred thousand dollars and benefits from writing, direction, photography and acting. It's easy to draw you to the beauty, happiness, difficulty and sorrow of pioneering. <br /> It's sad that Hollywood sometimes would pour millions of turkeys (based on one hit the director's director) and carelessly such a wonderful story.
