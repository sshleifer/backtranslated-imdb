I do not know what it is I find it end up on this movie, but the first time I saw it, I wanted to see how it ended. I'm not a big fan of Paul Winfield nor in war-drama, but I really wonder just how and when Winfield would find her child. All she knows is that the boy has green eyes. Truths have been said, I have not seen this film of years nor has it shown on television in a short time, but this movie is a bit of Odyssey one person after the war pain. Winfield shows a very sympathetic and warm heart fantasy of a man lost by his memory. There is a hidden message in this movie that it is looking for little in recent human morality in the aftermath of this war and the fact that it faced. Why this film is not yet on DVD or video is a mystery for me.
