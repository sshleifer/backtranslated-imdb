The relationship between wife and husband is unique. It is one that is open where it has nothing to do, it feels no particular shame for how it has behaved and wants to share things with her because its main focus is always on the reality of their marriage. There is nothing and no one can come between two of them. Only the odds of fate can intervene - his imprisonment during the war and what follows after his return to last last. A very intriguing movie that is totally absorbed.
