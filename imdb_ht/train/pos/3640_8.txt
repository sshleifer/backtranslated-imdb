This is one of my favorite movies. Dennis Quaid is moving and convincing at the part of a man who gave his dream of being a baseball pit when his arm was given out on it. As a high school coach, he challenges his players to win the championship division by saying they will try out for a baseball team if they do. They have (partly because of all the batting practices taken with a coach that can prevent more than 90 miles an hour), and he holds his side to the bargain - and it is signed! <br /> <br /> If you've ever decided to try something new and terrifying as an adult, Jim Morris's story will remind you. It is moving and inspiring, and the true man's relationship. <br /> <br /> Inspiration is not the reason I rent this one, though. Dennis Quaid is just downright solid in the party, with a baseball movie and a good-looking man changing a diaper is my mind in the sky. Ladies, if you feel the way I do, check this out.
