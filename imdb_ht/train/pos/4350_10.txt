This movie is one of those who have a familiar love. It is ground, sitting with a movie that will make you think ... and smile. Paul Reiser and Peter Falk take you on a journey that you will not forget. The soundtrack is very varied and tight; And the movie itself is like a breath of fresh air. This surely deserves recognition for both the movie and the actors! Finally, a piece of art from the story obviously likes and often affects the special that they see today. Never did I walk out of a movie with such deep abdomen and feelings of thought in my heart; so she felt as if someone was just wrapped in a fluffy flower blanket. To see this film is finding a real treasure and having fun in it.
