I agree with all hugs, I went to a box of tissue watching this movie. It has a courageous authenticity and encounter true in every way. The <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The question I am raises represents a tenderness now regarding the treatment of animals. I had a very difficult time with the beginning of the kill of sheep, and the deer died and its impulse and blood pool as his life was empty. This is the age of "no animal was hurt in this move." Iphigenia did in late 70s before the advent of computer simulation. Is it possible for such deaths? Or were these animals killed for art?
