14 years since this show has made and it is still the best show ever made. Writing this was the first grade and the second output was anything. This show should never have been done today and that's a shame. I hope if you're thinking about finding this show to look that you do. <br /> <br /> AG was out year I left high school at the time my TV show was the x records that gave you an idea of ​​why I was first in this show. AG was a far better and best program, but there was just one reason? I know this is not just the only program to get one season another example that comes to mind would be the Lone Gun (x file turned on) it was good writing and it was funny, but also was only one season . It does not seem right! <br /> <br /> We also note that this show was around before show as Twilight 'dark' show so I think this might have also left the show down hill. <br /> Watch this program and enjoy it! 10 out of 10 for me.
