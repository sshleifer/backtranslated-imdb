Show this has a great storyline! It's very credible! A wife wife dies and can not care for her children to call her brother in law her best friend and many others come later on the show. Like Rebeecca Donaldson, Comet the lovable yet strong dog, Nikki and Alex whom you can find for yourself (I do not want to spoil it for you) and to force Kimmy Gibler! (The sidekick of DJ), but the kids are wonderful too. This is Mary Kate and Ashley first taken! And also you can know Candace Cameron Bure from shows like St.Elsewere Punky Brewster and that's so Raven! Jodie Sweetin plays Steph the love can afford the child to feel left out. Really this is a very good show!
