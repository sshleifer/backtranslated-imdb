The second part (actually episode 4-8) in the hit Danube TV-series is a bit inferior to the first one, but it has a lot of laughter and crisis as well. This time, Udo Kier plays two parts, like the baby monster and his father's devil. Other parts of this time are Solher Pilmark's Doctor Krogshoj, who must face the terrible revenge of Dr. Helmer, and once again, Mrs. Drusse's patient is trying to solve the Miss Marple-style mysteries. Finishing on a cliffhanger and after the death of lead actor Ernst Hugo Järegård (Dr. Helmer) and Kirsten Rolffes (Madam Drusse), you wonder how they will ever be able to be part III, but I hope that at Trier will give it a shot. Unfortunately, Morten Rotne Leffers, Dishwasher Down's dishwasher # 2, died shortly after, as well. Look for Stellan Skarsgård in a chat. ***
