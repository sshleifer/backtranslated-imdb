A lot dating from this episode (just like the Twilight Area Zone episodes), as military military "Uniform" military. And some things are so incredible, as easy access to clean water. Still, consider the year this is done with the time, and you quickly why this episode is so special as you look. She has a wonderful sense of hope, something missing in a lot of Twilight Zone, as well as an interesting girl character (despite the fact that she rarely speaks), something else is rare on the Twilight Zone. "Two" is a great example of how the Twilight Zone, in just over 20 minutes, could pack more emotions and drama than most of today's movies. And it's great to see two people who became American icons so early in their careers.
