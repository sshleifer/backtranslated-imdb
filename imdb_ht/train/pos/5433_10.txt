This movie is one of my favorite favorites ever. Cary Grant, Victor McLaglen, and Douglas Fairbanks Jr ... what a cast. Not to mention Sam Jaffe as Gunga Din. Drama, action, adventure and comedy all roll up into one. The final battle scene still to this day gave me thrill and the finish still left me in tears. If you have not seen it, I would recommend it.
