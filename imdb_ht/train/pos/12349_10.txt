This movie just goes to show that you do not need big explosions, mutually-billion dollar computer graphics, or pretty much about paying actors and actresses to make a good movie, all you need is an excellent storyline with plots. that the master of all Japanese films, Akira Kurosawa pulls brilliantly. I recommend this movie to anyone who likes a season. and for those who enjoy Kurosawas work sooner. 10/10
