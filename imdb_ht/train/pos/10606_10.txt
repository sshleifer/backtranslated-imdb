I just finished watching this movie and found it very enjoyable. It's a quiet, small film that is not overwhelming you with special effects or "great" performance. It simply takes you into the lives of people living in a small section of weed in North Carolina. Henry Thomas gives a good performance as Raymond Toker, a young man who finds a abandoned baby in the woods. Toker's research for the baby's parents takes it on a journey that will have a profound impact on his life. David Srathairn plays Trester Lester, a slimy conman and a bottom motif. And David plays the bad guy in perfection. <br /> <br /> There are many more in this movie than first meet the eye. Decreasing aside from North Carolina with a beautiful soundtrack of traditional music, it's worth watching.
