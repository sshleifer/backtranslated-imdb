I saw Lady and Red Hair back when she appeared, and did not remember it as something to cherish. The truth is that, despite his base in a true story, his screen play is funny and incredible. The real merit of the picture is the throw. A constellation of some of the best players supported in the 30's and 40's made a background for the delicate, cleverly-inspired work of Miriam Hopkins, with the wonderful performance, spectacular of Claude Rains, which, as usual, is the most good in the picture. What an actor! He never won an Oscar, but he is in the good company of Chaplin, Garbo and Hitchcock. Perhaps Lady and Red Hair have her best work of films. Watch it and enjoy it. <br /> <br />
