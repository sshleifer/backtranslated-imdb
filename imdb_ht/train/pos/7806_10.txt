"Crying Freedom" is not just a movie. It is a historic account, heroic story, and insight into the cultural background of a great event in history. Not only Denzel Washington does a terrific job in imitating a motivated, determined hero, Steve Biko, but he delivers a public message about the horrors of southern Archeology. The story of Biko, an influential leader, and his main "influence", Donald Woods, is a heartbreaking one. But the ultimate success of his life can go beyond the committed atrocities in South Africa. "Crying Freedom" manages to communicate in its audience the optimistic aspect of the seemingly disturbing plot. It is because of such great films as this one, that the public can become educated about the terrible events of history, great leaders who sought to finish them, and how we never allowed them to reach the future. Because of this, "Cry Freedom" is an amazing movie that should be seen by all.
