<br /> I have admitted to enjoy bad movies. I love them I watch all of them. Horrors especially. My friends and I all pick up after a tough week at school and work, rent some crazy tapes, order a pizza and have an explosion. One of those we got in Hollywood video was this one, Zombie Bloodbath. This one had a big box, so I waited less than normal. The story is about a housing project that builds on a nuclear facility that has the highest layer of bulldozes, and the other underground layers simply cover them. Residents of this neighborhood find cover up the facility when some children fall into a hole inside a cave. This wakes up some zombies. <br /> At this point over, it's the small town-town. The great effects and actions never stopped until the credit ends sewing. <br /> <br /> OK, it's not great art, but this one, and it's in dialogue jokes and over-the-top things that really were our favorite tonight. Actually, it was one of the best "tape parties" I've ever had to have fun in watching. And you can say he did about no money, and a bunch of fools. There are hundreds of zombies, and the Director looks like Brendan Frazer (he has a chatter) and is just a wild trip.
