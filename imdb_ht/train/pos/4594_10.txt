The best martial arts movie ever made. This movie is better than anything Bruce Lee ever made. A classic and a more fun and brutal clue. Jackie Chan is the king of martial arts movies and the true king of kung fu.It's a great pity that Bruce Lee was so upset, she took Jackie Chan an eternity to become popular in Europe and America. Rule Jackie !!!!
