I thought this was a nice way to spend time on a summer too hot summer, sitting in the air conditioning theater and watching a light-hearted comedy. The plot is simplistic, but the dialogue is witty and the characters are unmatched (even the pen is suspected of serial killer). While some may be disappointed when this is achieved by Match Point 2: Risk Addiction, I thought it was proof that Woody Allen is still completely in control of the very style of our growing love. This was most I'd laugh at one of Woody's comedies in the year (dare I say a decade?). While I was never impressed with Scarlet Johanson, in this he managed to tone down his "sexy" image and jump right into an average but courageous young woman. <br /> <br /> This may not be the crown jewel of his career, but Wittier has passed "Devil Put Prada" and more interesting than "Superman" a great comedy going to see with friends.
