Most of the complaints I've heard in this movie are really down to one thing: It's not versed. Yes, the cast and the crew are basically the same. Yes, Kitamura rehashes a few shots at the Battle Scene that comes in the second half of the movie, but that's where the similarities are finished. The version takes place essentially all out, revealing Kitamura's ability to craft an exciting B-movie in the natural setting. For Alive, almost everything takes place inside. In small, cramped space. Here art design is pushed into your face, and its art design is! We treat several very intricate and interesting spaces, and our characters for the most part in prison in these spaces. Also a key difference is that we do not get much action here until the end of the movie. The version was all about action and cool, here's a much more emphasis on character and situation and mercy and self. Therefore, Alive is a movie that is most interesting than Versus. You can not pop it in and go to a random scene to watch five or ten minutes of bloody bloody zombies, but you'll sit down the screen for almost two hours watching it's interaction of a really interesting character. <br /> <I'm really ecstatic that I ordered the DVD despite some naysay. You should be too! But be sure to realize this is a different animal in Versus - it's often slow, and it requires a bit of thought to get out of most of it. I hope Media Blasters pick it up for subtitled R1 DVD release!
