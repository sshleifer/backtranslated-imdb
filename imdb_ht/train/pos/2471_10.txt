I never read Hamlet Shakespeare before watching it but I had a Shakespeare book with me and was able to follow the dialogue in it. Can watch me on the partially partial movie since I had never read it before, but I was pulling from this movie. Shakespeare is undoubtedly one of the best writers ever lived and the story of Hamlet is definitely one of his best achievements. <br /> But now on the movie ... I found that all the actors in the film had a firm threat to what they said and so they could articulate well. Leonardo in Romeo and Juliet is nothing compared to Kenneth Branagh and the King. Things I liked about this was that it worked very well as a "MOVIE" and not as a play you are studying. You do not need to be affluent and Shakespeare relates to all rural Misery has to go through. I would recommend this movie to a wide audience. <br /> That is my two cents.
