I saw this when I was 17 and did not see it since. 'CBS Late Movie' was used to show it on a regular basis at one point. I remember how sad and upset she was, it really made me sick in my stomach. These effects were not what they are today, but nevertheless, it targets the feeling alone in the Amazon, after losing both parents and looking for a way out, very well. I remember the bugs and maggots the most, so realistically, eating his meat. It is a black film that was controversial subject at the time, though likely it was strongly edited for TV. I wish to remember more details, and if I ever got the chance to see it again, I can comment more. I was looking for this for years. I believe it may have been shown on CBS under yet another title. I have no idea if it has ever been released on video.
