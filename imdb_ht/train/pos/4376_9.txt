Liam Neeson shows Scottish legend Robert Roy Macgregor in the early 18th century. He is a true actor. It captivates the audience and charisma as it does in all its roles. Jessica Lange is excellent as her husband Mary. Mary is such a beautiful woman. It's his love that makes Rob Roy the legend, but it's his passion that makes his love suffer. They need each other. Tim Roth as the wrong Cunningham is perfect; In one way or another, on watching the movie, you will find Cunningham disgusting. The Scotland landscape is beautiful. The environment and condition of the times are well shown. If you love history, romance, passion and love, you will enjoy Rob Roy. There are violent and bloody, but it's inevitable in telling this story as it should be said; There is no violence. And you have to listen carefully if you are not used in a Scottish accent. An important point in making this movie so good is that no single actress or actress is glamorized; they get dirty and actually look unattractive at various scenes. It's their skills as actors who attract you, they do not count on brand names, popularity or sex symbols. This is something special.
