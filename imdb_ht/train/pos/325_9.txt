This is a big movie - esp when compared to seriously unfortunately sometimes in politician-minded filmmakers today. A film that can easily combine sex, sexual relations, politics and art is a rarity of those days. While the buoyant's optimism in the 1960s can not be blind, I think we can at least learn a lesson in the broli's energy and charm. I do not know what people who label the movie "boring" were watching - there is plenty of it that he never drew the same movie for more than 15 minutes at a time.
