The "Pandora Clock" is a gripping / thriller suspense which is a cross between a virus film and a disaster movie. This film, revealed in two parts on its first NBC show in 1996, is about an airplane that gets infected with a virus when one of the passengers just happens to carry this disease. The American government contends whether the plan should be destroyed or not, while the pilot (Richard Dean Anderson) and a virus expert (Daphne Zuniga) try to figure out something to avoid disaster. I'm not really a big fan of TV and mini movies, but I liked the "Pandora Clock". It's one heck of a thrill ride. Jane Leeves (TV Frasier), Robert Loggia, and Edward Herrmann (as President) are also stars. <br /> <br /> *** (from four)
