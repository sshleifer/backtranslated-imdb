There are many illnesses in the spirit of the person who gave life in modern times. Constant alertness or accumulation of information in the Pyschosis domain, kept psychologists, mentors and psychiatrist busy with enough work to last decades. Occasionally, some of these mental phenomena are discovered by people who have no knowledge of the remedies or even of their existence. That is the quote of the movie called "The Night Listner." He tells the story of a popular radio army called Gabriel Noon (Robin Williams) who spent his evening enthralling his audience and living life on Gay life. Maybe it's because his show is losing his native veneer that admitting admitting it is not herself anymore. Feeling abandoned by her lover Jess (Bobby Cannavale) and her best friend (Joe Morton), she seeks shelter in her deepening despair and isolation. She is here, a mysterious voice of the night asking him for help. Midi needs to be useful and comes from the desperate voice belonging to a 14-year-old boy named Peter (Rory Culkin). In reading the boy's manuscript that depicts the early life and sexual abuse from his brutal parents, noon is fascinated and wants to help. However, things do not look like lunchtime quickly find themselves wrapped in an elusive story with scarcely torn right from a medical nightmare. This movie is the best of Robin Williams and was not for Toni Collette who plays Donna D. Logand, Sandra Oh as Anna and John Cullum as pop, this would be funny. Instead, this can prove to be one of William's most serious performances. ***
