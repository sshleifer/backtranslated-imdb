A stupid young man gets obsessed with a woman - so obsessed with losing perspective and common sense. An evil magician approaches him and informs him that he can give him great wealth that he can use to win the lady's heart IF he agrees to give him anything he wants in this room. The mute guy agrees with the magician to steal the man's reflection from the mirror - and bad things happen naturally as a result. <br /> <br /> If this film was made just a decade later, I'm sure I would not be so charitable in reviewing and scoring this movie. After all, drawing the film is a bit wobbly in spots and acting is, at times, somewhat aiming. However, considering that in 1913 "full-length" films were rare - and often only 20 to 30 minutes long! Plus, the whole idea of ​​a complex story as you find in this movie is very strange - as stories were very short and largely acted. So, given the limitations of the time, this movie is very good and is one of the earliest movies it was known.
