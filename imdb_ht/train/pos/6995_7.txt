Instead of embarrassing pieces of business featuring Bela Lugosi as a mad scientist (and yes, a Renfield-like assistant with his mother, a dwarf and yes, the wife of the scientist (sounds like a Greenaway movie actually lol) .. Lugosi gives his wife injection from the death of Marriage (why are they? Who knows?) so that his wife can keep looking beautiful.It became the brides after making a very clever trick with some orchids collapse of the bride at the altar After another broth bite the dust, a journalist just HAPPENS must be around for the effect and decide to snoop around for a story. He finds all sorts of clues about the orchids and lugosi .. The sky knows where the police were .. Soon it's going to Tangra Bela, when it meets a sort of strange looking physician who may or may not be eeeevil. It's all cumulative in a totally inched plan to have a fake marriage to take the scientist upset, but he it seems that the scientist has a vision of x-ray, as he foils his plans, Oh no! What will happen? I actually liked this movie as a bit of a guilty pleasure. Lugosi is great here, hanging-on them all very pretty weird, the story is actually quite embarrassing in some places that make it all the most lookuz. A little fun to see.
