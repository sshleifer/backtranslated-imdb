This was just broadcast on BBC and I was absolutely happy to see it. As the credits rolled, the cast alone made sure I would give it a go. After just five minutes I was completely immersed in this beautiful movie. <br /> <br /> Yes it was formulated and predictable, but that somehow added to her charms. The rearrangements of the quarantine were beautifully laid and captured an equal feeling in some production. A real feel-movie film, punctuated at all with exceptional music. When he leaves, I'll buy it!
