This is a very great cartoon, early bunny cartoon. As a result, the character always in a transition period - it does not draw as long as it later was with his voice is not quite right. In addition, the chemistry between Elmer and Bugs is a little unusual. Elmer is some poor candle that buys Bugs from a pet store - there is no weapon or desire on its part to explode the bunny smithereens! However, despite this, this is still a very enjoyable movie. The early bugs were definitely more sassy and vicious than his later incarnation. In film later, she messed with Elmer, Yosimite Sam and others because they started it - they messed with the rabbit. But in this movie, it is more like Duck Duck in the late 30s and early 40s - a jerk that just loves to disappoint others! A true "anarchist" instead of hero in the later drawing. While this is not among the best Bug Bunny cartoons, it's sure to have fun to look and it's interesting to see just how much it has changed over the years.
