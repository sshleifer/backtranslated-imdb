In the three rumors of this draw, I love them all, I have all three on VHS and in addition there is a copy of this one on DVD. There are just enough variations in the scripts to make all three fun and re-visible. In addition have any other movie been revitalized three times and these are all starred in each? Of course the main stars in this one are great, but the supporting actors are also superb. I particularly like William Tracy as Pepi. It was like a stolen thief that I was digging to find other movies it was in. It appeared in many, but most are not available. As the other reviews, I am saying - buy this one.
