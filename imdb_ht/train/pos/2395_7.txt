Even though it was the plague hit the festival race here in Austin (SXSW Film) as we got tired of things like Shakespeare's in Love, and Elizabeth, this movie deserves a hearing. An insider's look at the Platform of the "Scottish play" as actress called "Macbeth" when producing her to avoid the curse, this is a dry, effective and stylish treatment of the treachery that befalls the troup. With a beautiful evocative note, with looking and bleeding far better than its small budget would suggest, this is a quiet gem, not world-class, but totally satisfied.
