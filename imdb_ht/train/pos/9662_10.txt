A longtime fan of Bette Midler, I must tell her live recording concert is my favorites. Betting our emotions with her jokes and bringing us into tears and ballads. A literal rainbow of emotions and talents, Animals show us best in its solid repertoire, as well as new songs in the album "Bette Roses". Spanning the generation of people it offers something for everyone. One and only divine Divine proves here that it is the most intense talent scene around.
