This movie is utterly hilarious. He threw clips immediately with one frame and takes us on a wonderful ride in movie gangster movie. The conflict of brother vs brother appears when Johnny's brother becomes a good-doing D.A. However, the best character is Johnny's crimelord rival, Moron is heavily accentuated. As Johnny says "These people should be arrested for clogging the English language." <br /> Check it out on video. It's worth a look.
