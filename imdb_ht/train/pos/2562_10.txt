This is one of the biggest stories I've ever seen. Yes, I can agree that some parties may appear dated, but that does not distract from the movie. One should try to observe, criticize and enjoy any form of art from the perspective of the time. Clearly by the "Sex in the Cities" standard, Charlie Chaplin was horribly boring. However, when judging the prospects of 1925 America, it was fantastic. As well as Sayonara is a movie tool in her view of a mixed-race love affair, American "manifest destiny" arrogance and prejudice, and complexity in different cultures. It is a next natural stage in the films as Mr. Its purpose, however, was not just social commentary, rather, it is fun and enjoyable, with multiple lines that one just does not forget. <br /> However, even when taken only as a love story, it is terrific. Although, Brando's branding assertion is accentuated, it is in its closest best of nuances and characterization. Buttons and Umeki (which were both Oscars) and the rest of the supporting cast added many of the movie. <br /> Taka, the real star, does a fabulous job to make you feel the passion she has for Brando, while being torn by her sense of obligation and loyalty. His talk when he first met and talk to Brando is a classic and something rarely if ever matched in movies. Dialogue between Taka and Brando in her dressing room in Tokyo at the end of the movie is equally good. Of course, it does not have sips, spit-swapping and worse, showing examples of today's cinema, but doing so all the best. It shows true love and passion, and not just "heat." If this film does not touch you, then you're just too small, too cynical or dead.
