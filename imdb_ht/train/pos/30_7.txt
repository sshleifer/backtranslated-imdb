An old family history told two girls by grandfathers brought to life 16 years later as he predicted. <br /> <br /> People are getting murdered and bloody spilled, and the rats are troubled all over their bodies and naked they are loved. <br /> <br /> Kitty (Barbara Bouchet) is the suspect, but we know she is not the killer. Is it Franziska (Marina Malfatti)? Is it Evelyn back from death for revenge? Is it a plot to steal a legacy? The color is superb in this thriller from Emilio Miraglia, who only made another Giallo, as far as I know. <br /> <br /> The only thing that spoiled the movie was the appearance of which several frames were cut out. Someone called the police, and suddenly they have tried to save Kitty.
