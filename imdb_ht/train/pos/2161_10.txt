How many of us want us to throw social and cultural obligations and be free? Most of us, I suspect. Do we dance? is not a movie about dancing. It is about learning about ourselves, recognizing what we are looking for in life and having the courage to go in search of it. Mr Sugiyama is a middle-aged member of a Japanese corporation where dance dances are considered unsuitable behavior. <br /> One day Mr Sugiyama saw a beautiful girl leaning from the window of a dance academy. It is captivated by it and eventually sign up for dancing lessons. She is ashamed of her dancing and fear of passing. She hides in reality that she is participating in the dance class of her colleagues and relatives. There is a hilarious scene in the office cover when Sugiyama and Watanabe, a dancer who also dance, stop cutting practicing some dance steps. There are many other funny and warm-hearted scenes. <br /> <br /> The finish is not a fairy, but leaves the viewer fragrant. <br /> <br /> This movie helped me to understand the Japanese people a little better. It's a hot and very refreshing film to see.
