I saw this set when I was a kid and liked the detail he entered and never forgot it. I finally bought the DVD collection and its just as I remembered. This is just how a doco should be, fairly and realistic. The movie film is incredible and the interviews are fantastic. Only the other series I found equal to this is 'Die Deutschen Panzer'. <br /> I just want Hollywood to sit and watch this series, then they can make some great war cinema. > <br /> Note. Band of Brothers, Saving Private Ryan, Letters from Iwo Jima, Flags of Our Fathers and When Fumbling Rumors are some I'd recommend
