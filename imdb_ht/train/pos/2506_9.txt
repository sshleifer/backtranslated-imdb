Moon Children was one of the most symbolic movies I saw. What I really love about was the illustration of immorality / mortality, and the obstacles and tips in life. The film depicts a great deal of vampires that have the power of immorality and the advantages of it. If it has supernatural or eternal life, these are what people usually want for. Children's Moon shows pain and disadvantage for immortality, since their feelings toward impact losses almost all the characters are especially in the main characters Sho and Kei. The title of 'Moon Child' is revealed as the film comes close to the end where it clearly shows that everyone is a moon that shines the way others, giving advice. I'm a personality as well as that moral movie in show. The weaknesses of the film lie in some parts of the act and special effects since it made the movie less authentic. The scene where Toshi's death could be more powerful and realistic if more authentic emotions in the act were put into it. Some scenes with special effects like gun shots could also be more authentic without making it seem too much like an action video game. The sparks that came out of the guns appeared too fake and I think they could be eliminated or fixed. But I think that the Children's Moon should be a movie everyone should consider watching. The symbolic ideas and images of the film to carry out would be easy to accept by everyone and may be interested in many viewers. It is quite a thoughtful and fun movie to watch.
