I did not read anything about the movie before I watched it, by chance, last Saturday evening. Then, as I looked at her, I felt the misery of Lena and Boesman in my bones. I was so captivated by the acting with the tone and the filming that I listened only partially to the dialogues. My husband fell asleep right after we went to bed and I was asleep, under the impact of the movie. I wanted to wake him just saying: "If I ever vote for an Oscar nomination, it would be for these two actors." I decided to wait until the next day. Then I read more about the movie about IMDb, and it was sad to learn that Mr. Berry had died before releasing the movie and that he probably never saw the latest version of his brilliant masterpiece. I always said to him that my movie was a true independent film, in its concept and spirit. The actors must be praised not only for their brilliant performance, but to accept a party with no shine, not the show, well in the contrary, to show the true image of human depression. Tris, but intensely.
