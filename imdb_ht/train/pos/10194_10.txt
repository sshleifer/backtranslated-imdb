This would have worked much better if it was designed like "Mitchell in Malta." At least then we would have killed the eye of Joe Don Baker running around an otherwise scenic localized recreation in which ridiculous looking to equip cowboy ... we do not mention acting as a gunslinger Old West. Mitchell was Mitchell, the movie would not suffer from a lack of free police brutality either. Oh well. At least Mike's funny comments and bots have made this enjoyable fare as an episode of STD. I can not imagine watching it on his own, however.
