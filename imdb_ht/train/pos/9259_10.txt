It was simple and yet so beautiful. I think that the essence of all sex segregation in society, which can be bitter, was shown very delicate. He had a bit of bitterness in hummer in it. The fact that most of the actors were not professional, made the movie more tangible and more realistic. There was also a "documentary" around the movie. The best scenes are those of all the girls, banned from watching, listening to the passionate soldier, who is supposed to keep an eye on them, broadcasting the game. If you are an Iranian, cheering is familiar and dancing on the streets after a game won, filling you with national pride !! If you're not Iranian, you'll still love it all the same!
