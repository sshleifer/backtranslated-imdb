Cameron Grant is one of the best directors to make adult movies. Her only rival is Andrew Blake. Celeste is dynamic all over the film but the DR office's sequence with her & other ladies is just incredible. Almost as good is Carrera's performance and construction worker. I highly recommend this movie & gave it an 9. It's almost as good as Cameron Grant's element of wanting that I gave a 10.
