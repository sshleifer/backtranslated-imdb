Robert Mitchum stars as Clint Tollinger in this west, but hard west: Man with the gun. Tollinger is a professional tamaried city - like in, when a city needs someone to save itself; It is one of those who brought in to do it. Tollinger's latest gig is coming out as an accident: wandering in the city looking for his former fling, breaking into a city played as a puppet by a local gangster west. But many citizens start on the day's day to hire Tollinger, as his way to clean up the city has become much fiscal (sudden High Plains Diver looks less original). <br /> <br /> Man and the gun start off as a medium-sized hard-guy movie, but start to surprise you more and more as the movie progresses. What starts in as forgettable and run-of-the-mill ends up black and character-centered. The entire movie is beautifully shot and the cast is very enjoyable. Mitchum is itself the usual excellence here in Man and the Gun - not one of its very best performances, Mitchum still has its classic and effective presence hard-guy screen in high gear, and it hit action-packed, meaningless , and shocking scenes from the movie right out of the park. Man with the gun is a beautiful western Mitchum and is easy to be the one time.
