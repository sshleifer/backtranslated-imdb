One will get the whole card review because it is not comfortable to fit any mold. It's horror - but not a splatterfest. It is equal partial suspension as well as film - yet without the usual Hollywood curtains and hatch cameras. <br /> <br /> The feeling of the movie is spare and lean and next does not have any special effects because I think you should listen and watch the faces of the characters. <br /> <br /> Forget that Brendan is a graduate of the Buffy Universe. This is a red herring. He is acting here. 'Camp' is a misreading of this story. Adrienne Barbeau is providing a solid performance rock - so it must be believed that the script has something to say. We all know the excuses they are sorry that the actors are clearly out of concern and are just waiting for the director to snap "Cut" and get the checks. This is not the case, here. <br /> <br /> Forget the fact that their body begins to fall and almost universo-humorous regularity. I do not think the intention was funny - but keep you in balance. <br /> <br /> Think of it less in a movie 'movie' and more to a movie 'Play' on a stage - that adorns whitewashed houses. Then you might see it really about paranoia, scary, and spiral madness set in an isolated somewhere, USA. Travel time, Mind control, secretive experience with the Nazi who can not die. . . I say to her rent and give her a try if you're in the mood for something a little cerebral. This would be a good choice for a saturday midnight Saturday.
