The big problem is where to start as this movie needs your attention to the forthcoming hours and you better do not miss a few minutes to get a coke as there is a danger you can not follow. But good is also a pause-button. Bruce Willis must travel through a timeline to find out some antivirus for a virus that made animal rights on the world in 1996. Thanks to some mistakes he first finished up in 1990, then in the First World War and how messed Up it all can look like, Terry Gilliam comes and what should be one of the most clever scripts ever. This former Monty Phyton man knows exactly how SF-history geniuses have to be said as to his choice of cast could not have been any better, Brad Pitt's lunatic (his performance in the asylum is memorable) and a superb Bruce Willis who proves it is more than some Schwarzenegger-want. It's a movie you can look over and over again as the script is so strange and complicated (and yet you can follow) that all life gives you other surprises. One of my great favorites.
