I thought I should qualify my position after reading other reviews. The film is not great, but it has a lot of great elements. The lighting and scene along with the camera work are great. The story is slow and weak, but fun. The act is bad, but there is no worse than you will find on the SyFy Channel. The music is very good and the gor is good. He has the big leather face in the movie and is produced by Bruce Campbell. I watched the movie complete and while mostly predictable, it was always enjoyable. Women are attracted enough and the lead actor does a great job of being brooding and creepy. The movie was remarkably clean for a modern film and appropriate violence for children 13 and up. There was no sex gender. I gave it 7 out of 10 and I think it's just. I would watch it again if I had nothing better to do. The gay husband of the angel was the bitter aspect of the film, the devil is quite crap.
