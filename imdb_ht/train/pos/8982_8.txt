Damn, that was a lot to take in. I was pretty much fascinating at all. It was very perfect, though I would say the correction had a lot to do with that. I can not believe that this guy lived on good terms and many of them (Anton especially) to get all this foot without any serious ... beef. The Dandy came from well-together, middle-aged people who took advantage of their situation (and that's right!). I felt bad for Jonestown and especially for Anton, which perhaps was not a lot of other people felt. Great piece of film and great choice of subject (s). I recommend this to any music / movie fan. You'll probably learn something about film-making.
