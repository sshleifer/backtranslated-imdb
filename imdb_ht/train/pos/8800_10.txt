First of all, I do not understand why some people find this movie for anti-US. Be sure there are times when the US is accused directly, as in Youssef Chahine, Ken Loach and, to some extent, Mira Nair. But come upon them, they are not naive charges; Instead, they are based on real and documented facts, and all documents that the CIA release on Chile confirmed this, for example. But returning to the movie itself, what I liked most about is the variety of humor we find in it. We found the children educated for respect to all who died at the event; we find a happy couple that will be changed by the tragedy of that day; we find common people whose feelings are upgraded to the shadow of the events of September 11 and react differently with this, with dignity or frustration; we even find someone in the movie for that fall in the grounds forced for a moment of real happiness. <br /> <br /> All these visions and others - as powerful as those or even more - make a consistent mix and help the spectator have a glimpse of how different people scatter around the world react to events on September 11th. So what we see is a panorama that is more complex than white and black, and that can make some people freeze; but this is the world where we live, and in it there is no place for manicheistic ideology, whichever president or priest can tell us. Finally, I think it's a shame that there is not even a release date for this movie in the United States of America. It's a shame because most of the American people are wondering why this catastrophe has happened, and this movie might give some clues. This movie is very clear - different from what some people in this forum think - that all we do today will determine our future, and that the mistakes of the past will affect how we live today.
