This afternoon we took the kids in the movies and saw Neil Gaimans Stardust and all that I can say is Wow. It is rare that I completely aback not anything but this is quite possibly the greatest fantasy film I've ever seen, maybe even the best movie of any kind and it's all Neil Gaiman's fault. <br /> <br /> Sure, I could be sucked by the wonderful dialogue that was clever, flowing smoothly, making the characters completely credible. <br /> I could go on for spectacular acting days, Charlie Cox is perfect as Tristan, Claire Daines is Brilliant as Yvaine, and Robert Di Nero almost steals the movie as Deeply at Captain Shakespeare's Captain Claket Pirates. <br /> <br /> The heart is best brought on by the humor that is managed to be our laugh funny, smart enough to make first look like the 80's Sitcom, and mix in perfectly with the rest of the movie alone he would have made this a great movie. <br /> <br /> Special Effects were near perfect, this t rue was not LOTR or Star Wars SF Extravaganza but where they used to be exactly what was called for, not too much of distracting you from film In itself and blended in the story perfectly. is the story? What mka said. How often do you come across a story that has all the elements of the elemental elements that are not just out of as another cheap bride bride knockoff. He managed to be accustomed to comfortable and yet completely new and refreshing at the same time. <br /> Any one of these things would have made this a good movie, all of which combine to make it a great movie but to speak in comparison with the rich enchanted world that these elements combine to bring in life well. Once again Neil Gaiman did it and drove another dolphin in my heart by creating a world of fantasy that is so beautiful and enchanting that I would do almost anything to live in it and only giving me a brief look in it. I did not want it to end, I wanted to be sucked into a whirlwind in the land of Stormhold and get to meet Tristan and Yvaine in person, travel her field and valley, stroll through her gallows and meet her resident Be both dangerous and friendly and stay there forever. It's a feeling that I've noticed whenever I read something by Gaiman, Sandman, the Americans, Coraline all left me with a deep sense when I finished reading because it was over, can see nothing more in his world created which seemed to be so much more vibrant and lively than the one I forced to live in and watched Estardust was not different. <br /> <br /> In the end I'm sure that Neil's writing and this movie will not have the same effect on everyone but trust me when I say you will not regret the time or money spent watching this movie It's easy to get one of the five movies I've ever seen and I can guarantee that anyone at all with a soul will at least love it.
