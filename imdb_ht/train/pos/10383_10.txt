I saw this film in 1976, my first year I lived in New York. I went to live for the next 26 years, but never seen anything as delicate and beautiful again as this small TV movie. It was part of a PBS series as I remember, and I never forgot it. <br /> <br /> There are no sex scenes to talk about, just delicate, moving, moments full of touch with tension and excitement, full set of a conservative, Boston (I think), first-ever environment setting where women played roles The dedicated wife awaits the return of husband from the war, and did not seek a career and financial independence. Frances Lee McCain is superb in the role of career photographer and I spent the next 30 years odd looking for her in equally challenging role to no avail. <br /> There is to be a video of this movie? Ensure it should be on DVD but surely at least a video?
