I keep this on the flat last night. I liked the movie. I traveled to Russia 3 different times (adopting our 2 children). I can not put my finger on exactly why I liked this movie by seeing "bad" turning "good" and "good" turning "semi-bad". I liked to watch Ben Chaplin in the entire movie. Like "I can not belive this happening to me" if it's good or bad it look at the same (and it works). Great finish. 7/10. Rent it or catch it on the flat as I did.
