On the surface, this is a comedy higher than average romantic ladies. Under the guise, he MGM character cascade-casting actor in his funniest. <br /> <br /> Driving is straightforward, but all the rubbishes are thrown out of the way. Margaret Hamilton (aka Witch Wicked in the West), Edward Everett Horton (professional obsession-compulsive fussbudget), and Sig Ruman (Brothers' Marx's enemies at _Night's Casablanca_ and still-wonderful in the _Night of the Opera_), play a well - Gang intent is trying to bring two driving together, instead of driving apart as the "usual" characters they would do. <br /> It also pokes fun in many romantic-comedy conventions, which is another indication that this could not be so a "straight" romantic comedy, as it is a wry sent-up of many post-war comedies romantic & 2 dimensions, stock characters. <br /> I've seen it only once, and interruptions, so I can not be positive, but this movie can be one of those who worked best in the context of the time in which it did, but less Success now that viewers "see" these high characters in a completely different lens. I accept this is the case when I give it 9 stars. I thought it was hysterical.
