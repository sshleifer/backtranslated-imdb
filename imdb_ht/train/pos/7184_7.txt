I absolutely love this show, but I saw the second episode first. After watching the first episode, I could see why people turned off first. Humorous episode of the first episode is not the best, and they struggle well to start the series. However, I still love the mood and humor mood of the show. Characters develop more after the episode and become really enjoyable characters. As a first episode, it really does not accurately represent the rest of the show that is really good. The episode is not bad by any means, but as the show progresses gets better and better, so watch more episodes before you pass any judgment on the quality of the show.
