Andy Goldsworthy is a Taoist master in the first order, expressing the way to his healing sublime art. Indeed, time and change are what his work is fundamentally over. I bought her first book several years ago and my family was amazed at her. So it was a treat to get to know the artist personally in this movie, it is just as patient and gentle as you would expect, and it has some wonderful things to say about the natural world, the deepest of them expressed in its occasional inability to say it to words at all. It is like most kids who play out the big ones alone (if they do again), creating things from sticks to sand and mud and snow before they outgrow it. Mr. Goldsworthy gave the gift and the mission to extend the type of play to create profound vision of nature, and to open our eyes often weary of it in brilliant new ways. And always with the utmost respect, gratitude and humor of a stranger, and ask.
