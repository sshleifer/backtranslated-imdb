Based on Elmore Leonard, this is a violent and intelligent action movie. The story: a business man is blackmailed by some 3 criminals. Roy Schieder performs great work as the main character and the special credit received to go to John Glover who plays sort of a rogue psychopath. I must mention that the bandits characters are very complex and interesting - something very rare for a movie action. Also features some beautiful and sexy women - the most notable are Kelly Preston as the young swimmer for the Schieder character. Vanity provides a very good performance and appearance as the hooker is connected to the three blackmailers. I'm glad to say that Ann-Margaret still has not lost her - this lady is a true babe. Do not look at this movie rate. I really do not know what the public and some critics have against this movie but my suggestion is to ignore them and watch this really addictive and under-rated movie. You will enjoy it, that's a promise. Recommended A +.
