It's a bit easy. That's about it. Graphics are clean and realistic, except for the fact that some of the fences are 2d, but this is forgiven. The rest of the most cleaner graphics than GoldenEye and many other N64 games. The sounds are breathtaking. All from the SFX talk are nice and realistic. The camera edge is a bit frustrating at times, but it's the same for every platform game, like Banjo-Kazooie and Donkey Kong 64. <br /> <br /> I got this game as a Christmas present in 1997, and since then, I have consciously gotten 120 stars more than 10 times.
