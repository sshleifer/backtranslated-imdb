This is the cartoon that should have instead of Country Cousins. Visually well-done and more fun and memorable. Worth watching just for the music alone! Although there are undoubted elements that will break their sensitivity in these few days, the design has to be given a bit of perspective. It's about sixty years old and it is, after all, just a cartoon. I crippled and if I was as hyper-sensitive as folks who looked at things like this cartoon and took betting, I'd have long been hooked up in a fetus's position and faded away. Sometimes you need to lighten up, put yourself back and float! Caricatures of cartoon celebrities were common in the 1930s and 1940s and were almost never terribly complimentary. Bing Crosby reportedly hated it when it was used over more than one occasion. * SIGH *
