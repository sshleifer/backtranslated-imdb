Hickory Dickory Dock was a good Poirot mystery. I confess I have not read the book, despite being a fan of Agatha Christie fan. Adaptation is not smooth, there were times when the humor, and there were vibrant attempts to get it right, it was a little kicks, and the events leading up to the final solution were rather running. I also thought there were some slow moments for some of the mysteries felt padded. However, I liked how Hickory Dickory Dock was filmed, having a very similar visual style to the ABC Murders, and it really set the atmosphere, what with the dark camera work and dark lighting. The darker moments were a bit crap, this was helped by one of the most haunted music notes in a Poirot adaptation, perhaps not as disturbing as the one of my shoes, which gave me bad dream. The scheme is complex, and all the ingredients are essential, though not as entangled as my shoes bark, and in some ways that's a good thing. The act was very good, David Suchet is impeccable (I know I can not use this word forever, but I can not think of a better word to describe his performance in the series) as Poirot, and Phillip Jackson and Pauline Moran makes the integrity of brilliant characters. And the students had great personality and developed over the whole, particularly Damian Lewis as Leonard. All in all, solid mystery but does not rank along the best. 7.5 / 10 Bethany Cox
