An imagination is something terrible waste ... especially when you have talented actors. Writer / Director Jones wasted no time in the siding of the viewer and his protagonist. <br /> Anyone who shares an apartment with a slave is crying and laughing. Anyone who has arrived while a maid maid puts a ticket on fast car you'll just cry cry. We all wanted to rip a terrible touch on the man's head. These are just fragments of what's in store when watching "Cross Eyed", a sincere movie that should be a stone left for Jones and its sense of humor in front and behind the camera.
