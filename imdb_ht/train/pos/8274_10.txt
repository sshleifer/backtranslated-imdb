This movie is excellent. I found it very interesting. I thought Wendigo's legend was pretty cool. The act was also great, as well as costumes, productions, photography, direct and script. <br /> A very happy family, on vacation gets trapped in the middle of nowhere after striking a deer. A Huntsman then appears and is very upset and outraged about the fact that one of the antil's deer is broken. She then starts to drink the family and strange things start to happen. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie. It's worth it. Kudos cast, the crew and filmmakers. Two thumbs up!
