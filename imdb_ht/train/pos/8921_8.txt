I look at this page, and it looks like my disapproving have to listen to a whole person and annoy a real classic. Sure, I agree to let everyone have their opinions, but here's my: <br /> <br /> This movie should not be missed by any classic watcher veur, and should see many casual viewers around the world. Sure, he lost some of his flair and granite-age, especially in today's world of CGI effect, but that's not why you would like it. <br /> <br /> You would like it because it actually is a scary movie, even for today's standards. It's generally ickyness will creep you out just as much as the original audience, so do not slam a classic if you have not given it a chance. Look at it, but not with a critical attitude. Looks like it's fun, how it was originally intended.
