Gentle and intelligent play by two girls, Mischa Barton as Frankie, and Ingrid Uribe as Hazel, although the draw is rather a stretch of imagination. Young Hazel running for mayor seems out of place, to be honest. <br /> While the act well done by all concerned the movie tends to miss a genuine atmosphere of drama. Maybe we have grown to expect fearless facts in movies, rather like comparing Pollyanna how Green was my Valley! Never mind, each of them is good in their own way. <br /> I admire Joan Plowright though his role is somewhat submitted here. The middle of the road entertainment well suited for small viewers, and how beautiful at times to be exposed to fine-tuned music that is almost a rarity! <br /> I have found this movie to be a welcome change as it reflects toll, reflects on the growing years, and there is no violence to thank God. A warm family movie to enjoy.
