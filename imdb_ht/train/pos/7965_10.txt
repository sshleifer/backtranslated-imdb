This movie was scary ... she made me laugh and made a bowl, and most of all she had to talk about in her! This movie should be seen by all sorts of people! It is one of my favorite movies, and I just love it so much that I just commented on it !!! li rox! It is so heart felt and a wonderful storyline that makes up a big and sincere movie! My favorite character is shadow. This is because I think it is the most interesting and good. I used to have a gold retriever just like shadow, I miss it so much !!! He was my best friend and I knew that when he died, he would be in a happier place, but I miss him with all my heart !! This movie is the best I like it and everyone should be! Love your pet no matter what they do, take care of them forever !!!
