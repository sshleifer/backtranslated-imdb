Strange, this version of Open your eyes is more mature and more nuanced. Aided by Hindsight, Crowe's scenario is a lot tighter and more out than the original Amenabar. The Spanish professional should get credit for thinking in the first story, but there is no doubt that Crowe has improved on it - if just a little. Notice that you have no idea what the lead was made in your eyes, but you know almost everything about the lead in VANILLA SKY. That's what I mean no more "smacking out."
