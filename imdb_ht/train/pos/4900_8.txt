This is an original movie that Brits do well. Low budget, role-type role, well-executed. The story is a bit weak, a recently widower Judi Dench decided to round up the "blonde bombshells" of a very (almost all) girls girl who did during the war in London. The compulsive daughter thinks she went to the bathroom. made the way the movie allows young people to see that they do not have a monopoly over feelings, love and even lust! That "pollen of the elders" can have a good laugh too .. Judi Dench was superb as always, a pity we did not get to see more of the other "blond bombs, at the end of a little run I thought. Keeping thoughts as I saw that David Jason would have made an even better Patrick than Ian Holm, although he was quite adequate as the "transvestite" drummer. All in all an angry movie well worth a night with the girls: )
