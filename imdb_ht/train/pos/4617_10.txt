I was a fan of Jennifer Connelly since Phenomena, and after I heard about seven minutes in the sky, I saw it as soon as I could. The film is not just a comedy if you think a lot of things most of us went on as the kids and are now going to not only was the filmy movie that was ruled by the connelly jennifer phenomenon and captivating my attention that this movie was terrificly written to direct and act out it was one good deal I liked it and looked at it again and again and for those of you who enjoy a good laugh or love jennifer connelly you can not put in sight this movie !!!!
