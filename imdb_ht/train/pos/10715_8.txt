Teresa Pavlinek was a popular member of Toronto Second City cast. He has done many guest and advertising tasks here in Canada. Finally someone has the sense of creating a show for her. The support may sound good. I have now watched the pilot several times and I always find it refreshing. Though, I do not know why the shows show at Jane Show 2004. (I might be wrong) But as far as I was aware, the concept was shown in 2005 and appeared on Global TV in Canada in the beginning of 2006. It is a cool idea and hopefully it does well. Too this could not scare up with the Fuel Corner. Now I know Gas Corner is on CTV, but the two shows would be great piece of companion.
