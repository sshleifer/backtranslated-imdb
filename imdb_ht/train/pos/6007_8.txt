If you have not heard of this movie from Walt Disney Pictures, do not worry about it. It should be classified on the other Disney movies that are meant for educational purposes like "Family Planning". It was co-produced with Kotex to teach pre-teen girls on menstruation, supposably. It only educated at a superficial level, so it does not go into heavy details for the animated "Ram's head" / Sequence reproduction system. <br /> <br /> The movie shows the "Wonderful World of Disney" elements such as turning on the page and the use of animations telling the story. <br /> <br /> This movie is impossible to get, so if you can get the movie, better chance for you and enjoy.
