I really enjoyed fighting girls. It's something I could look over and over again. The act was fantastic and I thought Michelle Rodriguez did a good job in the movie. Very compelling I might say. The film will show how women should stand for what they want to do in life. He was very compassionate and again very hated at the same time. Facing an unbelieving father does not really help her. Even if he liked it he was really lovers. Her mother died when she was younger and that also put some sadness in the role. The love story was a part that I really enjoyed in the movie too. I felt the passion they had for each other. Then again drama lay in and then she likes to be choosing between her boyfriend and her life long dreams. I thought he ended up just right. It was the kind of ending where you have to decide what happened in the future for them. For everyone you love a movie based on a sport and a good draw I would suggest that you check this out one
