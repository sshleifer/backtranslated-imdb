This place in England during 1940. Three orphans (Carrie, Charles and Paul) are sent to live with Miss Price (Angela Lansbury). He does not want to be reluctant to take them in. It seems he is studying to be a witch in a correspondence course with the college of magic. (OK - I realize this is a family movie - College of Witchcraft ??? Come ON !!) Before it can finish the course even if the college is closed because of the war (???) and it is looking down Head of Professor Browne (David Tomlinson). And he and the kids travel on a bed with the help of a magical bed. I first saw this when I was 9 and waves to remember her love. It ensures that not hold as an adult! The story is funny (even for a fantasy), children are terrible actors and one of them (Charles) is incredibly reckless. Also Roddy McDowall is the third bill and only appears in two short scenes! There is also a trip to Isle of Naboombu that runs by animated creatures. I thought that would be fun but the animation is poor (for Disney) and it has a very violent and far too much football game between animals. There's a little favorable saving here: Lansbury and Tomlinson are just great; The songs (while forgettable) are beautiful; The long dance sequence on Portobello Road is very colorful and full of energy and the Oscar-winning effects are always very impressive at the end. But the weak story line, poor animation and incredible kids really pulled this one down. I heard the extended version is even worse! I can only give this a 7.
