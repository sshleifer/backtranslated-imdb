Unique film on confused women (Lindsay Crouse) who gets involved with boys well-known. Joe Mantegna gives an Oscar-gauge performance as the slickest of the band. Absolutely splendid first hour, as Mantegna shows Crouse "the ropes" in his hip toy. The story line unravels a bit later, but still stands as a unique portrayal of an innocent caught in a dark world. Definitely worth a shot.
