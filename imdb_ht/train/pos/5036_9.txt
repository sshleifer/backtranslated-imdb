Bill Paxton, Alien, Near Black, and Fame Terminator, surprises me with his debut as director for Frailty. It hit all cylinders, but there is only one implausibility near the end that involves FBI agents (Power Booth) that deduced a point from this otherwise chilling and thinking thriller thriller. Other than that, this movie was just fine. Bill Paxton plays Dad. It never gave a first name, but this is not a weakness in the movie. It in fact reinforces the movie, allowing the viewer to view it as a sort of symbol of some kind. He has a vision one day that he says sent out to God that he will come to an end and both his and his two sons, Fenton Meix (Matt OLeary) and Adam Meix (Jeremy Sumpter) Be fine spirits and kill them. The demons seem to be normal people who are killed, and this makes the viewer wonder whether father was just losing his head, or is he really doing God's work. There are scenes that reflect both points that add to the confusion and give the movie more suspense. <br /> <br /> The story is told in flashback by one of the sons who are now growing (Matthew McConaughey) and talking to FBI agent Wesley Doyle (Power Booth) who is very uncertain and just so . After all it's not everyday that someone comes to your office to tell you that he knows who the killer. The movie has many twists, and Bill Paxton directs the supreme by keeping us guessing without losing interest. The act is incredible. Two young people with Paxton work great together, looking like a normal family even though they are all involved in murder. As I said, one implosibility involves Booth's power, but it's really not a big thing. This was a beautiful film that involves faith and family.
