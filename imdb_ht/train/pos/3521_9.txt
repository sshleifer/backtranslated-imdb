Other reviews summarized the Noir film well. I just wanted to add to the "Whew!" Commenting one review made about the obviously coke-fed Elisha Cook epidemic. This was a doozy, I must say. Cook deserves some reputation for his frenzied performance. A bit of trivia that I surmising about: Cook emerged as a waiter in the 1941 film by Barbara Stanwyck, "Ball of Fire." It was a boy in the nightclub where Barbara was singing and legendary drummer Gene Krupa was drumming, most energy. Is it too late to suggest that Spuzzy Spidzy Cook in the film later, "Phantom Lady," was greatly inspired by Krupa's work, as witnessed by Cook 3 years earlier? <br /> If you look Krupa in the "Ball of Fire," I think you will remember some body movements clearly the same way. One is expected, of course, that he was not influenced by any drug at the time!
