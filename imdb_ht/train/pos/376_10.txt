The dramatic playberg's first movie is no down-down. It is a very well-done movie without any flaw on the life of an African-American woman. It also proves that not all African-American ethnic movies as the center of the story are to be eliminated by an African-American director. <br /> <br /> What I like about this movie is Spielberg's ability to make it very realistic despite the fact that it was based on a book. In addition, Danny Glover was excellent as Mr. And usually he is just himself in all of his movies. But in this, it completely branches out and is another person for once. But the performance of the film's full resistance from Whoopi Goldberg. It is excellent as Celie. You never forget those characters once you saw this movie. Now I hear that the music version of it's going to be a movie as well, and all I can say is: I hope it's as good as this one is, because this one is a movie that does not exist be missed.
