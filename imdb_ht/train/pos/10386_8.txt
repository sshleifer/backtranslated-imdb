what is wrong with you people, if you have not been hauled by the action machine sequences and jessica hot air simpsons then you're the bigger aim at the top. Of course the movie is not a masterpiece, I do not think he was aiming to be. It was fun and funny, I never watched the show when I was younger, and I only saw one episode, and when I watched the movie, I felt it was the same kind of atmosphere. The movie films were practically shaken, and the car sequences were good because it did not make me and drag as some of the 2furious 2fast scenes. and jessica Simpson is warm, I just want to have used him more in the sequence of actions. All in all, I had a hell at a time watching this and I would go and see it again soon and I'll buy it on DVD. People, enjoy it for what it is.
