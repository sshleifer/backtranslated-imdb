This has to be the best adaptation I've seen it's my favorite and I think it stays very close to the book. What really does this a must see even though it's dropped off of the lead actors. The wonderful Dalton Timothy is the best Rochester I've seen on brooding and tragic screens, while Zelah Clarke is the perfect combination of strength, courage, shyness and gentleness as Jane. The story (as I'm sure most people know), that's the young and plain Jane Eyre is a professor of a charity school for girls in the 1800s who recorded her service as a governor of the newspapers. He offered the post at the Governor of Thornfield Hall's toll of Adele's young parish in the mysterious halls and respected Mr Rochester owners. As the months go on, she falls in love with Jane and put into effect a few situations to try and see if Jane is as madly in love with her as she is with her .However, there is always a secret waiting to be discovered in Thornfield Hall and when it is the devastating effects. This is a moving drama and well-acting with beautiful places and gorgeous costumes as I have said earlier to act especially especially in Zelah and Timothy.
