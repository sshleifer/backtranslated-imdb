I saw the film in the Viennese a few years ago, where the audience loved it. I love it as well, Summer Phoenix performance always makes me, so I decided to write a comment. <br /> The story unfolds in London around 1900, where a jewish girl decides to become an actress. She tries to desperately become one, but it is not in front of a man to treat it seriously that he has achieved on stage, that he has talent and that he connects with the audience and emerges as a stronger human. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I think this is his strong point, that's exactly what Esther Kahn should be and Phoenix makes a brave decision making her Esther a rather boring girl. So, its transformation to the end is more powerful than it could otherwise. <br /> <br /> The cinematography is great, the images of London around the turn of the century are very dark and sad, you can see how unpleasant life was back then. <br /> <br /> The only fault in my opinion is the length of the movie, you loose touch with the characters, after all it is only about finding the actor in mind, so there is no dramatic action in the movie in. It's Phoenix credit that we do not drop the interest in the movie after the first hour.
