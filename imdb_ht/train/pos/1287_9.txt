"Let's Bowl" started out on local television in the Twin Cities. It came over late at night, something you would stumble across during navigation during your 7th bottle in the Hamm. <br /> The same ads were locally produced, featuring Wally Out Bar Brown, holding a microphone and stammering nervousness - "Ahh ... about you, Steve Sedahl." Not sure why, but one still makes me laugh. <br /> There was a bowling tournament featured under the guise of resolving a dispute between two gamers, but the game was high at the next and clips. Sedahl played it right, counter-balanced by Rich Kronfeld's rare and hilarious "Wally Hotvedt." Highlights include segments such as "How to properly throw an old bowling ball" (chuck them in a lake) and "Tips on Dating," where the duo "date" a couple of hookers and Wally ends with the bitter complaint, "I could have done this myself!" Another segment - what the duo did on the offsets - Steve featured in beer can disperse isolation, pigging out of the fridge while Wally struggled to climb the Cliffs of Falls Taylor's, dressed in tight blue talk blazer with over-size headphones. Hilarious! <br /> <br /> Wally's awestruck comment on "row bowlers," and his struggle to apply the euphemism correct to the various divisions were also evolving. <br /> <br /> "Let's Bowl" was collected by Central Comedy and had some good times, but the network never really knew what to do with it, running it during prime time and highlighting bowling "The Competition", which has never been pointed out at the show. Recognizing the constant cut off the flow and the side characters (Ernie, the Pig, Butch, etc.) were more distractive than anything else. Everything seemed to be running and forced. Even Jon Stewart dissudes Bowl on the show every day - (not enough lame, snake joke?) - A hymenity treatment for a worthy show far better. How often does a "kite bowl" come together in the world of modern television, a locally flavored mix of comical genius and crap total? The networks have the "crap total" part down cold, but it's a sad thing to watch them kill as a black, unusual, comical little gem like "The Bowl." <br /> <br /> Here's hoping to put it on DVD.
