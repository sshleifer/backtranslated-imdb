What would you say about a man who was about to marry and had his bachelor party and some of his closest friends in a Hawaiian bar bar? All sailing list until she takes her "hat". What would you say about her talking to one of the dancers suggesting and then sleeping with her? What would you say if this exact girl was her finance cousin? A new bar, right? Well Paul Coleman, played funny by Jason Lee, led this experiment to a painful blur and a new bar. I have to say this is one of its best leadership roles. However, I believe his role in Vanilla Sky has been better acting. His finances called Karen was played by actress Selma Blair during Karen, Becky, playing by Julia Stiles's beautiful and talented. As we return to where we left, Paul now has to deal with a problem that arises in another. It gets sick, has to deal with some people, and has played its lies and infiltration game or any member of each of the families can find P.O'ed, including one of his relatives who did not have an "intestinal movement" for 14 days. * Vomit * All of this leads to the long-awaited wedding and one hilarious scene before he recovered all the hell that Paul and his brother went to. <br /> <br /> Overall, something Guy is quite funny and it's all right. Sometimes the story may seem to go nowhere and you get tired of the scene here and have her hand in a mixed movie. But if you are a Canadian and a fellow fan of the sitcom's Brett Butt CTV, Gas Corner, you would recognize a role played by Fred Ewanuick, even those who play the hilarious Hank in the series. This movie is all right. It is another pen of Lee's hat (well an empty hat so far, however). I rating: 7/10 <br /> <br /> Eliason A.
