I just finished watching the 1st disc in a collection of 4-D (26 episodes) collections created in conjunction with the UCLA Film & Television Archives (S'More Entertainment, Inc.). So far (aside in Episode 1), the image quality is quite good. The DVD box is shown on the title page here on IMDb. "Mr. Peepers" is just as spacious as I first saw it (5 years old at the time) and Wally Cox is really endearing in this role. If you are in the mood for quiet comedy that sneaks up on you, as opposed to hit you over the top, you'll be treasure lucky to experience all the wonderful characters you might remember in your childhood. Although some of the gags are somewhat unrealistic, most are inventive and well-executed spirits ... and even these are the pleasure they enjoy. This is a television series that lives up to my childhood memories in it.
