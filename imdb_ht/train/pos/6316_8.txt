This is not a "loose", but a precise rumor, in the classical 1958 Monicelli "I Soliti Ignoti" and Toto ', Mastroianni, Gassman, Cardinale etc. That's the good reason, it copies all the funny characters and draws , even in detail (such as the scene where the photographer steals the camera from the local market). <br /> I looked superb version of the old times and I knew in the heart of all the gangs and ends, but I still enjoy "Welcome to Collinwood", which has its own freshness and atmosphere. It is interesting to see how life and how little thieves in Italy in 1950 are adapted to the USA 2002. Things do not change much. 8/10.
