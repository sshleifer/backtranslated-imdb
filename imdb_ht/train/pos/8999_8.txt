This film does not make any efforts to hide its true genre - a film B movie. It will be flat out telling you at the beginning of the definition of campy. It should also give the meaning of adjectives in cheese. But the two come together in this movie in the way that you go, "Hmmmmm ... that's so stupid!" and then you laugh. For example, there is a back stage of "16th century Japan", which shows a couple of samurai walking in the foreground of a temple. In the background of the temple, there are several tourists looking off the distance of slippers and shorts. Hmmmm ... hahahah! I could not stop laughing. And the act comes from decent, in loyalty, Oh my Lord, but that's what makes it funny. You will see some decent actors and then find others really horrible. I have to disclose a bit even though I've seen Stephanie Sanchez in several plays and is awesome. Time when it's the movie was very short though. I also saw Bryan Yamasaki playing several of the islands during my visit and she was also better in theater than in this movie. Anyhow, it's a fun movie, if you have nothing to do about an evening everyday.
