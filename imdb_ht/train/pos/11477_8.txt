In my honest opinion, everyone should see this movie at least once. He really puts things in perspective as I look at him. Even though it was fictional, this film is about something that can happen to your children. It shows how easy the children can hide both hatred for their school, and their plans to kill innocent people. This movie was not working in any other format. They pulled from the camera but kept, perfectly. <br /> It reminds us of April 20, 1999, when Eric Harris, and Dylan Klebold assassinated 12 students and then themselves. It also reminds us of the following stormstream media. Everyone wanted to see the Rampart video and everyone wanted to see the basement tape. This movie is a fictional version of our dreams being true. We get to see the kid behind the monster. <br /> <br /> The only bad thing about this movie is that it did not do well on the market, and some even knew it existed. If it had a preview of one blockbuster blockbuster, everyone would have gone to see what the big deal was about, Zero Day. <br /> I believe this is the best movie adaptation of a school shooting of some people who really tried it. The shooting itself only takes up to ten minutes in the air with a half-long film, because it mainly focuses on Cal and Andrew, and what they have done up to that point. <br /> <br /> If you have not yet seen this movie, go to rent it, and watch it. I guarantee that when it's over, you'll talk.
