For someone who remembers Jane in the Mirror Daily Mirror design, watch this film is an exercise in nostalgia. In what context it is wonderful, but smaller viewers would undoubtedly get the hype of comedy and would miss the point that the cartoon character actors. The plotline is also a little bit trickier for today's hearings, but reflects the naivety of the 40s and 50s pretty well. Jane, you must remember, was part of the escapist fantasy of the years during the war, creating the strengthening of the morale of the troops. It gave a double meaning to the "strip" of strip designs. <br /> The story has something in common with the stories of Edgar Rice Burroughs and Rider Haggard. The theme was a familiar one of readers in that era, a bunch of Nazi bumbling called that a few equally bumbling Englanders and put in the African jungle of course. <br /> <br /> For Jane fans, one must see. For the rest of you, a wet cube. <br /> <br />
