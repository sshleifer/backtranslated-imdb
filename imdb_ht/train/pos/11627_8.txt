Lisa is a hotel manager or owner and gets on a Miami flight. She ends beside an assassin called Jackson saying she has changed a room to a relative or her deceased father. The reason for changing the room is because Jackson wants to blow. <br /> It's a great movie suspicion because Lisa is trying many ways to escape the scheme that Jackson has established. The entire scenario is great and I thought they could spend some more time on the plane. There could be more of the plane, but other than that, the entire movie was pretty good. <br /> <br /> I especially liked the finish because it was heart-stopping. I did not know what would happen and I was amazed by it. For me, this movie just took off.
