Interesting mix of comments that it would be hard to add anything to the constructive. However, I will try. This was a very good action movie and some great set pieces. You will note I specify the genre. I did not criticize the lack of characterization, and I did not berate the act. Enjoy if it is a person, a good movie action medium. I could go on but I did my comment.
