Look, this is probably one of America's best movies to offer the rest of the world. This hated movie is hating freedom itself. I remember that the early 80's were a time of uncertainty. The economy was weak, communist threatened us all, and nuclear destruction was almost a certainty. From that confusion became a hero, Stroker Ace. Ned Beatty in the performance of this film has shown that he never yet be kind to cast as a single-dimensional victim of the desert. His triumph is an inspiration for everyone. Chemistry on the screen between Burt and Loni draws obvious Brad and Jennifer comparisons. Jim Nabors is a poet. Go to this evening movie!
