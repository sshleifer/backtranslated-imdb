I'm grateful to Cesar Montano and her crew to recapture the once-moribund Visayan movie. "Panaghoy" is expected by the presenter of a resurgence in the country's language (which claims more people than Tagalog). The dialect and detail form precisely reminiscent of this region of the Philippines. Downside: The corny and stilted act of the American antagonist. The other item that I did not appreciate was lack of authenticity in the "period" suit of the same character, and above all, his bright red kit-machine that I suppose was meant to pass for a 1930s roadster . Without these yet flattering details, "Panaghoy" would've been at least a 9 out of 10 on my rating - in the middle, Manoy Cesar! Addendum: This film ensures that Gallaga's peak in "Oro, Plata, Mata", which gave a different view of the Visayas during the Second World War. Hey, there are some parts where the cinema is observed back to Spielberg's "Purple Color" and the storyline begins reminiscent of "Noli Me Tangere".
