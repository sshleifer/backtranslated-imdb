I managed to tape this in my satellite, but I would like to get an original release in a format we can use here in the United States. Eddie is truly the glorious performer from San Francisco. I do not remember laughing so hard in a routine stop. My wife and I both loved this tape and her work on Glory I just wish I could buy a copy and help Eddie financially support in my purchase. We need more to show it available.
