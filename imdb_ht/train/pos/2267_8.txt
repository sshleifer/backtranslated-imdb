I have not read the novel, or anything else by Kurt Vonnegut, but I now intend to start. That's your flu from the very first frame, and they do not let go until the credit ends start rolling. Take you where you do not expect, the plot is fun at all. The rhythm is spot-on, nothing lasts too long, and this makes a perfect job of balancing between unexpected twists and allows the viewer to process what we've seen. It is well said and well-thought out. I never watched a movie that I feel might be particularly comparing this. It is intense and exciting, as well as funny and sad. The act is excellent, Nolte absolutely bright, Goodman again proves that he does not have to go to laugh, and Lee and Arkin are spellbinding. I could go on, really ... there is no role to treat in less than stellar performance. The correction and cinematography are beautiful, and all the visuals are great, and a couple of unforgettable and amazing. I will go for other movies directed by Keith Gordon, as well as the other two apparently relevant to this, from the author of the books. There is a scene of sexuality, and a lot of content and disturbances in this. I recommend this to anyone who can appreciate it; it's not nice. 8/10
