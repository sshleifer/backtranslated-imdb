This comic comic comedy shows what can happen if a section in London, in this case Pimlico, has declared himself independent of the rest of the UK and its laws, taxes and post-war restrictions. Merry destruction is what would happen. The explosion of a war bomb led to the discovery of ancient documents showing that Pimlico was ceded in the Duchy of burgundy centuries ago, a small historical notification has long since been forgotten. For the new Burgundians, however, this is an unexpected opportunity for living as they please, free of any interference from Whitehall. Stanley Holloway is excellent as the minor city politician who suddenly finds himself leading one of the sweetest world in the world. Dame Margaret Rutherford is a fun as the storyteller teacher where and Pimlico. Others in the stand-out cast include Hermione Baddeley, Paul Duplis, Naughton Wayne, Basil Radford & Sir Michael Hordern. Welcome <br /> Welcome to Burgundy!
