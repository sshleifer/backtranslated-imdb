I really like this movie ... when I started to look it I thought I would get bored very soon, but it surprised me ... I thought it was a great movie and saw it a few times now . The characters are credible and I must say that I fell in love with Brian Austin Green all over again (the first time they were Beverly Hills 90210). I would recommend this movie if you're a fan of it, but I agree with another comment made earlier, the ending is sort of irritating. I would like it to turn out a little different! Never forget, good storytelling.
