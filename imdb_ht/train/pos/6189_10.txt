Who would have imagined - Hal Hartley created a Syrian Syrian capillary while keeping his signature idiosynkratic style. The fusion is very fun. <br /> Do not see a Hal Hartley film for about a decade, I approached this with some precautions. Its brilliant production in the nineties has impressed critics with audiences and their unique style and dialogue. The film's earlier film was presented with colorful characters and offered live observations - often in the Long Island, New York or New York City - compared to the perspective. ranging from the description of this movie as a "spy thriller". For my beautiful surprise, Hartley managed his well-established style mall and focused on producing a very original drama in international intrigue. It works in more ways than one might imagine. Hartley's film retains the dialogue and concentration of its trademark brand, as well as a social cinema style. <br /> In addition it is very appropriate to provide the current situation in the world and the state of war favored by black elements on all sides. Hartley brought all his skills into something new - a political film worthy of mentioning the same breath as Syrians. Surely it comes to its own. The cast does a great job to interpret vision and Hartley style. Fans of Parker Posey will see him in full bloom here, always with us and more ripe and gorgeous than before.
