I have never seen a movie star Barbela Steele, and I still have a suckler for a good haunting story (especially for these wonderful pictures like "The Legend of Hell House" and the original versions of the "Haunted" and "House on Haunt Hill"), so I had a feeling that the "Blood Castle" would be right up my go. And boy, it was never! This French-Italian coproduction, while perhaps not the classic that Steele's first movie cinema, "Black Sunday," remains that day, is nevertheless a very atmospheric, enthusiastic maker of the genre spook. Movies in black and white, it manages to transmit a miasma to really climb. The film worries a journalist who wagered one Blackwood Lord and an author named Edgar Allen Poe that he could spend the night at Blackwood's castle on the night all day Saints, when the demons of the dead of the castle reenact their fate. The viewer gets to see these deaths, and they are very pretty horrible, for the most part. The movie really sends shivers up the spine, and the DVD insists that I'm just watching - thanks to the fine of Synapse - even features an amazing Topless scene and some moderate lesbianism! And Barbara is wonderful in this movie; It's otherworldly beauty and it's good to play a sympathetic spectator. His only presence turns a ghost fantasy story into something really memorable. Not for nothing has he called the "Queen of Terror."
