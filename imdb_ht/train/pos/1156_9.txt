The following year I followed a soap on TV. So I was curious about this movie, and I was so rewarded to get it. It's a wonderful parody of soap, and jealousy, insects of the usual actors, and all kinds of exuberant beauties. But more than anything - an amazing cast with an incredible script. How does anyone get all those top-notch actors to play in such an unusual movie? And how does this little movie find the writers writing the perfect lines? I have never heard anyone talk about this movie or even admire hearing of it, but it's wonderful and I highly recommend seeing it. Sometimes I'll throw it on while doing housecleaning, and finish sitting on the couch, watching, laughing and enjoying the wonderful thing. Many congrats to everyone who did it.
