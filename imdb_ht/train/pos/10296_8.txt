Well funny Jim Carrey car who has him as a news reporter who temporarily gets the power of God and pirated havoc. Carrey is back to the ground accustomed here and seems to be having a good time, and Jennifer Aniston as putting her on girlfriend is also good and affiliated. The story is predictable extreme from the cast (including Morgan Freeman as "God") is great and make the movie worth catching. GRADE: B
