BASEketball is one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. It's a movie-in-wall starring South Park creators Matt Stone and Trey Parker. They play two snooping friends who create a sport in the entrances that go on to become a national sensation. Most of the gags are really hilarious but the funniest parts of the movie are when players try to "psyche-out" other members of the opposing team. There are no rules on what is not allowed, so naturally they do the crazy things possible. A flaw in this movie is that the pace is way too fast, and after watching for about half an hour I find myself asking "Wow this over already?" Another hilarious part of the movie was how Joe and Doug continuously harassed Squeak, who is a hyped-up little guy. BASEketball is a classic comedy with some very quotable lines, and it is very fun to look!
