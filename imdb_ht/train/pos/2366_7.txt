This film (with the alternate title "Martial Law 3" for some reason) introduced me to Jeff Wincott for the first time. And it was a great introduction. Although I have never heard about it before, it seemed to be an excellent fighter. The scene of action in this movie are GREAT! There are many of them, too, by the way. The battle recruited at the Peacekeepers HQ is especially good. There's just something about a single guy to beat the crap out of a bunch of people in really fun. And for the rest of the cast: Brigitte Nielsen was a good choice for the villain. Role like this fits it (but others do not). Matthias Hues also did a good job, as always. He is a great fighter and character-like character, and was a good rival for Wincott in this movie.
