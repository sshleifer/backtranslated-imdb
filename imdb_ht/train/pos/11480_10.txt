Cut The Chase: This is one of the most amazing, most intense films I've seen in a long time. The first movie of the year that left me absolutely diverting. I could feel my way out of the theater, so I was so overwhelmed. <br /> I've stared at the screen for about fifteen minutes trying to find some way to describe the power of this movie, and just missed. Explain any aspect of it - the format of video-style diary format, painted in the event of inflation, the strength of the characters - just seems to trivialize it all. Some may find it ridiculous that any killer might be characterized as normal. But then not all the ravin kills digging cumin in the mouth. Many people are very regular, people are bitter. They're just tuned differently. <br /> And this maybe the worst thought of all.
