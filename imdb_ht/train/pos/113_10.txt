I have not seen this movie in about 5 years, but it still does. <br /> <br /> When asked about my favorite movie, this is the one I seem to always mention first. There are certain films (works of art such as this movie, "Dark City", and "Break the Waves") that seem to touch a place in your, a safe and hideous place for yet tender, that they make a Lifelong impressions on the viewer, not unlike a life-changing event, such as ending in a serious relationship or the death of a friend ... This movie "shook" me when I first saw li. She left me with an emotional hangover that lasted for several days.
