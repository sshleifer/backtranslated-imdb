Excellent film showing the domestic lives of two old chess chains. They could not live together separately. Babbling always, sometimes at the same time, was torn and re-hashed past; go on and on what might be. I found myself laughing at times, but mostly I took and how sad and abandoned these women were. Look at this one.
