I was very happy to go and see a Milanese movie shot in Milan. Alessandro Alatri is a Roman director who has understood well and fortunately printed in a Milanese philosophy movie. <br /> <br /> Movie tells the story of a standard-career-Milanese couple, starting from the "birth" of death. The Birth of the Wedding is so typical from any scheme that becomes original and involves all the wedding guests in a flash back story of how the couple came to each other and felt in love. Life is difficult to "urge" in Milan and after the old sweeties days have become tougher and tougher, then finally produced: a child, who instead of strengthening the more couples his relationship weakens because "the selfish effect" typical of a modern "metropolis" personality. The advertising environment with all the "creative" under stress atmosphere helps get involved with the plot. We are losing their lives worth and this well and deeply reflected in this beautiful and sharp film from Senza Pelle's director. <br /> <br /> The well-chosen actors, Stefania Rocca beautifully and well-marked, with a positive surprise, an unexpected good Fabio Volo, well known to the "garbage" TV series: Le Iene.
