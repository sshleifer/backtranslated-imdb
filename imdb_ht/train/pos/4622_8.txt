I originally came across seven minutes Linda Feferman in the air when I was 14 and working in a video store and I liked it. I just looked at the movie again and realized that it was a lost treasure. The movie stars Jennifer Connelly, nearly twenty years before she would go in to win an Oscar for mind ideas, such as Natalie Becker. Byron Thames plays his best friend in the world, Jeff Moran. The film is definitely a mild, cutie and smoother version of the Pretty in Pink and some wonderful qualities in the 1980's, which is exactly why it's so good. It's honest, not forced like these films, and parents will enjoy watching this film and having the kids. When Natalie's father leaves home on a business trip, Jeff convinced she should move in because his home sucks. With support from Natalie's friends, Polly, played exquisitely by Maddie Corman, she allowed him. But this movie is not about putting the child in situations and seeing what they can get away with. The three drives are so natural and the script, surprisingly so honest, that what comes to the best of their performance is broken heart. These characters really care about each other. It is a great movie to show children who are reaching pre-teen adolescents. <br /> <br />
