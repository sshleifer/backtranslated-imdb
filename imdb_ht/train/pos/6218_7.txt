79/100. Fred Astaire and Jener Rogers have never done anything but great movie together. Although this is not one of the best, it's an excellent music. There are some outstanding musical numbers, good support from Randolph Scott. Two remarkable appearances, Betty Grable and Lucille Ball make memorable screen performance early. Ball is particularly good, and a blonde too. "Let's Face Music and Dance" is one of the best duo numbers ever. Harriet Hilliard, best known as Harriet Nelson of "Ozzie and Harriet" playing Roger's ginger sister. The basic draw is very familiar, but with a cast this exceptional, it works. Excellent art direction and notes.
