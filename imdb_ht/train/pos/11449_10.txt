This by far was one of the most beautiful portraits of someone I've ever seen on the screen. Andy Goldsworthy is a kind of person on extinction. He views the earth with nature and admiration with respect that it is primitive in a good sense. His purity, honesty and kindness evenly as you look at his work as simplistic yet full of motion pieces of art. I was surprised how his patience created his piece, and how patiently he accepted the end. Sometimes prematurely, but his Scottish sense of humor covers his disappointment disappointing. The film is chic shoot and has the same flow that the Goldsworthy art has. It combines nature and art in a minimal way as it is in itself. Fred Frith's notes are organic enough to mix everything together without interfering with his naturalistic sound. This is generally a great piece of work in every aspect. it has no limit as far as age goes.
