I saw this first movie on some movie channels (HBO?) Some time ago. I was a fan of Public Enemy, NWA and other rap well and saw CB4 in the theater. Anyway, the promo to keep my eye, and I wanted to see what it was all about. Well, right off the bat I knew it would be good (WITH!) And I was good. The parody songs alone make this film worth watching over and over (my peanuts), but the overall flow and delivery of the movie was great. You had the love of satire in rap group (obviously NWA), certain rapports (Eazy E, Flava Flav, Ice Cube), and the humor of the three members of NWH. Who can forget Tone deaf scratch and her ass? It's too bad this movie did not get the credit it deserves, as it was covered by CB4 during the releases, but in my opinion is a better movie. If you know and love the 'gang' 90's rap, you'll watch and laugh with this movie for a long time. If you do not enter or do not like 'rap', you will enjoy the jokes at the expense of the genre.
