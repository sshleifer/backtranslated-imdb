John (Ben Chaplin) is a bankruptcy banker who lives in a small town near London. Even though the Internet, she contacted a Russian agency of brides. She chooses Sophia (Nicole Kidman? The guy could be lonely and shy, but certainly has a good taste, not it?) And when they met with each other, he realized he did not speak English. The communication between each other is fundamentally limited by gender (again, imagine, what a terrible situation for the guy, just have some sex with Nicole Kidman!). On his birthday, two Russian friends in his visit. Then many surprises will happen. I liked this movie: first, it's almost impossible to be 'branded'. Is it a black comedy, an action, a thriller movie? I believe all the choices are correct. Nicole Kidman is gorgeous as usual, and I'm very curious about her Russian: is it speaking Russian in an accurate accent, or just faking? Anyway, I found it an enjoyable movie. My vote is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "An Ispa Perfeita" ("The Perfect Apache")
