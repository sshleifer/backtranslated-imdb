I've seen this on television so long ago that I can not remember when it was, but it still means as one of the most horrible, the most unnerving films I have ever seen. There is an unusual but intense doubt induced by the woman in black cache at the edge of the frame, not quite clearly visible, so that you feel (like the hero's jurist), whether its just imagination or not. It is also one of the few films that really made me afraid to keep watch. "Value production" must be hanged, good movie is about a director's ability to create atmosphere using movie, actor, location / sex, music, attention to detail, and ... imagination. A real gem.
