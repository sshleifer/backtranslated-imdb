Watching this again after a lot of years and remembering the flop it was about its original release, I wondered at how it was caught. One of the reasons for his failure was that a generation just thought it was about indulgent crap and a younger one was disappointed that he did not show the hippie glory. See now it is clear that Antonioni was already aware of and captivated by the heady mix of fervent enthusiasm for change and a lack of clear vision for the future. The lead fade is excellent and it is shame that they have taken so much flakes for the feeling of the film's failures. They are ideal and transmit perfectly to the various contradictions and demonstrate a better fun of lovemaking. I blame others for emphasizing the student's rebellious sequence at the beginning, but to say that out of having about this is one of the most beautiful photo directors and it certainly got the best of the man and natural landscapes. Oh, and I do not even mention the extremely explosive finish.
