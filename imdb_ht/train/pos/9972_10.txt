This is definitely a proper update for the original, except that "party on the left is now part to the right." Like the original, this film rails against a federal government that overrides its limitations and considers personal liberty. It is a warning of how freedom of our political freedoms is in an era of over-zeal, and over-powerful federal government.

The message is so non-PC, I am wondering that this film can be done - at least not without bringing the federal government via the IRS down to musicians "Free or Dead Live" is the motto of Jason Priestly's hat, as it is brilliantly shown by the "voice", and which is "The Voice" or "The Live Voice". Summary of the dangerous (in some) messages in this movie. <br /> <br />
