As the story of my family goes, my father, Milton Raskin, played the piano for the Dorsey band. After Sinatra joined the group, my father practiced with him for hours on end. Then, at one point in time, my father told Sinatra that he was actually good to be tied up with as a small band (band), and that he should venture off on his own. Then Sinatra had enough credit 'under her belt' to do just that! Dorsey never forgave my father, and the rest, as they say, is story. <br /> I have some photos and folders of this effect, and this is done by Berkley University in California. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I've seen just about every movie sinatra more times than I mean, and her movies never get old. . . Thank you Frank
