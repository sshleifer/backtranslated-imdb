There has never been anything like it, that's for sure. This episode, seemingly redundant trilogy only really makes sense to take as a whole, and as such is not a movie about Groovin 'Gary, Utah cross-dressing sensation. He is very self-conscious of a film about how the reunion meeting of Groovin 'Gary. For Harris the entire project is clearly a prolonged and spectacular constraint of guilt and repentance. He tried to thank his sin - yes, Gary tried suicide after the initial document was revealed - in Corrections, Books, and Conventions, claiming Hollywood-narrative standby as the best friend and the happy ending challenge ( two of these different, with a hardware adjustment in the Glover version) and turning them into its own very personal use. So, during his term remains a movie about sex and gender, the structure ensures that it is also a movie about movie - but on an almost unprecedented level of complexity. There is just so much to go on; In telling and re-telling this story Harris is in the right place at the right time three times in a row, and he does not miss the opportunity to do something in it. Immensely moving, and as deeply as ever.
