If this movie proves only one thing, Keaton is, was and always will be a funny at heart, even when dodging bullets, heading for the electric chair and getting the wrong end in a prison line information. <br /> But "Johnny Dangerously" goes on to prove even more. In the '80s, the Zaz Boys (Zucker, Abrahams, Zucker) were the pinnacle of the world of genre parody. But there were several pretender of the throne. This time, Amy ("Fast Ridgement High Times") Heckerling tries his hand, with an amazing amount of TV writer behind the script (go and check). <br /> <br /> This slap-slippery parody slug in the 1930's-cops-and-gag "movie sters launches just about every cliche for a loop and even adds a few clicks that did not exist way back. British, not only is the ever-reliable Keaton but Johnny's title, but so funny guys and dolls like Piscopo, Henner, Stapleton, Boyle, Dunne, DeVito, Walston and just about each other in Hollywood which has been happening in the immediate vicinity. You should be surprised at how many figures you will recognize. I know I was. <br /> <br /> And the jokes? Well, when they start out, they come to you fast and furious, like a machine gun. There are too many to count at the start, topped off with a crazy theme song by Weird Al Yankovic. But you have to look for them when they reload. And they have reloaded a little too often. <br /> <br /> Everyone tries, they seem to have fun and I laughed a lot of the time. In the end, though, there was plenty of time to think about how certain scenes could be funnier - not usually the best thing to think about after watching a comedy. <br /> But for a slow night when there's nothing good on TV, pop into "Johnny" and be ready for some "Harmful" laughs. Check "Dangerous Johnny" ... not a "bastiga".
