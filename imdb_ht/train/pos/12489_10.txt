First, nobody can understand why this movie is rated so badly. Not only is this the first real horrible film since a very long time for me that is very hard-boiled with a long decade of horror experiences starting with driving in black rides (Ghost Train) as a child. Second, the main actress Cheri Christian has a face that allows you to expect that she will be the leading actress of great pictures of the future. Thirdly, this woman is so beautiful that I suggest the directors to remove all these Cameron Diazes, Eva Mendezes, and how ever these ephemeral bulbs light up. Christian woman is not a light, but a sun. <br /> However, "black remains" is also considerable metaphysical importance. They think that pictures show creatures in the intermediate right between reality and "imagination" that are not visible with one 'own eyes is not new. But I never saw in a movie before that these animals are visible on the pictures only for certain people and only at certain times. This means that the picture is not just an iconic photo of reality (by which reality turns into a sign), but becomes an alternative form of reality that can change as the "real" reality can. Being a sign, changing in the picture means that it influences the photo objects, this sign is behaving like an object. Now in our usual world of perception, it is common that objects change the signs. F.ex, if a person grows a bird, his photo shows him with beard, bloody, as he did before. But the opposite, changing into objects by signs would mean that the picture with first beard and only then the beard grows on the man. This is, very simply expressed, the case occurs with photos taken by the main character in the prison, in this movie. This is new, and we must be grateful for all new things in horror movies that usually just repeat and reorder the effects and features already well-known, especially since silent times.
