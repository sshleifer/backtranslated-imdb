EDDIE MURPHY DELIRIOUS is the easiest fimisest stand-up movie movie I've ever seen. Most stand-up acts usually have lulls at some point, but not those folks. For 90 minutes there is not one single side-divisively funny time. From that moment Eddie makes a very scary impression on Mr.T, the laughter does not stop. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this was done in 1983, and Eddie had done nothing almost as funny. It's incredible that the man who wrote this show is brilliant phenomenon, wrote a movie called HARLEM Nights that was not very funny at all. <br /> <br /> Eddie, if you're out there, please go back home and make a DELIRIOUS VIDEO movie concert. Believe me your fans will love you for it. And I think you know that.
