I'm a fan of kung fu, but not a fan of Woo. I have no interest in Gangster movies filled with the on-the-top gun-play. Now martial arts; * this * nice! And Jan Woo surprised me here by producing a very entertaining kung fu movie, which almost has * over * fighting, if such a thing is possible! This is a good thing. Many of the battle scenes are very good (and some of them are less good), and the main characters are fun and likable. The bad guys are a bit too unbelievably evil, but fun is not the least. You gotta see the sleep wizard !! It can only fight when it's sleeping - it's hysterical! <br /> <br /> When rehearsing look, however, Hurray's latest chivalry may tend to get a bit boring and skidding, also especially because many of the fighting scenes are actually not that good. Therefore, I miss it "only" a 7 out of 10. But it really is almost an "8". <br /> In every one of the best kung fu cinemas, made smack-dab in the heart of the prime kine fu cinema. All the movies are really good at kung fu from mid-1970's, with some remarkable exceptions from the late '60ies and early' 70ies (and early '80ies, to be fair).
