An absolutely brilliant show. The second season began where the first ended, with many mysteries. Stop at most, if not all episodes and mysteries everywhere. One that made me think and think again. It's really amazing how the writer can come out with all the connections and connect all the characters together and combine all the elements to make their lives in the characters of the show for sense. Never fail excites and I'm looking forward to the new season. Hopefully more secrets will reveal and at the same time more mysteries will be solved. Good selection of cast too much for this show, fit the characters perfectly. Really can not wait to finally discover the secret. Hopefully all the hype will not spoil the finish.
