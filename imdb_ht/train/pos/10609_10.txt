I saw this film last night on cable and extraordinary. What I like most about is that it is understated and low-key, but deeply sincere. Henry Thomas' (he plays the child at E.T.) performance is inarticulate mastery (he is supposed to be a man in some words). David Straithern is a wonderful crazy oven. And miraculously (given that we're talking about a Hollywood product here) a baby serves as a primary character, but one that does not act or has lines, but rather IS (and is glowing at that). Interestingly remember Thomas's mysterious relationship. E.T. was this movie core; while his bail. The baby serves as the core of "a good baby." Then there is the music - ah, what music !! Welch's Melody Melody is wonderful & the whole note is gorgeous mountain music country. <br /> <br /> This movie is pretty atmospheric. I recommend it very.
