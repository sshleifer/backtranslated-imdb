I wanted to see this for the longest time, James Merendino is a great director. SLC punk is one of my favorite movies, and in the first ten minutes of this movie I thought it was a great follow-up after that though, it started to crack. Acting and the directions were terrific. In fact, everything in the movie seemed to flow except for the script. At times, the only thing to keep my attention was the fact that at the disposal was the most beautiful woman in the world, Claire Forlani. This movie was good, but I was expecting more. Look for great gastro by Chi McBride, and Chris McDonald.
