It was originally meant to be a film that Gene Kelly would star in, but when the musicians could not find him being the "greatest actor in the world", and the result is very good. Basically, Nathan Detroit (Frank Sinatra) is having trouble doing what he does best, setting up a wonderful cute dice toy because he needs $ 1000 to get the place. So, to get the money he needs, he has a $ 1,000 bet with friends of Sky Masterson (Marlon Brando) that he can not find Sergeant Sara Brown (Big Golden Globe win, and BAFTA nomination Jean Simmons) go with him 'Hangman. Meanwhile, Nathan has trouble trying to get rid of the woman who wants her to ask her hand in marriage, Miss Adelaide (Vivian Blaine). Also begins Robert Keith as Lieutenant Brannigan, Stubby Kaye as Nicely Nicely Johnson and B.S. Chicken like Big Jule. An exciting romantic comedy music, with Brando singing his own songs, and Sinatra being smooth and cool. She has nominated Oscars for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration, Best Movie, Best Costume Design and Best Music for Jay Blackton and Cyril J. Mockridge, has been nominated for the BAFTA for the best film from any source, won the Golden Globe for Best Movement Movement - Music / Comedy. Frank Sinatra was the number 43 of the 100 pop culture pop culture, Marlon Brando was the number 30 of the 100 largest movie stars, the number 11 of the 100 Great Sex Symbols, was number 4 on 100 Years, 100 Stars - Men , Sinatra had 35 numbers, and Brando was the number one of the world's largest actors, "Chance to Make a Lady" was number 42 on 100 Years, 100 Songs for, the movie was number 23 in 100 years in music, and he number 36 on 100 Biggest Musicals.
