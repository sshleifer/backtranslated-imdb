This is a gem, a real piece of Americana for all that implies. If you are self-programming to resist "life-affirming" stories, just stay away and leave the fun of the rest of us who still believe. And what makes the mirror on the cake is delightful is that it is fact based on an old real rich story, does not need to pick-up that the details have changed to make a compact story. Chris Cooper is one of the worlds greatest and most complex actors, self-conflicting, under-line performers in the core of his father's portrait described only being pulled to success by a person with his / her skills and insight. The simple comments, refusing to accept a father who tried to lay down the law all the while that it may be maybe off-track, expose the limitations of the commentator, by the writer or act. This is not for the cynical, or the simple mindset.
