This is one of the biggest sports movies ever made by Hollywood. What a wonderful story about one of the great sports figures in the American history. What makes the story of James J. Corbett especially interesting is that Mr. Corbett presents the style of boxing that continues this day. In this sense, J. J. Corbett was truly innovative. But returning to the movie, all the performances were excellent. Alexis Smith was beautiful. Indeed, it looked like Nicole Kidman. And although it's a piece of period, the story holds the test of time; he did not go to stale. Port's Ward Portraits of John L. Sullivan have to do one of the great paints in a current figure of sports in the history of cinema and scene of the realistic, well-performing and highly effective boxing scenes. That coupled with a great script to make this movie a must.
