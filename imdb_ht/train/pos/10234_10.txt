<br /> <br /> Burning Paradise is a combination of Neo-Shaw Brothers action and the Urban Cinema Ringo Lam. When watching the movie, they can feel the scene scenes are only mediocre in nature but that's not the problem, attitude and atmosphere that counts. This big movie both! Still trying to be different than his contemporary, Lam gives us traditional heroes (Fong Sai-Yuk and Hung Shi-Kwan) and put them in an "adventurer in the lost box" setting. However, these are not the comic-light incredible incarnations that you might see in a Jet Li movie. Instead these guys fight to the death and brutal result. What makes the movie even better is that anyone can die at any time, no keep caught. Too bad, they do not make movies like this more often.
