Definitely in the top five of the best John Garfield movies are pride in the Marines. Read the true story of Marina Al Schmid private in the price of his eyes, while wounding occurred in a Japanese horde of Guards on Guadalcanal. <br /> <br /> The story is nicely segmented in three parts, Al Schmid's home life where it is a simple working hard that's just getting serious with a woman and who loves nothing better than bowling night his. Pearl Harbor is bombarded and is at war as millions of other people were. <br /> <br /> The second part is in Guadalcanal and we see a part of the action where it is in an isolated machine gun, caught in the Japanese troops. His actions prevent marine positions from being overgrown, but a grenade makes in his eyes. But of course the third part is her painful adjustment to civilian life and to reassure herself that people do not just care for her from pity, most of all this girl has seen Eleanor Parker. This film was broadcast on TCM on John Garfield's 95th birthday and had a documentary about Garfield hosted by her daughter. One of the interviewers said that Garfield was the most credible actor in the classroom role of having and maintaining a union map. <br /> <br /> In which respect he was lucky in that he made land with Warner Brothers in Hollywood. Though he was holding gangster in the gangster role in the tradition of this studio, Garfield was terrific in those parts because of his background, because he was out of Al-Qud's quality of life, with the exception of Garfield's background. <br /> In which respect it was perfect to play the part of a working class hero like Al Schmid who accepted the responsibility to defend his country. No heroic super here, just a guy who would rather have returned to Philadelphia, but doing a job that must have been done. <br /> It's a great party for Garfield. It is a movie that should not be missed. I am surprised if this is true of Al Schmid.
