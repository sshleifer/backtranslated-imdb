************** Probably sporty ********** There is one reason why I saw this movie and that was because I have a massive break Richard Belzer. (I do not know that much about humor) There were some parts that were funny like Barbie and Ken Spoof and dealers and skit the president. Mind you this is sometimes raunchy (Bay, I say bullies?) It was at funny times, but it could be better. Probably if they have spent more time in the humor and less time getting women strip, the film would have been funnier. Some skits just make you want to gag, and cringe, other skits make you laugh and strangely enough to think. Unfortunately this movie has dates. If you have an angry crush on Richard Belzer (so worth it) it's worth checking it out and seeing chevy chasing.
