This is right up to the top of my list of the most mysterious comic shows I've ever seen. I laugh so hard, I'm sure I miss half the jokes. Izzard's exhibition as the brilliant gifted comedy he is. What I particularly love is that it seems never to be "dumbing down" the material for his audience. Its casting is impeccable and the routine tied together as a piece of performance rather than just a series of gags. Heads up.
