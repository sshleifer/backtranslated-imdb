Pegg had a few hits in the past years, starting with "Shaun of the Dead" in 2004, filming on "Hot Fuzz 2007", early 2008 it out with "Run Run Run Run" and now Come on, "How to lose friends and alienate people" that is in many ways one of my favorite comedy in the year. The film is about Sidney Yound, a man who writes a missed magazine that makes fun of the celebrity mostly because it's not one of them. Anyway, one of the successful magazine owners (played by Jeff Bridges) invited her (from Nostalgia) to work in her magazine. Sidney is of course excited and moved to America, having read a girl now writing a book, with hilarity result. <br /> <br /> This movie is great and I hope more out like it in the near future. Pegg was once again giving people everywhere a good movie and I can not wait to see the third part of the blood and ice cream trilogy "Paul". I missed this movie 81%.
