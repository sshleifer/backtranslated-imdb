Preston Waters is off to a bad summer. In addition to his birthday, there is nothing else that looks promising. <br /> First he had to share his own bedroom with his brothers who will run a business. They can not do it in the rooms because they do not have enough space. Off to a birthday party it only gets $ 6 tokens while others get $ 32, $ 35, and even $ 50. When one of his four birthdays comes early, he only gets a check out for $ 11. <br /> <br /> Go to the bank he learns he needs $ 200 at least to start an account. Leaving the bank, an intruder stole the check. Pursuing after the kid almost gets him running on (definitely his bike losing) by a criminal named Quigley (played by Miguel Ferrer). The Quigley just got out of the bank too from giving the owner $ 1,000,000 to this guy tomorrow. Quigley started writing a check for the damage, but only succeeded in writing his name before a police car dry area. Scared, he gives Preston the check, informing him to give his father finish out. <br /> <br /> That evening though, Preston tells her dad that she does not want a new bike, she wants to clean her room back, better yet her own home. His father limits him in his room for the rest of the evening. Moping in his room Preston face can not find any worse he realizes that he forgot about the check as he's still in his shirt pocket. It is empty. <br /> Using the computer and after careful consideration, it makes it out for $ 1,000,000. The next day, while trying to cash it from the bank, he took the owner who thought he was the one he was supposed to give the $ 1,000,000 and make. It does not matter if the real man named Ji comes at a later time. <br /> Now the three have to follow Preston down. Meanwhile, Preston has fun buying all sorts of things including his own home, and even going to date with a disguised bank lady who's really with FBI agent (who tries to follow the 3 bad guys). He makes this person up to Mr. Macintosh who he works for and even plans for a party on his birthday. <br /> <br /> But eventually things catch up (the money runs out, the bad guys get it). <br /> Overall, a very funny flick of films. Miguel Ferrer plays his role very well. If you enjoyed it in another Stakeout, you'll love it here. He does all kinds of wicked things. <br /> <br /> Rick Ducommun (the stress out of stress from the Ghost of the car) plays a wonderful friendly driver in this movie.
