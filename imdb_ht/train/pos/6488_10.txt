War is hell. But this documentary in WWII is the sky. <br /> Not only is this series of a breath-taking, almost-full look at World War II, it's a poetic masterpiece said clearly and superbly by Laurence Olivier. /> <br /> This documentary series defines the genre. It's rapidly time, no doubt, but you will enjoy all of them and want to go back for more and more. (I have the series on DVD and I probably watch the series three times a year). Surely, this is a bit impeccable in film-making. Other than Olivier, the best part of the series will listen to the veterans telling stories; whether it's a current fight or finding a stuffy pig so they might have something delicious to eat. <br /> I'm going to watch it now (again, i ... 11th time).
