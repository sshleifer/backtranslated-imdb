Gotta starts with Ed Furlong on this one. You are required. God bless this kid. $ 5 bucks tells her character in this film is what she really loves in real life. It has one-liner or two that made me almost blown snot because of the subtle humor of the script. You know all the trials that this guy has gone through in recent years and does not even seem like Furlong is even acting. Perhaps that's why his performance was good. Even with Madsen. You keep thinking, "I bet this guy is really like this in real life." Does Madsen even have to act? Just natural. Vosloo was obviously moved on from the type-cast mummies guy. I think the surprise of this movie was Jordana Spiro's performance. His reaction is spot-off in this film. I fight if it's hot or not, but realize I'd just like to see more of it. <br /> <br /> Not a big fan of shooting 'em out / film type movie. But what I'm a fan of them is film and many twists and turns try and keep you guessing. It does not just steal your standards on a bank, kill hostages, and the good guys win the end of the movie type. Twists are kept on coming ... and come. <br /> <br /> The scene of coffee works best with the cats but who kept to show what it really loves in there. Do not gloss down on a bit. Think like Bourne ultimatum "lite" style on some stage of the coffee. <br /> <br /> And for fans of Bo Bice fans - actress Curtis Wayne (who plays Karl) will make you a double take. These men are twins. <br /> As I was looking at I was wondering why some of the actors had alien accidents and what they did in this small town. It made sense to the end that these people smuggled things in other countries / states so they could have these accents. But more is revealed in the bonus features of how some of the producers wanted to make this film for international hearings and some of the stars we could not hear in. And some of them smoke hot. Moncia Dean? Need I say more.
