Comments I would add to DATE Release, but I could not find a place for it. I was really surprised to see that this film was released in the United States in February 1955. I saw it in a "first run" theater in Washington, DC in March, 1958. Asked if it was re-released, or some problem? In my opinion, this film is very light entertainment, but there are some classic characters. John McIntyre does a bang-up job as a corruption / entrepreneur / thief judge. Walter Brennan does basically the same role he did in Red River earlier years. And, in my opinion, James Stewart provides as a fine as he has ever done. I saw this film once a half dozen or more, and never rubbed to see her part again. The photography and landscape are splendid, and offers a remarkable amount of entertainment in one hour and thirty-six minutes.
