A wonderful surprise in the Spanish cinema. I never thought Jordi Molla could be such a great director, after all, I really did not care much for his choice of movies. However this movie was absolutely fantastic and not predictable at all ... something I still enjoy! He has not enjoyed much good press and I really do not think he'll ever be released in the U.S. market. We will have content ourselves with the DVD or VHS if so ... I do not mean much about the story because I do not want to spoil it for you but basically the movie is about a homeless drink who gets new mesi The just for kicks and get some money out of it (like sooooooooooo much), before he knows it is plunging into a life he did not count on.
