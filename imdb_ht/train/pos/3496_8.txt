I am surprised how many people give this less than 7 stars. <br /> But they just do not understand the movie. <br /> <br /> The story is about to grow in a difficult situation .. <br /> There is a crazy grandmother who really wants the best for your grandchildren. <br /> And there are good reasons why so much criticism like this movie. / And the reason is because they understand the movie. <br /> I feel sorry for the notes given to some people. <br /> I wish I could just write a brief summary of a movie but IMDb requires you to write 10 lines. <br /> I honestly have nothing else to say.
