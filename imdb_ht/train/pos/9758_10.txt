Personally, this is one of my favorites of all time! No, I'm not 10 .. I'm 30! I own an old, original VHS that I bought from a rental shop. I watched it countless times .. <br /> while it's an entertaining movie for kids, it's an intriguing movie for adults. I once saw this movie whiile I was .. not mild. My eyes were open to things I've never noticed before. I saw the morality promoted, both overtly and somewhat subliminally .. I wish I could remember all the things I noticed in particular, but it was a very long time since then. Rest assured, there are TONS of the things that are taught throughout the movie. if you get the chance to see it .. not mild .. doing so, you will not be disappointed .. as a matter of fact, you'll probably feel rather happy and hot. <br /> wonderful thing!
