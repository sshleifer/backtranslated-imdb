I watched this last night with low expectations. The reason I do not usually like "made for TV" movies and rarely I liked "cast reunion" movies. But the criticism of the Los Angeles Times seemed to love this, so I gave him a chance. I'm glad I did. It was very good. Adam West and Burt Ward meet as themselves. But in a way, they act as themselves "Batman and Robin". They had campuses and did not take themselves, or that movie was too bad. The film starts out with them searching for the "George Barris" born Batmobile, someone stole before he was auctioned off for an orphan's home. While they are looking for the car they are also reminiscent of the series that they did together. This is said in flashback. It was well done. The actors got, for the least Burt Ward and Adam West died. And, for a television movie, he was down to the nitty-bravest of real behaviors over and over the screen. I give this one a 9/10, I liked it so much.
