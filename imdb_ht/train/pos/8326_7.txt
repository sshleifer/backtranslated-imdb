While Fred Schepisi's "I.Q." Do not really have any significant qualities, it's still worth seeing. Walter Matthau plays Albert Einstein, trying to help mechanic Ed Walters (Tim Robbins) fall in love with Princeton's math doctorate candidate Catherine Boyd (Meg Ryan). Probably the funniest scene is when Dr. Frizzyhead and friends (Lou Jacobi, Gene Saks and Joseph Maher) try to look like a scientist: he ends up looking like French Impressionist. The movie is historically accurate, but that's not the point. It's not like anything except a light comedy, quite the opposite of Robbins's most popular movie from 1994 (Shawshank the redemption). A film about Einstein's whole life should focus not only on his scientific achievements, but also his political activist, namely how he wrote a letter on behalf of the Scottsboro Nine and out against nuclear weapons (he reached points where the FBI holds a record of it). <br /> So, anyway, this one is acceptable. Also begins Stephen Fry, Tony Shalhoub, Frank Whaley, Charles Durning and Keene Curtis.
