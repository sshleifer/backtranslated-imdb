Midnight Cowboy made a great deal when he was released in 1969, drawing a rating X. By today's standards, it would be hard pressed to pull a rating R. Jon Voight, who was better, is competent in his role as Joe Buck, a Hick town wants to make it big with the ladies in New York City. He meets a hustler street called Ratso Rizzo, who is trying to treat his friend Buck for his own. Of eventually forged a bond that is both touching and pathetic. As Ratso, Dustin Hoffman simply shines. Hoffman has often been brilliant, but never more than that of painting. It is so character that everyone else around him pals in comparison. The Lost Way Academy Awards John Wayne is one of the most ridiculous decisions ever made by the Academy of Art Movement and Science Art. Director Schlessinger has a hand and his production, but this movie has a underbelly granny who leaves a bad taste in the mouth of the viewer. Worth sees for Hoffman's performance alone.
