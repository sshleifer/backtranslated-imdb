Although I'm inclined to agree with the other comments made by those who saw this movie, I'm ashamed that I prefer to love it. Not often can such a big pile of 80 will not get out of a Wham! video, so it is most definitely worth a look (Â£ 0.79 a night at my local store!). Watch out for the obvious insomnia and code on the suit of the monster, the fact that the 'hero' looks like a lot like Keith Chegwin and the classic lines like the following: Evil Wizard-Tip Block: "At Last We Meet Kor ... "Body:" Typing, is not it? "<br /> Amazing !! I also love the fact that although the video box seems quite interesting with images of a castle surrounded by raging sea and a dangerous falcon - like birds carrying a beautiful hero of security (among the other 'interesting and engaging' suggestions What goes on in the current film, none of them actually happened .. No, I do not play ... there really is not an ocean rush or a bird, it just tries to make you interested ... Classic in my opinion. This film gets 10 for the best entertainment value!
