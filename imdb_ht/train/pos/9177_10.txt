I said that this ministry was the best interpretation of the beloved novel "Jane Eyre". Both Dalton and Clarke are very credible as Rochester and Jane. I've seen other versions but not compared to this one. The best one for me. I can never imagine anyone else playing these characters. The last time I saw this one was in 1984 when I was only 13. At that time, I was a livworm and I just read the novel Charlotte Bronte. I was completely enchanted by this ministry and I remember missing any of the episodes. I would like to see it again because it's so good. :-)
