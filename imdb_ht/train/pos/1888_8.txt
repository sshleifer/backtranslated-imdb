"If I wanted to dribble, I would call a nurse." <br /> <br /> "Are you not enough?" ... "More than enough." <br /> "You got me a choo-choo." <br /> "If I start to die, please remove (hat) from myself. It's not the way I want to be remembered." Some of the movies are very interesting, and often Perspectives, from this film are good and often perspicaces. Dudley Moore is good, adorable and rich. Sir John Gielgud is aristocrat, good and loving ... and poor. The two have a non-father-father relationship with the son who defines the man Arthur is to become. Will he follow his heart and soul, or just his wealth? Over twenty five years, I've returned to this movie, with glee and fun with joy. It's a movie for the return of, time and time again, and remember what's important in life, as short as it is. <br /> <br /> Judge Miller
