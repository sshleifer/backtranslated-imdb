The events of September 11, 2001 do not need more human interest in the form after the formation of the rookie firefighter or the progress of the French French. In my view it would be best to leave this out. I think the directors tried too hard, perhaps they felt that the events of the day needed a story as a series. The commentary of one of the policemen - "this aint f *** ing Disneyworld" is fair. But it is compelling to look for the deposition of events. The smokers were all the right places at the right time, no other foot from the match day to shoot.
