Sarah Silverman is a dangerous bitch! It's nice, sexy, funny and talented, black and demonic. I read the other 'comment' on this show as well as the message message message and people just do not get it. There is nothing that appears on T.V. is an accident. Too many money, time and work are put into the production of a T.V. shows there to be mistakes. This show is stupid because Sarah wanted her to be stupid. This show is juvenile because Sarah wanted her to be juvenile. I thought the jokes were great and the theme show as well as the other musical numbers are pretty rare. It's a lot like Playhouse Pee-Wee's for maladjusted, slacker twenty-something glue sniffing, Future Pornstars in America from the Valley. Throw is awesome. The scenario and actions are quite rhythmic. I hope this show succeeds since Central Comedy did not let David Spade keep his show. Who plays Sara's sister? It's not listed on the home show page. I would like to see her stand-up. Does anyone know about the upcoming-coming days or DVDs that can be floating around outside?
