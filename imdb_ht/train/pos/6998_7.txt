Going to see seven Points I have not been clearly assured of what to think because the left-handed forecasts open to grasp what the movie really was about. So in the first 20 min or so you are completely lost in the draw, there is no idea what is going on and you think Tim, who claims to be Ben, is just a big asshole. All of this comes to an end when the "twist", so to speak, is unraveled in the last minute of the movie. Basically Tim (will Smith) has been troubled and haunted by a major accident he has done to the end of the seven living people. Then he decided the scope of seven new people in need of serious help that he in turn gave his life. <br /> <br /> Acting in this movie is great, as I feel will smith no matter what his party looks impressed. Rosario Dawson, for me, this is one of her best movies, aside from eagle eyes I think there. He was in some bad fate but he was saved from this movie. Other actors, like Woody Harrelson, have many small roles and are not a big enough role to grab the character. Although film casting has always been good. <br /> <br /> This movie was definitely not what I expected and certainly a lot faster speed in which I was hoping. The movie, however, was always very good. Nothing is revealed until the last 5 minutes of the movie and everything falls into place. Until then it just seems like a freckon love story. Final thoughts of seven books = seven stars.
