Well the story is a little hard to follow the first, but that's just because of the 70's breast-vamping-up vampires / witches dancing in the Bongo drums. This course cuts off a few vampiric origins. And some candles are very interesting and used for them. And for girls about girls action, vampires or not ... this movie just rock!
