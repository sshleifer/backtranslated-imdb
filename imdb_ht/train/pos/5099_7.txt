The only reason I came across this movie was that it's the DVD MISS MARKER DVD and I recommend watching it although you will not like it as well as the best known movie. <br /> We have Gary Cooper and Carole Lombard as a con man and her boyfriend. The film starts out quite light, but becomes more dramatic as Coop first plans on using his daughter to thickness a sizable amount of cash at his brother's law, but on meeting the girl and seeing the discipline It should be the subject and his brother-in law to choose to keep him. However, it has problems remaining on the right path and narrow and that the drama develops. Cooper and Lombard are good and Shirley still manages to fly the scenes it's in. There's little music in this, and Shirley only has one song. However this is fun and worth watching along with LITTLE MISS MARKER.
