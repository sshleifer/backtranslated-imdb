What an awesome movie! It was very scary, great acting, well written, drawn to draw nice, interesting characters, very good direction, and a surprise that ending that will leave you with a smile on your face. This is one popcorn scenery film that can not appeal to non-horror fans, but still (however) one of the best stairs out there today! I highly recommend it to only fans of: <br /> 1) The horror genre <br /> <br /> OR <br /> <br /> 2) An actor or actress featured in her. <br /> *** from **** stars! <br /> <br /> PS - I'm sick and tired of humans compared to this, with other modern horror movies, and screams. Ya know what they did not want to be like SCREAM. Everyone in such "Oh, they copy scream!". Well, if I'm not misty, SCREAM also copies other movies too! In fact, just about every movie horror copied an earlier one. SCREAM, however, was a good movie. But still ... stop comparing and enjoying it for what it is! <br /> GO AND RIVE THIS! <br /> <br />
