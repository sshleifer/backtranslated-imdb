In "Brave New Girl," Holly comes from a small town in Texas, singing "The Yellow Rose in Texas" at a local competition, and admitted to a prestigious arts college in Philadelphia. From the movie is growing into a colorful history of friendship and loyalty. I liked this movie. It was full of great songs and acting with characters who kept it moving at a very nice speed. The act was, of course, wonderful. Virginia Madsen and Lindsey Haun were outstanding, as well as the Nick Roth Work Camera really did well and I was very happy with the end (It looks like an end might be in the making). Kudos gives the director and everyone else who participated in this production. Well a gem in the archival films.
