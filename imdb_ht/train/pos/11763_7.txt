I guess that everyone has to make a comeback at some point. And that's exactly embarrassing Taft resident Jack Dundee (Robin Williams) intends to make the "Best of Times". Yes, the man who has gone crazy with the radio in "Good Morning, Vietnam" is playing football. In this case, she is looking to replay a game that highers her high school a prestigious title. But former-teamman Reno Hightower (Kurt Russell) will not only go along with it so easily. <br /> <br /> Granted, it's not the best movie for either people. But Williams and Russell are actually a very good comedy team. And some of the names in this movie are most likely to give you the giggles (they say at least). Look at that.
