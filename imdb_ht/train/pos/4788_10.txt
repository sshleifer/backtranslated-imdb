This is one of the greatest films I've ever seen: I shine inside of the movie. The music and cinematography that occurred when the spell was passed on the screen. The pace was gently set by the travel mode (a lawn mower mounted with a big trailer) and was preserved by the background and sound sights and gently-rhythmic lives of the other characters. actually happened; Alvin Straight died in 1996 at the age of 76. There was no act; Everything was completely real, as if the actors were actually transformed into the characters. Sissy Spacek has given a tremendous performance as a little bit disabled daughter who has suffered a lot but forged ahead, still wanting to do what is right. Richard Farnsworth was cast perfectly and she was very well acquainted Alvin Straight, a stubborn but lovely elderly person who moved around Iowa to go to his brother's insanity, Lyle, who had a stroke. Alvin learned wisely during her life and seemed to have carried out the best of the people she met in the way. The movie emphasizes the importance of this family and, hopefully, to all of us. I quickly anticipate seeing her, and yet. Directed by David Lynch, this film proves its direct competence. Farnsworth was nominated for a Prize Academy for Best Actors; In 79, he was the oldest candidate ever for this award.
