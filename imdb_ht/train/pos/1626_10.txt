This movie is actually fun! If you would like your brain rest for an hour then go ahead and watch it. She calls blonde and blonde, so do not expect deep and meaningful jokes. What is this movie and enjoy all our stereotypes about blonde. It's just a funny movie to look on a date or with a company of friends (especially if you are not too modest. Lol) Pamela and Denise are always pretty hot chicks. It's a mistake to judge this movie as a piece of art. C'mon, this movie is about blonde! It is supposed to be light, funny and superficial. Another thing, I do not think girls will appreciate and love this movie but guys will definitely be.
