** Warning - This post may include crowd ** <br /> <br /> I only have a Gamecube in September 2005, with the first two games I've bought James Bond games, the decent agent down fire and match Goldeneye Rogue Agent. The next game I've been planning was all or nothing, because my friend told me that it was better than the two games I already had. I said, it was right. <br /> I bought this for a tender at HMV, and when I got home, I slammed it into my cube and played it for hours on end. It was better than my other two games, and there was a much better and more interesting storyline. The graphics were some of the best I've seen (but now that the Xbox 360 has come out, Farcry Instincts Predator has some of the best known graphics in humans). The scenario was smart; Crazy (William Dafoe, named as Nikolai Diavolo) and beautiful henchwoman (Heidi Klum, named as Katya Nadanova), try to destroy the world with small nanobots, which at the beginning of the game, you James Bond, destroy on a train. The bad thing is that one of them is hiding in Katya's sine. You then have to block the plans and save the world. <br /> <br /> The big thing about this game is that it actually has the voice actor characters, such as Cleese Voice Q. There are 27 levels, some of them are short and some are very long and hard. <br /> <br /> Gameplay - 10/10 graphics - 9/10 sounds - 9/10 replay value - 7/10 multiplayer - 8/10 <br /> <br /> I give this game a grand total at 90%
