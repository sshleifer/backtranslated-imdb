The "Bourne Ultimatum" begins recklessly mid-kick and the batman's batman blast out there as Jason Bourne (Matt Damon, absolutely superb) tracks down the masterminds behind the CIA black ops who turned him into the perfect assassin at a final attempt to learn her true identity. A devastating storm of David Strathairn as the "man behind the curtain" was added to the return of regulars including Joan Allen (excellent) and Julia Stiles (non-existent). series, I wanted Paul Greengrass' unstable camera but which would keep stating at least for the few minutes of wallpaper. However, being said, it's a perfect way to take the tension, claustrophobic feel of intimate hand-to-hand-combat performances and work equally well in the chasing scene that is mostly on foot and across three-palladium batteries -up. Part of the fun of the Bourne series is the constant globe-jump and manipulation of technology and communications that seem to challenge the laws of physics and actual capabilities. Bourne's film seems to exist in some sort of bravest hyper-fact-filled technique based on magic. It makes no sense that everyone seems to be just in the right place at the right time, but I will be sentenced if it is not an explosion to watch them get there. <br /> With the absence of the Emotive and involving Franka Potente, the writers try to create some emotional connections between Damon and Stiles, but it is so blank-facing an actress he never really leads to anything. Still, this can be forgiven, unlike "Identity" and the "Supremacy", this "ultimatum" reveals all and we finally learn the truth about Bourne's past. It's a fun conclusion and meets the series, and if they have any good sense, and Damon gets his wish, this will be the perfect end to it.
