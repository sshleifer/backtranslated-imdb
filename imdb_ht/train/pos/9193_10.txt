It holds very true to the original manga in the same name, aka (Tramp as we are in the US) but it can still enjoy even if you do not read the manga. It's a different kind of tail, which shows a strong and self-painter woman just like everyone else. However, due to his outpouring force, he fears showing his inner feelings and so for those around him to hurt her and blunt comments. The only one who really faces him out with whom he can be eased and is his new pet ... man ... Momo. If you want something different than the usual boring things and some wonderful J-Dorama (Japanese Dram) actors / resses then this is definitely the series to watch ... and it!
