PI BETAY NOTORIOUS (2006) *** 1/2 Gretchen Mol, Lilli Taylor, Chris Bauer, Jared Harris, Sara Paulson, David Strathairn, Austin Pendleton, Norman Reedus, Dallas Roberts. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />! <br /> <br /> Gretchen Mol is probably best known for being taute as the Next-Read Girl a few years ago when no one knew who she was despite an infamous cover story by Fairness Fair among other dubi media, but despite a few co-starring roles here and having predicted stellar it seemed to twinkle less brightly until now. Here as the most popular pin-up Bettie page, Gretchen Mol is indeed a bright star of the rising. <br /> <br /> Bettie Page was born Tennessee as a god-feared and family oriented girl who seemed to find himself the unwarranted object of lust and affection, as he grew older . A rape flap gang is wisely not graphically demonstrating nor is the subtle show of his own father who has less than decades of drawing for his own child who is important to understand how Page managed to save this life's nightmare possible for a career as an actress titled in New York City in the 1950s when in reality that was the time and place to catch lighting in a bottle. Which page did not realize is that in reality it might just be that when it comes to. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Irving Klaw (Bauer) and his sister Paula (Taylor) who provide kitschy, but are considered pornographic to be unique in a unique clientele: the type of fetish. Although it is rather naive it is undeniably smart and knows that its body is not a sin and it can see the forest for the trees in the sense that it is in control - or at least stay in what it offers as the job It's not indecent and it's fun at its increasingly less-dress portraiture - until a witch-witch congress seeks out a few scapegoats to make pornographic images a crime. <br /> <br /> Talented bookmaker Mary Harron and her screen Guinevere Turner ("American Psycho" and "I Shot Andy Warhol") streamline the biopsy tragedies rather neatly and maybe a bit too scratch at getting in which really was Bettie Page although they performed justice in describing an era of uptightness in its genitals. Great thanks to Cinematographer's Mott Hopfel gift for her gorgeous and gorgeous gorgeous gorgeous gorgeous image, and also the segments of color whatsoever to remember Douglas's film of the era for its melodramatic intrusion. Part of the feminist and American dream of the United States has accomplished the story temptation along nicely with fine performances by its ensembles including the Funny Bauer and Taylor as brothers and sisters of Smut and Harris who have a garden day as a fellow photographer with a taste for wine and bavard. It's fun to see Strathairn in a bit of cascade casting as a senator on a campaign for right after Bulldog's new album Bulldog Edward Murrow in his last trip, "Good Night, and Good Luck" as an Opposition to the Role tab. <BR> <br /> But the talent hat is really fine in Mol as uninhibited yet deeply moral and Bettie Page's intelligent Bettie Page that allows children as like innocent beams in her dark stripping, and now-considered as-tame-and-strangely-borderline-kitschy poses that holds the fancy man for decades and is still a marker for human sexuality in this country and perhaps world in general. Mole is perfect and uncannily resembles the portrait of her portrait of her knowing-smearing smile. The real Bettie Page has been reported to have not participated in the project, but apparently gave his blessing and continued to live a somewhat lonely life that taught at the time of their final findings as they found Jesus and tore 'notorious images' it once for all. A shame since this movie weirdly embraced the hustle bustle of its subjects, spreading to all of its beautiful naked ones.
