Many of the reviews made it a point to remember that Pinjar is unlike the running of the mill produced in Bollywood. While this is true, Bollywood's overall film is adapted to a specific audience and should be appreciated for achieving their goals in this regard. However, Pinjar is an excellent film for people seeking a change in the normal Bollywood film equation. Set during the Time of Partition between India and Pakistan, Pinjar focused on a Punjabi girl who became the victim of societal and cultural attitudes toward the treatment of women in her time. Paro, the protagonist, forced to choose between a life and a man who had kidnapped him, and the hope went on a life with his family back to Indian led Punjab. More than one problem in Hindu and Muslim, Pinjar Street and defines the role of a woman as a daughter, as a wife, and as a mother in India and Pakistan in 1947. Unlike typical Bollywood films that make them escapist in nature, Pinjar is a movie that makes its audience contemplate the issues during and after the film.
