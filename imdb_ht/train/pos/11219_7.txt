/ / Pipe * / <br /> <br /> Way back, before Evangelion did, before Hideaki Anno was an idol and home name for many anime fans, and before Gainax got to the status of fanfare, Gunbuster did. With only Zines of Honneamise made by Gainax at that time, with the famous Otakon shorts or strings, Gunbuster has some difficult tasks to follow up. He did not make it easier on his head by picking out a genre that has already made countless quantities before, space opera. <br /> <br /> Chance, Gainax decided to put it out as a six-part (direct video) series. This allows the series to have a dimension larger than would have been possible if it was made in a movie. This also prevents it from getting too boring and overly long, with lots of freeware fights and filler along the way. In addition, they have made some efforts to remain clear of the space opera mechanics tested in Macross or Gundam, and many other popular space operas. <br /> <br /> For one, the shows start out beautiful lights, and Noriko's Okinawa High School for mechapiloting. Noriko is the daughter of a respected pirate captain who died in battle, when she was still a kid. This makes his life in the academy quite difficult, as some of his classmates begin to suspect that Noriko is favored by the teachers. The first episode is pretty much a comedy drama, with a very tight focus on the characters and settings of the school. Things quickly change when the threat of an alien invasion was announced, and Noriko and Kazumi (best girls in class) are chosen to help the fleet assemble. <br /> <br /> Food in the middle of Gunbuster leaves our girls in space, focusing on both personal drama and action. A couple of more characters are presented, and some parts of Noriko's past dragged up again. In addition, the alien threat becomes more imminent every minute, and the Gunbuster, the ultimate hope of mankind, is presented. Smart as Okada writer was, he incorporated the principles of time dilation, in spice stuff up a bit. In short, time is moving slowly for those traveling in the speed of light. This means that Noriko can be part of a war that took almost a century to complete. Also the dramatic aspect of this is stressful, when Noriko sees her friends on returning to the base, who is considerably greater than her age. The science might not be perfect, but it's presented in a very credible way, and even some SD science sciences in between episodes, where Noriko, Kazumi and coaches provide a brief description of the scientific principles used in the series . /> <br /> The animation, for a series made in the 80s, is definitely good. The designs are retro 80s style of course, but it has its charm. Animation is acceptable enough and the drawings are beautiful, although the costumes are betrayed <br /> <br /> some of the passionate fans of Gainax service will later exploit the full. The mechas in all the shows are very cool too, with the Gunbuster as the ultimate, strong and vast car. The last episode was entirely made of black and white. While it's generally believed (but not confirmed) that's been done for budgetary purposes, it lends a whole different atmosphere to the series, which is suited perfectly for the latter part. opera just. Too bad in places, very generic, and definitely not worth buying. It does fit the set for the most part, but it can become quite annoying at times. Tanaka is not really a famous composer, and only the other respectable series she worked on is half dragon. If you think 80 animated music, you'll know what to expect. As the series progresses, the focus is slowly scheduled out of the opera drama drama in epic battles, but in a way the viewer will hardly notice this. Step by step will be the tone drama, and the battles will take the front row. No matter which never leaves out though. With the recent episode of Noriko's and crews fighting for the more existence of human kind, and with the latest eye fight, some questions are presented to the audience, regarding the position of the human race in the galaxy, with which As far as it can go to auto-preservation guarantees. While they never respond later on, they always present some interesting foods for thought. The last episode is very epic, with a nice, but quite predictable finish, but not all ends should include many strange twists of course. Again, it fits the range. <br /> Gunbuster can sound like animated opera you first host, with alien invasion, big battles, and some personal drama, and for the bigger part, it is. But it is done exceptionally well for a change. Instead of going for a constant mix of ancient elements, six long episodes, Gunbuster presents us a small scale shift in scale to large scale scale season. Along the way we meet with some interesting and well-cared-out characters, which mutual relationships change heavily due to phenomena of time dilation. The show is very well written, although it tends to slip up at some point. Too many dramatic events and excessive cheating mecha attacks could easily be avoided. Overall, the trip to Gunbuster takes you on is a very relaxed, sometimes sad, sometimes heroic one. It might not have broken the boundaries and boundaries of genre of space opera, but at least it folded a little. Very enjoyable classic animated, but not flawless. <br /> <br /> *** / *****
