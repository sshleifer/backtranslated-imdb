I appreciate movies like this: smart and well-crafted, fun, absorbing, well-acting and nicely directed. Nobody - not even Pacino - will grind the landscape *, trying to stand out; One of the most effective film times (Aielo pulls on to his beloved ramp) is to cool precisely because of its constraints. <br /> <br /> It's not as good as saying, QUIZ SHOW, VILLA is in a similar fabric: engage the mind as well as eyes, ears, and heart. Why such entertainment as well as arrows at the box office is to guess anyone. <br /> <br /> * You know, Pacino grinds it up in one particular scene, but precisely because it is needed. Great scene, too.
