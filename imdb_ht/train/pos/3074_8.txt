I recently caught up with this little gem in a cable film. It took me by surprise, though, I should have expected it to the team involved in this movie. <br /> <br /> Henry Bromwell directed this movie with a sure hand, and it shows. One still wonderful about the secret life of killer killers. One does not have to go too far to realize they probably own your own neighbors, or social friends, or even friends; They do not differ from us, at least on the surface. In this story, the grandfather is a jerky character who does not hesitate to eliminate anyone for the right price. He has no scruples in teaching the ropes of his own son, and even the grandson! Alex is a man who lives in turmoil. He knows what he did in the past and suddenly came to realize the consequences of his actions. He has to see someone to help him find peace with himself. In attending Dr Parks, she tries to get absolution, although she does not get it there. On the contrary, there is a dramatic twist when Alex learns about who is supposed to kill next. Alex Alex, brilliantly described by William H. Macy, mesmerizes us. Not only is he a fantastic actor, but he believes he is the man. One of the best things in the film is John Ritter late. It is even convinced as Dr. Parks, the man who unravels the mystery. Donald Sutherland, as the grandfather is perfect. She is a natural actor in everything she does. Neve Campbell seized his pivotal role in Sara. It shows an incredible ability and range. Tracey Ullman is mat, wife of suffering, and she does not get so much. Also Barbara Bain, in a rare appearance, is the grandma out of hell. David Dorfman, is a fun of the movie. It shows a maturity beyond his years. <br /> <br />
