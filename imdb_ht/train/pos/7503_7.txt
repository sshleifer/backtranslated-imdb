The movie was okay, quite fun. The cast was pretty good, and I'll be the second to comment before I mentioned - Glenn Quinn was outstanding and it's the only reason enough to watch this movie. He played the "bad" selfish friend and manager of the brilliant group! There are a lot of songs made by "Beyond Gravity" in this movie, but this does not really come as a surprise considering the movie is a VH1 production. However, if the soft rock / pop music is not someone of liking someone might as well flash forward to those scenes. <br /> <br /> The plot of a band trying to make it to the top of LA but having overcome many obstacles on the road is not too original, but quite fun, with some surprising scheme to turn here and there .
