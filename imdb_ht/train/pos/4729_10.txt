A difficulty actor to find the best way to break into Hollywood is to start knocking in the competition. But what to break a leg of a real gem is the sardonic look at the existence of difficulty (and not so) the actor. It brings us to this world with irony easy and understandable. He also had a polished look with very skillful direction under Monika Mitchell. Breaking a Leg is one of the rare independent films that do not compromise its production value at any level. The writing is tight, the initial dialogue rate. Cassini is actor's actor, and the role really shows in his talent. The climactic scene between him and Rene Garcia is an instant classic, and they can come down as one of the Hollywood Fold scenes of all time. I've seen it in an advanced screening, and everyone in the audience laughs uncontrollably and raved on it afterwards.
