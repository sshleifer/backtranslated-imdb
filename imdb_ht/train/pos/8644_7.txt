**** = A masterpiece must be registered in the books and keep in mind <br /> <br /> *** 1/2 = A classic of time; simply a must see <br /> <br /> A solid, worth-while, very fun piece <br /> ** 1/2 = A good movie, but some unmatched elements or apparent flaws <br /> <br /> ** You can always consider good in the areas, but this work has either serious problems or is not caught by inevitable elements to judge inevitable (eg, genre) <br /> * 1/2 = Mostly a pile of nothing has been provoked by refreshing momentous moment <br /> <br /> BOMB = Not in a quality view? <br /> - California - *** <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I rent this movie awaiting a summer-in-you celebration face-summer-blokbuster-quality in Brad Pitt's face but was happily surprised and disappointed. This really is more of a drama, and very gloomy in this ... I remember some intense emotional Duchovny voice-overs. Pitt plays out his movie without ever having time and talent talent. Who started out as a hopeless yet harmless "garbage" trash has become a violent, disturbing alcohol and a messed idea. During some of the latter stages of the movie, I found it hard to keep watching her - it was unpredictable and scary. This proves very good writing and acting. <br /> <br /> The movie all full of scary, sensational scene that made me hold my breath not less than once, and I do not mean scene action. I mean that so brilliantly styled dialogue scenes actually winked and gasped at what I had seen. It was like watching a rhinoceros and a lion put in a cage and watching how they were licking each other to death. Again, I am very impressed with the senarist (s); Anyone who did the impossible: mixing oil and water. <br /> I also enjoy Juliette Lewis's great performance. She is so unlucky for this talented teen actress to make a day's appearance that when she makes it look like a happy one. Some of her moments in this movie brought me to tears. I mean that. Emotions of this girl can be excited by yourself are incredible, and I clearly remember getting blurred-eyed at a few occasions .. I almost feel like I'm copying the quality of the movie films they have appeared in only give "CALIFORNIA" a *** rating. But the dark feelings that it burns are too potent and depressing it. I believe everyone should see this movie though. I really do.
