for anyone who plays games video games here did anyone notice that the GTA: Vice City mansion inside the game and some other stuff including the movie's films related to this movie and this film inspired the musicians in the game (Rockstar Games) to copy some things from this movie and by the way this is one of the best 80 movies out there I recommend this to anyone who still did not see it 10/10 no questions asked
