What a stunning episode for this fine series. This is TV excellence at its best. The story takes place in 1968 and it is beautifully filmed in black & white, almost a film noir style with its deep shadow and strong image. This is a story about two people who fall in love, but I do not want to spoil this. It is a rare presentation of what homosexuals faced in the 1960s in America. Written by the superb Tom Pettit, and led by the great Jeannot Szwarc, we move in their lives, their love for each other, and the tragedies. Taking such a sensitive issue makes this episode all the more stunning. Our emotions are like tear and corners as their characters. Frills ran up my spine at the end when Bob Dylan's gorgeous play, "Ah, but I was so bigger then I'm smaller than that now," as sung by the Byrds. This one goes far past a 10 and all the way to the stars. Beautiful.
