Never see this movie and consider it a great classic with great veteran actors. In the period that this film was made, people in the Americas were different, there was no television or all the modern things we have today, except the radio and starting out of their big movie in Hollywood. Sweet innocent innocent romance between a young girl or guy has seen a different way than she is today. Ann Shirley, "My Sweet Kill", '44 played a young orphan named Carrot Top because of her red hair and found herself taken to a home in two as seniors, who was like two fools of wisdom and watch over Ann Shirley. It was a small town and everyone knew everyone and if anything happened, the whole city found out in it in minutes. It's a movie down the world and pretty decent people trying to help each other in a very simple way of living. Today, it seems a lot of ball and stupid corn but believe me, this was the way people were in America during the 1920s. & 30's and have been a great generation who loved good family movies.
