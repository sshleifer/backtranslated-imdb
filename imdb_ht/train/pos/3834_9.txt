A great movie! Slow: YES ... <br /> But original, deeply atmospheric, black and worry, perfectly SURREAL (feels like a nightmare). <br /> I would like to compare it to David Lynch (Eraserhead, Empire Empire, Blue Velvet) style and mix with a little bit of Barton Fink and Naked Lunch (Insect!). Also a bit of Jodorowsky (Fando y Lis) .... Ads some night on Earth, Heart Angel and a bit of offspring, Pies, (would it be wrong to mention Tetsuo?) Jacob's Ladder, Barker at the forbidden and Salome - which should form at least the concept of a dark night together ... NUIT NOIRE. <br /> <br /> If you're out for avantegardist and / or surrealist movies (like myself) you're going to be like this one. If you're waiting for something else like a movie full of action and some average scheme - try your luck with something else. <br /> <br /> Final word: The plot is very, very strange and unusual and that's probably # 1 why most people do not appreciate this movie hate it.
