I love cartoon. They can show that films and actors 'real' and scenery can not be - even if the computer's effects are changing more and more. They can push Satir limit ('Simpsons'), tasty (South Park), spectacle ('aladdin'), or reality ('Toy Story'). There are some good examples of this in 'Ice Age', as when we see a herd of fucking now-disappearing migration across country, discussing old friends. These scenes are a pleasure to watch, as we get the feel of both the familiar and unusual at the same time, usually in a way that makes us laugh. While Ice Age is not as good as the animated movie head of all time, it's a really fun movie. Sitting back, enjoying the delicate anakrons, the beautiful and stomach pleasures. The story follows Manfred monstrous mammoth, South, a idiotic sloth, and Diego, a tiger sandwich, as they take a human baby back to his tribe - for very different purposes. On the way, naturally, they have a lot of trouble. Also popping up throughout the trip is Scrat, the unlucky crisis story, who is desperately trying to bury a winter glacier: in glacier, on top of dead trees, in ice-caves. His opening scene is a classic. It's a simple story with a very predictable end and a middle of which is just a series of funny incidents and some character-building moments cast in, but some of the scenes, such as the changing switch or dodos, are hilarious, the animals will love and it looks good. There is only one moment well touched, when cave paintings of mammoths come to life in front of Manfred's sight. <br /> <br /> It's not a must-see but good for a fun hour or so. <br /> <7/10
