This is in the great comedy Sammo movie. This is not a parody of the Dragon's entry, the main character (Sammo) is obsessed with Bruce Lee and emulates him freakishly well for a man in his size. Nominal story of how his fight keeps the cause of his loved ones problem - then fight. Oh, the fight. Good, fast-paced scene with high impact (the white guy who plays a boxer looks like he really gets hurt by one of Sammo's kicks). The faint bit of this movie was purely unintentionally. There is a Jim Kelly looking guy (one of three experts hired to take out Sammo), but he was a Chinese guy in blackface with an afro-wig. Come, did not there any real black people in Hong Kong in 1978? Well, I guess I've seen enough white fake-like-hell "Chinese people" in old Americans too. <br /> This is one for any Sammo or Bruce Lee fan.
