Right now ..... This show was kicked back to the day and still is drawing cartoons today. I can not wait to track some of the DVDs to share with my little guy and see the shiny even in his eyes. I have already introduced it to Voltron (the 5 lions one, not the 15 single cars) and I laughed myself when he told me one day "Daddy. You sure look at some awesome designs when you was a kid! "How cool is that. <br /> <br /> Come on Hollywood, this one dust off and give it a live action attempt. Could not have been worse than Spiderman 3 was ... Man oh man ... 2007 was very blaming so far for summer movies. <br /> OK, I'll shuddup now <br /> <Cheers
