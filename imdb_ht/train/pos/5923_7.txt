A woman who hates cats (Alice) and her son (Brian Krause) moved to a small town and must deal with a mean teacher (Glenn Shadix), unbelieving relationships, a beautiful girl (girl Amick ) and one hell of a great secret. <br /> <br /> Well, so technically, this is a "bad movie". But who cares? So much fun! <br /> <br /> Impossible things (including corn) occur, freak people out of cats chat, there's one-liner covered, there are too many cheese to handle! <br /> So yes. You will enjoy this. Many. It will not move you, touch you, scare you, or thrill you in any way, but it will keep you entertained and laughing!
