Viggo Mortensen star as a new prisoner in a haunted prison in which the Warden (playing well by Lane Smith) has a grisly secret that might be the reason why various prison guards and prisoners were killed by a supernatural presence. Lincoln Kilpatrick is the lifer who knows the secret and is afraid of his life. When I think prison cinema, I still think action movies start Stallone or Van Damme or drama high caliber like Shawshank redemption or the Green Mile. However I did not expect a ghost story more on the lines of Exorcist III. Prison however is an atmospheric effort and it certainly remains the best movie of Renny Harlin's career. The film is crawling and some good acting in a cast in (at the moment) unknowns. Lane Smith comes from the best because his driver is not the usual stereotype of what's wrong but rather nervous and twitchy that adds some credibility to a movie that far exceeds expectations. <br /> <br /> *** from 4- (Good)
