A simple movie at the start, a simple movie at the end. It does not end with cliche pretend, but most TV movies have that any way. <br /> <br /> Christopher Reeve does a great job as an old con drifter. The marriage between himself and the woman it works, I feel a bit queer, but I believe for the time it's set, that it's not the one-less credible. , I've seen the 'TV' modified version, even though the movie was made and showed on 'TV', I found that a bit of typing too. But I feel if I've seen whole of the piece, I'd give it more-in-the-lucky same rating. <br /> <br /> J.T. Walsh does a good job, not her best role, but still ... a good job. <br /> 7/10
