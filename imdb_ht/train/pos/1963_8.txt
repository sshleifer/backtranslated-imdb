We start all our reviews with this information. My wife and I have seen nearly 100 films annually for the past 15 years. Recently, we have been honored by getting movie films spent in any movie at any time at no cost! So we can see what we want every time we want. This point is that CRITICS counts for ZERO. Your local criticisms or national criticisms like Ebert are really no different than you or me. The only difference is that they get to write about the movie and are forced to see hundreds of movies if they want or not. Therefore, it is our belief that if you get your money worth for two hours Fun is good enough for us! We never heard of it critically. We only care about our friends and those we know as things just like us. Quite enough about that. <br /> This movie is very good. not only good but very good. Critics are a lot of morons. Just because there are stripping and tongue hated it. It was worth the ticket price and that is all you can ask for. Is that wrong? Each film can not be an academic award candidate. Sharon rock is gorgeous and does a great job in the movie and it mystifies me like the content of the critically ill hell
