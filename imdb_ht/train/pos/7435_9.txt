I saw this first video 15 years ago. I thought it was excellent then and I still do. I'm a senior teacher in English (high school and college) and a guy in English Romantic poetry, so Coleridge rates pretty with me. Anything that could be detected from the beauty of the poem or the power of the story would not get my vote of excellence. In this case, everything works well to engage the viewer, especially high school students. The story is well illustrated for a generation that has grown in television. In addition, the voice of Michael Redgrave adds a sense of authenticity to his authority. Well, so did not have a big budget for the project. So it's not Star Wars and there's no CGI in it. But who can postpone Gustave Dor√© illustration as part of the presentation? The above comment, which in just four lines postponed the video as a piece of waste, is incredibly unjust and unperceptive. I'm a friend of the producer, but that's not my reason for this comment. Instead, I defend an artwork that I think is valuable on all levels. It is well suited to bring Coleridge poems to students in a way that raises their appreciation to it and raises their empathy for the lessons that the former Mariner.
