In the ocean of crap that Hollywood (and others) continue to put out, this is one of these diamonds in the rough. A small, simple movie that is very fun with your leaves and the feeling that you did not just waste an hour and a half of your life. Ashley Judd is really quite amazing in this movie. I've never really been a fan or have noticed it before, but it will return and see this early performance of her convinced she is very talented. Watching this movie was an assignment to a college course for me so I was skeptical i would care for myself. I thought, "Oh boy, some dirty chicks movie or feminist boys-bash indie crap ..." I was pleasantly surprised. Without analyzing many important themes, I'll just say, if you have not seen it, make yourself a favor and check it out. Sometimes, the down-to-earth cinema, slicing-in-life is the best, and that's a great one.
