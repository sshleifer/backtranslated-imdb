"The whole world is a step with its actors in it" - or something like that. Who the hell said that the theater stopped in the orchard orchestra - or even at the theater door? Why is not the participants in the theater experience, including the story itself? <br /> <br /> This movie was a great experience that said: "Hey! The story is you and it needs more than your attention, it needs your active participation." "Sometimes we bring the story for you, sometimes you have to go to the story." Alas there is no one listening, but that does not mean he should not have said.
