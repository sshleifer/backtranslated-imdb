The version I saw in this movie was the Blockbuster rental with a similar title, but an oath word in it. This movie was funny as hell. It was also true of the bone. If you have ever spent time in Hollywood or the area around it, you will understand the humor. If not, you can not 'get it' at all. The story of two people in the business has difficulty making it until they finally reach a crush point, it is a rare gem. He says he is a drama, but he is a drama as Deer Hunter is a comedy. Loren Dean is wonderful, as always, as a supporting actor. Jamie Kennedy could keep her own well. His performance is especially impressive during the poodle scene. The downside was Carmen Electra but we can not have everything.
