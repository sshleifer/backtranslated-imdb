Henri Verneuil's movie may not be so popular as Parallax View, 3 days in the Condor or JFK but it is certainly not worse and sometimes even better than those classic representatives of the genre. Actions take place in western fictional state where fictional leaders have died. After several years of investigation, special government commissions decided that the president was killed by a single gun. But one man - prosecutor Volney, played by Yves Montand - thinks there is something more to be investigated and so the movie begins. This film does not cope with some exact theory, but it embraces the whole structure of relations between the government and society in the world today. These films can only be made in the 1970's but it will never lose its reality. In addition, it's even a bit scary how precise are it's words. 10 out of 10.
