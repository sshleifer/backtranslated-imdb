"Soylent Green" is one of the best and most disturbing fiction movies in the 70's and is still very compelling even by today's standards. Although flawed with a small date, the Apocalyptic touch and the property environment (typical for that time) still feel very unsettling and think-provoking. This season's film-level is surpassing the majority of SF flick contemporaries because of its strong cast and some intense sequences that I personally consider classic. New York in 2022 is a place of depression to be alive, with over-population, unemployment, an unhealthy climate and the total scarcity of each vital food product. The only form of food available is synthetic and distributed by the Soylent company. Charlton Heston (in a great form) plays a suspect investigating the murder of one of Soylent's most eminent executives and breaking off scandal and black secrets ... The script is slightly more than sentimental at times And the climax does not really come as a big surprise, always the atmosphere is very tense and puzzling. The riot breakdown is really grueling and easy one of the most horrendous moments in the 70's. Edward G. Robinson is ultimately impressive in his latest role, and has a great (but too modest) support role for Joseph Cotton ("Baron Blood", "Abominable Dr. Phibes"). This is Science-Fiction in my book: a nightmare and inevitable for mankind! No fancy space-boat and monsters will attack our planet.
