I just saw the Year Drugs on VH1 and I love it. I think it reflects the history of the drug very well and most importantly it had a great meshage of all the tenants. Woodstock, Joplin, Hendrix and Jim Morrison's death have many examples of drug use and drug abuse. It completely covers the time line with the evolution of drug use in America in both good and bad ways. In my opinion this documentary is well done and I would like to congratulate its creator because this is exactly what is needed to be played on the TV in those days. I'm hoping to release the DVD. You should definitely see it !!! This movie is stunning - Big Time!
