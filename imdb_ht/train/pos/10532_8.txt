Make the world go. Find it on my shoulder. Say what you have said and make the world go. <br /> Well, Dave (David Hewlett) and Andrew (Andrew Miller) were in a marinated, one for embezzlement, and the other to kiss a child. Neither were guilty, but faced with charges and homes on them to be torn down, ended in, well, nothing. The whole world, except for the homes away. <br /> It's kind of strange, but funny, too. Just what you would do if you were all alone in the world? Two friends just enjoy each other's company and do what they want. But that gets old fast, it seems. Then they begin to improve their lives by hating away memories. The sound effects during this were great. <br /> <br /> Things really were weird in the end. This film has produced a great imagination, and writes and directed by Vincenzo Natali, with the help of the two stars. It just has to be seen.
