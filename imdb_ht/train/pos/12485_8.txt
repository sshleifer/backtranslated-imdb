I just watch this movie and be told, I was very impressed. It's very crap and it's time to get you jumping out of the chair! I smoked several "emergency" cigarettes on the road to calm my nerves! If I was criticized, I would say that perhaps if anything, there were too many times to jump. It reached the point where each new scene was climaxed with a jump and this gradually wore away the thrilling effect, because your new kind has come. Although it has virtually every cliche of the genre of ghosts, they all did so well that it kept the climb, scary-factor. It has the brightest element, the 6th and the Changeling Sons (in particular, the sound reminds me of the Changeling). <br /> I would highly recommend this anyone looking for an old-fashioned sore!
