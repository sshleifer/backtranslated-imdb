Three girls (a all-girl media crew, including actress Barbara Bach, no less) visiting a small town to cover a festival, finishing rented rooms in a house that should be avoided like the epidemic. Well done little shocking, suffers a bit from some redundant dialdown dials and a drawn line-drawn line (which does not do very well in hiding its secrets). A hidden underlying theme is quite disturbing (as in: ancient shock-material), and this is basically what the movie thrives on. Performance and cinematography are pretty much higher by comparison (compared to the late 70's / 80s early film of the same vein), but what really makes me recommend this movie is the fairly long stage scenario of sous-environments . From the moment the "Keller Junior" character presented, his performance made my jaw drops open and did not close until the end of the movie. A very pleasant surprise to see actor Sydney Lassick (who was funnily wacko in "one flying on Kuckoo's nest", and now completely back in the "Unseen") takes on one of the leading roles.
