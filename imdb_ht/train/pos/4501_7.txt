This group of English profits is a pleasure to watch. Throwing in support can form a series of their own. It's a previous sight seeing tangled between the head of his wife's surgery, and a new beautiful boy surgery boy. Only super act acting in Francesca Annis, Michael Kitchen, and Robson Greene's sexy rose this out of the garbage category in a very enjoyable "stuffing". The only Quibble is that it's hard to accept that the Francesc Annis's breach would fall in love with actually married Michael Kitchen, who loves me, is hardly an international, or even a British symbols of sex. You can easily understand why Robson Green would light her fire, and apologize to the "Doors". The guy who nearly steals the show with a great "set back" performance is Owen's father David Bradley. Watch it in "the way we live now", in a completely different performance, to get an idea of ​​his set. Daniela Nardini as the Kitchen Secretary, a sex toy, is difficult to forget as the mistress spurned that makes Kitchen regret she never looked great. Conor Mullen, and Julian Rhind-Tutt, as the sidekick Green budgies as I said could have their own series. They are good. The whole thing is a great deal of fun, and I recommend it, and thank you so much to let the customers pay them hard to say in this fascinating venue.
