I'm glad others enjoyed this movie because I know he's not the biggest reputation and he does not make any money in the box office. I thought it was terrific and there are several reasons why - Bogdanovich led with the lightweight touch, the cast (especially Coleen Camp) is perfect with Apple's Big Bad never look best on film. You've seen worse movies!
