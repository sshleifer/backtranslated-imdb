Spoilers And I picked up the book "Angel of Evil" when it first came out to know nothing in the case. Just giving the press to the Australian people a break here, I was far off before I began to question the culprit in the Chamberlain. The author obviously intended the reader to understand why the public jumped to the conclusions. John Bryson told the story as it was presented to the jury (and collected by the press) in the spray, patches (??), James Cameron's doctor who had the necklace cut with scissors, that a baby by could be taken out of clothes and buttons are always up, printed but without, etc. all quite convincing. After all, these experts in the fields have testified that there is no apparent reason to lie, and the fact that the evidence was completely wrong did not notice me at all. It was also very technical evidence, hard for a layman to understand. At that point, beyond some hearing hearings in the trials, hardly anyone has ever heard of a dingo attacking someone; people did not believe it was possible. The public was suspected of the Seventh-Day Adventist, whose origin was made up of a cult, with all kinds of wild beliefs contributing to the appearance of guilt. Is not it for a dedicated lawyer, who has worked continuously to investigate the trial and witness testimony, to find the Azariah dress later that would not be enough to get Lindy out of prison. The book shook me for this reason, and I was reluctant to come to a conclusion about anyone's bribe ever since (except OJ of course). I was thrilled that a movie was going to be on the case and did not think he could do better. I always loved Sam, whom I could identify with completely, and Meryl was perfect as always. Beautiful photography, haunted music. I think it's not just a very good, but a very important, movie. Too bad he did not receive more advertisements at the time he was released.
