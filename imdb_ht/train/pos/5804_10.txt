Michael Jackson is not very popular in USA yet, however in Europe (especially Germany) he has always received many fans. Many will say that this is a bad movie, and it is: it's no conspiracy, it's all clicks, Michael praises himself constantly. But you can not expect a draw or non-glowing in this kind of movie! It has fun visual effects and the music is perfect. Fragment of Criminal Smooth - the greatest song ever, full moonwalks, dance group dance and even the famous "Michael Jackson in Bench-on" - to make this movie one of Jackson's rulers with an even good-looking (and white. ..) Michael Jackson! <br /> A must for fans of Jackson, a must for music fans, a must for fan dance fans. <br /> However, as I'm a MJ fan, I should warn all Michael Jackson hating them out: NOT watch this movie, you'd only make increasing your hatred.
