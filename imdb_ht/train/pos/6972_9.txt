The Caprica episode (S01E01) is well done as a pilot. Really, this episode is the exact same content as released in DVD pilots. What they said, Episode 01 provided a very solid background in the very popular series "Battlestar Galactica" (both the original and the 2007 rum). It significantly applies most of the 2007 series. As the trendy cemetery of sci-fi at the end, this series explores "virtual" life or environment. On top of this, we have given many backgrounds on line Adam's family as well as their relationship to the unrevealed (in the Battlestar Galactica series) creator of the Cylons. For the most part, this first episode revolves around the popular topic of "Virtual" life and (as expected) life of the colonies, and the birth of the Cylons. <br /> <br /> Over all, I prefer to enjoy this episode. Although, it was not new material for myself or anyone who had previously seen the DVD release of the Caprica pilot, the series seemed very promising. As is the case with many pilots, Episode 01 leaves us with a cliff-hanger to ensure a follow-up by a hearing (Sci-fi community). I definitely will keep watching for solving as well as development. <br /> I give this series 8 stars.
