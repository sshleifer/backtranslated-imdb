When I first saw this movie I was with my dad. He encouraged me to watch this movie because he was one of his favorites. After watching the movie it immediately became one of my favorites. <br /> A river running through it is on the two brothers who each take a different path to life. Norman Maclean (Craig Sheffer) is the eldest of two brothers and is placed on the path of education. Paul Maclean (Brad Pitt) is the youngest rebel brother who travels on a full path to obstacles. The movie follows these characters as each follows their own path. <br /> There are no pitfalls of this movie. You will be entertained all the way through. Acting, directing, and writing is all perfect. The two outstanding things are the cinematography and the score. Both of you who enter Robert Redford's world create for you. <br /> <br /> This is an all around great movie that is destined to be a classic. Certainly it is in my book. If you have not seen this film definitely look it as soon as you can because it will stay with you forever.
