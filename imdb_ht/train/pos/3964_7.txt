I found the FBI story remarkably entertaining and convenient to look for my New Day holiday day. Her drama and action-packed episodes were thrilling. The hardesty character was well drawn and admirable. Overall photography, script and direction were perfectly credited. Rather than taking the movie to be a reputable piece of propaganda, as some cases, I loved it as a well-painted painter in the need for smart spirit and brave body in battle against crime. Again, describing a family holding together even under the strain of the husband's commitment to it (arguably) important tasks, I did not get to be a twee representation, but an ideal and exemplary one.
