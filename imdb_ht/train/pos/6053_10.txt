A gem gem. Many laugh out quickly moments, the shop and pub scene has made me stomach-laughs unearthed. Characters are recognized and the dialogue is well observed - I know people like that! The humor is surprisingly gentle and the movie (this may sound strange) put me in mind in an Ealing comedy. It's a little movie that has many details. It certainly takes a look. I watched her a few times (I showed all my friends!) And notice something new every time - a bit of dialogue, something visual that I had not collected over before. I was able to get really picky and get a couple of shortcomings in the movie but I'm not going to be because in general this is a great fun, feel-good movie that is really worth a look with which anyone has a sense of humor enjoy. It's a movie that will find her friends and I hope there are many of them out there. Oh .... and He has a great band.
