Great scenario and some of the best actors the world has ever produced. Montand gives the concept of police detective "Lone Wolf" a new dimension of intensity and, most importantly, credibility. <br /> When a typical Hollywood cop-heroe loses family, friends and pets kill it is usually given its minute of grief. But when the seconds are over, he pulls himself together, packs his gun and goes gleefully fired up his enemies by one. Marc Ferrot Montand's, however, is really devastating - not to kill his girlfriends, of course, but also do not find that he has another lover. In his confusion and anger he does not seek revenge but needs to keep going to find people who commit the real crime to a crime where fingerprints are all over the stage. So all his actions become unescapably logical. This is the main reason why this film honors us in our place, but definitely not the only one.
