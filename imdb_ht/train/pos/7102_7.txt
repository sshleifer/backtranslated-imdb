Other reviews here seem to think that this is a terrible movie. That's simply not true and a little unfair. The acting is of a good quality and the direction moves on with a decent fluid. I do not think there is anything wrong with the Tarantino-screened way of armored stories together. Maybe just a new tool for directors trying. I thought she made the movie much more interesting. Maybe a few elements of the script need tightening, but that's the only fault I can get. Nestor Cantillana gives a great performance as Sylvio, also Antonella Rios is stunning and worth the price of admission alone.
