I admit I had some trampoline when I first saw the forecasts for this movie. Was VH-1 trodden on hollow ground here? I mean, Harris and Quinn do not really look or even sound like John or Paul. But I must admit, this movie really surprised me. It's far in the OS movie I hope. Instead, it's a character study, a low-key, capricious, and finally look at friendship, and the ultimate lesson we all learn: it's hard, if not impossible, to take that we were once, and that was than not.
