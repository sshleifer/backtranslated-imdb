<br /> If you like rap or hip-hop, watch this movie, although it's funny if you do not get the referrals, as a straightforward comedy. <br /> <br /> Do not see much of the many hyped CB4, but what I saw was not the heart of this little storm. <br /> <br /> Do not hear from people involved since, that's a surprise. The movie looks great with Spin Tap, which does not have bad things, and I think a lot of the dialogue, while priceless in Tap is funnier here, probably because I'm more in rap than day thes rock, so trial my own cloud that point. <br /> <br /> The chicks are funny as hell, and it basically spots the benchmark for most of the movie, not all of them are in-you-figure, which means the physical comedy and one -Materials get priority over the take-offs. <br /> <br /> Great fun, one to look twice if ever was a movie.
