I saw this day since it was first out of the movie, I thought the film had given a good soldier point of view, giving a realistic account of men at war. The scenario moves in a beautiful rhythm, showing a group of people behind enemy lines, and trying to return back to their own line with an enemy inmate. Characters are well developed, and credible. David Hemmings is a good actor and plays the leading role and conviction, such as Alan Dobie (as German Helmut) I was amazed, that I could get this movie on VHS or DVD, and I feel it has become the forgotten movie is sad, as it is super lot of other movie films I've seen.
