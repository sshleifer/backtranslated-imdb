I just saw this movie in a sneak preview and all I can say is ... "What did I just watch ????" And I mean that in a good and bad way. <br /> <br /> The draw is really simple. Stiller and Black play friends / neighbors. Stiller is focused, hardworker while Black is a dream. Black invented this idea to create a spray that clears poo. The idea becomes very popular, and black gets very rich. The morning morning black progress and the fact that he always tries to be the best friend and Stiller causes the stiller to become crazy and jealous. <br /> <br /> As I said, the plot is simple. Everything else is plain odd. The direction is odd, and an unusual brochure opening shot in out-of-now sped up sequence. The dialoug and the act is very odd; odd in a rambling sort of way. And the sound track is oddest in the movie, from the strange "jealous" song that keeps on the comeback of the scene where you think you will hear a classic 80's, but suddenly it's Japanese. <br /> <So the true question is this ... is odd funny? It depends on the peppers on the person. I was cracked up by the unwavering strangely sweater of the movie. After the screening I heard people call it horribly unfunny and happy that it was free. Strange, I understand the points. There is no joke whatever, so if you are not hooked by the uniqueness of it all, you will hate this movie. Absolutely hates her. This movie is destined to lose a lot of money at the box office and become a classic DVD cinema. If you can laugh at a movie with no real jokes, like Guy Cable or Punch Love Drink, then I suggest you see it. If you do not, run away from this movie. It will only make you angry.
