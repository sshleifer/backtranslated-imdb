I could not believe the comments made on the movie. As I read the awful opinions about the movie I actually ask if you actually saw the same movie that I did. /> What I saw was incredible! I think actors and directors did a fantastic job in the movie. <br /> I did not have the pleasure to see either actress already and I could not have been further put back by the incredible task that I should say it the most credible movie that I've seen in a long time. <br /> What I do not see is why everyone has such a problem with Deanna's choice of drugs in suicide attempts, from the comments made you sound like he was the actress choices and his stupid choice. That I do not understand, a movie written by someone else and someone else who guides them how it can actress errors I fail to see. I think it was a real credible movie that I would see again and recommend. Opinions are what they are and too bad for so many, be near minded. I hope to see any of the actors sooner I think that all plays great roles. <br /> <br /> Occupy Philipps will be the actor paying a higher one day and I hope he can laugh at the face of all who criticize it! You go girls!
