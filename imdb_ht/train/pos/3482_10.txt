This is my first IMDb website comment, and the reason I write it is that we're talking about ONE of the best movie ever! 'Ne goryuy!' will make you laugh and cry at the same time, you will fall in love (if you are not a fan again!) and Traditional chorus Georgian song, and maybe you will accept the difficulties of your own existence and just feel good after watching it :) What I like about this film is that actors in the non-leading roles create vivid and memorable characters and are just as interesting and important as the central character. The movie begins Vahtang Kikabidze (who is great), but you will remember every single face around him in the movie. You will find yourself quoting the lines, which have become the home name for many Russian speakers. A movie for living with them. Simple, yet deep, you'll want to watch it again and again.
