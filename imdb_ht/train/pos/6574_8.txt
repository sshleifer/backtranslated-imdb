This would be difficult for some people to get in, being used in styles of Hollywood styles. The direction is inspired, apparently simply a filming of the set-up stage, and the audio quality is bad here and there (the fresheness of clothing people at odds with their voice, etc.). friends and I started looking without knowing what to expect, and the first stage almost put ours. It seemed very stagy and cheese. Then we picked up on the tune of the content, and really started to enjoy ourselves. It's very funny, despite some korniness. Definitely give it a chance if you appreciate great dialogue. Also, Helena Bonham Carter is adorable, of course.
