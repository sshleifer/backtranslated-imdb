Hello Playmates.I recently watched this movie for the first time ever and it is also my first experience at Arthur Askey, I have admitted I was very impressed by this movie. As a fan of black and white film generally, pimlico passport, the lavender hills crowd and Tommy Trinder (apparently a distant family), this movie appeals to the fact that it provides good old fashioned British humor. I noticed that some about here criticized the performance, but in my opinion it stopped the test of time as a fine example of quaint comic acting and if anything added to the picture did not create characters that are more than the stereotypes only which seems to be so dominating movie now. If you can get caught in this movie I would recommend you get caught up, shame those films generally do not show on Sunday afternoon again. I also was happy they had the opportunity to look another piece of work by Arnold Ridley (Private Godfrey in Army Dad) .I thank you
