I got a good laugh reading all the idiotic comments for this movie, as it's obvious that those who criticize the movie have never seen it, or have been stupid enough to pay for it. <br /> The best reason to watch was on Elvira's show a few years back. Elvira released the film and laughed as much as one could. <br /> It's a flick monster movie ok, compared to hundreds of American flicks flicks made. Way Best !!!!
