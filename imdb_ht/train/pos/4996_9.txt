I saw tons of HK shareholders, and this one is right at the top of the genre. The scene of action is as interesting and kinetic as anything you've ever seen in any action movie. Kung Fu is spectacular, the pyrotechnics-popping, the heartstopping cascade work. Correct is perfectly rhythm, increases the tension and compliments the fluid cameras. This film is directed by Old Pro Corey Yuen, whose resume is upset with some of the best works of the genre, including the Jet Li legendary car in Fong Sai-Yuk. If there is one missing thing in this movie it is the presence of a three-dimensional character, though Martin, the male lead, comes closer to him. This movie is full of archetypes rather than character - the sexy killer, stealing his jumps and his bitchy girlfriend, villains. That said, Shannon Lee has a terrific screen presence; it is great with the fighting, the exhibits, and weapons. When it's screens it's hard to take your eyes on it. It's fine. Why is not this woman a big star?
