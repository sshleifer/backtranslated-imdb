Tony Scott can make good and bad films, personally I think he can be a bit flashy and trashy and his work obviously suffers in comparison with that of his rather famous brother, but this is probably possibly his best movie, them. /> What makes this movie great is that Scott gives Denzel (burning, better than Day Training) and the revelation that is Dakota Fanning time to develop a relationship of real heat and tenderness. The setup is absolutely NOT boring, although it takes time - it involves, and takes us on a little trip to the characters - including a superb role for Radha Mitchell as the mother. This all serves to make the action much more effective, as we are, to invest in the characters, for all the too-obvious weaknesses. This film has you on the edge of its entirety, and does not bark from the end either. The film would of course be nothing without Washington. I often wonder why it seems to get many duff roles, when it's quite as good as any leading person out there (I can only really think of one, Daniel Jou Lewis, whose most powerful screen on these days ). This movie would be great, given its status and strength in its performance, and the quality of the movie. She just goes to show you that if a studio does not become a movie of the block, it ends up going straight to the video. I wish I would have a chance to see it on the big screen.
