ATTENTION, SPOILER! Many <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Many people told me that "Planet of Apes" was Burst's worst movie and apart from the most weaker than the original movie. So I decided not to see it. Another friend of mine who had not seen the movie again, advised me to look at it despite this because a Tim-Burton-movie is still a Tim-Burton-movie. I decided to do it, and I found that it was right. <br /> It is clear that a remake of such a famous movie as `the Planet of the Apes' is automatically influenced by commercial thinking. Still, Tim Burton manages his movie to represent his strange playfulness as `` Beetlejuice 'or' Batman '. If you are a fan of Burton-movies, it's hard not to like one of her films, though she has some flaws: nack-racking monkeys squeals, pan-dresses and a leading actor who could, without difficulty, be replaced by another person . <br /> What's the movie to give us in the first place, is an answer to the question: What is the result when Tim Burton is instructed to create a remake? First of all, Burton would not Burton, if he would not refuse to call it a remake from the beginning; It is a 're-imaginable'. On the other hand, Burton knows that almost every viewer of his film has seen the very first movie version of Charlton Heston (as human), and he knows that a remake does not exist without its models and that the two films by will stop being compared. So, all he does is playing with this comparison at every moment in his movie, and. g. by reference to quotes. Regarding the story line, Burton does a brilliant job when he answers open questions in the original first, and then leads the entire despair hearing by destroying this wonderful clarity and ending the movie with? AND here is the SPOILER ?? Leo comes back to earth and finds himself inside a world that seems to have been ruled by simple forever. <br /> Now this is the Burtonesque response to people's expectations to keep because of the amazing, ending shock of the first `warming of the Apes'. A finish, even more unexpected, more amazing and: completely confusing, because? and here I do not agree with the various `Planets of Apes' home-and-platform? it makes no sense. There can not be a meaning in it, or just something so complicated that it becomes effective. Tim Burton is playing his cruel game, making it a grin and doing it well. Burton fans will be sure to read, others may feel betrayed and complaining about some sort of sortism. Well, and I do not think that producers will ever ask Burton to direct a remake yet ??
