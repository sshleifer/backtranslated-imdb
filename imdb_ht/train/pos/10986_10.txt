We stumbled upon documentary, Gray Gardens, last Sunday and was "staring at" without warning. All who entered the room became transfusions of the television and the haunting images of Edith and Edie who seemed to be living out of their lives in practically one room in a huge mansion on the beach, eating ice cream and corn on the cob (which was cooked on the bed table) - and the cat urinated on the edith bed with its incredible words, "I shout about it [the center]." We did not see the start and wonder what we were watching and how these aristocratic women managed to get to the position they were in. a must see !!!!
