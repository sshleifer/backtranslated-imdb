Without "mental anarchy", this film I'd like to get in DVD offers an extraordinary dip in the vital and mental context of thinking of the people before "disenchantment of the world". That, thirty years ago, a director and a scenario writer could test one sympathy with such a romantic truth to make it to their heads let me be surprised. It would be necessary to be able to see and re-examine the film for better seizure than the temporal and cultural distance we have lost ability to be included / understood, analyzed and ultimately accepted in those or such examples of "primitive thinking". Because this thought holds almost impossible to feel in the world secularized however there are some key to our behavior, that only the next generations will be able to analyze and inspire enough. If anyone knows where I then get a digital copy or VHS me or DVD ?? thanks in advance.
