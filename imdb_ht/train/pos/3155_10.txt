I wish "this 70s show" would be back on TV. He has shown the greatest ever !!! They should make episodes between other episodes but of course that would be confusing. But I wish he would return and do more episodes. Please return ... The show was absolutely hilarious. You could not laugh without seeing an episode. There is a really funny part of every episode and the show was so much better when Hyde and Jackie were going out with each other. Those were the best episodes. "This 70s show is the best" ... It will be and will always show the best ever. It was really sad when the show ended. They should make new episodes.
