This is the best piece of film ever created It's a piece of master that has brought a tear in my eyes. I never forget my experience. I do not understand why people do not think I'm making the dinosaur turn into a performance reminiscent of De Riro Bull's Bull, the Scarface Pacino, and the Gladiator Crowe combined. This should be released on DVD in Superbit format so I can enjoy it as it meant to be enjoyable when it produced and filmed it. Whoppi Goldberg really turns into the performance of a life as a tough, bravest cop who is against it will be associated with a hot hot dinosaur as her partner then hi-jinx's indices to say at least. By the way I say the complete opposite of what this movie is to say is utterly flushed.
