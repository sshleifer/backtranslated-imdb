Slowly the dreams made in this pursuit of bronze ring by a naive hustler (JON VOIGT) and his lame man-man sidekick (Dustin Hoffman), soon forged a friendship based on core basic skills. <br /> <br /> A daring movie for its time, with a higher example of the type of fearless landscape they have explored in the more films of the 60's graphics. Symbolic of the "innocent end" of American films, since it was the only X-rated movie to win a Best Oscar. <br /> <br /> JON VOIGT is the male hustler who comes to the big city waiting to find women an easy way to make money by fighting on his body, but quickly finding the city is a place cold with no carpet greeted for his ilk. Meeted by a lame con-man (Dustin Hoffman), he goes through a series of serio-comic adventures that leave his dandelion and bitter, ready to leave the boundaries of a cold water for the sun Promised in Florida, a countryside friend of her "Ratzo" dream of living in. <br /> But even in this final quest, two are losers. Jan Schlesinger led with delicacy from a brilliant script by Waldo Selle, and John Barry's "Midnight Cowboy" theme added in the intense moments of research and despair. <br /> <br /> Summing up: A true American classic honestly faces a tough topic and daring to show the underbelly of certain aspects of the city's life.
