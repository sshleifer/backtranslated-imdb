Two snipers travel deep into the forests in search of their goals; a slimy South American drug-master and an important general. <br /> <br /> Moderately successful in building a brooding atmosphere, shooter is not much against a very solid thriller, taking it in time, establishing his character and combat and climaxing in some good action sequences. Director Llosa is not always successful in keeping the furniture mood and could tighten the story a bit; Some detour here are not added up very much. But this film is far better than the Stallone / Stone Travesti Specialist. Billy Zane, usually incredibly tedious, does amazingly well as the inexperienced sniper associates up with Berenger veterans. As for Berenger this film proves to be his latest great Hollywood budget business venture. He can do this kind of role in his sleep, it is very compelling here, reproducing the role twice more in direct to DVD suites.
