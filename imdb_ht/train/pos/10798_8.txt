First saw this gem in Joe Sarno way back when, and I must say that after seeing it, I can never forget Jennifer Welles. At first I thought the film was moving a bit slower than I would expect for a film Sarno, but when Jennifer was coming in, the first time I ever saw him anywhere, I sat up and took avi. His presence in this film is difficult to avoid, and spices up all the scenes he participated in. I've seen most of the rest of Sarno's film, and the other films begin or feature Jennifer Welles, and I must say that this was both Sarno and Jennifer in their best collective. Sarno's direction in this film of domestic domain drama is superb, and Jennifer has shown (figuratively and literally) an acting ability that makes this a must see. Co-star Rebecca Brooke (aka Mary Mendum) and Chris Jordan, both often co-stars of Ms. Welles, and often starring Sarno's work, turn into credible performance as a pair of adventures, Menager again normal. This film is Sarno classic.
