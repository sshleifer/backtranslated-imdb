This exciting documentary tells a remarkable story of an expedition to capture Tibetan blind trekking in the Himalayas; but also in a personality conflict between two remarkable people. On one hand, there is Erik Weihenmeyer, the first blind man ever to ride Everest, and the team of (see) Alpine guides who guide the kids. On the other, there is Sabber Tenberken, a blind woman who runs the first school for Tibet Blind, who agrees to the expedition but immediately doubts about how she progresses. At some levels, Sabine simply does not understand the mountain's philosophy (with emphasis on summit); it is probably right to identify the imbalances between mountain hikes and the desires of children, but its certainty of its own correctness makes it a person hard to sympathize with, especially as it has an effective veto. In the background of this (reasonably priced conclusions), we get an insight into the lives of the children themselves. I enjoyed the movie, although it delivers a message clearly designed to be uplifted - even if it details the dispute, the movie a bit relentlessly asserts how amazing everyone is presenting in it. But it's hard to discuss with that assessment, though it is presented to the viewer a bit unsubtly.
