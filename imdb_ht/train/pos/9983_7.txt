This film is about human fundamental relationships, and the interaction between them. The main character is an old lady in the sunset of her life starting a trip to her past, making an analysis of how she lived her life. This trip is precipitated because of the economic crisis son and his intention to put him in a nursing home. It is a very honest look at some issues that we all ask ourselves at some point in life, and there are many high ideas to discuss in this film such as family heritage, real love, marriage or destiny. Although this kind of melodrama movie has nothing new, this one can be useful to watch it and family members discuss some ideas. There is a good performance by the actors and the characters are very credible, but because of the time some characters may not fully develop. I really recommend this movie for a quiet Saturday afternoon.
