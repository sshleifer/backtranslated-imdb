It is difficult to describe the word Bug, it is one of those films that really have to be seen to be understandable. It follows a most fluid and interesting narrative than anything I've seen lately in a Hollywood release. As its characters react to the chain of events in different ways, and as events dictate different paths for the characters they follow, the audience is simply an observer. Almost Proustian flowing narrative thinking for thought, very spontaneous in the script will have you glued to the screen, waiting for anxiety to see how it all works out to the end. And as far as the thematic elements ... have a particular sequence of films that go from sadness, brightness and beauty, and then tragically, all in the span of about a minute. And it works. <br /> This movie is the best of magic. He reminds one why independent films are perhaps the star of the bright film industry currently there. Perhaps with more movies in the good bug, people are starting to take notice.
