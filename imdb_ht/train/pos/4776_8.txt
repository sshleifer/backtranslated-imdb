I watched this movie in one of my normal moments, which is real real late at night. Usually if a movie does not interest me, I start to fall asleep and attack the fridge to stay awake. <br /> At first I thought this I had done since this movie started to slow down, along with the fact that its shots tend to linger with the character for a long time. But after a bit, I start getting more of the movie, as more is revealing about the main character of her story says. In the end, you feel like you knew it all your life. The film kept my interest so much that I did not even know the sun was about to arise. <br /> Not many Lynch's Freck Style, but there are enough of original characters to make the movie fun.
