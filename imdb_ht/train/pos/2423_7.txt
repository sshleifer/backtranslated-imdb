Once in this life means that once a hoodlum, always a hoodlum, and nobody gets in or out of `the life 'for free. Neighborhood hoodlums in New York sell drugs and run scams because they can not make it legitimate in the world, perhaps because they have a criminal record, or a drug habit, or because they're just lazy. This simple story with a couple of twists on especially characteristic jerk manages to draw compassion from the audience for its main players because of their loyalty and compassion for each other. The film is written, produced, and directed by Laurence Fishburne, who also stars as 20/20 Mike (all nicknamed hoodlums), and based on his play, `Riff Raff. ' It feels like a game from beginning to end, especially during the longest stage where the three main square players decide who can trust. Often times the dialogue comes very fast, much faster than it would be on stage, and I think it is the biggest movie's flaw. The blend of as a flashback across the movie is poem in the street, a sort of rap rapport iambik, which is violent and evocative of this film released world. The poetry makes it difficult for them to postpone these guys, those hoodlums that kill, cheat, and betray one another, as worthy of our attention or beneath our contemptible. The disturbing thing about this film is that its realism shows us not only how these people live, but how they suffer for the same reasons as all of us. One too stupid, another a junkie, and the last suffered from consciousness while the audience wonders, or even laughing, in the irony of swordsman asked from him hanging in the malls saying jokes in the middle of breaking his.
