I enjoyed this movie, perhaps because I had not seen any reviews, etc. It was delightful with a little bit of a 'stuffing'. I do not know why he did not do more in a splash than he did. As far as the story goes, I could relate to some aspects of the character of Paul Reiser, and I could "see my dad" of Falk's character. Has reminded me a lot of times past when I was a kid and listened to my grandparents, too. If you enjoyed cinema such as Old Grumpy Male or Golden Pond, this is your movie. A "Travelers", in my opinion, and one of those who feel-good stories. Peter Falk and Paul Reiser had a lot of verbal tussles, but nothing happened. I would say it's rate at least an 8, maybe higher.
