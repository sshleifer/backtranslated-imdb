In the early 1970's, Clifford Irving proposed to write the final biography of Howard Hughes, claiming to have spent months preparing for the book, engaging in interviews with the millionaire reclusive. When all this turned out to be false, Irving was accused of testimony and spent several years behind bars (although still admitting his results was accurate). Flash forward to 20001, several months before September 11, a book entitled 'Prohibited Love' (published in the United States as "Lost Honor: Love and Death in Modern Modern Days") by an already unknown author by the name of Norma Khouri, a woman from the Jordan, reported on the death of the slain mercy of his best friend Dalia, due to the fact that Dalia, from a religious Muslim religion, Christian man. It, like Irving's biography on Hughes, was revealed as a potential fake. Australian movie maker, Anna Broinowski tries to dig into the quake that Khouri's attempt was to clear himself in the lie (s). During the time frame of 104 minutes, the film attempted to reveal is Norma Khouri telling the truth, or is it just a compulsive liar, and an agenda / vendetta in her own? Interview footage with who knows / knew her (including an ex-husband, her publisher, and others) tells the stories in the story. This is a lace, well-documented product that manages to point fingers in the same way as many potential parties guilty. Not rated, but there is a bad tongue language & a re-deduction of the murder scene scene grisly, played a few times (but nothing is almost as graphic & disturbing as what might be seen in recent episodes epic episodes, such as Saw: Part 84). It's not a good choice for the little ones.
