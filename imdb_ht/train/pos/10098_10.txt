The Dominion Tank Police without a coke in a doubt, one of the most amazing ever-produced shows, but not just in the field of animation. While the first part (Acts 1 and 2) mainly consists of action and pleasure, the second part is more serious and one should not treat the second part in the exact same as the first part. Subtlety is truly out of this world and the characterization is beyond brilliant. You must have an extra degree of intelligence to appreciate the second part of the finances (Acts 3 and 4). I have some complaints though. In the first part, Tank Bonaparte has literally jumped on a tank shell and did not make any sense at all. One could also question the plausibility of jumping Bonaparte on the wing of Gunship helicopter even though it was cool. Buaku rule.
