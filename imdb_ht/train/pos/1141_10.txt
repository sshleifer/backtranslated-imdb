Anyone who does not laugh all of this movie was packaged. I watched it at least twenty times and I still get tears in my mind at the scenes. Sally Field is absolutely perfect as Celest Talbert, a soaplike soap star that has to cast casting trying to get it replaced by the hope that their own star will rise. The fields of 45, always have wonderful pixie quality and beautiful and a perfect figure that sadly had three children. I'm partial, I'm in love with it. Throw in "Soapdish" is full of stars that perform their role in perfection. Kevin Kline is flawless, as is Robert Downey Jr., an ing√©nue Elizabeth Shue, Whoopi Goldberg, Teri Hatcher in one of his early roles, Carrie Fisher as the oversexed casting director who auditioned an actor for a small party as a bloody man his shirt over. Kathy Najimy is wonderful as the hapless costume designer, and best of all, Cathy Moriarty as Nurse In that drive the trace to find Fields the characters removed from the show is hilarious. <br /> This movie should have Oscars for Best Comedy, Best Lady That Leads to a Comedy, Best People Leading to a Comedy and Many Other Greats, including Writing, Leading and Supporting Actors and Actresses. Find the DVD so you can watch it over and over for the next five years. You will always laugh at it when the disc drives out.
