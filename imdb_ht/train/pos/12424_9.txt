I would always like David Duchovney to go to the movie business, and finally he did, and it made me proud. This movie has lived up to what I expected for. Duchovney played his character very well, managed to remain consistent with something new, instead of playing the Molder Agent used. Therefore, I give him extra credit for his role, also because I could not see anyone else playing particular characters. David was great, but nothing compared to Timothy Hutton. A brilliant performance that you do not get tired of all the movie, because it never fails to surprise you. It has weakness, and strength, makes the story all the more credible. I also enjoyed the narration, he added to the story a good deal, and there were some very memorable quotes that I always used throughout the time. This film also has a wounderfull note. I recomend this to anyone who loves drama, and does not mind blood.
