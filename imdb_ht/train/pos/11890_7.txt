This is quite a dull movie. Well-shot and realistic performance especially a very good in Depardieu as a framework with bad boys and realistic realism and art-house connotations all over, it fails because the director takes no position, stand or criticize on that subject it reads precisely. One of the French and regular French-speaking partners working on film and Depardieu - I believe they did 7 together - Pialat failed to engage. It seems to be a treat on why women fall for the bad boy who will hurt when they have a ready-made companion caring with good-hearted husband around. Isabelle Hupert who plays the lobbying and nonchalant elegance offers oppressive answers like "I Do not Know"; "I love her arms"; "I love his love of love" for her husband asking to kick her out of the house, but palliates and reconsidering because ... I suppose he likes it. So he accepts and hopes for what? That it will be one day to wake up and come to his senses. Things like these do not respond in Pessy's style to erect docu-drama and long speeches and even longer scenes that do not add up. I know the answers are not added, but please take a stand. Jules and Jim, this is not. The final shot like cold as the film we just looked is a grief and headache only to the most forgiving.
