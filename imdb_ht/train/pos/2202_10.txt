I had to be only 11 when Mr. Peepers started. It was a must see for the whole family, I believe in Sun. night. Repeated gags were Rob opening his locker (he had to use a yardstick or guidance to gage the right place on another locker and do some other thing, finally kicking the place where the door would open), and taking out pins New shirt (at the beginning of an episode would open up a package with a new dress shirt and for the rest of the show must get one PIN after another that he missed when unwrapping the shirt, distribution was everything with pins they got a lot of laughs.) I remember an aunt who drove a Rio like Jack Benny and always wanted "Sonny" to say something scientific. He would think and come up with "semi permeable membrane" or osmosis that causes it to say how brilliant it was. (you should have). Marion Lorne stole the show every time he was on screen. Why did not continue the series from his POV when Wally left (he was scared he was saying, but by then he was way too late) I would never know. I saw a place where the 1st TV wedding (big one anyway) was Tiny on the Carson show. Horsecocky. It was Rob and Nancy (I never had the dolls for it) and I remember he made the cover of TV Guide and got the press of all the papers and magazines bigger. A trip to the Museum of Broadcasting in NYC years ago was disappointing in that they had many episodes then and what they could go now. I always remember it as beautiful and wish I was a little older.
