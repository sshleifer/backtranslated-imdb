This is comedy as it once was and compared this with the remnants, the MONEY PITCH AND YOU MAKE YET?, Only point out all the more that 40 movie makers had a Flair for comedy since, sorry, lost. <br /> I was 15 when I first saw this and even at tender age, there was a lot I could laugh at. Now, of course, being familiar with adult frustration, I see a whole lot that I miss as a teenager. Three main actors ... Cary Grant, Myrna Loy, and Melvyn Douglas ... interacted perfectly, but the core of the movie lies in frustration they meet in achieving a dream. It's never as easy and free of invisibility hassle as an envisions. <br /> <br /> All in all, this is a classic comedy that still stands above the attempts to noticed it.
