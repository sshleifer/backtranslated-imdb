This film was terrific and even with a less than convincing finish, it's still well worth seeing. The movie starring Claudette Colbert is about to marry Robert Ryan. When the minister asks if anyone has any objection, a guy jumps up, announces that Colbert CAN does not marry because he's already married !! Colbert stressed this is not true, but when investigating to find out that Justice in peace and many others remember her marriage and have even signed a marriage license! Slowly, it becomes apparent that Claudette's head slipped and those around her seriously doubt her rules. Then, when assuming the husband was first murdered, all evidence and suspicion fell on Colbert. The film is an exciting movie mystery movie, as I was far out to describe this is just the first half of the movie. What follows is amazingly intelligent and captivating. Unfortunately, the conclusion, though, is a bit of a let-down, as the guiding force behind all this turns out to be "right from left to right" - and it is discouraging since it was so unexpected and impossible to guess based on the information given to the viewer. However, despite of this, the movie was so good, I can even apologize the end of the limp. In particular, Robert Ryan did a great job as the fianc√©e-bustin of the fiancee, though apart from her other performances were also excellent.
