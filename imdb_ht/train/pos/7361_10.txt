This film would usually be classified as the worst film production ever. Ever. But in my opinion it is perhaps the funniest. The horrible and scenario direction makes this movie priceless. I bought the movie also monitoring the DVD to negotiate in my local book store. Me and some friends then look at her, admittedly also rather drink. It soon happened that this was not any normal movie. Instead a priceless kind of what's probably James Cahill's latest film. At first we were confused and screaming for the DVD player to be turned off but fortunately in our normal-no-one state was bothered. Instead we watch the movie right. At the end we soon realize we've found any dream global warming, something that you can accept in laughter for hours, while laughing for every wrong reason. We soon showed up all our friends and they also agreed, this was not a work of abysmal film. This was a movie that you can really wet yourself laughing at. This was a movie that anyone can enjoy. This was engineering.
