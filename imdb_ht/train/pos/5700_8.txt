I have read many negative reviews of this movie and finally got a chance to see it on DVD. To be honest I really do not know what the problem is and it is. It's a mysterious mysterious decent mystery, shown at various points of view, from an oftentric drone cast out potential killers / suspects, including the late late King John Holmes. Please read the scheme for the exact details of the movie - I want to contribute more to a review than a Summary. Many revised have gone so far to the lowest rating films because of violence but I really do not see it. Many modern movies have become worse - Saving Private Ryan was ultimately more violent than this film, which often depends on implicit spots than those real brutal killers (the martians shown in this film made with lead pipes, after ). /> I was enthralled with both half of the movie - the first showing John Holmes as an unlucky cash hungry drug addict, and the second half showing around him as a little conspirator in a bloody sense. The film has excellent acting, though Dylan McDemorant looks much more than a bit out of personic biker's personic biker and goatee'ed bad personality boy. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack was also awesome - a fantastic mix of B-70's of rock and pop pop, spread out over a couple of hours from all sides right here Boogie Nights.
