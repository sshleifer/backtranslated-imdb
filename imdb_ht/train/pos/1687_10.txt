Some movies are really hilarious about science fiction but this one will hit your sox. Jack Nicholson lead the Martian take-off is side-division. The plot has a very smart sound that has been seen to be enjoyable. This is a movie with heart and excellent acting by all. Make some popcorn and have a great evening.
