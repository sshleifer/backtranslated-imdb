I'll admit, I thought that this movie would not be good but I soon changed my mind. The film kept you guessing as that direction it will be. Pierce Broson is amazing in her role as a hit man, who suddenly gets burned out and asks a man he met at a Mexican bar for help. Greg Kinnear is an awesome straight man, as his role as a threatening person from Denver, who starts an innocent conversation with Pierce in a Mexican bar. The film will have you laugh as Pierce delivers hilarious a covered material (especially on sex). The imagery of this movie is very well done, especially in the Bull scene and when Pierce sees himself when trying to finish his last job.
