When will they learn that some movies are made for fun and do not necessarily come from changing the world? If you realize this then expect to have piles of pleasure while watching "Bill and Brad's bogus travels." This is a movie that's fun to watch, Keanu and Alex make a big screen on their screen representing the characters of "Bill and Ted's excellent adventure" and even more 'style' then they were in the movie 1. It's not rocket science but it's great for a laugh, the characters were very like-able and the story-line were so radical you have to laugh. Do not expect 'deep-and-meaningfulls' just to expect pure fun!
