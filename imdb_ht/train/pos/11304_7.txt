I'm not sure under what circumstances Visconti director decided James Cain's film in the novel "Postman Still Rings Twice" (I'm not sure if Viscounti has acquired the right book), but the resulting film is definitely interesting. It's not the best version of Cain's story (I like version 1981 best), but thanks to Visconti's excellent direction and casting in Clara Calamai and Massimo Girotti (a very sensual couple), it's a must for noir fans. Visconti combines neorealism and awareness of great effects. The movie is not perfect, though. My main complaint is that the film is a little too long for its own good; The story is moving at a very slow speed (I do not think Visconti was very good at editing his movie). I think that noir works better with a short run. Fortunately, Calamai and Girotti are magnetic actors who keep the viewer interested. Regardless of how I love this movie and their remembrance, I think no one has made the definitive version of the many-praise Cain books.
