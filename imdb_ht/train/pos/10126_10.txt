A lot said about Shinjuku Triad Society as the first true "Miike" movie and I thought this sort of description could be a cliché. But, like all the clichés, it is based on the truth. All the Miike brands are here, the violence, black humor, the inversion, the taboo test and the love of central character. Shinjuku is, however, one of Miike's most beautiful films. He said in an interview that if he did it again it would be different, but not necessarily better. I think what it means is that the film possesses a truly fascinating energy and raw edge that looks so cool that although it might be able to take a more visually or technically complex movie it could not replicate or better purity in this movie. <br /> <br /> As you might expect, the violence is truly visal, gushing blood and critique beatings are supplemented by a fantastic scene in which a woman has a broken seat on her face. (Only a Miike movie could let you get away with a phrase like that.) The movie has a fantastic pace, unlike Dead or Alive that starts and ends strongly and sloping in the middle. Dead or Alive also deals with similar issues, Miike is clearly concerned about the relationship between the Japanese and Chinese in the war period and the topic humbly occupy well here, the central character really comes to life when you begin to understand his past. I can not praise Shinjuku enough. I do not want to give too much. This is Miike before it began to use its animated CGI film and is almost reminiscent of something like Sonatine Sonatine. The central characters are superbly achieved and the final twist is guaranteed that as soon as the movie ends you will blow it back on again to work it all out.
