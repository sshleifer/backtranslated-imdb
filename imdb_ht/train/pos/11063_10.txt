I was totally impressed by Shelley Adrienne's "Waitress" (2007). This film only confirms what was clear in that movie. Adrienne was a talented writer-director, an original and unique artist. He managed to show their misery in daily life and absurd humor and a real and humane optimism trend. Ally Sheedy steals this movie with a terrific performance as a woman who fell on the edge. Man led Reg Rodgers, looking like Judd Nelson, is fine. There is also a great rally by Ben Vereen. The song at the end of the film "The Bastard Song" written by Adrienne can stand as his optimistic eulogy: <br /> "It's a world of suffering, <br /> In a sea of ​​pain, <br /> No matter how many your sun brings you, <br /> You're pummeled by the rain ... <br /> Do not let the heart get you down, <br /> do not greet the heart of your door, <br /> do not live in heart of the heart "
