Time for Hollywood to sit and take notice! If the actors are acting snooty, all you need to do is find the host who worked on this little wonder. Renaissance is probably the first movie that makes you forget that you do not see human beings. Although the voice is not thrown in (Craig, McCormack, Pryce etc.) are some of the best I've ever heard, but even then the emotions described in the 'designs' are unnerving. Animation is not very new but the use of light and shadow makes film in a living painting. Ironically, as wizardry techniques make you forget that this is actually a very pretty movie. Gathering and drawing developments are wonderful with the dialogues dry. <br /> Draw: Desire to employ a mega corporation to unravel a story of lies and corruption with a hero Cold Heart at the helm. Can not say much without giving it all away ... except that while the movie holds you in the corner of your chair, the climax leaves you stiff. <br /> A must look .. even for 'grow-ups' that smirk in 'cartoon'
