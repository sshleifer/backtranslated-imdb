Also directed by Samuel Fuller, who also wrote the scenario, Ramase on South Street is a tough, brutal, movie film on a pickpocket (Richard Widmark) that inadvertently grants self-esteemed microfilm and gets a target for spying agents . Also involved are Jean Peters as a tough guy who is used as a courier by the former lover Richard Kiley. She's the movie-noir at her best and although her performance is very good to her great actress Thelma Ritter who steals the movie. As Moe a weary street buoy selling neck course (and who also sells information) it is terrific in a role that made it another Oscar nomination. It is amazing that Miss Ritter has been nominated six times for a Academy Award and has never won. This should be the role that was cut off for her!
