This is a pretty decent example of noir film. The environment is 50 years old and the Communists are trying to steal secret weapons from the U.S. Government. Richard Widmark is the magic pickpocket without scrupulous. It gives a pretty decent performance but there is nothing A-List about it. The interesting thing was that it was not just an anti-hero but in most of the film, an anti-hero unlikeable. It's not normal. Jean Peters has given such a performance as the hooker and the heart of gold. This great actress Thelma Ritter shines as the poop-pigeon. <br /> <br /> The draw had its fair share of twists and turns, wisecracks and hard speeches. There is a fighting scene near the end of the movie (at the train station) that was pretty bravest and exciting. <br /> I think fan noir (like myself) will enjoy this movie. For those who do not-nude viewers, it may seem like a little date and everything Commie has a tad overdone.
