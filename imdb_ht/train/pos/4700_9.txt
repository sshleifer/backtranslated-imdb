I could not believe the rating rating 5.6 on IMDb on Johnny Danger at the moment I wrote this review and I thought I did something to encourage memorable pieces of comedy as much as I can. Seriously, to get a rating so low, people who voted must have a very limited sense of humor, not to mention a very open mind. If you do not like humorous cops, do not watch them! Combine absurd humor, a very good story, with an exceptional speed given by the gunners running several times, this movie has made its way into my DVD collection. And this without mentioning the visual colors integrated here and there and of course, the use of "clinic d'oils" and "cliche" based on favorite movies organized our crime. I showed this movie to a lot of people and, being introduced to it without any specific expectations (except perhaps watching a comedy) - the very state of mind should have to watch any movie in my opinion - They all liked it very much. It goes well, it's not long to look and there is absolutely no slow downs in the evolution of the story, which I think is really right. Ensuring it's not perfect, some gags are falling a bit short, but no movie is perfect, especially when considering other views. That's why I rated this movie 9 out of 10. This movie is in my opinion a precursor like "Top Secret" and "Spaceballs" in the field of absurd but well-thoughtless comedy. Which nowadays is more absurd while cutting off the thought and energies. Sometimes gags need more culture than a lot of people imagine they must understand correctly, if at all. As a final word, I would like to say: look it for yourself, not following said average Joe and if you do not like it, then you'll know for real it was not good for your taste, which is understandable but easy in my opinion.
