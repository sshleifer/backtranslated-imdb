We do not come to the movies of siblings in Indian movies, or any other language or medium. This relationship has several aspects that have not been exploited in film or novel. Typically, a sister is described as a pile-up who can be used for ransom at the climax. This movie treats the subject in an entirely different light. It is inspired by Romanesque novel "The Mill on the Floss". The brother is very prosaic, indeed, the blue-eyed boy who is a conventional good son and a favorite with his mother. The sister is romantic, wild and challenging in the rules written in society. Yet, the brother's sister is the winner. This film is about the love of two siblings separated from childhood and revival of the same feeling when they meet years later. It is also the quest of the sibvied brother to meet with his sister who was chosen to be wild to challenge the world. Although the movie and the novel put about 3 centuries apart from two far countries, yet their feelings are the same and still hold true.
