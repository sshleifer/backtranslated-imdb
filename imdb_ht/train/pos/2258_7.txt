I believe Sarafina is a tremendous effort at Whoopi Goldberg. In addition, no other star of the movie and its role is less than the title character, Sarafina. Since I work in a high school with urban kids, I think this is an important movie to show South Africa's story apart. Sarafina is a film about the education and relationships of a teacher and student, Sarafina. I bought the video for virtually nothing in a videostore. I watched it and quickly sent to the music numbers. But I recommend this movie to educators and students to understand. Now, while I do not know other actors and actresses in the movie, I assume that they are very popular in South Africa and I'm glad they are filmed with a South African cast and crew with the exception of Goldberg in hand if it gets people to see this movie, than Whoopi arrives in worldwide calls.
