I kept this film not crashing on the cable in her midst and rented it to see it whole and I'm glad I did. I was immediately drawn by the storyline and caring about the girls involved. Naive high school graduates, best friends since childhood, take a high school trip, and take in by a hired man named Nick who finds them in serious trouble. They are used as sacrificial mules in an heroin heroin ring. Take to prison the girls learn to deal with their imprisonment while trying to find a way out of trouble. All these attempts to help themselves fall short when the Thai criminal justice system shows imperfection and girls end up in more trouble and loses faith in American lawyer Yankee Hank. Hank gives up trying to defend them after she feels betrayed by Alice (Claire Dane). However, the Thai native wife of Hank smells a rat in the case and does some more work to investigate and finds out the girls really being victimized. The end movie when Alice does an act of despair to save Darlene (Beckinsale) made me in tears. I really enjoyed this movie and I would recommend it.
