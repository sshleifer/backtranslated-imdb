At first glance this movie does not look like a big one. After all a Bette Davis movie theater with only 166 votes on IMDb and a rating of 6.5 would be a rather bad one. But the movie turned out to be a delightful surprise with the original. <br /> <br /> You would first hope that this is a normal 30's movie movie with a love-formula story, but the movie is amazingly well-constructed and has a strange and original story, which also helps make This movie is very pretty much to look. <br /> <br /> The story is brought to two main characters played by Bette Davis and George Brent. They were helped by a cast of characters especially fun but the movie mostly involved the two sides. The characters involved in a most unusual and intelligent love-story stories that work funny as well. He made this movie a delightful little comedy to look, which is perfectly fun. The movie is quite short (just over an hour long), which means that the story is not wasted anytime on useless to draw lines, developments and characters. It also makes the film quite fast, which helps make this movie a perfectly watchable by today's standards as well. He may have made the film a bit of a simple at times but never goes to the expense of its entertainment or pleasure. A fun romantic comedy Pleasant Pleasure that deserves to be seen no more! <br /> <br /> 8/10
