I saw this movie this year on late night TV. Back then he goes to the title of "Staircase in the Sky". As a young boy, I remember being deeply moved in the story and amazed by the visual effects of the trial court (who saw him know what I'm talking about). These imaginations! A perfect mix of romance, drama, humor and fantasy, this movie is right up with the greatest classic ever: Citizens Kane, Casablanca, Gone and the Wind. This film is rated very high by the IMDB voters and reason - about 51% voters rated it 10 out of 10; more than 84% rated it 8 or higher from 10. I was surprised he was not listed in the 250 top films until I realized so few have seen / rated this movie, compared to those on the list . What a pity. I hope this movie gets released on DVD for Region 1 (North America), for that 1), I can buy it, and 2), others discover this hidden treasure.
