I can very well be one of some people who are really stuck in this movie. I also saw this movie when it came out, and agree with the last post that the Acedemy was in front of its' time. The humor of the movie itself is most MAD MAD. I do not see why MAD stands behind this feature. It was also one of the few films in the early 80's to have an assassin accompanying bands with punk and new band waves that were emerging from L.A. at the time. I own the band and I play it still in that day. What's wrong? There are definitely worst movies out there. I do not consider Porky to be funny like the Up Academy, some really good laughs throughout the movie, and the jokes are dropped on either stereotypes or getting put. Hey, nobody said this would be the Maltese Falcon.
