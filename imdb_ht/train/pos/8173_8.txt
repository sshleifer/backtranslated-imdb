The brightness of this film is that even a competent dentist is beautifully scared. He is one of the primal man's fears. This movie is the nightmare image of every kid went to the waiting room. Corbin Bernsen gives an amazing non-substandard performance as a crazy dentist that I guess trying to kill but he only works on the teeth so he does not really work out. In a particularly gory scene we find that-so actor Earl Boen has his teeth completely destroyed with floor and exercise, which I guess is the absolute worst you can do when you are a killer dentist. It's a typical Brian Yuzna situation, not well written but there's Gore. The plot is shoddy and at times seems to be making up on the arena but hey, it's a film dentist movie, we've all been thinking of it, but they did it first.
