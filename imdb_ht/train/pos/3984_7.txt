As part of the celebration of the release of Royale lockers, this new film and the beginning of it has shown, from director Roger Michell (Notting Hill). I almost turn it around to be a bit boring, but I'm glad I'm sticking to it. Basically May (Anne Reid) is a single mother of Helen (Anna Wilson-Jones) who hardly saw anyone and she did not have a boyfriend of years. Her daughter says she might want to get married with her new boyfriend, Darren (Daniel Craig, of course). After knowing each other only a few days, May and Darren have a secret deal. And in his age, with a 30-something, and the new Bond! Anyway, they obviously want to keep it secret, but May have regretted and wonderful if Helen is getting acquainted. When it does, Darren gets less complicated than May. In fact, Helen asks her permission to hit her. Also starring Peter Vaughan as Toots, Danira Govich as Au Pair, Harry Michell as Harry, Rosie Michell as Rosie and Johnny English to Oliver Ford Davies as Bruce. Really good!
