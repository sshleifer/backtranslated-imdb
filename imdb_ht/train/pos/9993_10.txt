The movie's most hillary and funny Brooks I've ever seen. I can watch and re-watch the tape 100 times. I laughed a ** off and I cried a few moments. It is really good and funny movie, and if you like Brooks - this is a must! In short - Brooks (billionaire) gets to the streets as homeless for 30 days in order to win the entire poor district of his competitor. The reality bites, but in the end - it's about warm relationships between people ... Hightly recommended!
