I anticipated this movie to be decent and maybe kneeling, but I was completely wrong! Charlie Cox (I never heard of him until now) played an incredibly good leader; It was so serious and romantic, I and my friends who saw the movie with me totally fell in love with her. <br /> <br /> Claire Danes, whom I liked before (LOVED her in Romeo and Juliet), did I enjoy her even more. His act was fantastic, I could not even say he was Indian. The chemistry between it and Charlie Cox was very good, the casting was quite perfect. Robert DeNiro and Michelle Pfeiffer were equally well driven; DeNiro as a gay pirate ... priceless, priceless. I laugh so hard at this scene where Septimus comes on the boat ... oh my god, wow. Pfeiffer has played a decent villain, I love her as the brilliant mother of Hairspray. But he has the good amount of melodrama and snapping comments throughout the movie. <br /> <br /> Overall, it was funny (but not slap-stick at all!), romantic, the special effects were not totally common, but when they were, they were great; The gastos from Ricky Gervais and Peter O'Toole were well placed. <br /> I totally recommend this movie to anyone who loves fantasy movies like Princess Bride or even Lord in the Rings. He kept my interest all the time and I'll buy the DVD when it comes out!
