The bigger games of Kasparov or Fischer can be a mess for a total rookie. This is a great movie. There are no special agencies involved in the scheme. This is the sign! This is a PRIVE plot, built as a PRIVATE enterprise. This is a self-destructive and a self-organized scheme. As a conclusion, the scenario describes the perfect professional scheme: private, self ?? organized, self-destructive, with no trace at the end. Anyone can behind the plot: a smart "director" with some money. Everything can be done only by delegations. The "Director" must just trigger. If the normal viewer can not see the essence of the plot in the explicit sequence of the movie, a real scheme is less likely to be discovered. All actors' performances are well done, and some special monsai for Gene Hackman and Mickey Rooney.
