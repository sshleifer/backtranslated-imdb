I saw this movie first on my way home from Paris Newark aboard Air France in August 1996. The film itself I believe is quite a masterpiece. It's the kind of movie that people should do. I still think that Daniel Auteuil is one of the sexiest actors around. In this French movie, she plays a divorced father and businessman who has lost her zest for life until she is through a Down Syndrome who lives in an institution with other Down Syndrome patients. The actors including the actor who currently have Down syndrome create a friendly belief and relationship between these two men easily. Daniel's life and we changed forever with the Down Syndrome man. He realizes that life is not just work and does not play hands for the living and love and that's what life should be all about. The finish is kind of unusual though but I still think it's one of my favorite movies. It's enough to bring a tear in your eyes.
