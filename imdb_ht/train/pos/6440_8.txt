I never seem to write an IMDb review unless I am very surprised at how good, or how bad, a movie is. This movie falls into the first category. Every year I try to see all the candidates for the best foreign films in the Oscars, even those that I know I will not love. "As it is in heaven" looks like the bill. The sound conspiracy is sugary and emotional and slow ... To my taste, which runs more towards the original, dark and / or daring alien movies (Michael Haneke, Francois Ozon, A lot of modern Japanese / Korean) "As it is Heaven "does not sound particularly interesting .... It did not get released in the USA, so I sat for watching a VCD I found in Singapore, preparing to" cross it off the list. " After a dull beginning, "As it is in Heaven" gets the rare film where you really become inspired by what's happening on screen. Few Points: The characters in the film are the best "character" characters-the injured wounded, Bully in the city, the beat wife, Ladies loose yearning for love, the minister rushed .... Fortunately, they're hugely a bold clay, as well as being well written and well-acting. Angla Olsson, as wife of Inger's wife, was nominated for an Oscar whose performance was English. Strong points: the music is beautiful, and the main song, singing by Gabriella, is truly dramatic and memorable. And keep an eye out for Olga's 87-year-old Actress's playlist, who keeps up with the dance stage as well as the youngest ladies! I will not discuss the end, but I'll say it makes sense. They're a lot of emotional stuff happening in the last hours of the movie, and you're not sure why they're going. Although nothing is explained in words, it all makes sense as the movies come in a fitting crescendo. **** from *****. Probably most of the Swedish films I have ever seen.
