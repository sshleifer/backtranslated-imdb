Well, I guess I'm emotionally attached to this movie since it's one of the first I went to see more than 10 times in the movie theater ... help me in my master's thesis, or rather keep me working it! > <br /> But on watching it again many years (and many movies too) later - what a little bit-crafted this is! I never saw Gwyneth Paltrow in a most compelling performance, and Jeremy Northam is the perfect Mr Knightley - where one meets a man ??? <<< sigh >>> Turn off Sophie Thompson as Ms Bates is vitious acting at the finest (oh, napkin, sorry!) and the rest of the cast has no deception either - Toni Colette brings a lot of her Muriel Harriet, and Ewan McGregor is convincingly good - and Alan Cumming and Juliet Stevenson are the perfect "impossible" couple! <br /> Of course along with the costumes, and the beautiful band contributes much to the feelgood, almost obbiton like the atmosphere of the movie - although as far as cinematography and art deco is gone, it's almost a quarter of visual overlays. Very pretty, but a little more austerity might target a better sense of period. But the good thing is, the movie does not take itself too seriously, and there are lots of fun - with some very fresh corrections - that keep it from sinking into Merry Old England fashion macaroons. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The most favorite thing is the ball scene - some nice acting and directing here, and the concluding dance summarizes the relationship between Emma and Mr Knightley just fine. The mercy of the final proposal stage goes on for just a little too long - off two shots (I can think of exactly what!) And it would be much more in keeping with the rest of the movie. /> Gosh, I just achieved (by reading the imdb lists) that I saw Jeremy Northam at least three movies without even knowing that it was him - apparently having a lot more going for him, as an actor, than just being a gentle English heartthrob! Hmm, guess I need to pay my video store a visit ... <br /> <br /> Lovely movie. My favorite Jane Austen adaptation so far - though perhaps Ang Lee's sense and sensibility is, strictly speaking, the best movie, this one is closer to my heart - and I've certainly seen it many times more! Watch it if you can - and not too difficult about its little flaws. <br /> <br />
