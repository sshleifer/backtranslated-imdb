It was a while since I watched this movie, and the series, but now I refresh my memory! This was a very funny movie based on the classic series! Johnny Knoxville and Seann William Scott were hilarious together. Bo and Luke Duke help Uncle Jesse run Moonshine in the Lee Lee General. When Hogg boss forces the officials on the farms, Bo and Luke sneak around Hogg's local site and find samples of coal. They soon realize that Boss Hogg is going to strip my Hazzard County, unless the officials can stop him, with the help of their beautiful cousins, Daisy. My only problem with the film was that Burt Reynolds was not good for the Hogg Boss party, and Sheriff Rosco P. Coltrane was way too serious. Other than that, I highly recommend the drugs in HAZZARD !!!
