The "Big Big Things" is a beautiful satirical movie that sardonically rubs pop culture to the point of comedy auto-downtrust. The characters are so interesting and fun to laugh at / sympathize with them. Which brings me to an introduction to the characters I love best ... <br /> <br /> Simon Geist is a man of late 30s / early 40s who created a pop-culture driving editorial magazine called "The Next Big Thing". This thing is, this magazine does not really exist, and it's only an excuse for Simon to get close to actors by interviewing them, only in bitch-slamming funny, insults the ways of buying pop culture. He lives-of female friends, Darla, is also writing a magazine (which is real), which mainly did with him and Simon, as well as he and his father. Darla is a really laudable (or durable) character, depending on how you view her mere neurological behavior. Magda is a whore, the character I loved the best. Brent is a flat character and not many of her, as is Tedra, queen-music queen for a bunch of B-rated rock bands. Still, these characters tie a very interesting website together. And this movie questions all the motivations that people have for what they do and why they do it. It's a wonderful movie and I suggest you see it if you're in the crowd / home crowd. Mark my words! <br /> <br />
