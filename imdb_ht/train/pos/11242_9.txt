Anyone interested in pop music, and not familiar with British music trends in the late sixties, should be sure to look at Breaking Glass at least once. The film, on request of a young woman in her make-up in the music world, captures the times perfectly, from the braided sexism, rough economic times, social change, to changes in pop culture from punk-rough and -Look very tight and pretentious Futurism / New Romanticism. Music styles and fashion created daily in Great Britain in the late-late seventies are still being discovered and recycled (there really was nothing new since 1980). This was a dazzling time, with Breaking Glass both telling a very personal story and cultural landscape survey, and doing both fine.
