Hood of the Living Dead was a lot to live up to their credit before the opening began. First, any play on "The Living Dead" invokes her Holiness Mr. Romero and immediately sets up a high standard that many movies can not afford to endure. And secondly, my movie-watching companion stated that any urban support film would surprise the fundamental Leprechaun in the Hood. Skeptic, we stay in their view. <br /> <br /> We were rewarded with a sincere and good-happy zombie movie. Oh, certainly the budget is low, and of course the amateurs friends directors populate the cast, but Hood of the Living Dead loves zombie cinema. Cheap? Yeah. But when it's cheap, you can see clearly where LOVE holds it together. Ricky is working in a lab during the day and as a surrogate parent at his younger brother at night. It's dream of moving from Oakland. Before that planned escape, however, his brother is shot dead in a drive-by. Ricky's keen scientific idea presents a superior option to CPR or 911: the injection of his laboratory experimental formula. Unfortunately, little waking up in an ambulance as a bloodthirsty bloodthirsty zombie! Chaos and destruction! I think it's more economical to eat your enemy than taking revenge on a drive-by, but then again, I'm a poor judge of the complexities of urban life. (How poor is a judge? In response to a gory scene involving four people, I opine "Ah-ha! White T-shirts on everyone for the blood to show up .. Economic! I used the same technique in my own movie Budget Extreme "Jordan said:" No, this is gang clothing. "White t-shirts were banned in New Orleans for a while as a result." Oh.) A lot of the film is set in a people living room, so there's a great deal of hanging out and waiting for the zombies. But the characters are sympathetic and the movie is sincere - it surpasses its budget in mind. <br /> <br / > Zombie Explanation: When People Play God, Zombies Rise! Or, Maybe: Follow FDA Approved Testing Policy Before Human Experimentation! <br /> <br /> Contribution Of The Zombie Cannon: This is the first Zombie Movie I saw and a drive-by-shoot. As far as the real zombie goes, infection spreads with a bite as usual, but quite very top vaccine does not work - the heart rate shots. which proves true death. And these zombies make cold Jaguar-groei noise. <br /> <br /> Gratuitous Zombie In-Jail: A mercenary named Romero. Groan. <br /> <br /> Favorite Zombie: Jaguar-rushing little zombie brothers, of course!
