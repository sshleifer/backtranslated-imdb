It's good to see a movie with real people and honest feelings. Sissy Spacek is so absolutely convinced as a simple, yet beautiful, daughter of Robert Farnsworth, who finally, in her last role, gets to know what a fine actor she was. It is hard to believe that this is a film by David Lynch. It is slow and even, sweet and moving. One of the best unless you like car chases, sex scenes, and violence.
