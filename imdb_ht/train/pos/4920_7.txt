No, not really, but this is a very good movie indeed, and sadly a gem is forgotten. Black and white suit the movie. <br /> <br /> Straight forward formula, a guy had the epidemic and the authorities must track down all the people he had in contact with before dying. well directed, and the act is great. Richard Widmark as the male lead is good, but is completely on the shadow of the nails acting by Paul Douglas as the commander of the police, and Jack Palance (never better than this) and Zero Mostel as the villains. Unfortunate Palans went to play similar characters to some really gangster second or movie wars.
