There are not many movies made on the Lighter-than-Air Aspect (LTA) aspect of aviation, but this is one of them and is damn good. Just a fun movie to watch. Most of the film takes place in the Marin Blingp operation of NAS Lakehurst (and NAS Tustin plays the role). Wallace Beery plays a lucrative but Munchausen-like Senior Chief Ned Trumpet, a registered pilot, whose story tall has come so often does anyone really believe him. Half the fun is near the end of the movie when events begin to prove that most of its more unusual stories are actually true. <br /> Place in WWII, the main centers drawn around Bachelor's trumpet wooing a local widow only to end up having a father relationship with son and the disabled disabled widow, Jess. Told that she would never walk without skiers by doctors, Chief Pens pulled some strings and a Flight Marine flight surgeon to assist in restoring the boy's little nursing. Jess goes to join the Navy to become a flight officer, flying blimps back to Lakehurst and facing a new set of challenges. <br /> A very well-made film, albeit not without some fantastic Hollywood dial slides past the technical advisers, and Beery's inability to walk in stage. Otherwise this film gets good scores for technical accuracy, and provides a rare look at the LTA Marin operation. Topics Registering the Cash, an exchange between love love Cathy, whose trumpet and Jess, are an absolute absolute.
