With the current trend of gross humor, this film is the granddaddy of them all. While some of the humor are dated, each skit will either trauma, recover, or make you laugh loudly. Most memorable are sex toys games and, of course, the VD commercial. It does not always work, but it pays when it does. I give this a 7.
