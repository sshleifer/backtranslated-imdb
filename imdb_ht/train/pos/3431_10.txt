Simply the best Estonian film that I've ever seen, although it is made by a Finnish director Ilkka Järvi-Laturi. Tallinn Pimeduses is a fun comedy about a bunch of people who tried to steal a huge amount of gold, a national treasure belonging to the republic of Estonia. But at the same time it is some kind of a summary of the conditions in many Eastern European countries at that time. In the early 90's Soviet Union fell into pieces with many countries, such as Estonia, became independent. Now the conditions can be best in most of these countries. But in the beginning of the many 90s of these new nations were forced to fight corruption and organized crime by the Soviet era left as inheritance. (And many of them still do ... at least on some levels ...) Tallinn Pimeduses is a very realistic film in which era and credible characters and a well-written script. The actors are also very good, especially Jüri Järvet (maybe the best-known Estonian actor, playing Snaut in the Solaris Tarkovski), playing with old gangster that's slowly becoming tired of his way of life. But the most amazing performance from Monika Mäger, a child playing Terje, a juvenile girl in her early teens, whose presence in the scheme is quite essential. (and its name is not even mentioned in the list IMDb-credit !!!) you <br /> <br /> There are not many films in the world that managed to be entertainment and artistic at the same time. But Tallinn Pimeduses does. Without strongly other Järvi-Laturi films are far from this kind of achievement. His first, Kotia Pinhe was too artificial and his latest, story was made at night was just a weird mess.
