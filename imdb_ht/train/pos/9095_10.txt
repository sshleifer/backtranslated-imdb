A good, funny movie that gets a solid class all around. I saw a screener in this film recently at work. It was so nice to see this film in dealing with all the sad songs I felt every day. So much, that I figured I would write in. Not sure if this movie is going to be theater, but I hope it does. It's a nice movie to see with friends, its a charming, and it has some funny jokes. The act was terrific (especially Howard Hessman and Larry Dorf .. The direction was very good (not a movie that needs to be over-directed) .. What really makes this movie stand out I think it's written. was such as Neil Simon, Seinfeldish, and clever between character is clever and has a nice rhythm .. As an aspiring senarist, I notice things! (I'm a dork) .. Anyway, a really nice movie that i recommended.
