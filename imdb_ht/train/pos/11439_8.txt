OK - as far as the 2 versions of this movie. There were 2 people involved in the making - John Korty and Bill Couterie (George was just the producer - he really did not have any kind of say in the movie - just helped with money) - the 'Adult' version was made possible by Bill Couterie. John Korty did not like or approve this version (as he did behind him). Thanks to Ladd films going down, they did not advertise this movie and dispose of all the cash ads for the "Stuff of Rights", hoping it would pull them off ... ... and it was not. So this movie never really got a chance. When "Twice" made it to cable (HBO) - they showed the Bobels and Bill's version with John threatening to sue if it was shown again (you notice how the 'adult' version was not over for much time?). Showtime got the 'own' version. The version of the video and laser-disc is the version approved by John (which is greater than Bill). It's a pity, really, as the 'adult' version is actually better and more meaningful. But it's very doubtful that it will never be released in this version of DVD (or any other short format of bootleg). Sorry to disappoint everyone. I know all these things as I used to be the president twice in a Fan Fan club (still there are lots of movies in the movie - used to own a version of the box-box in the 'adult' version, but it was stolen - only has a copy of her current HBO copy). 8 stars in the 'old' version - 5 in the 'own' version. Any other questions, just ask.
