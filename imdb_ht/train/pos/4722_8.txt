Given the low budget and production limits, this film is very good. It is possible, realistic, and shows how the Csikos (Hungarian riders who lived in the plain (puszta) risk their lives to save a pilot who descended from the Nazi ruthless and wildlife ... We draw in strong feelings for young, impressive, yet very courageous people - who admire the American pilot. If you are looking for special effects, superman hero, and magic themes - this movie is not for you.If you want to feel what She must have liked to dodge persistent, amorous Nazism and lack of compassion, then you will be enthralled by this film. I really enjoyed it and for those who love horses, dogs, and humble, those who value the value of freedom and those who like to do this, this movie will be one you will remember for a long time.
