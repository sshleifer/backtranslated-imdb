A meteorite falls into the countryside in a small town, bringing a frozen animal. An old farmer attacked the alien from him, and the young Steve Andrews (Steve McQueen) and his girlfriend Jane Martin (Aneta Corsaut) took him to Dr. T. Hallen (Steven Chase). The local doctor carefully treated poisoning, and asked Steve to investigate the location of the old man. When Steve returned, he saw the pate kill the doctor. Steve and Jane try to warn the police and the inhabitants, but nobody believes on them, while the blatant swallows many, getting bigger and bigger. <br /> <br /> The "Pate" is a cult and classic sci-fi. It is a low budget film, with many cow and actresses (with the exception of Steve McQueen), terrible effects but also delightful and very, but very funny. This is the first time that I saw this classic (I've seen remake of 1988 and Kevin Dillon), and I really recommend it to fans of Steve McQueen and Sci-Fi B-movies from the 50s. The subject of the 1.400 review movie I could not be best. My vote is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "A Bolha" ("The Pate")
