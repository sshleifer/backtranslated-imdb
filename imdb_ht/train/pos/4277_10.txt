"Kum Tamo Peva" is one of the best films I have ever seen. A tragicomedy with deep deep implications of the fate of humanity is shown in the eyes of those very similar to the very common and common people of a Serbian province-just before the start of the Second World War. I saw it in a small movie theater in Russia where the film had a very limited distribution, and I had no chance to come across it ever since. It is such a pity that this film is almost forgotten right now. I searched for a VHS or DVD copy of it many times, and unlucky - could get any. I would be most grateful for other fans of the movie-making gem for a hint of how to buy a copy.
