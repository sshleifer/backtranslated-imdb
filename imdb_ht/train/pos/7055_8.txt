Although Cinderella is not the obvious choice for an end I love Jaq and Gus so I did not hesitate. The format of mice to write a book for Cinderella was an inspiring. I enjoy writing my story stories and hoping kids will be encouraged by this. The three stories are beautiful & fun, although the songs were forgettable. Jaq and Gus were my favorite characters, but I also liked Lucifer, Bruno, Chorus to the Mouse and the rest. Pom Pom has proven to be the perfect companion for Lucifer and I liked the Governor. An end to doing good for a change. My rating 8/10.
