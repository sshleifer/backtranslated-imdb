This film was made in Hungary I think. Anyway, the country is gorgeous, people who play their farms are totally fascinating. Revenues are scary. I got more of the native people, the firm life, and how heroic they tried to hide Brady from the evil Nazi where looking for such parachutists. They even offer sacrifices to life in many cases. The orphaned boy that Brady befriends was a sweet kid. you will be surprised at the rise I think, and the action of trying to evade the Nazis. It is fun and funny in some very tragic and stain tasks. Ladies have hugging handy, as you will devastate at the end. I own it, and looked at it several times. In other words, not just one time around flicking films. a guard.
