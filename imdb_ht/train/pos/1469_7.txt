I admit creating great hope before watching because some friends mention it (and not pervs!) As a must see. And it is a must see! Just do not expect to see something inevitable. <br /> <br /> The Freudian psychoanalysts are interesting in many parts of the movie, but there's just too much pervertion and it does not stick to the end. <br /> Some of the good things are the analysis of the Blue Kieslowski, most of David Lynch, some of the Hitchcock and perhaps a couple more I missed (I just remembered ... Dogville), and I usually Do not miss anything unless they are too obvious or loose in the air. <br /> Other than being repeated, making it too long, the documentary is enjoyable in the sense of noting some perversions of foods by our unconscious, hence the commercial success of most studied and used as the basis for the theory . <br /> I really enjoyed the energetic tone of the narration and the effort of Mr Zizek to revive Freud's theory, which was numb for too long, especially in northern America. Again, it's the way to the top and I believe it's not a waste completely in time for my belief that most people have a black appreciation for death and blood.
