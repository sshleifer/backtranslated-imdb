I thought that Mr. Dreyfuss was perfect for his role as the actor and the dictator. His co-star, Mr. Julia, plays his role equally as perfect. It was interesting to see how reluctant Richard Dreyfuss was to replace the dictator against his will. But it has become more confident and comfortable with the role as time passes. Since everything happens for a purpose in life, I believe he was forced to replace the dictator because he meant staying there for the year that he did. I guess he was staying because he was supposed to see how good his life was compared to the poverty he witnessed at Parador. I think he's got a lot of things to do in life and he needs to get a serious fact check that does not stay in that country while he's done. .. anyways ........... That's why I gave this movie a 7 out of 10.
