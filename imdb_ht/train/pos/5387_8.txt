Even in the 21st century, children who provide children are dangerous: women have miscarriages, and give birth prematurely. Fifty-five years ago, it was not uncommon for women to die during childbirth. That is the term "life start": a look at the "hard case" of the parish in a maternity hospital. Loretta Young plays the lead, a woman brought here out of prison (which crime is committed by the germinal to the plot) to give birth; It was controversial about the fact that she will have to give her baby up after it's been done. It's a ward and several other women, who shared their joys and pains with each other. Even though Loretta Young is the lead, the outstanding performance, as usual, is set by Glenda Farrell. Farrell was one of Warner's Women's "B" in the 1930s, which appeared quite a bit of supportive role, and sometimes received the lead in Cinema B (Farrell played Torchy Blane in several installments in the series "Torchy" B-movie.), Farrell plays a hopeful mother who does not want her children, since they will only be found in the way. He does everything he can to find in the way the nurse, such as oil smuggling in the ward (this course during the ban days), and drink as a fish - apparently they never heard of fetal alcohol syndrome back in 30s. <br /> <br /> Interestingly, unlike most films in the early 1930s, not the women being bumbling idiots are getting in the way of the heroic men - that reverse situation, and their ancestor hopes quivering the frozen hills. (See veteran actor Frank McHugh as one of the ancestors of hope.) "Life begins", being an early talkie, treating the subject with a doll just in melodrama, to be sure, but it's quite a good movie little. Turner Classic shows it, quite often; I've only seen it showing up on a few days honoring Loretta Young. But it is highly recommended to look when it shows up.
