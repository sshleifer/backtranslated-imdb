This was the worst movie I've ever seen, yet it was also the best movie. Sci Fi The original movie is supposed to be bad, that's what's fun! The line, "I like my dinosaur meat well done!" is probably the best quote ever! Also, the plot sounds like something from a bump dream spell. I can imagine it now, the writers wake up after a long night of getting dance dance and dance dance revolutions, then putting ideas together for this: Marine Marine arrived in foreign planet, infested with dinosaurs and has medieval houses in it, protecting a team science studying the planet. Best idea ever! In fact, to adapt the complete Sci Fi original movie list: medieval dinosaur weapons travel times terrible space acting <br /> So go watch this movie, but do not buy it.
