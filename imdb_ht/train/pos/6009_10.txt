Mark Frechette star as Mark, a college left radical. Mark was accused of killing a cop during a campus riots, and he ran along the way to the desert. He does this by stealing a small plane from the local airport, and flies it himself. <br /> Once out flying over the desert, spot a car in the air. A young woman named Daria came out and saw Mark coupled to the plane. Mark swoops aircraft very low, causing Daria duck or getting hit. When he lands, he gets acquainted with Daria, who is weirdly loaded by Mark's High Healing Mark. <br /> After engaging in sleep conversation for hours, Mark and Daria get naked and make love in the sand. But with Mark evades the law, they realize that he needs to keep running. So Mark and Daria in the sadness are quite intense, because it does not get them developed into a full-blown romance. Zabriski Point was the Eraserhead in the early 70s. Both films have a rambling, vague quality, with intricate meaning and character. Frechette was as reckless of people, as his character was in this movie. A few years after Zabriski Point, Frechette steals a bank into real life. While serving his imprisonment, Mark died an ignoble death. He was killed by a 150 lb weight, which fell on him when he was weightlifting. <br /> <br /> The best thing about this movie was superb movies, with special visual effects. Incredible, slow-moving movements of floating debris in the air after an explosion, was a stroke. Although not as ground-breaking a movie like Easy Rider, Zabriski Point always resonates with the early 70's counterculture. I recommend it, for those who love avant-garde films that show the change, in the young rebellion during the early 70s.
