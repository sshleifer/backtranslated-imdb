SUNSHINE BOYS was the 1975 screenshots of Neil Simon playing on a retired vaudevillian team, played by Walter Matthias and George Burns, who had a very distorted separation and asked to meet one more time for a special TV or something like that. The problem is that the two still hate each other and want nothing to do with each other. Richard Benjamin appears as Matthias's neath, a theater agent who has given monumental responsibility to make this reunion a reality. This warm comedy and winning is a beautiful valentine in a forgotten form of entertainment ... vaudeville and works mainly thanks to one of Neil Simon's best merits and outstanding works by Matthau, Burns, and Benjamin. Burns won the Oscar best for supporting actors for this, but I think Matthau walks away with this movie and his impeccable hilarious performance as Willy Clark. Matthew was nominated for the best actor but he did not stand a chance against Nicholson for one WICK on the Quaker's Nest; However, in another year, this was an Oscar-worthy performance. Matthau screen screens and there is not a fake fake in this very well-timed performance. The scene where it is audition for a commercial chip potato and can not find the name of the right product is a classic. The SUNSHINE boys are a hot and winning Neil Simon comedy that shines thanks to unbeatable chemistry between Matthau and Burns.
