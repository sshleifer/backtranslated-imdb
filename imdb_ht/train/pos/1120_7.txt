Not to be confused with the British black comedy in the same name from 1994. But this Grave Shallow is a worthy addition to 80 scenes of backwoods. <br /> <br /> The plot goes = 4 sorority girls from a club are planning spring spring a life in Florida, but they have plans to put on hold when one of them witnessed a man who killed a woman Local, and when he realized that he saw, well let's just say it becomes a very dangerous game of cat and mouse and things get even worse when it turns out to be the local sheriff. <br /> <br /> Shallow Grave in my opinion is one of the most enjoyable slasher that came from the 80's, especially at the late 80's when the slashers were down, this was one of the few did not with this movie would be best known, it's a pity it's not. This is one movie that is actually confused stereotypes (just try to guess which final girl will do - I got it totally wrong). Throw in the principles of all containers and it's one of those movies that you like hoping they all get away, which of course they do not. This, coupled with the first fluffiness film of half-one hour jars (in a great way) and some flashes of real nastiness (the second murder given a real real) and some unexpectedly unexpected (though this is not a high My sole buddhist did not expect the topless scene where a woman was harassed and her own (accompanied by a religious religious radio broadcast), in a movie late in the 80's. One or two bad things about this movie, quite by bad minors, such as the subcommittee and the two boys who do not go anywhere with the ending that was stupid and more concerned to the Deputy to follow logic. There is no sharp instrument in SHALLOW GRAVE but, in my mind at least, it is a flick of slasher films in and through. Scenes where the girls are hunted in the woods by the harmful sheriff are tense and exciting. <br /> All in all a very enjoyable and refreshing slasher, with great performances from all four of the main girls and the sheriff's psychic.
