Japanese independent film and humor and philosophy where three main characters are running literally almost in the movie all, chasing each other due to strange circumstances and humorous coincidences. While running, we see what's going on in their minds and how they got where they are at the moment. The running act is a metaphor for these down-on-life chances. In some ways, these are really chasing for not being originally chase, but for that meaning in life and an escape from personal problems and broken dreams. Running makes them all feel really alive. The great life-running adventure comes to an end when they accidentally get in the middle of something big, violent, and so absurd that it's funny in a smart way. One of my favorite movie ever by engineering director Sabu.
