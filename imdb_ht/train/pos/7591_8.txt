A mess in folklore, but it's mainly based on Stephen-Chow's genre-ups for his inspiration. There are magic kung fu, college romance, sports, gangster action and some white melodrama for a topping. The production is excellent with the quick rhythm to easily get past the many faults of this movie. <br /> An abandoned baby next to a basketball court. A homeless man carries it in a Shaolin monastery in the middle of a city with a special kung fu manual that somehow has but it can not read. The old monk teaches the boy but expires when he tries to master the special technique of the manual. The school takes over by a phony kung fu master who will help by wacky monks. The new master gets angry at now the 20 + year old boy for not pretending to be hurt by the punchy weak master and throws him out for the night. The boy is getting throwing in a basket from an incredible distance by a man who brings him to the gangster club to play darts. This led to a great fight, expelling the boy from the monastery and man's decision to turn the boy into a college basketball sensation. All of this occurs in the first 20 minutes and most of it passes through the first 10 minutes. Aside from extreme narrative shorten the first issue is how little we get to know the main character until the movie's way. Those who use the boy are more stringent to define in the first time the third is over. The plot does not have any new grounds except for climax in the movie movie. I'm sure you can imagine how the monks will be up to the end. Effects, photography and stunt work are all top-notch and make up for the uninspired plot. Stephen Chow has a better command of plot and comedy writing and this film lives in his shadow, but that's not a good reason to ignore it. It's quite fun with an end-shot finish. Recommended.
