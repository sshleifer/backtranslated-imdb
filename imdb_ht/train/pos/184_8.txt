Nobody like "Show Man" Marion Davies (as Peggy Pepper) and William Haines (like Billy Boone). My introduction to Ms. Davies was a "clip" in this movie; The delightful one slit in which it reduces a scarf reveals different emotions. My introduction to Mr. Haines was in watch this movie, right now; though, it's possible I've seen it in a less memorable role. Haines makes an incredible impression when he joins Davies for a homework - tapping his hat in the ring and some wonderful bits in the food table. Indeed, Haines and Davies deliver great comic performances. The story begins with Dell Henderson (Colonel Pepper) daughter of Davies in Hollywood, certain she will become the newest Tinseltown sensation. Indeed, Davies and Haines have already come to become comedy stars. But Davies was surprised to become a great drama queen. Davies left Haines, and partnered up with dramatic dramatic Paul Ralli. But the audience preferred Davies's more funny role; Maybe King Vidor director will offer up a case for imitation art life? <br /> Full of Hollywood big feet where, both on the set, and there. All major "cameras"; in a studio lunch, at the star chart, Davies sat between Douglas Fairbanks and William S. Hart. The best "bit" player, however, is Charlie Chaplin, who has enough nerves to ask Davies for his autograph! While the cameras are fun, they, and episodic sequences, help "show people" become less of an important movie, and more of a historic important document.
