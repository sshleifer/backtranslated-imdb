Unfortunately, I saw this film for at least 4 times now and I still do not get bored watching it. The visuals are so good and along with the music that is totally awesome and perfect fitting this movie is mind-blowing me. <br /> <br /> CGIs are quite bad IMHO, but the whole visuals and the black and white feel about it and the totally sterile interiors were just ... Just a perfect genius combination for such a movie. The whole feeling about the feeling is indescribable, the draw is so good. However, the film had little flaws, such as e.g. Sometimes I thought the movie was a bit too "slow", but I do not mean the scenic parties do not, I totally loved those. <br /> <br /> Also I was distracted very often by the totally complex story, as when it is in bunker-like underground objects in digicorps, where all the data is saved, and has this conversation with the guy down there ... but that may be just for me: D And the end of their appearance may have somehow more to emphasize, they should have made the find-back-true-memory-part a bit Longer and "strong", but then again without all of these films the movie would have been so good I would never stop watching it again and again ...
