This film was disaster in Box Office, and the reason behind that is innocent in the film, sweet in the story. Music was good, story is very simple and old, but presentation in these stories is very good, Director tried his best. Abhay is excellent and impressive and shines once again in his role, he did his best in comedy or emotional scene. Soha looks sweet in the movie. Remaining cast stars was simply okay. Music with all the good songs, Himesh is impressive as a singer here. Do not miss this movie, it's a beautiful movie and a good one for us. Abhay best work until date. I'll give Akista Ahista 9/10.
