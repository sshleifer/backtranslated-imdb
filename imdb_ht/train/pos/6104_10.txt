I must admit, from the collection EROS MOVIE, this has to be the one that I love the most as well as another that I've reviewed too. The story is something that really keeps you watching. A lot of the EROS films have a plot that looks like a hammer broken into pieces before production when you look at it. All centered around sex, and who can find and how many different people come to the end of the movie. And oh I love God, never look at one of those films when someone pulls a gun. It does not work that it is almost ridiculous, but you do not want to waste the energy to do that. <br /> <br /> "Lost control" is exactly as its name comes on. The protagonist, the leading character (beautiful Kendall Reed is talented and beautiful). The control is the control of someone having the senses, their bodies and their feelings. With one person changing everything for her, make her a different woman almost. But the ice is broken at the same time. This makes for a great movie that I wish I came up with first !! <br /> 10/10
