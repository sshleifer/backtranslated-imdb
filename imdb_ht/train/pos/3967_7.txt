This is not among Jimmy Stewart's best film - I quickly admit that. However, while some see his movie as a pure propaganda, I ask what's wrong with that? Yes, sure, as the FBI TV show, this is an obvious case in the Office to do some PR job to try drum up support. But as fun, she does a good job. Plus, amazing enough for the time he did, the movie focused more on crime than espionage and "comet". Instead, it is a fiction of one of the earliest and career choices he has chosen. Now, considering the silver playing by Jimmy Stewart, then it's pretty sure to act and writing was good - as this was a movie that has a real budget and a studio that was not about to wasted the star of a third-rate responses. So, in general, it's worth seeing, but not especially great.
