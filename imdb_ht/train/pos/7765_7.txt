Douglas Sirk directed this drama over-acted on the happy Fortune. Kyle Hadley (Robert Stack) and Mitch Wayne (Rock Hudson) are boyhood friends and look like life. Kyle is son of a woman in an oil tycoon; Mitch is working for Hadley Oil Company. Both fall in love with the same woman, Lucy Moore; but she is Kyle who has the means to wow her to her feet and to marry her. Marylee's sister (Dorothy Malone) seems to be the city's nymphomaniac and brings a torch to Mitch, which always seems to be one of Hadley's messing cleaners. Ambitious and pretentious; a little over the head, but the stars make it a movie to see. I was most impressed with Malone. Round out cast: Robert Keith, Edward Platt, John Lurch and Robert J. Wilke.
