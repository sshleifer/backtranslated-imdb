This is the first American film to successfully adopt the natural style used by the Europeans, particularly French and Belgian, for at least a decade, and is not it over time? After three high school girls in Crown Heights neighborhoods in Brooklyn during the last days of summer breaks between freshman and sophomore years, she did so all the good art would be: she discovered the universal of the particular. Even if the girls' vacations are conventional outside - boys, gender, popularity, money, freedom, and clothing - we glimpse how all life has been shaped, the universal interface between character and destiny. The natural world is full, complete. The film breathe, staying at this time, occupying real-time. The story says itself. The medium and its affairs, for once, are not the message. The film unconditional, truths convey the perspective of the child to his characters; it does not impose its own or moral meaning. Details emerge from their own, they never push, and thus seem to be all the more real and powerful for their exaggerated. Although major pain was taken to capture the authentic social reality of Crown Heights, part of the largest Black Ghetto in New York City and one of the most violent violent places in the US, the subject is childhood in the ghetto, not the ghetto itself. Documentary footage of the practice sessions in a lot of markets, Jackie Robinson Steppers, punctuates the film at regular intervals and an explosion of color, movement, and sound. Otherwise, the camera remains very close, very intimate, a patient observer, sunbathing, and unobtrusive. The language is rich, spontaneous, transparent. There are some exceptionnels, such as girls lolling over, each revealing its deepest imagination. Lanisha's confession of accepting it to a random violence is much more shocking, one of the deepest marks in the ghetto. He shares with his mother confusion and fear before the challenges of adult life equally moving, and beautiful, ensentimentally affirmative. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It is most emotionally stable and sympathetic to others, and the one with respect to self). Two of them suffer from asthma, a disproportionately disruptive disorder in the inner city. Gunfire, an event that accepts daily, only moments of interrupting conversations. Only one of the girls, Joy, feels hopeful, feels about the future, while the other two degree divides have already accepted despair. This is by far the best American dramatic movie I've seen in years. Watch it, see it, see it.
