Brilliant! My wife and I along the sprawling line to see Holly at the Edinburgh Film Festival. After seeing the movie, I can understand why there was such a long line. Holly is a touching story about an impossible connection between two people. She is a virgin, she is a worn out west. The film has fitted every bone in our body. There is no graphic scene or something hard to look - it's surealism of normality that really kicks you into the gut. The movie is very beautiful. Among others, we loved the scene where Patrick teaches Holly to ride a small motorcycle. Thuy Ngoyen's (cant believe this is his first act) and Ron Livingston's performance was with me for a couple of days. Very recommended.
