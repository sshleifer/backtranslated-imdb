This movie was so great! I'm a teenager, and I and my friends all love the series, so it's just going to show that these movies draw attention to everybody's age. I recommend everyone. His favorite line in this film is when Logan Bartholomew says: "Rosy cheeks", when talking about his baby daughter. He is such a great actor, as well as Erin Cottrell. They are scared up well, and they have such a great chemistry! I really hope they can work together again. They are as attractive people, and they are very good actors. I finally found the movies that are good to watch. Recently it was hard for me to find good movies and show good moral, and Christian values. But at the same time, these movies are not cheesy.
