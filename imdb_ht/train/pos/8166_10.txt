This movie is very great! The act is fine, with excellent casting of Corbin Bernsen as the perfectional dentist who freaks out with his patient torture. In the beginning he saw his wife and the poolman, and then he went crazy. He also took revenge on his wife and the poolman, beside the patients he tortured. The most special effects are also nice, although some are really fake (like a tongue-out, which is set for 1 nights out, and still red in the morning). But the turtle scenes are absolutely well-done. Even though this film has weaknesses it is very slow; Between heavy parts are sometimes just incredibly boring parts. But for the real horror / fan-fan this is a must-watch!
