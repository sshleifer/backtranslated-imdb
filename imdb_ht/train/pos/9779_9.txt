Three horror stories based on members of a Hindu transgrunt culture that return home but changed in some ways. In the first story of our former members of our cult now in a crazy asylum and is visited by a report who wants to find out about what went to the cult. A bit slow down will be like the stories said in flashback while the two sit on chairs and face each other. Reporter is particularly interested in what led to the death of the participants. What seemed rather boring suddenly very interesting with a surprising twist of the story. Things get quite bloody. <br /> <br /> Second story has a violent young criminal visit a psychiatrist for compulsive therapy. The patient seems to have some kind of agenda but the psychiatrist is up to the job. Again, things slow down a bit and get weird. Then there is a strange twist of the story that is very well written and surprising. <br /> <br /> Final story deals with spiritual healers who claim to be able to remove the disorder from the hands and hands. One of the patients is an ancient cult member, so the healing success becomes more complicated. Again, we are surprised by a twist. Is there a beautiful gorian scene in the. There are some beautiful girls full of nudity as well as men full of nudity for some reason. I found stories to be very well written and the director succeeds entirely in setting up every story with its surprising twist and the Tory consequence. <br /> <br /> Note: Review the German DVD.
