This is a brilliant and well-made contribution by a group of fans, and considering it's made in a back room on a green screen painted in the complex and twisted story lines, and his character shows realistic depths and dimensions. CGI created by the crew is breathtaking. While it's the first episode might be a little unstable, it's some final thoroughly thought out and good shot. Some fans might think that the Star Trek franchise came to an end with the early dismissal of Enterprise, but these fans did not take no for a response. I recommend this fan with newcomers, 10/10 hidden front equipment. <br /> Make it so ...
