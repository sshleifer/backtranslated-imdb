This is not the movie Mel Brooks movie. It was much less slapstick than most of his movies, and actually had a conspicuous plot. Leslie Ann Warren has made the film, it is such a fantastic, under-rated actress. There were some moments that could have been fleshed out a bit more, and some scenes that would probably have been cut to make the room to do that, but all in all, this is worth the rental price and see it. The act was good overall, Brooks himself did a good job without his features speaking directly to the audience. Once again, Warren was the best actor in the movie, but "Fume" and "Sailor" both played their party well.
