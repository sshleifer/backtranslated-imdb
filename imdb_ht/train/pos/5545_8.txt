**** Includes Spoilers **** <br /> I was a fan of movie horror now for decades. Just when I think I've seen all the big ones pops up to surprise me. I have never seen this movie before. It was a treat, cut the beaten path too ... not only the path to the swamp ferry ship either. Here was a horror movie made in the 1940s that dared to try something different. The beautiful girl is (gulp) fearless for a change and save the guys, including the man he loves, from the monster! How is that for a twist. This girl has been completely opposed to most women in the film this time, there is no screaming in her own shadow, no illness in great fear, no tripping on a leaf like it runs. This gall was not afraid to be alone in a lonely hut far from the rest of the villagers. Not only that, but the place was on a swamp of rumor about to be haunted. Heck took even naps out of swamp ... as a regular 1940s version of Ripley. No snake, gator or hunger strangler would give this bold odor. Books on Early feminist films should be sure to include this neglected task. Look at this if you're a fan, like me, of those classic movie B / W atmospheric movies made only in the 30s and 40s. And be sure to wear your turtle shoe helmet for protection.
