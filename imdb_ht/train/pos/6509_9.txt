I just can not believe some of the comments on this show! The show is just genius! Ensure it does not follow the tried and true, but we as consumers always want the same thing to push us over and over again. Should not we have the option to sit back and enjoy something new once in a while. The style is not as realistic as before "Scooby Doo" shows, but it does not suppose. The show of the titled "Shaggy and Scooby Doo get a clue" is what part of the titles that all enjoy inviting in other renditions would always be in the action. And nowhere to say that they should solve mystery, and not even can stand monsters, so why would they? I'm really happy to put some point long-standing draws that work in a Scooby-Doo show. They are always running jokes, clumsy hi-jinks, quick-change teams in chasing scenes, gags in standard gags and even Scooby snacks. In fact I'm glad that this show is out there, because I just love it. I am happy to get rid of the rest of the team for a while and focus on just two main characters and a cruel. <br /> <br /> Make sure it's ridiculous, it's supposed to be! Make sure it's different, it's supposed to be. It is supposed to make you laugh at the villain, and applaud the idiotic robotics triumphant over all intrigue gossip, no matter what the size. You should find the "Roobi-Roo" jumble running. The whole thing is just to put together well, no one thing I can think is WRONG with it. Write this, act, the animation, all the top teeth. The title music is awesome (my computer plays "get a clue!" When it boots up), and the background music is just inviting.
