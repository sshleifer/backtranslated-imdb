This is indeed a funny show, done in a creepy clown style, much like a movie Tim Burton. It's worth a look, as it's far more creative than most of these epic shows. Best of all, it's not a "reality" show. I wonder why the public watch is so ready to accept such shows (that lack of creativity) and ignoring wonderful shows like this that actually has a creative bent. While some say the citizen, I think it's really amazing. Many more enjoyable than "Whisperer Ghost" and "Middle". I think it is this funniest thing about the tube since my name is Earl. Oh, and the narration and music are wonderful. If you enjoy showing a bit of the beaten path, I would recommend it. It's not as strange as Twin Peaks was, but it's got a serious corner of it.
