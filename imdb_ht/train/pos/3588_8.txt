When I saw this movie, I was surprised that it was only a movie movie. I think this film should be in the theater. I've seen many films on rape, but this one means out. This movie has a kind of realism that is very rarely found in today's movies, let alone TV movies. It tells a story that I'm sure is very realistic in many rape victims in every small town today, and I found it to be very credible (which is something hard to find in other cinema centered rape). I also thought that Tiffani Theissen and Brian Austin Green were scared of parties they played. I definitely recommend this movie to anyone who likes movies that have a bit of a harsh reality. I loved it very much.
