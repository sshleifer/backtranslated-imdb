Never seen this film until recently on TCM and found this story about Poland and a small town that suffered from the occupation of the Nazis in local towns like many other European cities for example: Norway. The First World War was over and people in this city were still suffering from the lost soldiers and the wounded that War still created. Alexander Knox, (Gimmy Gimm) "Gorky Park" returns from the war with a lost leg and the former city teacher city. He brought a German and was not very pleased with the Polish people and in turn did not fully accept him either. As Hitler's party grew to power Wilhelm Grimm wanted to become a Nazi in order to return and punish this small Polish town for their treatment towards him that was really all in his head. Marsha Hunt, (Marja Pacierkowski), "Chloe's prayer", played an outstanding role as a woman who lost her husband and romantically participated with Whilhelm Gimm. There are many rbits and some very real truths about how Nazi families are destroying their lives and their lives. The animals cars are shown in this picture with Jewish people across the Nazi gas chamber. If you have not seen this movie, and love this subject, give it some of your time; This film is very down to earth for a 1944 film and a story you will not forget too fast.
