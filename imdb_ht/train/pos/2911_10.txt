This is one of the finest music concerts anyone will ever see and hear. I grew up when my entire Lovin brand was brand new and heard it today by the original artist today is a power measure Sir P Mc to spellbind any crowd at any age. This doco goes way behind the scene to show us life on the road not only for the band, but everyone goes down to the Roadies. I saw this guy living in Aussie 1975 and he can make sure his performance here on this DVD is no less than it was given almost 30 years ago. I have a great 5.1 sound monitoring system that does justice and would recommend that person especially to a Beatles fan. This is the closest you will find in a Beatles concert today. Singer, songwriter, lead / rhythm / bass guitar, piano, ukulele, just genius. Some architects can stand alone with one instrument and hold the crowd in his hands. If you want to note perfect music, buy a recording studio CD. If you want to hear raw music as it is the intent and spontaneous crowd, with all the excitement and emotions of the crowd-this DVD is for you.
