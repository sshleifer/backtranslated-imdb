How can a movie be both controversial and gentle? This one does it with a near-perfect structure. No one wants their daughter to be athlete. Apparently most cultures do not want their daughters to be tired, either. Here we see a bunch of superb actors we have never heard of before as different cultures live fairly humdrum life until girls want to be, and they have the potential to become professional football players. The structure around the parallelism of the two cultures is wonderful. There is no condensation. Both cultures see it as modern and invaluable. (And yes, both are funny, too). A default: The Hindu wedding ceremony seemed to involve hundreds of families, but not one child among them.
