This is a Noir Series "B Series", and my vote reflects its members in that genre. I saw this film last night in a left-bank movie in Paris, where he opened a movie noir run. The movie has some flaws, yes, but far too many delicious elements are ignored. As the previous criticism notes, the drumming scene is incredible! (B-movies could break where A-movies were forbidden!) And the draw is intriguing. Regarding Franchot Tone, however, I implore agree: for me, it is mysterious suitability; just the right shadow of creepy. One must bear in mind that there is a sort of German expressionism that is happening here (the director, Robert Siodmark, was a German who came to Hollywood during the war), and thus a time of exaggeration adapted to all films that. At least he does it for me. <br /> However, it's gorgeous Ella Rain who, in the third only credited his performance, held this viewer entertained throughout the movie. A "Friday girl" type that has a solid resemblance to Gene Tierney, it's an amazing fact that she did not become a home name. But it's so good here that I've just ordered another movie itself ('impact') on the Internet, and I can not wait to see it too.
