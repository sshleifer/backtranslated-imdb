Astounding ..... This could be a poor attempt at renaming the film yet Ommen recreated, but I'm sure she enjoyed it. <br /> <br /> The latest one who commented is a fool, this movie was one of a kind, with the Dark Music, Jerry Goldsmith himself, would have been applauding this movie. <br /> <br /> Great Recommendations from Myself Watch or Buy This Movie. <br /> I collect horror movies and soundtracks, so listen to what I have to say, not the other idiom. <br /> There is one thing that is not my fascination, endings. all correct, including Final Conflicts, and Left Behind. But my conclusion ... There are great movies ... and they should see, before the Great Depression falls on us, and before the Democrats are also taking on the presidency. <br /> So sign up ... Jacob Eder ... A farmer, and a Mastermind.
