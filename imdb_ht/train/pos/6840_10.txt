The fact that the movie is predictable is not a problem. This movie is like a beautiful painting to be enjoyed. The museum scene is like a beautiful music video. The Sexual Sex Scene is a scene all too familiar in our adult life. but the movie would not hold any interest for me without Keith Gordon. Keith Gordon is perhaps one of the most iconic actors in our time. Almost everything I know about acting out of studying mainly his eyes. It had the most compelling figure. His character possesses the qualities I look at in a person's sensitivity, and dedication. keith gordon is gorgeous. BTW, I like it would cut off her beard now as her mouth, jawline and apple's apples were beautiful and put next to her eyes.
