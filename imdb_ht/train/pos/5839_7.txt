The Last (I Believe) In The Movies The Boys Made With Hal Roach, this is the latest comic movie that was made before going to 20th Century fox, which is so famously cheating talent. Although there are weak moments - the business and "lungs tester", for example, is a bit, ah ... blocked (but worthwhile, just to see "Dr." Jimmy Finlayson) - but over this whole flick Movie a good summary of what the boys were wearing on the screen. Richard Cramer (uncredited) appears in other L & H flicks, and is delightfully threatened here as condemned by Nick Granger. The scene where the boys have to eat their own synthetic meals ("looks good, good odor, and it probably tastes good.") It's one of my favorite moments in the workshop. Stan & Ollie will still have nice companions in the lives of millions of fans devoted.
