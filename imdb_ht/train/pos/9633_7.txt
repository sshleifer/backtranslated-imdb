In many ways DIRTY WORK is a predictable L & H short on the surface and the boys are going to sweep someone's person. Guess what happens next? This slapstick straight to its most sucessful reality. <br /> But there`s one or two similar things untypical. Ollie for example is something that's unbelievable, it`s arrogant, it's rude, and not just Stan to look at how he addresses the domestic and "HEY OU" and he takes a very toddler huffers with his catchphrase "I have nothing to say". In short, Ollie plays an intruder in a very unbelievable way and I am very much fond of seeing him to play the arogan loosely where he's still in his bunny <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < Other L & H shorts like Finlayson, Long, Busch and Housman means that when we change into the mad scientist plotline there's a little creepy atmosphere that jars and the rest of the movie <br /> Having said. that this is always a good shortcut especially down to Stan. Also look out for a scene featuring a fish. Many jokes / plots from L & H feature fish and this is another
