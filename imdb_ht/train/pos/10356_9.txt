In August 1980 the disappearance of baby Azaria Chamberlain and the trial chased her parents Lindy and Michael for the murder alleged child caused a mess through what was then a very angry nation. The media and the public have already tried and condemned the couple accused and being given to blood. What followed was a gross miscarriage of justice. Michael and Lindy Chamberlain claimed that while camping near Ayers Rock, central Australia, a dingo took ten old daughters from their tent as they prepared to eat in the barbecue area. No one believes. Lindy was charged with her baby's murder, and Michael as an accessory to the reality. The whole country was abuzz and whispers in a ceremonial murder. Chamberlain's court was about it before it started. Lindy never proved her innocence, so she found guilty. There was no evidence to convict him, but the jury was swayed by public and media pressure. How could we be like a nation sitting in judgment? From where we are, how would we possibly be supposed to know? Unless there was absolute evidence, and no reasonable reason, Chamberlains should have been accepted. Fred Schepisi's film enequivocally and all heartedly supported the argument of John Bryson's novel, that the Chamberlains were completely innocent of their plagiarism. This in fact a dingo made Baby Azaria on that fateful night at Ayers Rock. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />! It shows Australia in a rather flashy light as a person who was totally obsessed with seeing the charm paid! His scenario, co-writing with Robert Caswell, vigorously stomped their emotions and will most likely find the audience saddened and upset by the travesti of justice. Exceptional Meryl Streep provided an incredible performance as women accused of the most obnoxious of acts. It brings to life the most convincing Aussie's life that was ready to stand up to the allegations and put the world straight. Even its accent is almost, but not quite, staining on. A very good effort by the master of this trade. Sam Neill is all as good as Streep as the first loyal, but then dismissed Michael who can not understand why their world is falling apart and begins to question Christianity. She, as she was the Streep, is a show of great emotional strength that will move you deeply. All the support players are excellent, and some of Australia's finest actors and actresses play a party. Technically, the film is also brilliant, and Director of Photography Ian Baker captures this great country with beautiful (especially Rock). Editor Jill Bilcock maintains the whole movie tension and emotionally charged, while Bruce Smeaton gives a note. <br /> <br /> For all this Aussies is a must see, a shocking look at the mirror if you're, in what we as a country made in a family that just wanted justice to be served, and truth to be known. As Michael Chamberlain said: "I do not think anyone really understands what innocents mean ..... innocent people." Saturday, May 20, 1995 - Video <br /> <br /> Even on looking back against Fred Schepisi in courting travestis who came to Chamberlains, who lost baby Azaria in stone Ayres in 1980, still emotionally powerful and honestly moved . <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> The family tent is not a dingo just moments after being put down. > <br /> Among media speculation and greedy rumors Lindy was charged with the assassination of her baby, and Michael was charged as an accessory after the fact. What followed was little more than trial by media, and the Australian people determined that they were out, Lindy was found guilty and sentenced to life imprisonment and hard work, though the prosecution could present any motifs and little more than evidence evidence. / <br /> Meryl Streep is in the top shape as the woman accuses Australia's head on proving her innocence. It is really scary, and the only thing that fails him is a true Aussie blue accent, though it makes its best level to sound acoustics. You can ask why a top Australian actress was not cast in the role, but star power is probably the answer. Together with Meryl is an equally impressive Sam Neill, exceptional as the husband who sees his world fall apart from his eyes, while he feels powerless to do anything about it. An Aussie fortress borrows convincing support. <br /> Corrected from Jill Bilcock is very timely, movies from Ian Baker in the rock and other rugged places are visually brilliant and Bruce Smeaton's music is perfect for the party. Surely a must for all Austrian awareness. <br /> <br /> Sunday, June 15, 1996 - Video
