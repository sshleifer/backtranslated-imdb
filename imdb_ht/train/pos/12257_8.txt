This is a better adaptation of the book than the one with Paltrow (although I liked that one, too). It's not so much that Beckinsale is better - they are both very good - but the scenario is better. Davies is a master of adapting Austen for filming, and production value here are very good. It's not quite as brilliant as the Hollywood treatment, but it's closed, and I thought that where and the costumes actually worked better.
