By the most successful television project Jan Cleese has ever done, "Strange case" has the feeling of a first draft that has rushed to production before any review could be done. There are some funny ideas at all and even a bit clever, but the story as a whole unfortunately does not add up much. Arthur Lowe is a hoot, though, as Dr. Watson, Bionic Bits and All. "Good Lord."
