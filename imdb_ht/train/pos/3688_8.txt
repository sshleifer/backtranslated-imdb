Delightful film is directed by some of the best directors in the industry today. This film is also filing some of the great actors of our time, not only from France, but from all over the world. <br /> <br /> 14th Round: Carol (Margo Martindale), from Denver, comes to Paris to learn French and also make a sense of his life. <br /> <br /> Montmartre: There was probably not a better way to start this movie than with this Parisian romantic segment. br> >> 16th Loan: an image of Paris that we are best aware of the riots in their site. Ana (Catalina Sandino Moreno) spends more time for caring for another person (it's a nanny) than in her own. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Tour Eiffel: Do not Tell Me You Did not Like These Mimo! <br /> <br /> Tuileries: Like a treat to see Steve Buscemi as the tourist who is making high contact (a no) and a girl in the England. <br /> <br /> Parc Monceau: Nick Nolte is great. Ludivine Sagnier too. <br /> I spent 3 days in Paris in 2004 and this movie made me want to go back! <br /> View from Barcelona (another big city), in the Verdi, on March 18, 2007. <br /> <br /> 84/100 (***)
