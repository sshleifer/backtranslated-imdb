Spoilers !!! This movie is based on the concept of what? Naturally Mr Destiny will be able to answer this question. The main character goes on a bad day, like many of us, and ask this question. The state of chaos state of a butterfly in China could have an effect on someone over here from a chain reaction. The movie focus is based on an event during a baseball game. This event lies in the Destiny motion; Just like Ashton's "Butterfly effect" except Mr. Destiny uses comedy drama. The results make a cool, original movie movie. If one's philosophical tune with the "butterfly effect" one will likely enjoy Mr. Destiny. I give it a 7 out of 10. Amazingly I saw the first half of this film 3 times, and finally watch the finish on TBS.
