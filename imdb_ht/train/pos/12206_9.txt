In all of the movie noir in the 1940s and 1950s, this was classified as one of the weird, and most fun to watch. I say that due to the four main actors: Orson Welles, Rita Hayworth, Everett Sloane and Glenn Anders. <br /> <br /> The first names are familiar to everyone but it was the last two who made this movie so entertaining at me, especially Anders. His character, "George Grisby," is one of the weird people I've ever seen on film. His voice, and some of the things he said, must be heard to be believing. Slaone is not far behind in the "strange" category. Hayworth is not as glamorous and short, blonde hair but still Hayworth, which means a lot of ogle if you are a guy. Welles' is as fascinating as always. One tip: if you have the DVD, turn on English subtitles. His character in this movie is an Irishman and you need the subtitles to understand everything he says. <br /> <br /> Welles also direct the movie which means you have great camera angles and wonderful facials. You also have a unique look, visually, and a shootout in a house of mirrors. Great stuff! As rare as this movie is, I still think carnival buffalo-like atmosphere at the near-end suit was too much and was taken into the gravity of the scene. Otherwise, there is no complaint. <br /> <br /> This is great entertainment, which is the name of the game.
