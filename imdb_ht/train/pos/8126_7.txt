I must admit a weak disappointment to this movie; I've read so much about how spectacular it was, again the real futuristic sequences, the Age of Science, taking a lot of money in the movie. Together they are excellent when we get them, and there are some thrilling images, but that's the final sequel lacking too much to consider other ... <br /> <br /> The many best drama drums are in the mid- section, and then it plays as melodrama, arising from the 'concept of high' science-fiction nature of it all, with gaiety dialogue inefficiencies. There are many human lives in this part though, with Ralph Richardson's great glorious over-the-top surf as the tiny dictator, the "Boss" of the Everytown. I liked Richardson's styling and delivery of his lines, postponing the presence and ideas of Raymond Massey's eloquence, trustworthy visitors. This boss is a posture, convincingly deluded face, able to achieve the small-fry nature of his government ... It's not a big role, yet Richardson does much to it. <br /> <br /> Everytown itself is presumably meant to be England, or at least a British English representative representative in England. Interestingly avoided the complete on any religious side of these things; 'Things come' seems to revolve around a conflict between war barbarism and a trust in science that seems to have little ultimate goal, but just go over and over. An attempt to charge has increased some arguments and tensions in the last section, regarding more personal life, yet one leaves quite satisfying. The film has not received much interest in subtle complexity; It goes for barnstorming and unsubtle spectacle, tide morality, every time. And, of course, note the final hedged-bet: Raymond Massey elevates lyric about how things are uncertain! <br /> <br /> Regarding the question of the movie being a prediction: I must say it's not in all the bad ways, considering that one obviously allows that it is impossible to find the details of life something like right . Grand concepts have something for them; a war in 1940, well that was perhaps predictable ... lasting almost 30 years, mind! A nuclear bomb - the "super gun" or some such contractor - in 2036 ... A socialist technocrat "we do not believe in the independent nation state" -type government, in Britain, after 1970 ... Hmmm, unfortunately nowhere also close to one, chap! ;-) There is no real policy to go through here which is a shame; All of these surfaces are a very commendable anti-war sentiment. Generally, it is assumed that dictatorships - whether boneheaded-luddite-fascist, as under the Boss, or all-the-hands-to-pump-social social - will * be the deal *, and these implications are not hacked ... While we must remember that in 1936, there was no knowledge of all how Nazism and Communism would turn out - or even how they turned out - the lack of consideration seems sweet around the familiar subject Vision of the film makers on other matters. <br /> <br /> Many of the earliest things should - and could - were cut in my opinion; Only brief things from '1940' would be needed, but this segment tends to be rather marvelous, and it is the age before we reach the Richardson-Massey parties. I would like to see more with Margareta Scott; who just is an uncertain trifle, cutting off a flattening-Mediterranean eyeless face to negligible goals. The character does not explore, or frankly explains or exploits, except for one scene that I will not spoil, and its relationship with the Boss is not explored; but then this was the 1930s, and there was such something as widespread institutional tender then. Edward Chapman is fun lustr in his role; more so in the first as a hapless Chapel, pray for war, only to be sharply put down to another Massey character. Massey herself helps many things, plays her part with a mixture of constraints and gusto gusto, contrasting well with a hugely dissolved cast, for Richardson, and Scott and Chapman, a little bit. <br /> I would say that "Things Come" is undoubtedly a very extraordinary film made in Britain in 1936; one of some serious British science fiction films to date, indeed! Put it (piece) design and equipment in resources are debated, wonderful. <br /> But the script is finally over-reliable and, at times, all over the place. The direction that tends to make a flatness, though it does set up a scenic gear or two on occasion. The cinematographer and Mr Richardson really do salvage things however; thus creating an awkward sense of wonder in technology, and an engaging, lepers performance that always beguiles. Such a shame has so little substance or real chemical conception of the whole thing; Powell and Pressburger would be the perfect directors to take on such a task like this - without peers among British directors as visual visuals, incredibly large in character and dealers in dialogue at first rate. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Wells' words, as that movie language, again and nothing like the amazing force of it.
