Who can watch a movie, watch Lucy Liu and not be happy. This girl is amazingly beautiful & a talented actress. This is a tough combination to get now a day. With Jeremy Northam. I heard her name many times, but I never really saw her. My advice to Hollywood is: "use it more". <br /> Now on the movie: I watch it in one of my graveyard changes. I do not recommend anyone. It's a bit complicated & mysterious. I still can not believe I did not see the coming end. I will not say the causes that will spoil the movie hole. although it says this is enough acceptance. <br /> Now, I'm supposed to throw my vote on this movie. I love the mysterious black story, the actors have done a great job and I love the director (natali) work in the past. There is not a big audience for this kind of thing, this is also very risky. Do you know what, I just will give this job a 8th cause everyone should see this. Then again, point 1 point points still have space for improvement.
