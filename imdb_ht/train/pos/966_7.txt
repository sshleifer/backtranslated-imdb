2005 Toronto Film Festival Report It is official; Takashi Miike is whacked. The annual midnight screening of the new "Takashi Miike" movie, "The Great Spook War" or "The Great Yokai War" or "Yokoi daisenso". Call it what you will be this is a fan ride. <br /> <br /> Colin Geddes, the fearless programmer stated this was the original movie adapted for children in Japan. Reflect on "Lord of the Rings" or "Neverending Story" for Japan. After the screening I can understand where they were gone, but this damn is "Takashi Miike" after all. He directed the film '01 "Ichi Killer", when he screened in the bark festival bags being handed out from the screening. And no, that was not just a marketing plot. Summary of Scheme: A young boy who has a troubled home life becomes "chosen," and he breaks down in the midst of a great war of spirit, where he meets a friendly group of friends who become his comrades on his journey. This is not really for kids, quite not 'too' teens. Certainly they are getting shitless fright and some of these (same friendly people) spirits on display. This is unlike anything I've seen in the movie movie before. A fantasy naturally, some very funny things (but black). You will not be bored to be guaranteed. Does this ever hit North America? Doubtful <br /> <br /> My Rating = B
