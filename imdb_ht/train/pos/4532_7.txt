This was Keaton's first feature and in reality three shorts, set in different periods (Age Stone, Roman Age, Modern Width) on the eternal triangle of romance. The stories are parallel to each other as in the INTOLERANCE Griffith, which was intended to satirize. The forces of jokes and gags almost all count on anachronism, bringing modern business days into ancient settings. <br /> <br /> **** WARNING - SPOILERS FAVORITES FOR ELABORATE POZ BEST ****** <br /> <br /> Here are the classic moments: <br /> Use a torture as a wee-gee board (Stone Age); A wrist watch with a sun dial (Roman Age); A tread with a spare wheel (Roman Age); Use a helmet as a rubber lock (Roman Age); Early golf and rock clubs (Stone Age); Dictating a will have been carved into a stone (Stone Age); Change weather forecasts (Roman Age); Race through snow-busters using skiing and huski with a spare dog in boots chariot (Roman Age). The above are all cast-away gags that keep you chuckling. There are also unforgettable moments as well: <br /> Buster takes out cut matching equipment girl put on make-up; The fantastic double takes when a buster inebriated gazes in his plate to discover a crab stamped up on it (in one second he jumped standing on his seat in a sitting position and jumping again into the arms of the waiter - one of the funniest the moment I've ever seen). And that lion - the manicure-justice is brilliant. There is also a bit of de-color in racism when four African American-Borrowers are abandoning their mistresses for a game of crap Roman. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />. The metro feature is scored with piano and flute and heavy lending from Grieg. Many fun and full of laughs.
