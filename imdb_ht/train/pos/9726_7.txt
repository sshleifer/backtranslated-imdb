Well it was a nice surprise after all. His trailer did not predict a good movie at all, it was even a bit misleading. Especially part of Jeff Bridges was a positive, well-written, sardonic and funny surprise. Less real though, I do not think that a guy who got the place he received would show the signs of the irreversibility towards everything that his current company stands for. One does not become a top trial just doubt it all suddenly again. The movie film, during the Dolce Vita show, was too real, clich√© and quite disappointing. And of course a guy like Pegg's character would not have been past his first week in a New York blitz magazine like this. I hope one day I will see a decent role writing for Megan Fox, here she watched a poor actress playing a bimbo. And by the way I do not see why it is the "sex symbol" of the year, I see hot girls on almost every cover in every magazine.
