This filmed presentation of the "Rime of Ancient Mariner" is a most beautiful and interesting proposal in Coleridge's haunted poem. Kim's hit, combined with a collection of centuries of effort to illustrate the epic poem in 1798 by the world famous artists, and the superb superstition Michael Redgrave, are very well worth the time to see this excellent visual work. /> At large age, such as work as this is a vital tool for encouraging young students, as well as adults, to explore and learn the value of great poetry. For the best of my knowledge, this kind of work is true; which is regret. As a student of world literature and as a senior college teacher and academic adviser, I feel that the greatest epic poem as the Coleridge's "Rime of Ancient Mariner" would be so "translated." Although not a movie critic, but as a hunger reader of classical literature, I am pleased to recommend this fine production without any reservations as well.
