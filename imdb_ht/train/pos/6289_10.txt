This film took a lot of wood. He was not criticized when he came out and was blaming for Nicolas Cage's career to eradicate. The thing I do not think people get is that it does not mean to be an epic, Oscar contender in a movie, it's just some brilliant "Bruck-buster" action at its best. Fast cars, quick corrections and a great band - it does exactly what it says about the tin. Also, for anyone who loves his car a better treat. It has everything: Ferraris, Mercs, a Hummer and do not forget Eleanor! I think you should be hard pressed to get a better action movie, and personally, a better movie of all !! Then again maybe that's just me!
