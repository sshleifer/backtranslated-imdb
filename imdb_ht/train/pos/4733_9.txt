Again Jet He brings his charisma presence to the film screen in the Black Mask movie. In this film she plays Tsui, a escapee of a super soldier program that seeks to regain humanity that the program has taken away from her. To do this Tsui decided to become a librarian to live a normal and peaceful life, but the fate demanded that he clean up his past problem before he could continue to seek peace. The other members of the super soldier programs have escaped at the same time as Tsui, but they want to get even with the world rather than finding inner peace. So, Tsui gets the only thing that can prevent former ex-colleagues from sharing information that would cost many innocent lives. This movie screams on the screen at a frantic speed and never allows its audience to go. The martial arts is amazing, but because it uses its wires can not be appreciated as much as it deserves by American audiences. If you love action movies with an interesting story and good performance requests to act because they deal with psychological as well as physical controversy, then Black Mask is for you. I'm glad to see that some of Jet Jet movies are finally getting the main streams in the United States and look forward to seeing how these release will be required (things like doubles and tape) will affect the movie. This is one of his best films, going out and seeing it on May 14 when it is released in America.
