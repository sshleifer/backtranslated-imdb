I was really impressed with this movie. Writing this was fantastic, and the characters were all rich, and simple. It's very easy to get emotionally attached to all of them. The creators of this movie really hit the right nail on the head when it comes to creating real-life characters, and receives the viewer to seep right into their world. Further, the music is terrific. They hired some independent to score, and some of the band, and performed a fantastic job in the movie. If you have a chance to catch this movie in a small theater or in a movie festival (like I did), I highly recommend that you go see it. Also, on a personal note, Paget Brewster is beautiful in this movie. That's enough reason to go check it out.
