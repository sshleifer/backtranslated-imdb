a bit slow and boring, the story of an old man and his wife living a Delapide building and interacting with a fixed cast of characters such as the mailman, the brothers sitting on the porch, the rich cigar smoker . The photography of the river is beautiful, as is the interior decoration period. If you love decorating in Banana Republic store, this is a must.
