Did you see and love Greg Lombardo's most recent films of "Knots" (he co-wrote and directed that feature as well), I decided to check out his earlier work, and this movie was well worth the effort and location . Macbeth in Manhattan is a language of cheek, excellent take on the favorite Shakespeare, updated and moved to NYC. I was impressed by the hidden wit and intelligence of the script and was wowed in the path to the scenario in the production of films in the storyline mirrors of the play itself - and very clever at that. The trials and temptations of life in Manhattan are very parallel to playing Shakespeare, and Central Park has rarely been set to better use than the Woods around Castle Macbeth. Mr. Lombardo obviously has a place in his heart for New York and New York stories (Knots is a comic and warm sex comedy of six New Yorkers thirty-something set primarily in a good Brooklyn neighborhood, with the Manhattan office and a downtown downstairs in for good measure) and has spent considerable time around playing in Shakespeare. The film is well-paced and the story reflects a profound understanding of the essential drama of the core of Macbeth. He reminds me of Al Pacino in "Looking for Richard" - another wonderful Shakespeare "play in a movie." I highly recommend checking Macbeth in Manhattan.
