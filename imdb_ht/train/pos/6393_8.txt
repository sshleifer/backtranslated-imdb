This is a must see for independent movie fans, but it also keeps up well against mainstream movies. I think we have the makings of the next Woody Allen or <br /> <br /> Trentin Tarrentino here. The budget is painfully low. There are no special effects, and they have used ambient light (shot in digital video.) But this tram film is caught by you and never lets go. Simply is a bit scarce, but the actors and directors pull it off with complete realism. It has humor, it has intrigue, and it has pathos, and it all works together. <br /> No point in describing the details. If you want to see an independent <br /> <br />, a virtual lesson in how to make a low budget flash that really works, see this one. <br /> <br /> -Oh yeah, it's also really fun. <br /> <br />
