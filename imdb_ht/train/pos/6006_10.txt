When I saw it as a child, he answered all my questions and looked for all the fears or misconceptions that I had. It's easy to watch because it is animated, making it desperate. It does not have any moral bias or "preachy" aspect, so nobody should have any objection to it. It is a beautiful movie that simply gives the realities of rule in a reassuring, "way-of-fact" way. I hope to show it to my daughter.
