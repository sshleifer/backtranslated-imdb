I saw first "Breaking Glass" in 1980, and thought it would be one of the "Classics Movie". This film is a great look at the music industry and a great cast of performers. This is one movie that should be in the collection of everyone and any one who wants to get into the music industry. I can not wait for it to be available on DVD.
