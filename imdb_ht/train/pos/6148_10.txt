In Love Memory of DAVID TOMLINSON (1917-2000) <br /> When I watched this movie for the first time I was 4 years old and I was captivated by this story of Witches in the 2nd World War. The scene, which impressed me the most, was the battle between the Nazi soldiers and the medieval army. It was outstanding to see this army without a short walk to fight the amazing singing songs. This film is fantastic, from the trip to Portobello Road (which has become my most fantastic place in London) on the Naboomboo trip. Angela Lansbury and David Tomlinson are really a fantastic couple. She is still great, she looks like the good aunt of a family with David and her amazing face is her great co-protagonist. we will miss it very much.
