Credit Opening: great. Music: just right for this movie. Cinematography: great impact effect. <br /> <br /> Harrowing excitement in a sort of train-waves in style. This is how out of control some lives can become. "Wonderland" painted wild-drought (and its consequences) is not such an aberration, but shows how it really happens in our society. It's better than representing another wildlife group - Manson's - because all Manson's films, books etc. focus so much on Crazy Manson's mind rather than the overall picture of the cheap and randomness fame that is so ubiquitous nowadays . <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> If you want to see some of the best "Methods-Acting" films, watch Kilmer in this movie. It shows how the "Method" can be fixed in the right role. <br /> <br /> The creators here succeed in raising "out-of-control" at the level of an art form, not only for the sake of giving us good emotions.
