Why people bitch on this movie and not about terrible movies like the godfather. Titanic is the greatest film of the 21st century. With great acting, directing, effect, music and generally everything. This film is still thrown by everyone because one day some people said they did not like it any more so most of the world decided to agree. There is nothing wrong with this movie. All I can say is that this film, not only being the most heavily filmed Oscar film evermore, most money ever ever made and sadly one of the most underrated movies I was never see. Apart from that it is truly the best movie ever. The only movies that come close were like all the Star Wars and the Lord of the ring trilogy or anything by the master of the Hitchcock or Spielberg or Tim Burton. These are all good movies and directors but do not match up to James Cameron's TITANIC chief.
