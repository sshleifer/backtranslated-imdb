The children, ages 7 to 14, had such a great kick from this film that we gave a copy of all the other kids to our birthday list this year. They all love it! Kids from 2 to 7 look at it repeatedly and often, and we get a kick from watching it with them. <br /> It's rare that a movie is fun for kids, and it offers street laughs, too. Most enjoy it more than the first. <br /> <br /> Top-quality production with an excellent cast, led by Christopher Showerman as a superior George - Athletic, Energetic, and Completely credible, with an adorable innocence and a particular narrative of taking a leg Wooden in the face - Well supported by the inimitable Christina cypresses as the evil mother-in-law, Thomas Haden Church as rival to hate evil, and everyone else. This is fun.
