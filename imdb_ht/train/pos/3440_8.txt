Loving Rosario Dawson, thinks he is one of the finest actresses of the modern era. <br /> <br /> Descent seems to be more autonomous than anything else. It's consistent in all things in the movie. The dialogue is flat, the characters seemingly bland intentionally with one side. The only consistency is the representation of autonomous autonomy of the characters and travel of Rosario from autonomous own loss of autonomy and back again. <br /> <br /> Climb this as a classic rape is not appropriate, and that's probably why so many people do not enjoy the movie. The 'audition' standard audience would not particularly like this movie, and maybe that's the point? The film asks more questions than answers, and confronting its target audience, if they like it or not. There is a compelling relationship between the characters and the target audience and while the movie does not calm the audience through the face and self-right audience it engages the viewer for what may or may not be, all the wrong reasons. > <br /> Descent is a good movie that IMHO is serious under-rated.
