Very few movies have impact on the American urban culture urban cowboy way. Thank God he was temporary. But UC is almost in a class itself as one of those flicks when you flip the channel at 3:00 am or just can not take your eyes off .... my three heads are Animal House and Tall Tall BTW but that's around the point. I remember the urban cowboy hit theaters and overnite had their honkytonks open on every corner, boys were sporting hats cowboy and penny penny, and if you do not know how in your two steps you were considered a social somb! Personally I think it's a great movie. Travolta really surprised me on the heels of SatNiteFever. Who would be a thunk. It's actually credible too. The soundtrack is awesome. Too Charlene Tilton, on television Dallas fame lost Johnny Lee's career that guy was just terrific. Stealer's show here is Scott Glenn as the former graphic designer combines cowboy. And I did not get anything against greaser old cowboys semi-being one myself, but I've always been using what I feel to be the greatest power line of all time .... "package- The S * # t! "Sort in as Clint's" Make My Day. " And watching her Sissy slap around is the closest thing I'll see in my crap Julia Roberts so ..... Like I said, nice. 9/10
