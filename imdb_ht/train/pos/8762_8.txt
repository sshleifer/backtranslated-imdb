"What were you doing?" is a question that will stick to yourself for weeks after watching Brokedown's emotional palace. You will also be asked if Alice (Danes) told the truth or not - a problem that leaves unresolved, and that's why. This film is particularly well-acting and beautiful shot. Although it is slow at times, its speed is reflective in the story line - but a lot of the movie will have you on the edge of your seat; want to know what happens next. The finish will let you imagine yourself in the shoes of the lead characters, which is brilliantly played by Kate Beckinsale and Claire Danes. Bill Pullman's performance is laudable, too.
