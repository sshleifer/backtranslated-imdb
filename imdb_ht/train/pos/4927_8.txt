Just a comment on New Orleans accent ... <br /> <br /> An earlier review noted the following: "This movie, could be shot in New York, or another big Northern city because it introduce us to characters that speak more like "broklynese" than maybe a South accent one would hear from that part of the country. "There was also another comment on the lines from an English Assessor. Many people in New Orleans do, in fact, sound "broklynese". I never found why. (He mentions "A Confederacy of Dunces" by John Kennedy Toole.) I still appreciate films that take place in New Orleans including this detail, as this one has done. Too often it's just the Hollywood version of the South American accent.
