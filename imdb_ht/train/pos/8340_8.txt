This is a really fun, breezy, romantic comedy comedy. You can not go wrong with the beautiful Meg Ryik Perikite combined with Albert Einstein's genius. Normally, I'm not a fan of completely crafted fictional stories about current people, now dead and can not defend themselves, but I think that former Einstein himself would have gotten a chuckle out of this one. It was in 1950 ... Princeton, New Jersey in the spring. The story revolves around a beautiful, young, widespread brave mathematician, Catherine (Meg Ryan), who all along marries a butcher silly, a behavioral researcher named James, simply because he has the brain he's looking for in the dad in her future children. However, he likes at first sight when his car breaks and meets a car mechanic called Ed (Tim Robbins). As he does not think Ed is smart enough, his uncle, none other than Albert Einstein, playing match match, helping in his initiative by three mischievous constables, all theoretical physicists. Uncle Albert must make Ed appear appropriately smart, so concocts a charade that shows him as a physicist ... naturally with entertainment outcomes. Walter Matthieu is himself his usual hilarious, and pulls on the character of Einstein quite effectively. With his three professional friends, Kurt, Nathan, and Boris, a lot of laughs arise. The real Einstein had a genuine man's side and this movie just took it one (outrageous) step further. If you stop any logic, you can almost imagine this funny story! <br /> It could not rock science (despite its main character) but it is a beautiful movie, refreshing film. One of the best in the genre romance genre.
