Jack Frost is really a cool movie. I mean .... its funny. It's violent. and very enjoyable. Most people say it is B Rated, but that might not be far from the truth. It has great special effects and good acting. The only strange thing is of course, the killer snowman. I think that this movie was actually one of the best films in the late-nineties. Most films these days lack the criteria for a Master Bar Master Master. That is, Make the original and give the viewer what they do not expect. Jack Frost is very cool. 10 from 10. Classes: A +. Ed Also recommends Sam Sammy from fans of Jack Frost.
