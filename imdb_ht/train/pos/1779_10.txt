I like this movie! 10 out of 10 hands down! It is that damn good! I'm not much of a fan of movies but I must tell you this one open my eyes. Astounding color and energy fast. I was fortunate to catch this in a screening while Zoinks! Festival Film in Boston, and the story really enveloped me from the start. He had a lot of adult and character terms and when he finished I wanted more. I hope they do an end. That would be fun. My only problem with it is the performance of Melissa Connor as Anya. UGH! It SUCKS! I saw a block of wood pulling out a better performance. I'm not the director thought when he threw it. But if you ignore it you can not help but give this movie a tremendous !!!
