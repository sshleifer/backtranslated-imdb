I came across Insomniac's nightmare while looking for offbeat independent movie, and happy to say that it does not disappoint. This crazy half hour ride was me asking all the way off, and the finish was excellent - one of the NOOOOO moments that really stayed with you. I showed it to a number of people and everyone seemed to agree but down. Little girl's ghost was very talented and I think her performance stole the show. He cracked the heck out of me, I can say that much. Nanavati has done a great job putting this briefly together. All the pieces just fall into place and you can say that it is a great writer from what he did with this script. So well written. It is undoubtedly the most part of the movie. The direction was great and the act was enjoyable, but the most important factor here is the strength of the scenario. Good job of this girl, I can not wait to see more!
