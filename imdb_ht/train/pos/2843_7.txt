If not in the mood for more than an hour long film than this movie can give you some variations. What I like is the continuous surprises. It's not just once you want one or more of the short films in 'New York I Love You' to continue. Yeah, some of the short films make you curious, some of them very short, some of them again, some of them have it end up being finished, some of them do not. <br /> Most of the story presents sad side of the capital. It shows many different backgrounds of nationality. Many of it, making it feel the same way I once went to a foreign capital for a year where many people came from different countries. This movie explores many kinds of things you might know, but for all the characters it's something new. Maybe some of us have traveled abroad independently for a year or two just to feel something new, meet new people; Feeling sad, sad, but the kind of sad you are looking for because it's just that bored you were in your own home. You might want to revive it again, do not watch this.
