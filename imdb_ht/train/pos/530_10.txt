The great talent Michael Powell and Emeric Pressberger are apparently in the wonders of "A Matter of Life and Death". It was part of the recent tribute to Mr. Powell who was playing in Walter Walter in New York. This film, in particular, shows us one of the best British films from this, or any other era. <br /> <br /> "A Matter of Life and Death" has a brilliant movie by Jack Cardiff, a man who knows how to work wonderful with a camera. Particularly impressive is the contrast from the monochromatic tones to the scenes they play in the sky, and those who are colored when the action comes back to earth. This was quite a coup, and well ahead of its times. Dark and white sequences involving long stairs where Peter and the conductor are discussing be one of the most amazing things on any movie. Many say in this forum on the film, so our comments will be about the great acting Powell and Pressberger was out of great, distinguished cast, who answered intensely at the directors' . friends die as a result of it. This film marks the one mentioned in Mr Niven's career. She was an excellent movie actor as she showed us in this movie. Kim Hunter is amazingly good June, the woman who spoke to Peter as his plane fell from the sky. As fate would have it, Peter and John fell in love at first sight. <br /> <br /> Some of the best British movie actors favors this film and their presence. Robert Coote is Bob, the man who admitted to heaven, but it is surprising his friend Peter never made the trip with him. An excellent star turned by Marius Goring, who as the conductor 71 steals the movie. Mr. Goring, who worked with directors, is one of the best things in the movie. Also, Roger Livesey, as Dr. Frank Reeves, has one of the best appearances in his career, as well as Raymond Massey, who sees it as Abraham Farlan. <br /> "A Matter of Life and Death" is a timeless movie that will always be seen with gratitude toward its creators.
