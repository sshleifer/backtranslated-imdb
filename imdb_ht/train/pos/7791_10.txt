Another of these films you hear about from friends (... or read about IMDb). Not much fake scores in this one. I was able to see just about everything here actually passing through a young girl who escaped from a dead-dying city in Tennessee Florida, and all its assets to the world of an old bat-up car. The heroine, Ruby, does some fake start, but learns from them. I found myself asking why, why did not lean a bit more on Mike's shoulder, but ... he's right, as it turns out. <br /> Just a fine movie. The only thing I do not like about it, I think, is the title.
