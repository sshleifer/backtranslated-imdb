Offbeat, slow-paced, erotic erotic entertainment and many graphic and blasphemous scenes that will undoubtedly lead some viewers. However, it will be difficult even to appreciate the many imaginative sequences of this movie there, or to ignore the first-rate performance of the crab. Verhoeven holds an intriguing ambivalence throughout the movie, playing with the meaning of the hero's vision of the omens. Unfortunately, in the last 5 minutes everything gets into a blur, and the unsatisfying end is certainly not as good as the rest of the movie. (***)
