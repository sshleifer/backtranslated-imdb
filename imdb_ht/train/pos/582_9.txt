As a habit I still love it in the 'hatred' review of any given movie. especially one that I want to comment on. and not so much a counterpoint point counterpoint; I just love to see what people are saying about the flipside. <br /> But I want to address one thing. Many who hated it called it, to recall, 'beautiful, but deep,' some even went so far as to say that the normal norm again inability to help his brother was a lofty plot, at best. <br /> <br /> <br/> I would like to agree. <br /> As a fee to a sibling with a similar dysfunction, I may report. Every day, you see them abuse themselves, knowing only that their current path will inevitably lead them to self-destruction. and it's not about the specifics of what they did when; how or why paul decided to gamble and associate with doubts; it's really more like they're tuned. On one hand, they are true geniuses, and on the other, painfully self-destructive (it's a lot like people like hards hardes ?? the same forces that drive are the same forces that tear apart) and all during You see this, you know this, and what's worse, you realize you can not do something damn on it. <br /> <br /> for norman maclean, a river running across it was probably a way to find an answer why the tragedy happened, and was blaming. In the end, there is not one, and often, no why. but it takes a great deal of sadness to really come to this realization. Sometimes it takes a life. and sometimes it never comes across.
