Bromwell High is nothing short of brilliant. Experts scripts and perfectly delivers, this searing parody of a student and teacher at a South London Public Schools leaves you literally rolling and laughing. It's vulgar, provocative, witty and sharp. Characters are a cross section of the superbly caricatured section of British society (or to be more precise, in any society). After the escape of Keisha, Latrina and Natella, our three "protagonists" want a better theme, the show does not shy away from parodying each imaginable topic. Policy correctness jumps out the window of every episode. If you enjoy showing that they are not afraid of keen fun at each imaginable taboo subject, then Bromwell High will not disappoint!
