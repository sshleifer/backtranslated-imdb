I do not think I'll ever understand the hatred for Renny Harlin. 'Hard 2' was cool, and it gave Cliffhanger in the world, one of the most awesome movies ever. That's right, you've been pressing Cliffhanger's rule, and we all know it. Sly plays Gabe Walker, a former relief climber who 'just visited' his old town when asked to help a former friend, Hal Tucker (Michael Rooker), to help in a rescue a mountain peak. Walker has obviously turned into a convenient time, because people are trapped actually a sophisticated team of robbers led by Eric Qualen (John Lithgow). Quality & Co. has lost a lot of money being stolen from the US government somewhere in the Rocky Mountains and they really want it back ... <br /> <br /> Essentially, 'Cliffhanger' is another script 'Dead Hard '. Just trading at the boundaries of Nakatomi Plaza mountain ranges are open in the Rocky Mountains, complete with scenes created to point out the weaknesses of our heroes and keep him mortal. Of course, that set up is totally torn shredded fast enough, as Stallone's character avoids quite a large number of bullets and ease, and the first face slams of several rock faces with no high-apparent effects. After all, is not that movie action all about? <br /> <br /> 'Cliffhanger' is one of the most exciting movie films around. A showcase of great scenes and stunts. One of the early exhibitions is one of the best exhibits I've ever seen in a movie, and while the rest of the movie does not get any better than it did at the start, it holds awesomeness its actions. Super Lithgow's lead lead, and a bad dude. Well, perhaps one of the lead-free lead ever. Cliffhanger is easily one of Stallone's best efforts, definitely the efforts of Renny Harlin, and a very exciting action movie - 9/10
