I know that there are some purists out there that poo poo anything that does not exactly like the original, however sometimes turning-compromises can stand on their own base. I love the new chef chef because it is similar to the Japanese version, but at the same time welcomes American minds. I love Alton Brown as a commentator, because he explains things with Flair. The iron chefs themselves are very interesting. I know the original were probably the best chefs on the planet at the time, but Bobby Flay is the only American chef Iron beat. Mario Batali seems to have fun at most when cooking, commenting and being flashy while creating. I watched the series and find all the players working together well. Judges are not always the best choices, however. There are some exceptions, such as the lawyer turning foodie, but most of the judges are skeptical of being able to handle what has been served. I like to look hustle to chef and the challenges are surprising. The food at the end always looks amazing and sometimes it inspires me to the kitchen. Perhaps everyone can ask, really want to eat what has been served. The only thing I would really change on the series is wondering how the show lightened up a little. Sometimes the mood gets a bit too tense, and that's not always fun to look when you wait more entertainment. I liked the version with William Shatner (Iron Chef USA) because it was so over-the-top as the original, but I can say it was a very expensive proposal. I wish he stayed with this version and was the host - between Bill Shatner and Alton Brown, who would have me grinning for an hour. As long as you do not expect the original Japanese version and can accept this series on its own basis, you can find it to be an enjoyable hour.
