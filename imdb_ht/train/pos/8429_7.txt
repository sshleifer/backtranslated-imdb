An absorbed (although repetitive and rather pedagogical) analysis of exploitation and despair in a situation where there is no way forward or up, where attempts to make yourself feel better does not violate and put down anyone below to be the only option. But even here, in this desert desert of dreams and no future, which does not work, and reaches out of something or someone in comfort and sharing with, a simple action of charity, gives some reward, even if it just does present the Gendel√® does not revive the memories of the past. Although there is little current on screen violence, this is a harsh and brutal film about the small mindset of asthma (politically and personally) that does not make for easy entertainment. Clearly based on a play, with a little cast, a wider relationship to all social and political environment might have helped the movie to reach a wider audience.
