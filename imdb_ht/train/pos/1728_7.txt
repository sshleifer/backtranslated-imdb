The wooden horse was one of the first "great" stories to escape from the Second World War, telling the true story of Eric Williams and others escaping from Stalag-Lufft III in October of 1943. I really like this movie but had not read about VHS from Amazon in England and get it transferred from PAL format to the U.S. I read the book when I was in the school hight, after seeing a portion of the movie The early 60's on the TV drama drama of Peter and John trying to escape from Germany during the war is much more realistic than the track of the survivors described in the Great Escape. This film is a lost treasure, which should make more available to American audiences.
