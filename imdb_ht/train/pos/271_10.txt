It's all about Mitzi. I liked it at that. And he did not look fantastic ?! I like the movie poker movie poker ever since Sunday. This is like one of those nailbiters where they still go to commercials in the most annoying times. Richard's character was completely creepy. I was dating like that. Well, not exactly like that lol. I wish Zack had never died. It was a cutie and very easy on the eyes. I like these stories of stalker stalkers. It always makes me up and sure my door is closed. My husband does not usually like these kind of movies but actually sat down in everything with me and actually liked it. I can not wait to see what Mitzi does next!
