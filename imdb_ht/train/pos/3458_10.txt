Casting Jack Cassidy as Ken Frankin was beautifully shining. Cassidy's personification of arrogance, confidence, charm and wit - all with a condescension, evil smirk little on his face. In my opinion, Jack Cassidy is by far the best murderer (he has appeared three times) in the Columbo series. This particular (and first) performance, is my favorite Columbo episode ever - but down. A cool faced Steven Spielberg made amazing camera works (yes, there was a couple of camera shadows on the actors at times) capturing the nuances and complaining of different and intriguing angles between Columbo and Franklin. Also, the scenery and tightness of the Big Bear Lake vaccine, CA (Franklin's cabin house) was very impressive. <br /> If you have not yet seen this episode, then you must read in your mind to do so - it is a true masterpiece. Jack Cassidy was a very talented and singer actor. Her charisma personality was very infectious. His death in 1976, at age 49 was very sad and indeed very tragic - he surely had his best year before him. Resting in peace Jack, you will live forever for your great work.
