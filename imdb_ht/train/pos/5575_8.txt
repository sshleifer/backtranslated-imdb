I did not expect much of this, but I must admit I was rolling on the ground laughing a few times during this movie. If you do not grossely run in the first ten minutes, this might be a movie for you. That's right if you're kind of looking at Amanda Peet muddle cards for an hour and a half. It certainly is not an important task in comedy, but given the indy budget-budget Indy is mastery. At the level playing field for comparison, imagine all the studio and budget films are redirected by a factor of 100 or so and see what you get! Kudos Peter Cohen and his network to see this in. I look forward to his next effort.
