I did not see this movie since the late 80's and decided to pick up the VHS version of it. The draw is very slow, and the actors are almost alike robots in this flick of reproach. Music, hip hop / freestyle artists and the breakdancing scenes are what makes this movie special. The Breakdancing is actually the best of this movie than in Breakin ', but I must say that Breakin' 1 & 2 "brings the energy & excitement of the screen a lot better. It's a movie I'll keep in my library, but not a movie that I can watch over & over again, just once in a blue moon.
