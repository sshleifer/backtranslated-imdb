Not only is this fun movie, and excellent acting comedy, but also interesting politically. It was born at the end of the Soviet Union, but it made fun of the soviet mentality in and through. The story is set during the early days of the Soviet Union, and it raises the rationale behind the revolution both in terms of cultural and practice. Of course, by late 80s and early 90s, strict scrutiny in Soviet societies are already relaxed, but the ideology and mentality is still alive and well and ready for some well-deserved deconstruction. Fortunately, all this deep philosophical is wrapped in a funny and fun pack! <br /> <br /> Jur
