This pleasant minor noir boasts a top throw, with many memorable performances. The great distraction is the lack of respect for authentic accents. Spanish characters in the movie are played by a Frenchman (Boyer), a Belgian (Franconia), a Greek (Paxinou) and a Hungarian (Lorre)! And head all over Bacall is supposed to be an English aristocrat! Despite these absurdities, performance is all very good - especially those in Paxinou and Lorre. But the scene of Boyer, Paxinou and Lorre meet, and speak of wildly different accents, it's a real real! And I guess, see how they were alone, that they should actually have spoken in Spanish anyway! It looks very strange that Warner's fees were not able to find any Spanish speaking actress in Los Angeles! Of course, Hollywood has often had an "any old accent will do" politics - my favorite is Greta Garbo (Swedish) as Mata Hari (Dutch), who fell in love with a Russian soldier played by a Mexican (Ramon Novarro ). Perhaps they should have Novarro for "Confidential Agent" - it would be great in the role of Boyer or at least Francen (which would have saved a lot on the dark make-up budget).
