I really have to agree with guy-yardley-reis who would have to watch some absolutely stunning Scottish scenery (some of the best shot ever in Skye) and found a movie There is a hard start coming together a really interim whole. <br /> This is not a big budget movie. Instead it is a movie that has a strong community feel. <br /> I can not say how many 'movie films' make me - push out the same stuff again and again. Seachd does not seem to be so at all. It really seems to be trying to offer something more real and certainly more Gaelic than any recent Scottish film. <br /> OK, so the act is not in the style of a blockbuster. That's because the actors are really real people. I actually thought that the key roles of the boy and his grandfather were really compelling - and at times very nice. <br /> Seachd really bears a second look, since there are lots of wire that becomes clearer second around - that's really eating at the finish. <br /> Overall, the combination of music and (at times) stunning visuals, plus a community approach to the acting and non-normal structure has turned Seachd into quite different and memorable films. More of these please!
