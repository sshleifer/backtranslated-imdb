After my experience in Finland for a little more than a week, I would say this movie depicts the nature of the Finnish society beautifully. Especially the young-couple-and-a-baby-severe-phenomenon phenomenon very familiar to me, as I'm witnessing the exact same thing to people when I was in Finland. Relationships with the problem of people, the vulnerability of the marriage institution, the drinking culture, unemployment and the problem of money up, all are very well put, without any subjectivity or exaggeration. <br /> There are some points in films that are not necessarily easy to understand and tie to each other, but the big joint picture is still rewarding. Not every one of the short stories is interesting or profound, but as said above, the great picture does not fail to deliver the feeling of "real life" and capture the viewer. I come to think in a calm moment: What's going on in the lives of all those in the street? Well, this is what's happening. Movies like this are good to feed your imaginary power. It would be safe to assume that this film can be applied to life in many countries, but it particularly reflects Finland as it is, and very humiliated. <br /> A comment on the act: Being a fan of Finnish movies, I have never seen any of these actors on any other movie, but I've found the act of this feature right next perfect in general. Perhaps not a masterpiece, but a very good attempt by the whole crew. I'll keep an eye on the future releases of the director and the cast .. <br /> <br /> 7,5 / 10
