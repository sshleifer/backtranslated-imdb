The Sentinel is a movie that recommended me years ago, not my dad, and I've seen it many times since. It still manages to entertain me, while being effectively creepy as well. The flashback scene is what really makes it to me. Father Cristina Raines's run around all creepily, and the two climbing women, still managing throwing throws down my spine. It's your typical good thing evil thing, but at least it manages to be fun. My end is considered to be one of the finest in horror stories. He was very shocked and suspicious, seeing Burgess Meredith doing his stuff as a Chaser, made me on the corner of my seat. The Sentinel has perfect build up of tension. We are never completely comfortable whenever Allison is on the screen. We know something terrible is always waiting for it, and that has made things all more tense. This film is often neglected among horror fans, but I personally think it's one of the best in them out, and it certainly has enough for all horror fans, they must be satisfied. Cristina Raines has her wooden moment, but it has come even though in a great way for the most part. She's nice to look at, and her chemistry and Saranadon felt natural. Chris Sarandon is great as the companion, Michael. She has an instant screen presence, and I can not help but love her. Martin Balsam, Jos√© Ferrer, Jan Carradine, Ava Gardner, Arthur Kennedy, Sylvia Miles, Debora Raffin, Jerry Orbach, Richard Dreyfuss, Jeff Goldblum and Tom Berenger are all memorable, or small. Burgess Meredith is terrific as Chaser. It looks like a normal old man, but what we get out is absolutely terrifying. Eli Wallach & Christopher Wlaken do well, as the bumbling detectives. Beverly D'Angelo has one scenic cottage, which I will not spoil. <br /> <br /> Bottom line. The Sentinel is an effective horror movie that horror fans, Unfortunately they tend to overlook. It will give you the emotions and crises you need to be satisfied. Well worth the look. <br /> <br /> 7/10
