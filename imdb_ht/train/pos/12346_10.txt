This is a very good and poetic story. Beautiful scenery. Magnificent music notes. I was twice in Japan last year and the film gave me this typical Japanese feel. The movement of the camera is superb, as well as the actors. It goes deep into your feelings without becoming melodramatic. Japanese people are very sensitive and kind and it's all very well done on the screen here. The principal is playing superb and light a color and shows the audience that it is also possible to let them enjoy a subtle and fine film. Once you've seen this movie you will want to see more of the same director. It's a real feeling good movie and I can recommend only for everyone.
