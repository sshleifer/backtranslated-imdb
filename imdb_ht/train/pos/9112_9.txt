When half-portuguese does not render half blind (nor half prejudice) when discussing Portuguese films. Not that I get to do this very often anyway. But this movie was such a rush of adrenaline! Yes, that's right - it's just as accurate as history has gone / gone - but it pulls no punches on adventures beyond normal official movie officials: things like using real-worlds in the middle in traffic control Lisbon and recruiting a real crowd stand in for the real crowd of almost 30 years ago. And by God they found it right! OK, to sum it up: very emotionally if you lived in it, but you'll spot minor improvements that might have been done as well as the need for plots. If you're just watching it randomly, you're in for a good historical garbage, only in the most recent History and a bit more thought-proven way than usual. Even by European standards, yes.
