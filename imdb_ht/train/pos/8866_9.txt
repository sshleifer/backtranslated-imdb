"COSBY," in my opinion, is a must-see CBS hit! I'm not sure if I have never seen every episode but I still enjoy it. It's hard to say which one is my favorite. Also, I really like the theme song. If you ask me, though I loved everyone, it would be good if Madeline Kahn did not pass away during the show's run. Since that happens, I've always wondered what the show would be like. Everybody always gives a good performance, the production design was spectacular, the costumes were well designed, and the writing was still very strong. In conclusion, though it can be seen on TBS now, I recommend you catch it just in case it's gone to the air for good
