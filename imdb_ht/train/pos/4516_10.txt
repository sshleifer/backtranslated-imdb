Since Educating Rita, Julie Walters has been one of my role models, and her performance in this as a woman who helps the man he loves to get in synch with her feminine side is magnificent. I would never believe her character from a younger actress, but Walters pulled her off with gusto and panache. Adrian Pasdar gives her best performance on the date of male's lead.
