Best of Arguebly Al Pacino's role. He plays Tony Montana, a small Hood from Cuba back to a wealthy and powerful crime master of Miami, and he did it with only two things he had gotten into this world, his balls with his words, and it does not break 'em for anyone. Begin to work for a great Cuban dealer, Frank Lopez (Robert Loggia) and quickly lift the ladder to the organization along with his long friend Manny (Steven Bauer). Soon she has an eye for sexy wife Elvira of the boss (Michelle Pfeiffer). After Frank sees a threat of Tony in his position, he tries to kill Tony but with no luck. Tony is upset and nothing can stop him now. The film has a great cast among them is F. Murray Abraham as a jumper gangster, another familiar face is Harris Yulin as a croak cop trying to shake Tony, marrying Elizabeth Mastrantonio as young Tony Tony. Credit in Ecxellent's Scenario by Oliver Stone. This film is one of Brightest's Brian DePalma's points in its length UPS and downs career, you can see this very talented guy. The movie has a nice look at it. Also pay attention to two memorable scenes: One of the fancy restaurants ("Goodnight tells the bad guy"). The other is the final shooting where Tony shows that he still knows how to kick the ass and kill over 20 assassins who invade her home. This is certainly one of the most impressive terms in a movie I have ever seen. For fans of Al Pacino and crime crime it is a must-see. For the rest of you it is highly recommended. 10/10
