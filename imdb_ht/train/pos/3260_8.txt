People call this a comedy, but when I just watch it, I laugh <br /> <br /> only once. I guess the problem is that I saw her first when I was 14, <br /> <br /> and I was not old enough to understand that she was not meant to be <br /> <br /> take seriously. There was quite a few scenes that meant <br /> <br /> to be funny, but I care too much about the laugh characters in their <br /> <br />. <br /> <br /> I suggest that you watch this movie next time you will fall in love, <br /> and try to take it seriously. I think you will find that, despite a few funny <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />, it's one of the most loved stories you've ever seen.
