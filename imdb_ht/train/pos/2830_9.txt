The extraordinary Rosemary Forsyth is the main reason to see this flick of films. Why it never became a larger store could never be known. But it is exceptional and stolen every scene of the inch Garson Kanin led this piece of fluff and cast is the first rate, and Robert Drivas and Brenda Vaccaro are especially memorable. A "9" from "10."
