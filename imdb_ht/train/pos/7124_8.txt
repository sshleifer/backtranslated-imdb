Quite a little movie heat and it's not just for kids. John Thaw is brilliant as always (without any hint of Morse Inspector on it). The boy playing William did a good job as well if I did not get him convinced in each scene. I liked all feeling the village with the slowest pace of life at that time. I also felt the scenes in London where historically accurate, as far as I could say. <br /> It firmly remind me of a Scandinavian movie I saw a couple of years ago called My Mother. This movie will have a boy who has been evacuated in Finland in Sweden during WW II. Woman in the family took her to ask for a girl because (as she turned out) she lost her daughter. Getting a boy instead of completely ignoring her. The fact that the Finnish-speaking boy complicates matters even further. I highly recommend that the movie anyone who likes Goodnight Mr. Tom, has the same feeling of it.
