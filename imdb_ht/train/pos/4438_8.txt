Director Edward Montagne does in a little over one hour what other, more expensive and hyped movie fail. Mr. Montagne shows us a police story written by Phillip H. Reisman Jr. That while, not one of the best in the genre, it holds the viewer involved in all that's happening. clearly a quality movie B. In fact, the best thing for the "Stranger Tattooed" is the opportunity to take a look at New York's look in the years. The crystalline scene is clear by William O. Steiner, either held in the years, or has been restored with love. <br /> <br /> There are great New York views in the opening sequence. Later we were brought to Brooklyn in the dumbo section and later on the movie traveling to the Bronx and Hill Hill area and stores its many monuments in the area. John Miles and Walter Kinsella made a great detective team. Patricia Barry is perfect as the plant expert at the Museum of Natural History. Jack Lord, who went to the biggest thing in his career, was seen in a non-pale role. <br /> It was great fun to watch a city, as it was, because it does not exist yet.
