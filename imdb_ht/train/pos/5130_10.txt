... may seem like an overstatement, but not. <br /> <br /> What is difficult to understand is - why did not they make more music shorts like this? Is not the beauty of it totally apparent to everyone involved? I guess not. So many shorts are made for commercial purposes only, and some have the chance to have some artistic value in the. This is one exception - the only one? - where it seems the director had a vision and clearly would appreciate the music as art. Why did not ever think Lester or Charlie Parker on a live date? Crazy, man. <br /> <br /> A pity there was no suites. If you have seen anything of similar quality, please share it!
