Of all the yall who thought 1.This was a Berry telecast 2.Halle Berry and Denzel Washington did not deserve the Oscars <br /> <br /> SHUT F ** UP!

To be honest I stopped watching the academy award because of a lack of diversity in either winners or candidates. For me it was nothing but a bunch of white people patting each other in back.the academy was likely to vote black actresses that were brilliant in films such as Alfre Woodard, Whoopi Goldberg, Diana Ross, Mary Babtise Mary, but it was not 2.Halle Berry deserves that Oscar has no competition the academy has been under pressure to vote for her long deserved actresses being ignored by the majority Academy which is composed of white voters Yeah Nicole prettily in muling rouge! but the black man's time has been accommodated in these show shows. As for the Mr Washington Academy, it must be great time after that loss ingredient for MalcomX. All those who think race is not a "probably white person" problem in industry The film, well it is much of the most talented black talent around being either reduced to stereo typically made by the white man's role in what they think is a black woman or not the existence of "Angela Basset". I do not expect much of the white people to understand any of this because they never faced any of it. As they think of it is the one who has been injured
