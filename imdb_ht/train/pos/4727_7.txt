I was pleasantly surprised that I liked this film. Written states (some "inside" jokes I got, others I did not - maybe due to actors talking on top of each other), great acting (notably John Cassini), great camera, interesting and unique directed. I rent it to see Jeffrey Meek (very disappointed she was in it as a little bit, beat and you'll miss her!), But the movie was remarkably entertaining. I'll actually watch it again before I send back to Netflix. I think the actors and wanna-be actors will be well-liked this movie. The last is a bit hoping but wanting to do something different (and more positive). Too bad the movie was not best received except for the "festival" market. I suggest it to anyone who likes the act to act.
