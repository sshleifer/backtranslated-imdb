I studied Charlotte Bronte's novel in high school and left me with a stunning impression. Here was a wonderful novel about a young woman's struggle to find love and acceptance of the black times of Victorian England. This girl was Jane Eyre, a poor and plain character with a strong spirit and the will of her own. His story, which Bronte said in Jane's own eyes, was both sad and inspiring. <br /> <br /> As part of our study, we looked at the 1983 adaptation of the story, and it blew me away. The mini-series not only made the effort to remain the true Bronte's original text and essence of the story, but the actors depicting the characters were just great. Both Zelah Clarke (Jane Eyre) and Timothy Dalton (Jane's lover, by name Rochester) captured brilliant sense of character. I can not imagine anyone else in their role. (Other performances in Rochester in other versions such as the 2006 version lack of passion, energy, and tenderness are needed to show Rochester precisely. I think that Dalton has come out on top because he owns all of these features in his paintings in Rochester. just looks like Jane Eyre, but she's captivating quiet, but firm and entertaining Jane's lovely nature. She keeps in her emotions, like Jane's in the book, at the appropriate time of the story, but lets her fire from Jane In the imaginary scenes, Clarke and Dalton's chemistry show the scenes together also credible and true to Jane's and Rochester devastation.) As well, the actors also support their role perfectly, and the sets fit the gothic nature of the story. <br /> <br /> I recommend this version of the classic Bronte story. If you have not read the book before, then you can watch this production as a faithful introduction to this beautiful story.
