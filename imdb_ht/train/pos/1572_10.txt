When reading a review from another user, it says it's a terrible game, I could not stand idle and do nothing! <br /> Well, this game is great, from the news clips (and two real people, full of sense of humor and credibility!), in the story, I find it very good! I only complain about the enemies starting to blink when they die, until they disappear; and some frustrating situations on the LEILA VR missions, when riding the bike, here and there ... <br /> <br /> Except that, it's a great game, with a great story, good graphics, excellent characters, great band ... I recommend it! Surely! It can be a bit old, but still enjoyable! At least, on the Dreamcast ... but the PS2 version will be the same.
