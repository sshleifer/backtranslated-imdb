This is one of my favorite time. It is so simple and sweet - definitely a chick flirting comedy romantic movie. I really love a movie full of good quotes and this one ... one of my favorites is when Albert Einstein says Ed Walters "Do you think I think" and Ed says "Now what are the chances of what pass! "In my opinion, a movie is awesome if you can watch it again and again and get the same amount of fun out of it, with this one you can !! I also really liked Walter M.'s way of showing Einstein. I think all the characters fit together properly and the story flows nicely. There are many times that I find myself smiling right along with the movie and quoting my favorite line as I watch it! I would recommend this movie to anyone who has a heart and enjoy a good-good feel now and then!
