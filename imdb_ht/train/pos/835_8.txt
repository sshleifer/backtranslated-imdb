Pierce Brosnan's newest, but by James Bond, is an assassin. It's pretty good at what he does, but it has become old and tired. Greg Kinnair is really good as the straight and narrow business man. Now, when the story opens the movie shows these two people in separate lives. Then one night they have drinks in a bar, and they start to talk. Then all of a sudden you get these two people getting drawn together during a series of events. The story is excellent, the act is top notch, and the humorous humorous I never thought that Pierce Brosnan would be this funny, but it really is and I must say this movie is a must see.
