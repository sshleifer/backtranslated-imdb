No message. No symbols. No dark undercurrents. Just a wonderful mix of music, nostalgia and good fun put in-gether by those who obviously had a great time to do it. It is a refreshing antidote to some of the garbage dumps landed by the studios. Naturally YEAR and Incomparable Judi Dench is worth seeing. With Cleo Laine's brilliant jazz songs is a bonus. This lady is in the same league as Ella is late. This goes on my movie shelves to be pulled out again anytime I feel the need for a warm experience and a nice hearty character. Just a wonderful movie!
