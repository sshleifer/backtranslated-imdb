Gene Kelly, Frank Sinatra, Kathryn Grayson, and Jose Iturbi star of "Anchors Aweigh," directed by George Sidney. Kelly and Sinatra are Joe and Clarence, the navy on the left in Hollywood. They meet a boy (Dean Stockwell) and take her home, and meet her aunt (Grayson). Clarence falls for her. He wants an audition for Jose Iturbi. They try to help but have a mix-up. <br /> This is a very energetic music with great dancing and singing by Kelly and Sinatra. Kelly gets dancing with the Jerry Mouse in a delightful sequel. Grayson sings envy and my heart sings. Not one of my favorite voices, but it does well. Iturbi's piano works are beautiful. <br /> <br /> Sinatra gets her versatility show, and why the girls swooned on her, with these big blue eyes and juvenile figures. For Kelly, this was a great break for him at MGM. <br /> <br /> Beautiful movie, very dynamic.
