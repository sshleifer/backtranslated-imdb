I do not care if you would like my comments or no but I think you who wrote that the movie is not good..ou is so obsessed by the Hollywood films that you can not see how good this is My movie is not a fan of Jay Chou but I love playing it, not only it ... and can you think that there is a great sense of the idea and may you think it's not so interesting but Look deeply there is more than action in the movies more than love and passion and tears are more than USA in the world and it's good :) really good. And it costs a lot to do so, please do not criticize the actors the directors cause you do not know how hard to work for you to be happy at this time and a half watching them thank you :)
