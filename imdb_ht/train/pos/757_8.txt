I need honesty. I watch and enjoy this show because it was gross, offensive, hilarious, and raunchy. Yeah, there is a lot of humor for every taste. If you are in the kind of humor that deals with making fun of those who fall out of skateboarding, for example then you will have a great time for it. Or, if you enjoy people on extreme stunt actions gone bad, you will have a great time too. But if you enjoy skatological humor and extreme hushy situations, you'll enjoy the show. I love all three types of humor that "pesky Sanchez" offers. I love having a hard laugh and the situations in the show. "Jackass" is like a walk in the park compared to this one. So, if you are tired of the typical American type of Jackass, give it an English toughest attempt on this show. With all due respect. <br /> This is a show of little taste or class. It is not recommended for those who are easily offended or grossed out. Now these guys need to see a psychologist. Especially the Paco character.
