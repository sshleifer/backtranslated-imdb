I saw this in the theater at the beginning of 1970. The most memorable and frightening scenes are when the German army is attacked by the Yellow Mustard crosses for the first time. The Germans and their horses cover the top of the toe (or hoof) with their own protective suits. Soldiers experienced British Don Don Gas (only) and once again awaited the clouds of gas and the German attackers. The gas blacks move ever closer, finally enveloping the British defenders. The Germans move forward slowly menacingly into fear they are looking for Garb. Suddenly a cry from the defenders ... This gas is like no other being experienced before .... <br /> <br /> Now you will know why I came to remember this scene For the last 30 years and always wobbly, I think you'll be too!
