In 1948 this was my favorite movie ever. Betty Grable in the costumes was so ravishing that I wanted to grow up to be her and dress like that. Douglas Fairbanks, Jr., was irresistible as the superb Hungarian officer. Strange and fluffy as this movie might appear at first, when I was eight years old it seemed to me to say something important about the relationship between men and women. I saw him again the other day; I was surprised to find that he always did.
