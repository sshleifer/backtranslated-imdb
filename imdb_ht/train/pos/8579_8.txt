The plot: A Lord's crimes unifying 3 different mafia in a venture to buy an island, which would then serve as a whitewash facility for organized crime. To get that, FBI is trying to bust one of the mafia chefs. The thing goes wrong, and by some easy twisting and twisting scheme, we are presented with another "copying copy that does not like each other" film ... one being a female FBI agent, and the other a former ex-male DEA. <br /> So far, so stupid. But the force of this movie does not lie in her story - a poor joke, at best. It is funny. (At least the German version is syncing). The action is good, too, with a memorable scene involving a shotgun and a rocket launcher. But the focus is downright on the humor. By smart satire, not quite slapstick, but somewhere in between, you get a lot of funny jokes. <br /> However, this movie is the opposite of political equality. Legal drug abuse is usually presented without criticism, and even shows it as fresh. That bit of the movie that seriously annoys me, and makes it unsuitable for the kids, in my opinion. <br /> <br /> All in all, for a nice evening watching comes acceptable action and some funny jokes, this movie is perfect. Just remember: In this genre, it's common to leave your brain at the door when you enter the movie / TV room. Then you will have a good time. 8/10
