This film is one of the most memorized films in its time. When watching this movie, you are full of action, and when something is not really over, the mood is not matched. Brilliant writes for a movie made to give us a bloody blend, in a game show where criminals are competitors, and a near future where the general public all has a thirst for blood.Also Arnold does not let you down with some of his best one liners. I do not want to spoil anything for you, but I'll tell you when Arnold gives "I'm going back line" He gets the best answer to them all in this movie. Hope you enjoy this gem as much as I did.
