I liked this movie! Chris Showerman did an amazing job! Not only is it an incredible actor, but it is gorgeous and an awesome physics! He did a great job on the delivery of his line, the more transformed George better than Fraser did. A great performance for her first bigger roller! This film is full of hilarious scenes that every child will love. My kids watched this movie many times since we bought the DVD to the day it came out. In addition to the movie, the extras on the DVD are just as hilarious. Two thumbs up on this one! I highly recommend it to everyone!
