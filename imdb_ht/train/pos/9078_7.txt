Generally speaking, the plot was better than I expected. The laughing streak was a bit annoying at times and they were tending to get off the road; However, there were enough real chuckles in this episode to make up for it. My biggest surprise was to find some of the best lines and situations not shown in the trailers. Spade, in particular, was not presented in the best light of the earliest promotions, but his character comes through quite well into the pilot. There is enough eye-candy please almost anyone with all the regular characters they look up to work in front of them. Now, if the writers can just live up to what they have begun.
