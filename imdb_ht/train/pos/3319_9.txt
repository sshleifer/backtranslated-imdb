As a long time Red Sox fan, I just went to the movie. It was very good! While never able to live footage from the 2004 Red Sox miracle season, there were great shots in some of my favorite Red Sox players. While the movie is certainly a flick of chick, it has enough baseball footage from the amazing 2004 Red Sox comeback to make it one of my top 10 movies ever. I especially enjoyed the Red Sox fans who belonged to Ben's baseball club. The scene where Ben will be meeting with her buddies on daydreams determine who will find the place certain games is hilarious! A must see if you are looking for a good movie to watch with your spouse, date, or significant other ... especially if you are a baseball fan ... and even more especially if you are Red Sox fans! !!
