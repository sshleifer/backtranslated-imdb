A question to be asked immediately is: Did this movie be held if the women in it was not aunt and cousin Jacqueline Lee Bouvier Kennedy Onassis? <br /> <br /> The answer is: Probably not. /> <br /> But fortunately, they (or were) the cousin and aunt of Jackie. This documentary by the Maysles Brothers on Existence (one can hardly call it a lifetime) in Edith B. Beale, Jr., and her daughter Edith Bouvier Beale (Edie), have the same Calling in a train wreck - you do not want to look, but you have them. <br /> <br /> Big Edith and Little Edie live in a magnificent once castle in East Hampton, New York, which slowly rotten around. Once beautiful garden are now a forest. <br /> <br /> Magnificent lean oil paint against the wall (with cat stools in the back floor) with beautiful portraits of them as young woman lifestyle for space on the walls next to the old magazine cover. <br /> <br /> Living alone together for many years has broken many barriers between the two women but building others. <br /> <br /> Clothing is seemingly if you want. Edie's favorite costume is a pair of shorts and fantastic tires pulling up on them with bits and cloths in wrapped and pinned around torso and head. As Edith says "Edie is always nice at 56." And indeed it is. There are times when it's almost luminescent and both women show the beauty that once was there. <br /> There is a constant undercurrent of sexual tension. The food habits are (to be polite) strange. Ice cream spread on crackers. A dinner party for Edith's birthday at Wonder Pen sandwich is served in fine china and plastic utensils. Time is irrelevant in their world; as Edie says "I have no clock." Relationships with men are oh-so-strange. Edie feels like Edith calls again in his early attempt. He says "If you can not find a man to propose for you, you can as well die." In which Edith responds "I'm going to take a dog any day." It is obvious that Edith does not see her role in Edie's lack of male company. Earlier in the film she stated "France dropped but Edie was not." Sometimes it is difficult to hear exactly what they said. Both women speak at the same time and constantly contradict each other. /> <br /> There is an unusual relationship with animals throughout the movie; Edie feeds the raccoons in the attic with Wonder Bread and cats. The cats (and many of them) are everywhere. /> At one point, Edie stated "The Hallmark of Aristocracy is Responsibility." But they seem to be unable to take responsibility for themselves. <br /> This is a hard movie to look but well worth the effort.
