If you liked Deep Cover, you might also like this movie too. Many of the poetic interpretations of Fishburne recipes in Deep Cover are from the lyrical script to "Once in Life," a screen adaptation of a play that Fishburne wrote. If you like Larry as much as I do, you'll love this movie that is full of Larry, all hot, and all flesh out. Of course there are playing guns and illegal substance used, this is a gangster movie of kind, after all, but the script is beautiful and the story is touching, even slightly on the flick of chick side. AMAZING movie ... black, scary, sexy, and interesting. If you've ever sneaked out at night or hanging out of a club, you'll get the proper impact of the restrained sets (metephorically echo being trapped in life). The clever intelligent and complex relationship, this film is tight .. Everyday feelings reflected in the series of dresses and vaccine cameras. GOOD JOB!
