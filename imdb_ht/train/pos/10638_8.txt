When I think about this movie, all the adjectives that come to mind somehow relate to the physical appreciation of the world. Texture, smell, color, is how I think this movie should be judged in terms of. Watch the beautiful golden tone that surrounds the young woman asleep in the fireplace, or sweltering turkish bath, and let it flood your senses and impressions of spices, coarse fabrics, smooth skin, scented oils, flame flames, rustle satellites. Not only look and listen, you must absorb, leaving the voice of drugs in telling the story of you.
