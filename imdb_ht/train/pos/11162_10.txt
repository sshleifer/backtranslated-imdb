High Energy Raoul Walsh Classic from 1933, Bowery puts saloon masters and operators Wallace Beery against bitter rival and dandy, George Raft, and adopts kid street Jackie Cooper and good looking Fray Wray in the role that plays between rivalry great ones. It's not clear exactly what the rivalry is all about, but everyone follows it in the tabloid every day. Many of the wisecracks at the beginning, but the characters soften as the film progresses. Apart from that it is excellent in the scenes of Beery's salute. The various characters, chorus lines, lots of drinking, a perfect creation of a coward of cruelty is not too refusing by so-called pre-cord restrictions, and then later coming to Carrie Nations led by Carrie Nation himself. It all creates a very vivid picture of a life that's gone away. I do not like to compare eras, but this film is completely and totally different from anything one might see today. The film is very hearty and has long lost innocence and is absolutely a must see.
