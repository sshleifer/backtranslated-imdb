An excellent cast does this movie work; All the characters developed very well and clearly that the actors enjoyed this movie cinema. <br /> It's not quite the comedy I hope, much more a gliding look at the attempt to claim youthful glory than humorous humor. For music fans there are quite a few subtle references that in themselves are intelligently funny. <br /> I hate drawing direct comparisons to other movies, but many of this movie reminds me of Alan Parker movie I can not help: Imagine whether their commitment actually made it great - and then tried to recapture says glory 25 years later.
