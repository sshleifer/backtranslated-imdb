Ah, a Kelly / Sinatra marine-costume music. So, familiar, right? Yes, but this is not one of you usually heard about. About the city that-a-way. But if you stick around, you can learn something. Okay, probably not. Anyway, Anchors Aweigh tells the sailors' story about a three or four days leave. Joe is "Wolf of the Sea" and Clarence, the IBS type, Joe's henchman to get him a "dame". Now, after collecting copies to find little Donald home. That's where they meet Susie, who temptor, that jezebel. Just kidding! Clarence falls in love with her. At least he thinks he does. Is it right? Or is it a moron? Or is it just misguided by society? Find out all of this and more when you look at the trumpet fan ANCHORS AWEIGH! If you want to see Kathryn Grayson have anything but gentle sweet, try to kiss me Kate (1953).
