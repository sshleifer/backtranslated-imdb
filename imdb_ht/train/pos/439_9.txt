The true measure of any fictional piece of work is whether the characters grow in their experience and from the experience change in some meaningful way (remember that this change does not need to be positive or beneficial) to the end. By that measure, enchanted April is a resounding success. As a movie in general, it succeeds very well excellent thrown together, well developed your character come to care about, wonderful script and beautiful lying with places. In the short film is, well, breathtaking. Although all performances are first-rate, three are to be mentioned-Josie Lawrence, Jim Broadbent and Joan Plowright. He says something when Miranda Richardson is doing his job fine and yet is covered by many others in the cast. Most highly recommended, especially if you are a romantic in heart. Further advancing Saith not.
