You do not need to read this review. <br /> An earlier review, not Pinninson in Seattle, has already identified all the main shortcomings in this production. I can only apply the fundamental arguments. Little House was a relatively late novel Dickens and is darker than his earliest work. This is taken too literally by the director, Ross Devenish, who piles on the gloom and excessive fog. When Ada, Rick and Esther appear, half an hour in the opening episode, it's a relief just to be in the daytime for the first time. In some of the market scenes it was difficult to see what was actually on my TV screen. I look at the whole thing in one day, starting mid-afternoon. As daylight fad has become less of a problem, but I have a very good TV and I have never encountered this problem before at any time of the day. <br /> <br /> The rally is very deliberate (therefore slow down). I'm sure this was intentional, but it is overdone. There are many shots of people trudging though the manure and gloom of Victorian London being held longer than necessary to establish the mood and atmosphere. A good editor can probably take several minutes out of every fifty minutes episode, without losing a line of dialogue, just by reducing each of the scenes a little. <br /> I do not want to overstate these issues. You soon adjust to the view and speed of this output. The most important issue is that it does not always tell the story very effectively. Earlier Dickens novels are as long as House Bleak, but they are not so complicated to draw. For example, I recently re-read Nicholas Nickleby because I was intrigued to see how Douglas McGrath crammed a 800 pages book in his two-hour movie. The answer is simple: the book is filled with padding. McGrath cuts big swathes in the novel while still maintaining all the essential story elements. This would not be possible with House Bleak. <br /> <br /> This production needs its seven hours. Probably, he needs even more, because many elements of his plot plot are not sufficiently clear, or as well handled, as they need to be. A few random examples will illustrate the issues. The girl Rosa has appeared in nowhere with no background, so Lady Dedlock's attachment is largely unmotivated. In Tulkinhorn's quest for a sample of Horton's writing is a bit dig. <br /> It was not clear enough that Esther is actually in love with Woodcourt when he agrees to marry John Jarndyce. Nor is it clear that they have agreed not to announce their commitments, or why. <br /> Ada and Rick's secret wedding are omissions. In one episode are simply lovers, in the next, people are suddenly referred to as husband and wife. Mrs Rouncewell is only presented at a late stage in the story and the Sargazian George's engagement from his family is left unreasonably - as is the medium by which he discovered. Tulkinhorn's dedication to keeping the honor and respectability of the Dedlock family is understated, so its motive for persecuting Lady Dedlock is more obscure than it needs to be. <br /> <br /> Implication of the brick makers with both Tom and (later) Lady Dedlock is somewhat opaque .. It's not obvious that Guppy renews her bid in Esther because her brand on sale has all but disappeared . <br /> This is just a selection: there are others. They are not the biggest problems with the main violence in the story. However, minor irritation is detected from its power: you should not have to puzzle on pointed small points. However, there are more significant structural issues that weaken the story in later stage. <br /> <br /> The whole business of Tulkinhorn's murder is a bit thrown away. Bucket immediately pinpoint Hortense as a suspect, weakening the suspense of Sergeant George's situation and the importance of finding Mrs Rouncewell. It also reduces the impact of the sub-plot in which suspicion is cast on Lady Dedlock and weakens the scene in which Hortense is unmasked before Sir Lester. <br /> <br /> A more serious problem is that the murder, its investigation and the subsequent search for Lady Dedlock, dominate the story for more than an hour, during which time we completely lose sight of The other main stride scheme: the legal case and its effect on Rick. Endless failing, his government by Vholes and Skimpole, Ada's despair, its declining health and so on, are all set on hold for an entire episode. This may be how Dickens wrote the book (I have not read it for years), but a good scenario should keep the different scheme sections moving simultaneously. <br /> <br /> Finally, the role of snack in the story is so reducing that it is almost useless. His discovery of the new will, which triggers the final phase of the story, is also thrown away. It came on screen. <br /> Despite all that, it's still a very good output. Many of the performances are exceptional. Individual scenes are very well achieved. Its essence accumulates in extremely powerful tragedy. I would always recommend it as a superb adaptation to a great book, it was not for production in 2005. In fact, I probably would not be completely aware of its damage if I did not see how Andrew Davies did it's best. I was critical of Jane Austen Davies's adaptation, but I must admit that she really knows how to tame Dickens's books. <br /> This is an impressive and exciting drama and well worth seven hours in anybody's time. However, its probable fate is to be seen primarily as a cross reference to the pre-definitive version of 2005.
