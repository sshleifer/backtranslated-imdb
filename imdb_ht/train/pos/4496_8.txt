To put it simply, I enjoyed this movie. The reason for my interest and pleasure was not related to anything other than the subject itself. I've heard stories from my mother and grandmother about how Northern England working class life and attitudes are used to be (as their experience) and this is an interesting illustration that looks faithfully to what they have to say to me. In particular, the paternal father, but exuberant who "knows" what is best for his family and stubbornly then defying paradigms. (Not much has changed there then !!) Those who saw the play will probably be disappointed with the movie because the story is not easily transmitted through the different media. In a sense however, the movie is a historical document and I personally enjoyed it, if only because of its way of targeting a social phenomenon.
