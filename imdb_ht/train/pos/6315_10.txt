Welcome to Collinwood is a lot of things, but it is not one of the following: <br /> A George Clooney Unfunny Un-Unique Star Machine <br /> <br /> And yes I know, base The movie is another movie. But as far as Hollywood goes, this can rank with the most authentic productions of this decade - and for me, it does. The film is from start to finish, an absolute fuel. That's why. <br /> There is not a bad performance in the movie. Funny comics are funny. The orgy parties are edgy. The script contains, not a dull moment in the movie's dialogue is cool and the answer is yes. And do not comply with the Hollywood norm (you will see what I mean, when you see the movie) <br /> <br /> When I was a kid, I remember seeing advertising for the movie. This movie went under the radar after not near much of the box office, and not even a classic cult. The reason why Transformers 2, to see what is acceptable by average film spectators, is because they used to see Transformers 2. If the movie as original and comic as has been pumped out often as multi-million pieces s ** t , Cinemas experience would be a lot of fresher places - <br /> When 'they' say they do not do as they used to, they 've not seen Welcome to Collinwood. <br /> <br /> A fun, mini-masterpiece of commercial caper, which refuses to compromise. One of my favorites.
