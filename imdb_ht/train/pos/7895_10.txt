At the opening scene of this movie someone shot in her hotel room in someone else's bathroom and blow out all the lights. This must have been very hep for 1936, but rather way out and have nothing to do with the movie, Robin Hood did not make an appearance as far as I could see. However, Bette Davis (Daisey Appleby), "The Whales in August", '87 was very young and attractive and made one of her best roles in a long career in Hollywood. Daisey never stopped teasing or being very sexy with its nightgowns and so-called suits swimming on her yacht and George Brent (Johnny Jones), "The Spiral Staircase", '46. Daisey even proposed Johnny's wedding in a Ferris head down and even got a black eye. Davis and Brent did a big couple, one supposed to be very wealthy and the other a very poor reporter. Off stage, Davis and Brent had a real real love affair, which is good reason why there was spark when these two appeared in this movie. If you liked Bette Davis and George Brent, this is the movie for you!
