The most amazing movie, spiritually linked to the restoration of the gospel. Far better than any other movie, or film made on the restoration so far. If you have not seen it, hop on a Salt Lake plane and see it now. You will not regret it! You really get a sense of what's the first simple struggle, trusting the total and total of the Prophet Joseph Smith. You finally find some sort of understanding of things the Prophet had to fight in with the persecution he and his people faced. If you have any questions about the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and the beginning of submission just to watch this movie, it will make a complete and complete sense of time.
