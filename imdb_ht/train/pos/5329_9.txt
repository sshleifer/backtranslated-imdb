This movie was great. <br /> <br /> The plot was convincing. But <br /> <br /> But given you can lighten up enough to laugh, it was a very thrilling lone combining keystone cops and the Langer Ranger. <br /> <br /> The animals were more funny than bad. The good guys were not too good. Black actors have played normal characters rather than black stereotypes. Inclusion a baby added a good touch. Sympathy may have been a little tricky otherwise. <br /> I do not agree on acting. It was, on the whole, very good. I really wanted to punch Judge Reinhold. And, after all, is not marked in a really good movie, want to punch Judge Reinhold?
