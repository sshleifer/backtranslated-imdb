I enjoyed this movie. It was lit, delightful, and very colorful. You can see MGM showed Teknikolor. There is hardly any color that does not appear in this movie. Each scene is packed full. The choreography was great. Gene Kelly is an amazing one. It is so talented. The dance numbers in this movie are all perfectly executed, and perfectly designed. He understands that the dance can tell the story as much as anything else. The last section of the movie, the grand dance sequence, is very impressive. What makes this movie very special is Gershwin's music. Some American composers had a better gift for tune. I greatly enjoy Gershwin's music. It's breathtaking. Ira Gershwin is definitely one of the greatest lyric writers. It's so witty and spacious. This was a very fun movie.
