Note: These comments are for those who have watched the movie. Vanilla Sky is a brilliant, complicated, and exciting movie that explores exactly what the tag-line says: LoveHateDreamsLifeWorkPlayFriends. Perhaps the film scheme can come into focus for people who have movie-rocket if someone looks at different angles .. <br /> <br /> <br / > Now I do not have to go to the movie scene by stage, so I'll have more to examine my statement (and I welcome your thoughts), but give this a try and see if the movie does not fall In place: Where exactly the 'bookings' compressions happen? <br /> Now, I'm not talking about the tile as explained by the 'technician' LE, since that sequence itself could actually be interpreted as a rationalization inside David Aames's idea / dream / coma but the exploitation True to reality and dreams. It seems to me that the fact of crashing the car, the way that it is filmed (no explosion, for example) is a 'complementary' point point, and that any particular sequence with an existential / dream / coma / non-reality feeling - whether it shows screen before or after the crash - is actually part of Aames's personal travels toward self-realization inside of his own mind. In this respect, then, we leave with two questions at the very end (if you know more, let me know): Is Aames actually defined, and where is he waking up? <br /> <br /> If you do not get entirely wrapped up in the exact sequence of details of plot, or at what particular point its dreams spread throughout, this movie becomes a fascinating exploration of a human on a Travel finds himself and wha this means in today's pop-culture society
