As maybe one of the few Canadians who did not read the book in high school, I thought I would add my comment. See the movie without knowing the story in advance in any way detracted in the movie. Characters have many complexities, everyone can relate to them in their own way. The brightness of the adaptation is that everyone will allow them to project their own perception of the lives of their characters, rather than being spoon-eating an opinion. You can love them or they do not like them, and you still feel emotional impact on the movie. Wonderful performances by Ellen Burstyn and Christine Horne really bring their characters into life. I would highly recommend it.
