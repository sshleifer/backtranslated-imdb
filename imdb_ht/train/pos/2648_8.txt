Really the story of two cold and respective fellows fall from grace (through addiction drugs) and later redemption. A brother, an independent genius proclaimed by James Franco is typical or sensitive but intelligent people-child. The other brother is a hard work doctor who gets less trial as he even falls due to addiction while dealing with the stress of living up to his family's expectations for both children. Not too heavy to repay as the drug substance they want, and all of a pretty realistic draw in the family's dynamics that drug problems carry over. I would recommend it to anyone interested in studying these characters and congratulating James Franco for his efforts in what was obviously a work of love.
