I saw this film as a teenager and immediately identified and painted by Reese Witherspoon in Dani Trant, a 14-year-old tomboy in rural Louisiana circa 1957. She feels that she will never be as beautiful as her older sister, Maureen (a currently rarely seen Emily Warfield), and feeling out of place in terms of his conservative Baptist evangelism. Then 17-year-old Foster Court (Jason London), his close-knit mother (Gail Strickland) moves to the next door, Dani experiences his first breakthrough, while courts enjoy his company, with voluntary spirits . Dani succeeded in finding her first kiss from her, but as soon as she saw Maureen, she collapsed on her heels, leaving Dani behind. The bail's close brakes are severe by the ripple that erupts, which only deepens when Court dies in a tragic accident. The girls then were made to realize how they needed each other. <br /> Sam Waterson and Tess Harper are just perfect as their parents love, trying to balance their daughter's independence, at the same time trying to keep the family together. The beautiful cinematography, with the wonderful soundtrack featuring Elvis Presley, the Platters and many more contributing to the film's atmosphere at a simpler time. A touch-to-face movie touch with a timeless message.
