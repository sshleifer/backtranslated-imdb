A gentle comic humorous comedy, until the last five minutes, which has degenerated into running in the British television TV mill. The last five minutes cost it 2 points in my rating. Despite this bigger scheme and style default, it's worth looking for the actor's unique and unique Cornwall character. Many fine small bits, such as the eternity of our tensions, all go in waiting for the bank approval after the clerk swiped the credit card ... made more thorns when we did not - well - assured that the card was not maxed.
