This was one of the best movies I've ever seen. The film relates to real-life and how drugs can play an important part. Although this film appears to be produced in a low budget, I found it to be exhilarating to look. Some may not like the story and tell the script to miss the direction. However, when one gets as deep in drugs like these characters, no direction is life. I feel this movie is an accurate representation of what can happen to someone if they are faced with extreme temptations. Most of the cast is new to the industry. However, they all pull it off very well. Everyone seemed to do their job well and get in the proper way. <br /> I think this movie might be a good tool to use when dealing with someone or someone who loves to participate in drugs and appears to be spiraling losing control. This movie might just scare them enough to change their way.
