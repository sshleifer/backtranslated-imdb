At first, this movie seems so bad that I almost fell into a first vision I saw it. It was like a bad dream. Cosmic cos. But I gave it a second chance, then another and another, etc. ... I finally was addicted to this movie, due to its slow slow sleeping, wonderful natural laying, bathing in a thin autumn light and especially notes of music, which is made in some 70 rocky and absolute pavilions Singing Exclusive Songs by the actor / singer / songwriter Derek lamb (Troubadour) .You should notice the song on Hazel Wood, Silver Trout and Ladies disappear from the air ..., Hearing in the middle and near the end the film. There are some carnival scenes in the beginning, which allows us to appreciate the natural charms of Elizabeth Suzuki.The films are made by some "repertoire" directors such as Bergman, Lars Von Triers or Jean-Luc Goddard, critics would have to roll on the floor, raving about that movie as if it was a cosmic chief.I personally think that this movie is one million times the superior any of Cinematic Fellini's sh # Â¤ @ t! Definitely not for the firefighter.
