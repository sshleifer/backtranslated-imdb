Mirage (1990) is a very rare terror / chiller from 1990, released here in the UK on the label "New World Video". It's a desert based movie horror on a group of young friends who are partying for the weekend, only to be killed one by one by an unknown force that drives a menacing black truck! This movie has some creepy scenes, and some gore here and there, but I said that the act was so lame, even by low budget standards! But the movie was strangely addictive and I loved it, and I never fall asleep or turn it off, which is always a good sign! I almost gave this movie 6/10, but seeing as it builds up steam along the road, there were some good times of gore and suspense, there were some good nuts, and the fact that the blonde in the main female role was a hoth too! I'll give it 7/10.
