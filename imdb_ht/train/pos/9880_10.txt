This movie was born in 1943 when I think Judy was in her picks (seems wise). In her previous movie for me and Gal Gal I often say she looks emerging. Well in this movie it looks perfect. She is beautiful and shows she has a comedy flair. <br /> I think this movie is hilarious, especially at the beginning when it tries to arrange an audition with John Thornway. One of the funniest scenes in my opinion is Judy's pronouncement of Lady Macbeth and when John is looking for her to the party giving him a spank (Lol). One criticism I have is that there is a hole in the plot when John and Lily fall in love. I mean a minute she despises her and the next will be out on a date then next time they meet after the dates of love. <br /> Another point I did not like was about night opening. If I was Lily I would be furious with John but it's not ... it just does not make sense. But all in all I should give this movie a 10 because it's just wonderful and almost perfect.
