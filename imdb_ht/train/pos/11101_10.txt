The sopranos were probably the best show at 90's. Its sadness was over, it was the best show on HBO if not on TV, not everything was spelled out for you while you thought it was brilliant. The throw was excellent. Tony (James Gandolphini) is a great actor and he plays his excellent character, as well as others. Each character had the defect that made them so real and allowed viewers to connect with them and that one reason it lasted long. The last episode was good, I'm not sure how to take it a lot different things can be interpreted by the ending end as thought Tony did not die, but the mud walked in to sit with them and that the blackout was just for suspension. Tony will have to go to trial and deal with who hopefully does not die as I feel ... Long live Sopranos and Tony Soprano .......
