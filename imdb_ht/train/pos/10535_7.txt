The only word that resumes this movie is original. It is a light-hearted snake in an existential concept. bouncy (in more ways than one) and a little nutty. I would not exactly call it Grand and Unforgettable Cinema and it does not seem quite as memorable as the movie director's first "Cube" but it's a good pit of fluffy look on a Sunday morning. The glasses act in respectful annoyance at times but I believe it is as it should be written. to make as a serious movie she could possibly be great or maybe very well stepped in a state of pretense. A little like "the uterus" meets "head" to satisfy "human nature". <br /> 6.8 out of ten
