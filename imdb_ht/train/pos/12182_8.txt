I did not do any research on the movie before I looked first to it because it was part of a set of boxes Welles I had just bought. A set of boxes I received primarily because I wanted to own a male for all seasons and also to re-evaluate Waterloo. So I stick Orson and Rita in the player and I treat in class and confusion in the same measure. <br /> <br /> On the surface of the story seemed a simple, man meets gorgeous women and saves him from a couple of thugs, they click right away and people come offering to work on a cruise with women with her husband's most famous lawyer, and then ............. <br /> <br /> .. well it becomes mystery mystery of deviously drawn and very shenanigans. Michael O'Hara (Orson Welles) himself does not really know what's going on, it is as confused as the viewer is, and that's wonderful to watch as it is pulling all over the place by many people in the movie. It is obvious that being pulled by the heart strings by a fatal females of beauty such as Elsa Bannister (Rita Hayworth) has its moments, but you just know that things will go beamed-shaped. <br /> So many wonderful things in the movie, she has Welles visual style all over her, seeing a scene of an aquarium that is wonderful and the sequel sequences of a fun home is majestic on the eye. The narratives from O'Hara are happy mockers, and we find good relief in a way court case with Everett Sloane considerably lighting up the procedures. But the movie is a oddity, and in fact it's a horrible look, because {as I found out after} the studio's master cut off the movie by pretty much a whole hour, and that's just not just frustrating the viewer, but unjust in Welles' visions. I'm positive that an original movie full of this film has been very much applauded and revered, as it is, we have a very good and intriguing movie, one that sadly only hints at Grand Prix, but remains a fiendishly movie rude that I am happy I own more reviews. 8.5 / 10
