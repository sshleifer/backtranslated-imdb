Peter Jacksons version (s) are the best film films from objective point of view. That being said, they do not like my favorite screen of Lord in the Rings, and let me explain why. <br /> First, acting on the screen characters is just too ordinary and uninspiring with LOTR Jackson. All the cast is too busy at the factory. "Are you claiming that these funny cartoon characters in Ralph Bakshi versions are best actors than real people?" one can ask. Well, they are not really unusual (saved for Hobbits, later on them) and they certainly pack more personality than Jackson's part - even with long-term dialogue time. And this is because of _voice_ supervision acting in the LOTR Bakshi. Take Aragorn for example. In this version of his voice is deep and charismatic and full of authority (Aragorn Lord) and a seasoned racquet (Aragorn Ranger). This is due to John Hurt's brilliant voice. Compare that the rather high fall of the Viggo Mortensen with no soul and duel becomes quickly uneven: Hurt beat Mortensen but down. <br /> Then there is Gandalf. Probably the most dominant (and the most popular) characters of the whole legend. In this Bakshi version Gandalf (William Squire) is a real wizard. And by that I do not mean he shoots out of his right (he does not) but his presence is just captivating. It is a mystical, powerful and can be changed from old man to man who is scared with ease. Add to that looks like: Tall, old as ancient oak, long beard like his body, sharp eyes, zandra wizardy nose and of course, the classic wizard hat. A perfect Gandalf, just like in the books. Gandalf Ian McKellen's on the other hand is simply just too boring. It seems too human, sounds too human, too human to act and no hat or shield does not have swords. Yes a sword. In this Bakshi version Gandalf notes the orc killed the couple with his sword (as he did in the books). And these are stylish slow motion slowing. Gandalf is not a power to be messed with. And it must have been noted, while I'm sad to say that, Christopher Lee's big did not bring Saruman alive. Fraser Kerr in this movie did, even with a very limited screen time and line. Before I move completely into the visual aspect of the movie, it must be mentioned that the voice acts with the overall presentation of the Ork are also superior to Mr. Jackson's bad guys. The Orcs Bakshi cast their enemies (or each other) constantly and grow, screams and nasty words. They are more credible as monsters and they are more faithful to the book in my opinion. And finally, the Black Rider - or the Nazgul. Those ultimate bad guys are scared ghosts in this one - not just some black riders. Then they speak with haunting voices, which mesmerizes the victims. My favorite scene in the movie is when Nazgul is being pursued by Frodo near the river. While Peter Jackson could not do anything but show passengers simply pursuing the party, Bakshi launched into a nightmarish dream and some cool motion slow motion scenes with the sky thunder. <br /> But as many I like this movie over Jackson, the latter are, if only technically, always better. And this is because of some key visuals. As you know Bakshi LOTR features a mix of animated characters (all Hobbits and the main cast) and real actors covered with paint. I do not really have a problem using real people in this way animation, but they just do not fit very well with traditional drawing figures. This is especially true of people (the Rohan rider, people taverns etc.) orcs are different problems, since they are meant to look very different from other characters. Orcs, while playing by humans and animation mix, look far superior to Jacksons version. They have brownish-green skin, shiny red eyes, flat face and sharp teeth. <br /> <br /> Biggest screw up in this visual movie, howerver, is the Hobbits. While I prefer almost every character in Bakshi version compared to Jackson, the latter has clearly superior Hobbits, in fact they are perfect. And Bakshi you get some disappointing and rather wrongly drawn humanoid Disney bambi. And you are forced to spend a lot of time film with them, so they were warned. Once again, the voice acts is OK with them too, but the actors mouths can not save the "immersion damage" made by little heaviness. Well, I never really liked those halflings anyway. <br /> <br /> The General Chess of the Bakshi script are well known. Limited time playing (with budget boundaries) and many missing scenes. So while this movie covers almost half of the story, it does not make it in great detail compared to Jackson's version. <br /> <br /> In a summary version of Ralph Bakshi in LOTR there is a superior: <br /> <br /> - atmosphere around (it feels more like Earth's Earth) - all voice acting music (I really dig the fantasy story by Kont & Rosenman) -Gandalf -Aragorn (One of John Hurt's finest roles) -King Theoden -Orcs -Coliman Rider -Elrond (It's not some hippie fairy in this one!) <br /> <br /> While Jackson version is better: <br /> <br /> -consa it covers the whole story - all visual and special effects -Gollum / Smeagol -Balrog -Hobbits <br /> <br /> Lord of the Rings by Ralph Bakshi, even with it's known known shortcomings, is one of the best animation films ever made and it captures the atmosphere of Tolkien's fantasy world very well, if not perfectly. I'll give it a score of 8Â½ out of 10.
