Hey guys I'm actually in this movie! I did not even know it was on this site until I looked a few years ago and I was amazed! I played Pete, the son's main character. It was a great experience and I loved every minute of it. While filming they needed me to be in two places at once, so they used my twin sister as a double body! The finger that pushes the radio button in the car is not it to me. I always act and do some TV, but not as much. Oh and if you want to prove my name is the first one at the top of the roll. <br /> <br /> Review: I thought the movie was okay but if I was not in it, it would not be one of my favorites. I thought the act was really good, but the story line was just that.
