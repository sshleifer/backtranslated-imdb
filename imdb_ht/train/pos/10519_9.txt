I'm a big fan of Jane Austen and besides being a feature-length film (a true fan wants to see as little to let out as possible and can only be achieved through a mini-set) it's really great. Gwyneth Paltrow really captures little clueless but well-intentioned girl's wealthy and Jeremy Northam is Mr. Knightly and pointed her and nobility. I was not thrilled with Ewan McGregor though I loved him as an actor but did not feel it spoiled the movie at all. As I said, as a fan of Jane Austen had something I would like to see included that was not but would have made it much longer than acceptable for a film film film and as it was I felt really included history well. I've seen all the adaptations in this book and felt this was the best one!
