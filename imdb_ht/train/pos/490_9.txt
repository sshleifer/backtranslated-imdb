Obsession comes in many tastes, and exists for a variety of purposes; For some it may be nothing more than a compulsive disorder, but for others it can be a future of survival. Lack of encouragement, combined with an inability to negotiate the simplest necessities of daily life or basic social conditions, can even strain an enthusiastic enthusiasm that provides a personal comfort zone. And in extreme cases, the object of this satisfaction can become a manifestation mania, driving people on to what has begun as a means of survival to become the very one of its ruins, and as we discover in the "Luzhin Defense," led by Marleen Gorris, a high level of intelligence will not ensure a satisfactory resolution of the problem, and in fact, can actually exacerbate the situation. Obsession, it seems, has no prejudice or preference; In addition, it provides no quarters. In an Italian resort in the 1920s, Alexander Luzhin (John Turturro) is one of many who seemed to have a chess competition, the winner of the World Champion. Luzhin is a master of the game, but he is vulnerable to that chess has long ceased to be a game of him; Instead, it is his obsession, one thing discovered in childhood that sees him his total uncertainty in seemingly all areas of life, and allows him to cope with the subtle franchisements of his immediate family. them. So, Luzhin is a genius with a Achilles heel, a defect that maybe only someone else knows about and understands, and besides achieving can be exploited for his own personal benefit in this very competition. This person is Valentinov (Stuart Wilson), former adviser to Luzhin, who after a brief absence in some years has suddenly been reappeared and made himself known in Luzhin. Valentinov is an unwelcomed presence, disturbing in Luzhin, and once again life threatens to beg him. Not only is it on the face of a horrible opponent of the tournament, Turati (Fabio Sartor), against people in a match before it appears with a draw after fourteen hours, but it is also trying to solve a new element of life She - her feelings for a young woman she just met at the resort, Natalia (Emily Watson). And, if it might be, black clouds gathered above him that just could push Luzhin even deeper into the mani that the grace was saved, as well as the curse, throughout his life. telling Luzhin's story, Gorris effectively uses the flashlights to evolve the elements of his childhood that very quickly lead to his mania and chess. And as its background is established, it allows the insights to allow the audience to more fully understand that Luzhin is and how he reached that point in his life. For the stage of his childhood, Gorris Textures with an appropriate dark atmosphere and a subtle sense of foreboding that brings on, and the foundation, the more pastoral environment of the resort. The transitions in which he draws the past and the present are nicely occupied, and with the Gorris pace sets it for a fixed, yet unrushed presentation that works very well. He also underplays threats produced by the presence of Valentinov, focusing on the drama rather than the suspense, which ultimately serves to increase the overall impact of the film, making Luzhin's tragic all the more credible and disturbing. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />. For this movie to work, Luzhin must be absolutely credible; One fake or feigned moment might be disastrous, as it would take the viewer out of the story immediately. It does not happen, however, with the film doing work, because the Luzhin Turturro creates is honest and true-to-life. It captures Luzhin's genius, as well as his inability, and presents his character in terms that are extremely hard to say. It is an equal performance, if it does not exceed, Geoffrey Rush's paintings at David Helfgott 'shine. 'But when you compare his work here with other characters he created, from South Lidz to' Unstrung Heroes' to Pete in `O Brother Where Are You? At Al Fountain at 'Moonlight Box,' you realize that an incredible Turturro ranks as an actor, and what a remarkable artist he really is. As Natalia, Emily Watson is excellent, as well, turns into a fairly reserved performance in which she develops and presents her character quite nicely. Even though she has to be somewhat outgoing related to Luzhin, Watson managed to make it in an intersecting way that is entirely effective. Most importantly, because of the details it brings to its performance, it makes its accelerated relationship with Luzhin credible and credible credibility of the story. You have but look at Watson's eyes to know that his feelings are transmitted real. It is a bit terrific to work in a talented and gifted actor. The cast in support includes Geraldine James (Vera), Christopher Thompson (Stassard), Peter Blythe (Ilya), Orla Brady (Anna), Mark Tandy (Father Luzhin), Kelly Hunter (Mother Luzhin a), Alexander Lachas (Young Luzhin) and Luigi Petrucci (Santucci). Well manufactured and delivered, the 'Luzhin Defense' is an emotional film that involves, featuring a restrained compassion that recalls a sense of sorrow and perhaps a reflection on human humanity. We do not need a movie, of course, tell us that there is wickedness in the world; but we are well served through the cinema when it reminds us of something we should not forget, as long as we all have the ability to effect positive changes, and make a difference in the lives of people around us. I miss this one 9/10. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
