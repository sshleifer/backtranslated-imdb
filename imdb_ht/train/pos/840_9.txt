Not sure what to expect from this movie. I love watching Brosnan in any movie, it's always good, but that's totally different. It's a mess, and playing being a very good mess. In fact, he reminded me of myself some time back to UNI :) So, there's not much violence, there's not much action, but the dialogue is cracking, the act is superb and very refreshing, and It's very funny too :) I do not think you're going to the movie will be "Wow! I've been blown away," but you'll smile have enjoyed a good movie. Can not ask for more. Oh, and if you're lucky, some morons will put the reels off wrong, and you'll get inverted, upside down, reverse (and reverse audio) ads !! Brilliant. There is nothing like watching a Jack Daniels announcement where the drink goes back to the bottle out of the mirror with an American gray "Twin Pics" comment :)
