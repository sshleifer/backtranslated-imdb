Always love it 17 or so years after the first time I saw it, in fact I discovered that I had lost that copy and it was very upset. Although it's non-associate and the original (which as a kid I've never noticed and as an adult I do not care about), this is what cartoons * should * like. Just black enough to be interesting and light enough to be enjoyed by everyone. I am more than happy that my parents raised me on this kind of thing rather than the drawing we see today that teach our kids nothing. The music is great and gets stuck in your head forever ... I've downloaded the band at one point or another.
