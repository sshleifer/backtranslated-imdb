First, I saw this film when I was about seven years and it was completely enchanted by it then but for years it could get to know what the movie was calling. Now I am twenty one and stumbled on the movie by accident about two weeks ago and bought a copy. Although my memory in the movie was a little vicious, I was in no way disappointed by what I saw. The animation of this movie is superb to conjure up an entire world that is so credible and so well animated that you are drawn to the movie by itself. But this movie also has a plot that will be charmed and amused with adults and children alike. with a floating island, a mad general, a grandma of friendly pirates and a well-loved love story constructed this movie will not let you down I would recommend this movie to any one.
