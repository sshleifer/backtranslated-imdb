Outrageous is very good movie! Robert Culp was very good at the movie and was perfect for the party! It's hard to believe this is a true story but what can you do? When I looked at what I thought, why should all of this be done? It is not good but to learn lessons when choosing the wrong man! Anyway, if you've ever seen this movie on television watch it because it's a good one!
