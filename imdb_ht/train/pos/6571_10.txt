<br /> <br /> The first thing I said is that I own Jake Speed. I've seen it at least 10 times. This movie is one of the most fun movies ever made. The movie begins with Margaret (Karen Kopins) trying to find her sister. His sister was kidnapped in Paris and the family did not hear anything. Together comes Jake Speed ​​(Wayne Crawford), telling exactly where she is and offering an offer to get her. Jake Speed ​​is a hero. It does not work for money because it just wants to help and have a good adventure. His partner (Dennis Christopher) follows her around and writes the adventures of novels. This movie is a great adventure. It's hilarious, it's action-packed, it's just great. I guess it's a movie movie with a following culture. Crawford is perfect as Jake speed and throws out some one-material that you will never forget. Kopins and Christopher are also adequate to the girl and the sidekick, respectively. John Hurt, the stomach guy blew up in aliens, plays the demonic, pervertish villian who just adds to the fun. In many ways, this film looks like Indiana Jones, in some ways it looks like James Bond movie. Perhaps it should have been named Indiana Bond but whatever it's titled is, it's a very enjoyable movie.
