I was amazingly impressed by this movie. It contains fundamental elements of depression, sorrow, loneliness, despair, hope, dreams and company. It was not merely a genius musician who hit under rock but it was about a man kept in grief trying to get drunk into his music. He finds a companion who comes up with his own problems. Claire and Desi were able to provide each other with friendship and love, but most importantly a conclusion of events that formed their lives for the worst. <br /> <br /> profiles are an easy character by today's standards of a rock star. But it has music genius. He also had an event in his past time that made him stagnate, while things around him literally went to ruin. His focus is to create his whale music, in fact he gets an obsession for him. Claire is the streetwise child who needs a place to stay. He found hidden talent while in the company. He also finds a mutual friend who accepts it. He learns to trust him over a long period of time. <br /> <br /> These two find love to each other. Do not mind the blowing gender, infused kind of passion, but a love where friendship and understanding mean more. For two people who have been hurt, they have faith together.
