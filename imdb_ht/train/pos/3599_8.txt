This movie is a real gem. The Arc of the scheme is defined in the first 3 minutes, the characters are sympathetic and clearly drawn, the motives are completely credible. The dialogue is cool, and oh so real. Situations are unique to their characters and not in every clich√© or ambiguity. Up to the highest point, that is. Then it's as if the movie went on the tracks a bit and it got a bit hokey and incredible. But I do not want to discourage people watching this movie. The first 3/4 of it is really remarkable. I gave it an 8. There are some remarkable performances here. Check out this movie.
