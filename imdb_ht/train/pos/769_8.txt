In all of the breakdancing / hip-hop films released between 1983 and 1986, the film 1984 Beat Street is definitely the best one. The story follows a DJ, his little brother's brother, a graffiti artist and a showbiz promising wanna of a winter in which they try to break out of the ghetto using the "street" talent. The act is not always up to date and the characters are not completely drawn out, but they are more than compensated for by down-to-earth dialogues, a possible story, fantastic dance sequences and a timeless sound hip-hop sound. It should be noted that this film was shot in the crib at Breakdancing ("This is Not New York, this is the Bronx!"), And features emergence by the ancestors of breaks, dance steady Rock Steady Crew and rapper Africa Bambaata. Rock Steady Crew gives the best stage of the movie by dominating a dance battle at the club credited premiere at the early 80's, Roxy. A must see for hip-hop lovers.
