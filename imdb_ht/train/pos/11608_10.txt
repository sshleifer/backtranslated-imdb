This is a great movie. From reading other reviews, I can see that I'm not the only one who shakes a water. Tamilyn Tomita acts with such skills and conviction, he has made end of heart and memorable. In the hands of a younger actress, her last scene would have seemed trite and blown. One would never guess this movie has been done on a tight, limited budget. The cinematography is gorgeous and has a number of great name actors. The script is so beautiful, I can see why they all wanted to do it. If you look long, long list of credit in the end, you'll see that half of Hawaii camped in making this film happen, and for good reason. The soundtrack (available on CD) is absolutely beautiful and puts the mood around the movie. I only "complain" is that I almost did not want the movie to end.
