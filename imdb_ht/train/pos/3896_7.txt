Some people liked the "Aristocrats" and others hated it, often walking from among them. Reactions to Eddie Izzard are not likely to be that extreme - if you can handle a transvestite comedy (saying that she likes girls) and has a vocabulary that we will say, enough to use "f" word which program it should be one steep time if presented on TV networks. Many Izzard fans are so devotees that they do not see any such defects in his performance. On the other hand, I thought this show was occasionally flatter than Izzard's chest, but also more often than not funny, and, in spite, absolutely hilarious. It has a way to connect referrals to early routine in the later routine show. It's not a story teller. It's not a joke maker. It's not a frenetic fantasy like Robin Williams. He plays around with ideas, some of which work with some of them - a routine with the San Francisco cable car and Alcatraz, for example - are completely unfunny. It has a way, however, in moving gracefully past the routines flopped and extended to those connected. I have given this performance a 7 and would be able to raise it to an 8. but a 10? There is no way.
