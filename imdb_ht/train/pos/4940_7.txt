This film is about human relationships. Charming, funny, and well written, with meaningful text. It seems that Morgan Freeman surely delights in the series. Also good music. Vega is a beautiful and smart woman. I really like to act. Women like it are a good motivation for learning Spanish. From the moment Morgan Freeman meets the beautiful Vegas Vegas view of taking on an intimate journey with two foreign learners about where life was headed. 10 Articles or Less is about life in life. If you enjoy this movie also see the pursuit of happiness with Will Smith and his son. It's not an action movie or a nude comedy. It's all about human relationships.
