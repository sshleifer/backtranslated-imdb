In NYC, Michael O'Hara (Orson Welles) sailors Deliver Elsa Bannister (Rita Hayworth) from a mugging & rape as she takes a horse & chariot at Central Park - and she lives to regret it. Titian-Haired Hayworth is a blonde platinum in this one; as dazzling as cool-fall snow - but nowhere near as much ... <br /> <br /> To reveal any more of the complicated scheme of this foundation "noir" would be criminal. It's as deceptive as mirrors used in cataclysmic effects of the final scenes - but the film holds darkest secrets: From NY Times: "Childhood Longe: The Hidden History of the Black Dahlia Murder" by Mari Pacios "Mari Pacios who was 5 years old when he was befriended by 15-year-old Bette Short, short steps back, friends interviews and associates. He also offered a detailed, speculative, analysis of Orson Welles - particularly in regard to his film "The Lady From Shanghai." According to Mrs. Pacios, the film, along with archival materials related, there are many of the same ritualistic elements associated with the short murder. It raises the question: Was Welles being the killer? "Interesting theories - and spate of books now out on the" Black Dahlia ", much more can come to light. Fritz Lang's brutal film "Noir Movie", "The Big Heat" (1953), was a novel-a-nail say in the "Dahlia" killed in the "City of Nets" that was LA - but it Opus's Orson which "Dahlia" has a "hands-on" connection on. In fact, it was Bugsy Siegel (and the Hollywood mob wars in the 1940s) that made the "Dahlia" in ... but that did not negate much of what wrote in writing. Nearly all Hollywood intersects with Elizabeth (the "Dahlia Black") Short and read stories / Aura / heritage / cursed cod in a number of Golden Golden films. "Dahlia Black" was still on the peripheral edges of "Shanghai" -and before it started filming. Barbara Payton on Franchot Tone: "It was when she thought about doing" Lady in Shanghai "before she lost the option to Orson Welles. Franchot said she would have been in a bad state about that deal when she ran to Dahlia in the Formosa Cafe * in all the Goldwyn studios ... "* The highest floor of the Formosa Cafe was the Bugsy Siegel office and" Dahlia "one of her over again / over again working" girls ". <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> After getting into 1951 on Barbara Payton between Tom Neal and Franchot Tone who sent Franchot to the hospital with a concussion and "never talk the same way again , "Barbara said he married Tone just after Neal." Tom ("Detour") Neal also knew the "Dahlia" (who did not?) And became obsessed- From "Desperated" by John Gilmore : "The January 1947 murder of young, beautiful actress should be actress Elizabeth Short, the so-called" Dahlia Black ", was one of the most grisly crime in modern crime. A project called" Who who killed Dahlia Black? "being kicked by actor Tom Neal, a fierce hell of WW II cinema. Potential producer Gene Harris:" Someone will have to come up with a more imaginative business proposal than was presented by Tom Neal and his cohort ... "Not long after:" It would be very clear one beautiful day to come when Tom would sneak up on the beautiful new Palm Springs wife as he lay on the sofa and shot a bullet .45 li. "Barbara Payton and Norma Jean Dougherty (later Marilyn Monroe) knew the" Dahlia "and the stories are well-known. It looks like everyone who crosses the road to the" Dahlia "(like the black cat proverb) entered a "Twilight Zone" darkness and / or has an incredible string of bad luck after that. Tone / Neal / Welles are just a few - and this includes a butcher film called "Lady of Shanghai" ... <br /> <br /> "Lady from Shanghai" took two years to be released, thanks to re-dumping - and all because Columbia president Harry Cohn could not understand the story. It's black "noir" to be sure "It's also a bad satire on life in the new atomic." <br /> <br /> Nicolas Christopher: "Shanghai" pushed out a stressful subtext of nuclear apocalypse and has statements The definitive noise of the atomic bombs and the American city. Victims of the film director of murder (and there are many), a psychotic and double-dealing attorney, manically proving Armageddon in each Turns, claiming that he can "feel it." He announced that he plans to rescue from a Pacific island-a mostly acidic joke on Welles's party since this year the many US have started testing atomic bombs in just such a where the bikini athlete, moves all the inhabitants and destroys ecosystems. Since bikini, Hayworth's erotic identification and the bomb seem to have been institutional, with the blessing of the military bronze; The first bomb dropped to the Pacific testing of named "Gilda" and has Hayworth's image, in provocative clothes, painted directly on her box ... "<br /> <br /> Its unreliable big Orson interpretation Welles 'of an Irishman who is considered a detriment in the film by many Welles is giving a sign of viewers that "Michael O'Hara" is only telling the story - not part of the story even though it revolves around it. "O' Hara "contradicts the motto shark in the whole movie.Rak on a food frenzy will not stop until nothing left." Michael O'Hara "lives telling the story." Elsa Bannister "causes a food craze during" O 'trial " The Hara "and the complete escapade suggests that it was parched as such by devastating the human viewers of a Coleseum Women. The spectators are on a frenzy meal, gossip and carry on on" Elsa "- the correlation of the aquarium sequence The marine San Francisco marine is the human condition ... except for "Michael O'Hara" but he will spend his life trying to forget his past ("E lsa ") - or die trying. "Elsa" is part of "Michael" and the story feeds its own to the end and the viewer warns them to stay out of trouble.
