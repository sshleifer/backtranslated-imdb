A meteor drops from the sky and reawakens a plesiosaur that has long been used to terrorizing the area around Crater Lake. As the monster eats the locals to try and get away to kill the monster. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />! It's the movie sort that those films paraphrase and send just this is the real deal. All these movies try only and out the tongue in a cheek and its more fun because of it. This is a real-driven drive of the movie which has the odd chance to come as Star Wars changed the way we look at special effects. The Monster, a mix of suspended movements and a head of life size, is a funny little chic animal. Cinemas spoiled the audience and shots often in the monster and its destruction. Make sure you read it all fake, but not film about the suspension of disbelief? Actually I think it's really cool monsters, what's there. I love this movie in a low budget drive in sort of a way. If you want a real authentic drive in monster movie look no further. This would be perfect for a double or triple feature and similar movie monster movie (Boggy Creek etc.)
