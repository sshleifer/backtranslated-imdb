This, along with "tonic hare," ranks as one of the best cartoons cartoons, indeed one of the best bugs, ever. There are some comments on how bugs in these cartoons are "basic," ie, I guess, that it is not yet fully developed. I actually prefer this "basic" version from the mid-40s (Chuck Jones' was the best version) that is actually more rugged-even far more fun than eventually the long version that shades on Yosemite Sam and Duck Daffy. The day-to-day letters have become too suave and sophisticated for my liking. Also check out "Hair Hare Hire" (1946) and Rabbit Rabbit (1948) for example classic classic and classic Chuck Jones bugs.
