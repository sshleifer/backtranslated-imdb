I have to point out, before reading this review, which in no way, is this a statement against Iranian people ... if you really want to read something in it, than hopefully you see, that I am against politicians in general ... but if you're looking to offend ... I can not help you! <br /> It is not in Iran as this prohibited film has (see IMDb Trivia for this movie). That is a shame, because the movie is great. It should not be for "Grbavica", this film was at the International Film Festival in Berlin. <br /> <br /> Justice is so (it was the runner-up, or second place if you will). Why? Because it is an asthma film. It's not that this is a complete woman problem. It is about the government trying to keep the people down. An analogy so clear that the government felt the need to ban the film. But do not forbid it is nothing to solve and / or to make this movie disappear! <br /> <br /> Another review had a huge resume line: "Comedy on a Tragedy", how much it got up very well!
