This brief was nominated for awards Academy and I wish it won! Basically a confrontation session filmed between some talented musicians, including Lester Young and Joe Jones, the music is incredible! Hollywood quite often embraced jazz (particularly animation, believing it or not) but this is a rare look on the movie of a improvisation jam. This was added to the Film Preservation List and deserve this. TCM runs this as occasionally filler and runs it every March sometime for its "31 Day at Oscar" tribute. From downtown to the season, swish, nothing but the shot is so smooth, the barely barely move. Most solidly and highly recommended !!!
