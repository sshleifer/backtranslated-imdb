Miss DeCarlo's first start having everything the writers could come up with - from the Franco-Prussian war to the U.S. Civil War, the great American West, San Francisco in his great glamor, ballet, opera, vaudeville, bandits coach stage, and a Chinese junk. Just when you thought the plot could not find any vendor, he did. It's nice, take the tongue in a cheek. DeCarlo's character (here named Anna Marie - PA Salome, is his role dancing) is the wound-based wound career in the notorious Lola Montez, who was the king's mistress of prisons and caused a revolution when he gave him the jewels crown. He escaped to the western American. There is a city in Arizona called "Salome, where it dances," based on the historical fact that Lola Montez has done the dance of Salome. StageCoach Cleverly with great Russian state that falls under its charms is not historically accurate, nor I suppose that Chinese are wise and accentuates in Scottish - but it is one of my favorite all classical class time with DeCarlo is breathtakingly beautiful in all.
