This movie awed me so much that I watched it at least once a year. Sometimes I find it uncomfortable. Sometimes I find it abusive. And I still find the characters and real. It's a movie that shows you the frustrating fact of life in LA, starting with the lightweight research helicopter search scan for the dungeon dangers so close to the ordinary lives being carried on by the characters. It is also a movie that shows you how dear to a stranger can change your life and allow you to make a difference. Grand Canyon reminds you that every action you take, if intended or not, has powerful impact. I found this movie to be similar in the many ways to Robert Altman's Short Cut film. Both have a star star list of perfectly cast actors and actresses with both movies allowing you gradually to see how the characters are interrelated with each other and affect each other, for better or worse. Grand Canyon has done a better job in giving a message, hopefully in the face of desperate reality, than the Altman movie, although I found them both intriguing in their own way. This movie is a definite must see !!!
