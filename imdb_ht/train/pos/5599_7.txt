This was the second time I watched the movie (via the French-language version as opposed to the first, armed in Italian) and I felt that it improved on subsequent subsequent ones. <br /> A convincing if quietly building the Stage of this study, the beautiful injections and the Parisian settings were equally impressive. In the long run, it's not Polanski self-class and I would classify it at number 9 in his filmography, but it's still a confidence blend of subtle thrills and, amazing, often great comedy. It also features a fine cast, all of which are in good shape, but especially Isabelle Adjani, Melvyn Douglas and Jo Van Fleet. <br /> Even so, I'm a bit bewildered by the sudden strain of Trelkovsky 'changing' of the previous tenant; Apart from the ownership of the apartment bar, opposite the apartment building, where it was provided by Simone was without asking if he wanted any different, there was little indication (as far as I could discover, anyway ) that this is what everyone wanted it! Well, so she found things Simone still lying in the apartment but what exactly drove her to wear her dress and make herself as she (though she apparently started doing this unknowingly)? Following his nightmare vision in the bathroom, the latest section of the movie (where Adjinya all but disappeared) is almost anti-climate - especially the scene where the owner and other tenants witness his suicide attempts as if it was a night of The Opera, a concert that has already been used 46 years earlier by Jean Cocteau in a POET (1930)! The finish, then, is at once predictable and unresolved: just what made the occupants of this particular apartment jumping from the window ?!; I remember this factor bugging me on first look as well, and I'm sorry to say it's not clear now! Remember, the first two-thirds of the film are very solid but I wish Polanski was less dependent on the dotting point of darkness at all.
