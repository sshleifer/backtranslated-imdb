Samuel Fuller's Pickup on South Street is anomalous: A "smart hurt" movie that devoid of hysteria, in which the communist threat is nothing more than the McGuffin that ignores the plot. Pickpocket Richard Widmark delivers women who release Jean Peters in his wallet with a microfilm strip; unknown to one of them, it's vital secret port of the Cold War. Peters, as happened, was under surveillance by FBI-like agent nonplussed by the flight as the man who runs him, comic commander Richard Kiley. In attempting to retrieve the precious film, both are engaged in the help of Thelma Ritter, a giant streetwise old man who is still on the ear and wants to sell what he hears. Fuller draws from an opulent palette of tempos and tonality into the storytelling, which becomes a race against the clock in scrambling brutality. From the subways of the waterfront, his midsummer Manhattan takes on a sheen sweaty that's almost sting. The love scenes between Peters and Widmark have become an unstable mix of tumultuous and tangible, and they will score in "Again," a song introduced by Ida Lupino at Road House, also begins to Widmark. Little slackens for the very beautiful writing and playing Ritter's death scene - among the most poignant puppets of all the noirs, and a miracle-oasis kind of a parched film of sentimentality. This is only the Fuller's writer / director only in the strict limits of the noir sugar; His later exploration of the American pathology (Kimono's Crimson, the Naked Kiss, USU midfielder) is never in a synthesis as meeting as Ramase on South Street.
