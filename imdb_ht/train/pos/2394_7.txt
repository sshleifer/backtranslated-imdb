Nice, beautiful, and funny, but not earth-breaking. He does a great job of showing "behind scenes" the world of theater groups and the lives of the actors. Three large witches - both on-and off-stage. I would assume the film works beautifully (many of the apparent jokes inside) if one participated in the theater (which is not).
