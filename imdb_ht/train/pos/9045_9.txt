There is a bit of trivia that should be pointed out on an early stage in the movie where Homer is watching the attempt at December 6, 1957 (at least that video was used on the television he watched) that showed the launch attempt Vangard, who fails. <br /> It is next to show reading or dictating a letter to Dr. From Braun offers condolences to the failure. <br /> <br /> From Braun was at Marshall Center Flight Center in Huntsville working for the Army. The Vanguard project was not Nasa's early team of what was soon to become Space Goddard flight center. <br /> <br /> The Army runs Jupiter C, which was essentially a US made V2 technology, but worked to launch a satellite in response to Russia's success with Sputnik. <br /> <br /> This error can actually be done by Homer, because of the notoriety of Von Braun, but his team did not have the attempts to fail. In fact, the Redstone signed has jumped out of 52 and was the first U.S. rated recipient, used for the Shepard suburb flight, as well as the Grissom. <br /> <br /> This is why this sort of movie is so good, as it hopes to inspire people for it and attach those bits to trivia, and in the process to see what was done and to be inspired to do more.
