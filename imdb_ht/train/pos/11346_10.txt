I grew up with H.R. Pufnstuff and the alleged talent Jack Wild and now my daughters are worshiping fans of Jack Wild too. This movie is exactly what movies should be: fun and fun. This movie is not limited to children either. A lot of the dialogue is directed to adults and Witchiepoo's performance is something you do not want to miss. The music in this movie suited Jack Wild and Mama Cass very well. And as a Jack Jack fan, I would never miss the chance to watch him dance or hear him sing. Knowing the hard life that Jack has made this movie even more wonderful especially when he sings the opening song "If I Could". She makes me stand up in love for her to give me my wonderful memories now over to my children. Let's go to Living Island where there is friendship and pleasure! And keep Jack Wild's memory alive by passing Pufnstuff on to others.
