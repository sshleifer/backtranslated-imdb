I love to watch this movie so much because of all the scenes scary about the raptors. I like the reminders because they are scared. My favorite part is the ones where the raptor looks like the pole because it reminds me of a scene on Friday 13th film and the girl who eats the banana. <br /> <br /> I really like watching a lot of this movie because the computer graphics looks like a small fake but it's okay because once you get into the movie you hardly even notice what's going on and I think She had a good finish though I did not really understand what was going on about my first couple looking at her out on time and that is the important part. The vital part is how scary the dinosaurs can be if you watch it first time. <br /> <br /> This is the best movie.
