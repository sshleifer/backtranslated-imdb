Just right is a movie but decently held together by strong performance and some creative (though extremely predictable) writing. Sean Connery is an anti-death penalty crusader brought in to save a seemingly innocent young black man (Blair Underwood) from the final penalty. To put things right, Connery's initiative in the scene of the crime, where he must fight not only with the passage of time, but a sedentary meddling (Laurence Fishbourne). Torsion and spin and roller reversing are many - some surprising, some not - as the aging crisis try to unravel the mystery. Finishing the climate is a bit funny, but JIS reasons are worth a look on a slow night.
