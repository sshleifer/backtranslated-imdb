When I first saw this film, I thought it was typical "love your neighbor" thing .... The more movie went on, the more I participated. Acting is magnificent in both actors, great direction, the amazing story. Cry my eyes on, first time in my life for a movie. A real must have in any serious videotape. 11 out of 10
