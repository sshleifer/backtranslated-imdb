I just saw this film @ TIFF (Toronto International Film Festival). Fans of Hal Hartley will not be disappointed !! But if you're not familiar with this director's work ... no matter. This movie can definitely stand all on its own. I have to go through second screening ... it was amazing I need to see it again - and soon! <br /> <br /> This movie is very funny. It's very clever dialogue, and the performance of Parker Posey is outstanding as it stars in the title role of Grim Fail. Grim Grim is the latest feature review of the world and the characters introduced by Henry the Fool film (2000). Visually, the most characteristic feature stylist staff utilizes the usual canted (or dutch) angle, which can often be seen in Hartley's past working out of various shorts, available in film possible: short work by Hal Hartley 1994 -2004 collection, and at the girl from Monday (2005). <br /> I see this movie unequivocally at Sept 11th. Typically, Fay Grim's adventure in this story is backdropped against the world changed after September 11, 2001. Without going to major looting, I saw this work, and history-world as a political portrait and original crown of political Geo policy that is rarely, ever, separated from the fictional post-911 fictional films now (see Syrianna: at the side mark - Mark Cuban Exec.) The prod by both the most exciting films, they say at least). <br /> <br /> Finally, for those well-attached to the characters of Henry Crazy, Simone, Fay and Henry film this hilariously self-conscious and self-referential. That being said, the character of Fay Grimm starts off in the movie, exactly where it was when Henry crazy ended, but at the end of the movie ... Knowledge and experience The fault has total change and expand over the narrative course . What can be in store for the future of fault and the crazy family ..... I can not wait for the third part of this story!
