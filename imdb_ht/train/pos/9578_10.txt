As others have been mentioned, all the women who go naked in this movie are mostly absolutely gorgeous. The plot very abolished shows the hypocrisy of the female libido. When men are around wanting to be prosecuted, but when there are no "men" around them, they are prosecuted by a 14-year-old boy. And the boy becomes a really fast man (we all should be so lucky at this age!). Then he gets the courage to pursue his true love.
