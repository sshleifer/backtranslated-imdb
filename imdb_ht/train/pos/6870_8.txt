From start to finish, I laugh really hard throughout the entire movie. It's amazing that the "Groove Tube" is perhaps the granddaddy, yet raunchiest, in all comedic udiz cinemas. This is the way I like watching TV without bored of flipping channels only suffering from insomnia! For 73 minutes, weird, the weird humor never ceases! Just think of how all this street nonsense can help you enjoy life easier! It's way, way better than Central Comedy or anytime prime time! Make yourself a favor and rubbish all soft-lover, romantic comedy romantic lover in the trash! Better yet, say your box office manager wants the "Groove Tube" back on the big screen!
