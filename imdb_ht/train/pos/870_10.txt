"It's my mouth (about mes l√®vres)" (which probably has different resonance idiomat in its French title) is a diligent, contemporary twisty story of office politics that unexpectedly becomes a crime criminals as the characters most acclaimed slip up and down an ethical and sensual slip slope. <br /> <br /> The two magnetic drives, Emmanuelle Devos (who I have never seen before long resume in French movie) and an even more clutter than usual Vincent Cassel (who brought a sexy and / or menacing watch and voice in some US films). <br /> <br /> The first half of the movie is on its turf in a competitive real estate office and it is the neophyte. The second half is on its territory as a former con with its wrenching adaptation of that. <br /> <br /> Writer / director Jacques Audiard is very clever to use women's inscriptions to insulate women as an entry for us in his perception, to remember the sound up and down to hear how he (so even more annoying than usual when the public speaker), using visual as sensory reactors too. None of the characters act as anticipated (it is not like sweet victims from "In The Male Company," not in individual interactions, not in the scene, and not in the overall arch of the unpredictable story line (well, until the last shot, but the hearing was waiting for this progress) as we moved from a modern office to hustle, to a dislike of romantic hustle and criminal pole-outs. There is a side story that's being themed redundant and unnecessary, but that's just to give us a few minutes to catch our breath.% This is one of my favorites of the year! <br / > <br /> (originally written 7/28/2002)
