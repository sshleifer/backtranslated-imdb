Other commentators have outlined the scheme and social parables and books as well (or better) that I could, but I would like to join in my admiration for this little jewel in a movie. It holds pretty well more than 50 years later in each category - screenplay, acting, photography, set design, sound design ... it really is a classic of kind. This was my first exposure to the "young" Alec Guinness, and obviously from the first boards that made him so special as eventually getting a knighthood. I only miss it's "8" because it's essentially a lightweight light parable that examines human nature, but it does not really skewer it; and because the scheme takes easy steps from the end, rather than actually resolving conflicts between the inventor and the mill workers and industrialists who are chasing him around the city. Also, a couple minutes of thinking reveal the basic flaw of the logic of the scenario - wear and tear is hardly ever the factor to determine whether to buy new clothes (especially clothes); children grow, change size, get and lose weight, and go with the latest fashion all the time, and they have as long as the woven woven cloth. But if there is nothing else, the manufacturer would make a fortune to provide indestructible materials for military uniforms (especially BDUs). <br /> Still, this is a great movie. If you find a chance to see it on a classic movie channel, you should.
