This is, in my opinion, better than one of the 1990's versions, but is still not all that good. It feels that date, probably because it is, but it stands well compared to 1980's BBC period as Mansfield Park and Northanger Abbey. This adaptation length allows for a better adaptation of the Book than one of the versions 2 to 90, and St. John Rivers is at least covered, although not very well. Timothy Dalton is a good thing like Rochester, but Jane's actress plays much too old. There is definitely scope for a television adaptation of this length of more than one tenner spent on it.
