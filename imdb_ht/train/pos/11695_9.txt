This is like a big movie! Never miss the bar rating here. I really have no idea where that came from, they have to discuss a different movie then. Because I absolutely love her, she finds it to be a little hidden treasure. <br /> It's history has been so original and spacious .. I really can not think of anything bad about it. Maybe she has to be 'what kind of thing you', but I saw this with my sister and my mother, and we all took it. <br /> <br /> The act was also very good, and that's hard to do in a movie like this. But I found all the characters very intriguing and sympathetic. I have always been very fond of Dougray Scott and found his new 'dark' role very interesting. It is really hard to get me to love a bad guy, but I absolutely did not have any problems with this time. Even more so, I worship him. <br /> Everyone who loves a good drama / drama that also has a good dose of love and tragedy should definitely go see this movie, there is no question about that! Anyone who wants to see a movie with 80% blood flow, should go somewhere else, though .. But I guess the title is already kind of giving it away. This is a love story, not seen 3. <br /> I give this movie 4 out of five stars !!! Good job !!! <br /> <br /> xxx Enjoy!
