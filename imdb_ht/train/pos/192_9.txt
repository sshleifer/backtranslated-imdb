Before seeing People Show, my impression of silent comedy was essentially slapstick, and slapstick only. I could not imagine how comedy screen might be possible without relying on spoken word or much prataps. But this mastery movie hurts me. Davies, in my view, was probably the greatest comedy actress coming along before Lucille's ball. I mentioned Lucy firstly because the Davies and Facial expressions reminded me of the point that I wonder if Davies was not one of the main influences of the ball. This will come from a 21 year old who has never seen comedy silently, and I must say that no matter how many of the specific periods you actually find (I did not, usually), you do not will be bored by this movie. You will probably even laugh more than you would at most fantastic comedies. This is not just my favorite comedy comedy, but easy among my ten favorite comedy of all time.
