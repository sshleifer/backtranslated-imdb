I liked this episode. It's so great that all 5 of them team up and stop LutherCorp and save the world. I love this episode because Kyle Gallner (Bart Allen / Impulse) and Justin Hartley (Oliver Queen / Green Arrow) are invited to start at it !!! I just hope that Clark will join the Justice League and we'll get to follow this group of heroes across the globe !! =) It's really interesting and keeps interested viewers what will happen next. I think Chloe should also enter the ticket as a ticket, which might be such a coool to do besides the planet everyday because it does not have super powers. Also, I want to know what kind of subject Lex is going to be used for 33.1, I wonder which other power of others in the world is there !!!
