This movie keeps me surprise. My friend told me that this movie was a "flick chick." Boy, it was wrong! This movie has a great family calling, which does not have sex scenes such as _other_ movies. Jake Gyllenhaal does a great job at Hickam Hickam shoes. Thrust in support is great, as well. <br /> <br /> Science, coming-of-age, family difficulties, a great train scene ... This movie has it all. The soundtrack is good, although the score is presented quite choppily. The 50s music kicks off the movie on the edge of greatness. The DVD is definitely worth it to squeeze into charcoal. Value replenishment is great - I've seen it quite a few times already.
