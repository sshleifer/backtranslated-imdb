This movie has a cast all stars, John Candy, Richard Lewis, Ornella Mutti, Cybill Shepard, and Jim Belushi for a few names, running amuck at Monte Carlo, as well as some other European beauties, and it's very funny. The problem that everyone comes to when they lie to protect themselves is great, and I highly recommend that you see this movie, it is well worth it! John Candy is in top shape at once on a crime, as is everyone else! If you and your family are looking for a great family movie, this is your ticket. Everyone has great performances, great acting, great comedy, and great distribution, which is rare in movies these days. Great draw, great mystery, (which I love anyways) and in general, well worth the money you spend on it. So get the kids, grab some popcorn, juice, or tea, or soda, and enjoy the show !!!!
