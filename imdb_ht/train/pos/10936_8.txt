Most 70s (and 80s) Kong Kong movie martial arts barely operate as movies; Generally there are a few well-planned battle sequences, but the draw is very thin to fill in the gaps between these nodes - like porn movie, really. <br /> But this one does many things well. Most openly, there is the direction and choreography, which limits every fighters to a 'style' - it's really based on Chinese acrobatics and comedy theater, but the working effect. <br /> <br /> Second, there are languages ​​in the camera, which uses some impressive techniques (even by today's measurements), changing projection speeds from real time to slow motion, and from unfiltered filter inputs to describe directional direction in the direction of sot past or toward the future. <br /> The least open, but most powerful and unexpected, is the construction. The winner of this competition is determined by the 'unfolding' story. The master (the writer) sets up a game where the lead character does not know who he is looking for, which is the same situation we viewers find ourselves in. One by one, he figure out who at the same rhythm we get out who is who. It all follows a tragedy / noir arc. The finish tends toward Irony, the "Sting". Many ideas are more than what we usually get out of this genre. <br /> <br /> The five venoms idea is the model for the Tarantino's bloodthirsty assassin from the merchants "Kill Bill".
