This is my favorite movie ever. I watched it at least 10 times and I cried every time. My family made me do not look at her so I did not have a weeping fit. I think I love that it is a true story written by Admits Himself just as much as I love the movie. Acting is toothache, and the actors were perfect for their role. Denzel Washington is one of my favorite actors. But this is my favorite movie he did so far. I was caring for a boy who was also in prison. It was the most precious boy I had ever encountered. He was now adopted by a wonderful family who fought for him for almost two years. I saw this movie while the battle was still going on and its future was over and I am so happy it is safe and loved. And I'm so happy to be happy and get his family. <br /> I would like to know more about him and how he has since his family meeting. I just cant say enough good thing about it !!
