I think the context of the story has been covered by other posters so I would just like to write about the impact of this film on me. <br /> I first saw this movie the year of its release around 1987. My school is organizing a trip to the movie to see it, for a RE project I think. We all went out excited because we were on a school trip to the cinema! Little we knew what we were about to experiment. At that day I always remember the feelings he invoked in me and I remembered to cry so much as they were most of my friends. I think at the age we have found it shocking and quiet reasons outraged in our youthful own ways .He has such an impact on me for me alongside the Anti Apartheid Movement of the same year. <br /> I think he has served his purpose in my case.
