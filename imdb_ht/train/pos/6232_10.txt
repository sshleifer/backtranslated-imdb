One of the best of Fred Astaire's and Giner Rogers movie. Great music by Irving Berlin. Solid support from Randolph Scott, Harriet Nelson, Lucille Ball, Betty Grable, Frank Jenks, and Astrid Allwyn. <br /> <br /> The lyrics include "let yourself go," "Let's face the music," and "Put all the eggs in a basket." The latest song is introduced by Astaire playing a jazz and piano piano. That's a nice dance with Rogers. Rogers also sings "let yourself go" with Grable among the backup musicians. Harriet Nelson (then Hilliard) sings two beautiful songs and plays Rogers' soft sisters. "Get You Behind Me" is a song that sticks with you for days. He also sings, "Where are you from?" Snappy and fast paced, this entry in the Astaire-Rogers series is one of the best ones. The classic and amazing final fantasy, "Let's face the music and dance" is among the best-known of the numbers. Rogers puts one of the rugs in movie history .... a chanting bright number that swirls around her legs as it dances (her bosom) and also a little to see in. Just gorgeous. This is the number that Steve Martin and Bernadette Peters re-created in pennies from the sky. Randolph Scott looks like an odd choice like Astaire's pal, but it also looks at Roberta and Irene Dunne. Luckily he does not try to sing or dance. It seems that Grable and Ball would have been the largest part of 1936 but they have a few scenes and make little impact. Allwyn has the biggest role but only OK. Rogers has one of her best solo numbers in the series and "Let Yourself Go" .... Jazzy and Upstream, it's a great song. /> <br /> Fun all the way, although I got tired of "We joined the Marin" after the third time.
