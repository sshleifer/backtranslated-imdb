I watch the show 10 years ago and love it !!! I'm currently in possession of the DVD and watched the series, and waiting for the scene I knew was in the show (when Lucas encountered Gail at his house) and realized he was missing - all of a sudden I looked at the seduction without the lead up. Then I went on the lines to check out all the biographies of the stars and came across the comments on the shows that they were out of order. Thanks !!!!! But there are some conflicts. Some comment states "Strangler number 19 then Triangle 20, when another was there in the other way.Also potato boy 5, and the World's Dead 6, were reversed as well .. Can someone clarify ?????
