I know I know it was a good finish but sincerely it was awesome. I love when a movie ends on a terrific black nature but this time I was impressed with Darth Vader turning against the Emperor I really was amazed. The bitter episode of this film was when Luke tortured and defeated by the Emperor / Darth Sidious. It is about to be destroyed when Darth Vader, Lord Black in the Sith, eliminates his black master. A beautiful sacrifice. Movies in this movie are impressive. I was amazed at all Rebel Boat Boats and Imperial War Pirates and Super Star Destroyers. I liked the new race being brought on Mon Calomari's screen, the eukos, sullesteian (CO Lando's pilots) and many more ... Most of my favorite scenes in that movie: 1-When Vader Destroy Emperor and is deadly wounded. 2- When Luke sees the demons of Obi-Wan and Yoda and then shows Anakin Skywalker (Sebastian Shaw) (the greatest stage of Star Wars) 3- When Leia slay Jabba sprawling the Hutt crime master. /> I personally like the script and the Battle of Endor presents a ground and combat space as well as the best duel of Star Wars between Darth Vader vs. Luke Skywalker on Star Death. Post-script: scenes with Leia in bikini in the memorable slaves. 9/10.
