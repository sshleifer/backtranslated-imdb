I saw this movie in the premiere of the Imagina Festival in Monaco. <br /> I saw the trailer first four years ago, and at the moment, I was waiting to see the final result. I was not disappointed. <br /> It's a full 3D movie with a great black and white contrasting render. Clearly inspired by some comic books, such as those from F. Miller. In this scanning, it goes one step beyond the excellent "City Sin" adaptation from R. Rodriguez. This time, (almost) no gray or any color, but a graphic style has never seen before in an animated movie (can not wait for dangerous scanners) <br /> <br /> The massive use of capture Movement provides a lot of life and credibility of the characters and we really forget the soon aspect of the techniques to focus on more classic elements, such as direction or draw. The direction remains moderate and controlled despite the infinite possibilities of the medium, and that is a really good surprise. The futuristic story (Paris 2053) makes it a classic sci-fiction movie and holds the viewer interested in the end. Despite a classic base trail (an investigation that goes beyond hope expectations) the atmosphere and some exciting recurring themes (genetics, absolute power of certain companies ...) give this movie a great interest. it is an animated movie, this one is obviously not made for the kids. You will not find here any funny pets or any moral family stupid, only the cold reality. It is far closer to a good noir movie. <br /> I found that the environment is one of the best aspects of the film: we always feel Paris well known, but it is morphed by a beautiful touch of futurism. <br /> But I'm sorry a few errors. The assembly is sometimes somewhat flat, one or two highly moving motion motion movements and some poor dialogues. Even though the technique is excellent, it shows its boundaries in some romantic sequences (somewhat like "final fantasy"). These little people make it a 7/10. <br /> <br /> All along, it is an artistic success challenge that you have to look if you can. The director, Christian Volckman, knows how not to fall into potential traps (likely, did not ask Jan Woo to do the job!). <br /> <br /> To conclude, it's a visual and visual explosive, a smart story and a wonderful art direction. Watch it if you can! <br /> Please excuse me for the spelling mistake.
