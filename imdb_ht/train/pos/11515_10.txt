It has been many years since I saw it, but I feel obliged to defend this sentence against his sheep. <br /> It is interesting and weird to observe the diversity of views here. That's the humor I suppose. It is subjective. It's either packed into your comic bone in 60,000 flights or leaves you cold and asks why you gave it the time. <br /> <br /> This show has some of the British British actors comic to put together in a story that is funny and irreverent and the result is hilarious. The dialogue and visual comedy are very well released and the conduct (Cleese and Lowe) are superb together. This was done for them. <br /> I can not really say yet other than asking you to get this and watch it. You will not be ashamed of in a devoid world of genteel humor, this is a classic unrivaled and harmonious piece of glamorous comedy.
