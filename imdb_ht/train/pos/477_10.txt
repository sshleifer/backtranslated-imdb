Hi all I am a chess enthusiast since the age of 6. I was supposed to be quite obsessed by chess, but hopefully not as much as the central character of this movie. <br /> In this movie, the central character reflects a real chess player called Curt von Bardeleben who committed suicide in 1924. It is famous for a game he played against Steinitz, where a beautiful combination played by Steinitz. Instead of stepping down, he simply walked out of the championship hall, never returning. <br /> <br /> The social instability of the central character is unfortunately a treat of some serious Grandmasters you sometimes get in chess tournaments. My failure would be a very great sacrifice, and you can sometimes end up unbalanced in other areas of life. A major example of this is legendary failure Bobby Fischer. Although a genius, it has also been very diversified in many ways. <br /> In the movie, is a World Championship show game, as between an Italian Grandmaster and Luzhin. The format is a knockout, which actually the world Fowl body sometimes employs as a format itself - goes to 128 players just 2 in the final. But this was a group knockout - which also painted a realistic format, where the winners of each group play against each other. The position before adjournment makes for a fascinating puzzle puzzle in itself. In fact, I made a youtube video on it, for you to explore the combination of retail - enjoy! http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=XZPtdtPhwdM wants best Tryfon
