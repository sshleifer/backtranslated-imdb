First of all, when people hear 'GUY RITCHIE', they immediately think of SNATCH. Yes, Snatch was a good movie, but the problem is that Guy Ritchie's all-time snatch partner. They do not expect him to explore new borders. This movie REVOLVER is different than hacked; it's much darker and it's very complex. The reason I gave a rating of 10 is because I had to look revolver 3 times to understand everything. So, this movie game with yourself. It is very wrong to write. <br /> This movie is different than Snatch. It's nice, the movie is beautiful, and you can recognize Guy Ritchie's personal (style of directing) in it. What won me was the complexity of the protagonist and how we left with more questions than answers.
