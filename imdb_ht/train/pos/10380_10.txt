In 1976 I was just moved to our place from Ceylon. I was 23, and married for a little over three years, and started out like a lesbian. I saw this film on an old black and white television, with terrible reception, alone, and uninterrupted, in an awakening that seemed like an echo of the story. I lived in a small house in Arizona tucson, and it was summer ... like everyone else here, I have never forgotten these images of this story called out, and its residuals in fragile magic, and I I am hoping to see him again a day. I'll keep checking in. I hope that someone would make a movie of Shirley Verel's 'other side of venus'. It also has some of the same delicacy and persistent extension.
