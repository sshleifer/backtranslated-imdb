Since I first saw Aweigh's First Anchors in 1945, watching her on video clip keeps a lot of nostalgia for me. At age 15, it was easy for me to be drawn to the first of the great MGM Technicolor musicals. Now I am perhaps most interested in thinking about the future career of the leading players. Though Sinatra did a couple of neglected films soon after his emergence after his Dorsey Day, as a solo singer, this was his first great film appearance. As another viewer noted, this seems almost to be a warm-up for the Town. Sinatra may have been working hard at her, but his dance with Kelly is credible, and she would do better in their next couple. However, observing his physical body, it's easy to see why he cared for a chain weight. Who would have imagined that in a decade he would win an academy for acting, and go on to play as many roles as a hard detective or leader in combat. Though Gene Kelly's personality and dancing dominate this movie, her LED performance did not suggest that she would become a great creative force, almost the iconic figure, for MGM music, where she developed a style of complementary dance to that and Fred Astaire. Finally, it was strange to see the cool-met Dean and remember that he would later play a "thriller" bloodthirsty in controlling, based on the murder of Leopold-Loeb from the 1920s. An additional note: A review praised Betty Garrett as Sinatra's favorite interest. He later played opposite him in the city, but Pamela Britton was featured in this film.
