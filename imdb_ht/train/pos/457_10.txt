This program is a lot of fun and the title song so enticing I can not get it out of my head. I find as I grow older I draw from the findings that get things done, and these cards are excellent in their initiatives. Some of these facts are outrageous but brilliantly considering that now our PC and PC worlds we could never make it into real life. I always learn something in the shows. But if you love mystery, drama, comedy, and a little legal task you will love this show. He reminds me of Quincy, ME in a way with Barney Miller in another way to work and interact with each other. They screw up a lot but they get the job done, and that's what counts.
