Movie scenery film filled with famous but stolen figures by Cristina Raines (later on the TV "Flamingo Road") as a beautiful but somewhat unstable model with a gummy smile who is looking to pay for suicide attempts Do not Keep The Gateway in Hell! Scenes and Raines templates are beautifully captured, the atmosphere music is perfect, Debora Raffin is good as Cristina's palate, but when rain moves into a creepy Brooklyn Heights brownstone (inhabited by a blind priest on the top floor), things really start cooking. The neighbors, including a fantastically cruel Burgess Meredith and Couple Couple Sylvia Miles & Beverly D'Angelo, are a lot of demonic, and Eli Wallach is great fun as a wily police detective. The film is almost a continent cross in the "Baby Rosemary" and the "Exorcist" - but what a combination! Based on the best seller by Jeffrey Konvitz, the "Sentinel" is amusingly spooky, full of shock brought in by director Michael Winner, who has a thoughtful attention to finishing skills. *** 1/2 from ****
