"The Right Story" is a really beautiful movie about an elderly man named Alvin Straight, who rides his lawnmower across the country to visit his alien, dead brother. But that's just the basic syllabus ... this movie is over much more than that. This was Richard Farnworth's last role before he died, and it is definitely one that he will be remembered for. It's a stubborn fool, not unlike a lot of the old guys that you and I probably know. <br /> <br /> The "right story" is a movie that everyone should look at at least once in their lives. It will reach down and earn some parts of you, at least if you have a heart, it will.
