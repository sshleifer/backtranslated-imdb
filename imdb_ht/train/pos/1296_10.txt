It is a very difficult movie to watch, particularly as it seeks the intimate core of all of our lives. But ultimately it is a very beautiful and deeply moving movie. Anyone finding it cynically must say that they have missed a lot of points in all the movie's messages. For those who actually watch the movie, they will see that the way the problems are facing and is absolutely necessary, and the result is finally expanding. Sure, it's very hard to look, a tricky and even brutal topic. But it is very important in society and everyone. It shows the peak of what world cinemas are doing at the moment (I will not restrict this term to just France) and everyone should try to see it. I'll say that it's best to go in with a clear head without swayed by conflicting opinions, and just leaving the film to work for you.
