This movie has a special place in my heart, as when I held it the first time, I taught adult literacy. He met very well for me and even an exceptional student I was at the moment. There are scenes that make you gout and sudden emotions, and those even put a smile on your face of absolute identities with their character and their situation. Excellent performances by Jane Fonda and Robert DeNiro are the best performers, a great turn by a Young Mattex Mattee, a inspired storyline, and an ante-inspired music note for a more enjoyable and rewarding experience.
