Since I watched her for the first time, "Piedras" is a personal favorite and one of the few pictures I actually could look over and over again. The great scenario depicts a lot of women (all of them somehow connected) with deep understanding and sensitivity. Ramón Salazar has achieved a compelling film of his first director, and has proven himself as an actor actor. <br /> Not that all the performances are excellent, though. Of all the leading ladies, they range from average (Najwa Nimri) to very good (Vicky Peña), but the ovation should stand in the new Mónica Cervera, which is compelling to play Antonia San Juan daughter delayed. Enrique Alcides is unbelievably charming as the girl's nurse, and there's a nice little turn from Andrés Gertrúdix, Geli Albaladejo and the director himself, Ramón Salazar. <br /> <br /> "Piedras" is very well written and filmed, when I watch it I got so moved that I could not stop thinking about it for days. I highly recommend it.
