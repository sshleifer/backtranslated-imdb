Pushed Daisies was a wonderful show. Many like dying like me and Wonderfalls, you can say was created by Bryan Fuller. I can understand how little people in a love for theater, movies, music and love will be annoyed. This is not a typical TV program and the fantastic is too much for some. These people seem to need some slightly more linear and muted tones to keep them happy. This program exploits with colors, winks in old movie scenes, hums and incredible music and talent performance. There is nothing random about choices that are made in the leitmotif costume. The story takes a lot of twists and turns, but everything is very inaccessible because the conversations are about love, honesty, courage, loss and much else we face every day. Only the unfortunate aspect ended in the show and that was running because Pushing Daisies was canceled. By this approach as a typical TV show. Think about it as an evening in the theater, then sit back and enjoy!
