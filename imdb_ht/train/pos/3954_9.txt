Every time people ask me the name of the horrible film I've ever seen, I have always answered "Black Noon" and that day nobody ever heard of it. <br /> I watch her alone some 30 years ago in the tender age of 13 when my parents came out for the evening. As far as I know her sole ever been shown once in the UK and unfortunately is available on DVD or VHS. If anyone can draw a copy, please let me know. <br /> <br /> If I look it again now it would probably be a great disappointment but it was still stuck in my memory as a particularly disturbing little movie!
