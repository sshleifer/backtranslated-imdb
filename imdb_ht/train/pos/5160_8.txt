Dr. McCoy and Mr. Spock find themselves trapped in a Ice Age of Planet, while Cap. Kirk is in the colonial period of the same planet. However, it's the oldest pair that has the most time trying. In addition to the freezing temperatures and the sanctuary can be found only in Caves, there is a third, beautiful and so sexy Zarabeth's (Mariette Hartley). As Spock spends more time in this era, she slowly starts returning to the behavior patterns of her ancestors, feeling a natural attraction in Zarabeth and sending "caution in the wind" ever since leaving this place. Only with constant Dr. McCoy's "boost" spock keeps on some grasp of reality. <br /> <br /> This stands as one of the few times when the character gets to show some "emotions" and Nimoy (Spock) playing it in the pig, coming close to knocking the bejesus from Deforest Kelly (McCoy). Amazing installation, Captain Kirk (William Shatner) was not allowed to find the girl, another more for this one. <br /> <br /> Perennial "old man" Ian Wolfe takes the role of "Mr. Atoz," Librarian who is responsible for sending trios in the past.
