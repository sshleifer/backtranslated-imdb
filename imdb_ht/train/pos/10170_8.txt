In complete contrast to the opinions of the other review, this movie actually was amazingly good! I reluctantly went to see her and expected to be bored by glowing, obvious jokes and overacting, all of which were the promised trailer. However, after 5 minutes I found myself really laughing and enjoying the refreshing act. With only one 'humor toilet humor', More Dead Body it manages to actually come up with really funny stories and, without spoiling anything too much, some of the time involving the hilarious animals. <br /> <br /> The discontinuous ingredients of a good movie are all there; script, director and actor and comparing some other recent attempts at romantic comedy, this movie stands high. <br /> <br /> Be sure, you will not learn anything or have a spiral lift, but if you go with an open mind you will be more than likely to have a good time!
