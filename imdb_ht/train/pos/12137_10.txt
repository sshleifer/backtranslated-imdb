How amazing this film is! I've seen it over and over all the years and I'm still spellbound by it. The reason why the movie is so easy to re-look is, of course, the arrest performance given by the young Bette Davis. He does not just steal each scene that it's, but is actually the most beautiful and best photo here (not to mention sexier) than he was in any of the films that he did so far at his home studio, Warner Brothers ( This movie was designed by RKO Radio Pictures). She puts a very complimentary make-up and has very beautiful hairstyle and o, these cute big eyes (especially, at the restaurant scene that take place in London's Soho). His body was so curvy when he was young. Get a load of it in the cheap careless that it wears for its large explosive showroom scene with Leslie Howard. And oh boy, it's an absolute commercial powerhouse at this stage. Howard is a little too nervous at all, but it does capture the hero's sensitivity. Frances Dee notes as sweet, sweet young Sally who really loves her. Max Steiner is both good and intense. Full performance and thirty flavors make this to be seen in the classic Roman novel.
