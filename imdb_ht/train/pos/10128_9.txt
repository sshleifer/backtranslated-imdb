Here is the first episode of Friend Friend, where we get introduced to Freak Monica Gellar (Courtney Cox), Newly Divorced Ross Gellar (David Schimmer), Hippy Pheobe Buffay (Lisa Kudrow), unknown actor and man ( Matt Le Blanc and very sarcastic Bing Chandler (Matthew Perry) .This is how the scene begins until we present to the 6th and final Spoiled Rachel Green (Jennifer Aniston) friends. Most people give credit for, like any new sitcom The first episode is not always fantastic. The actor in this episode is not great because the cast can not be identified with the really credible arnt of the new characters (apart from Kudrow and Perry - shining) Matt Le Blanc - Man, was downright straightforward because until later, it became more confident, but I think it tries to be funny, but most fail. <br /> /> David Schimmer - Why is it pronounced every word? It can not normally speak But it has become one of the funniest characters in later times, but it's not trustworthy and I can not sympathize muse with Jennifer Aniston - Look warm and do a good job as Rachel Green, but we only see the real Rachel later in the 1st season, Courtney Cox - looks quite anorexic in this episode, worrying her, it looks totally different Now, (more sentiment), it acts a little excuse but everyones is in this 20 minute pilot! Lisa Kudrow and Matthew Perry-I'm doing these together because they are comic distribution and quality superb acting, and for Lisa this was one of her first roles and it is so natural as Pheobe (Pheebs) and Matthew Perry are just Matthew Perry plays himself fundamentally! The episode quality improves later, like those ensembles, they seem dark and creepy into this episode and make them seem chilly, the act is OK, the characters are confident and each new scene and I'm proud this is pilot la! I hope you see friends come together! Causes are always there for us!
