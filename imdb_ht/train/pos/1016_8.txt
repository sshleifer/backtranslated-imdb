I would give this otherwise terrific series a full vote 10 if Claudia Black did not continue on in it! His inclusion as the comic 'Vela' has brought the series down to my estimation. To bring it to a regular at the same time as including Ben Browder replacing RDA was a mistake. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately we were just curled out of the loss of 'Jack' and really did not need this great back series of new episodes in 'Farscape'. <br /> I was a big fan of the film "Stargate" and when I announced the first series I had reservations that he could live up to the movie, but after watching the first episode I must admit I was hooked . I have always looked forward to new episodes and great anticipation
