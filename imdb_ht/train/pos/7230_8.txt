The "Invisible Mouse" is a delightful cartoon with Tom & Jerry. It presents the usual cat / mouse chases and battles, but in a different way this time. Jerry accidentally falls into an invisible ink bottle and is obviously very happy about this because he realizes that he can prepare a lot of "surprises" for Tom, scare him, torment him and confuse him. As it is strange, it's also very cool and funny to see what we can not see: Jerry invisible. It's fun to see things awaken in the air without seeing who does it (we know who, right?) - it's like things have been a life of their own or even almost like a matter of ghost. It's equally fun to see Jerry eat some candy and fruit while it's invisible. I really enjoy this instrumental music playing when it's not visible. Some of the best jokes about this short while Tom saw the shadow of Jerry and his slams, and even when Tom tries to slam him with a frying pan and Jerry writes "Miss Me". I also like Jerry when Tom's chocolate milk, becomes visible again with a happy look on his face. <br /> <br /> Overall, this short has basic ingredients needed for a classic cartoon: humor, fun, fun and some nice artwork too.
