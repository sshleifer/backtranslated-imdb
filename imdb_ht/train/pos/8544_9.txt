This film has never received the attention it deserves, although this is one of the finest pieces of acting ensembles, and one of the most realistic stories I've seen on screen. Clearly filmed on a small budget in a real V.A. Hospital, the center of the story is Joel, beautifully played by Eric Stoltz. Joel was paralyzed in a motorcycle crash, and came to the hospital in a parish with other men with spinal lesions. Joel is in love with Anna, his married lover, played by Helen Hunt, who shows early signs of later Academy-award winning jobs. Although Joel-Anna's relationship is the core focus, there are many other well-developed characters in the ward. Wesley Snipes does a tremendous job like Raymond's angry. Even more impressive is William Forsythe as the bitter blubber and racism. I think of Forsythe of the best scenes when he gets frustrated and angry at the square dancers, and, later, when he feels compassionate for a Korean boy who was shot in a lucky store holding. My favorite scene with Snipes is in the roundtable discussion post-accidental sexual option. The chemistry between Stoltz and Hunt is very strong, and they are two very intimate, but not pointless, sex scenes. Orgasm in the ward is both sexy and entertaining. There is also another memorable scene where Joel and Bloss and the Korean boy take the wind specially equipped in the strip bar. It's really a comedy of error as they try to get the wind to see the "naked ladies". <br /> The story is made even more intensively in the fact that the director, Neal Jimenez, is paralyzed in real life. This is basically his story. This movie is real, not glossy or flashy. To have the amount of talent in a movie in such a small budget is amazing. I recommend this movie to everyone I see, because it is one of those films that even improved on a second look. It's a shame that such a great piece of work becomes neglected, but in video, maybe it can get the attention it is so deserving.
