Seeing this as previous viewer by accident, I watched it twice now. I enjoy it, there is no idea to imagine just plain fun fun entertainment, good songs, good characters and just a good movie feel Very good to recommend to those of you who just love to enjoy film and do not outshine them Great Fun for All Families here. I did not realize Rosie Alvarez played by Vanessa Williams, she is excellent and very hot. The songs like One Boy and One Kiss are the most enjoyable to listen to and your feet through Jason Alexander is the complete contrast to her character of beautiful pretty wife. Tyne Daley still sticks to my mind from Cagney and Lacey with her voice and accent always had that memories of her. Overall I just love it and will be looking for it if it's available
