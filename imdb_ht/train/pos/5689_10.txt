First, this is a review of the set of discs that came along with the "Wonderland" DVD rental. <br /> <br /> Two movies included with the "Wonderland" rental and the Johnny Wadd documentary, totally obliterate the myths created by "Boogie Nights". That is being that the characters involved in the adult film trade were considerably more than thin lowlifes that would do anything for money, basically denying that they were nothing other than independent self-centered trials. This is amazingly similar to what the book "Wiseguy" and the film "Goodfellas" made of the "Godfather" fables and most of the rest of the gangster romanticism of the Voice. <br /> Currently, what exacerbates me most during watching these movies, and will probably be anyone who has seen and loved "Nights Boogie", is how crazy and gullible supposedly educated and sophisticated people can. "Dirk Diggler" of "Boogie Nights" is without a doubt John Holmes, which unlike "Dirk Diggler", had no quality rachim. Holmes was a criminal societal who abused anyone close to him, totally burned by his self-satisfaction, and was without a doubt a key participant in the brutal murder of Wonderland Avenue in Los Angeles in 1981. The film lays the big sets that "Boogie Nights" was, and reinforced Linda Lovelace's description of the cruel and pathetic business that is known as the adult film entertainment industry. This should have to look, both features on the "Wonderland" DVD, for anyone who has any positive views on the story of the film "Boogie Nights".
