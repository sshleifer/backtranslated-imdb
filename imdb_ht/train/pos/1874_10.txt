Everybody should see this movie because each one of us breaks in one way and can help us realize 1) My life is not as bad as I thought it was and 2) How important it is to adopt a child in need. There are many people out there. To think that the movie was actually based on a real person was to make us think deep about life and how the world has and constantly. Corruption, but that corruption does not have to come home. We all have a choice! Definitely recommend this one ... and while you're in it, I would like to throw in the "Purple" and "Woman, your loose art" by TD Jakes. Cinema-based life and gives us a glimpse of life.
