"And All Through The House" is a special crypt episode not only because it's from the first quarter, but this episode was the first one I saw! I remember as a young man being on vacation with my parents summer in 1989 in our hotel room in South Carolina on HBO I saw this episode and I was buried in the right script then and for all time! I've always been a fan of horror-thriller series and liked monster movies, and this series started by my HBO again was very fun. This episode being the first one I saw is memorable for me and one of my favorites, it's just so enjoyable with a nice twist. "And All Through The House" has a nice cozy environment on a snowy Christmas Eve, which is a perfect way to get you relaxed for holiday deco! Well, anyway, you have Mary Ellen Trainor (who is in the way of playing several warner warriors, usually small parts) as a vicious lawyer wife who takes care of her snowmen while waiting for some money and a new romance. Only as the most weaned things take a turn for the worst and bad people to find what they deserve. The many chances of stacking when a maniac dresses like Santa Night comes from a local black house, making for a late-chewing holiday on Christmas Eve! As in the old eccentric lessons, you learn the bad people to find those axes! Well this story ends with a perfect holiday call! Also this story was in the 1972 film and featured Joan Collins, this is without a doubt one of my favorites and probably one of the classic cryptic episodes of all time!
