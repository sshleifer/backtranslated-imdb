Put the camera on me is a fabulous movie. It is actually a complex glimpse in the psychology of children and offers interesting insights into the development of adults and an artist. On the surface this is a nostalgic look at some home movies made in the 80's by a group of upper-class children. One of the film directors, Darren Stein, has access to a video camera and has quickly been taken as the artistic leader for all of the movies. Sure, these are just some cute kids having fun. But this is also much more. This is a look at some moments in time as the children understand and a number of confusing issues that all of us face in life --- scary, awake sexual, unrequited love, loneliness and just trying to make sense of the world adults seem to explode everywhere. As we get older we tend to forget how overwhlelming the realities of life were when we were little. <br /> What makes this movie all the more valuable is to watch a young Darren Stein turn into a little general in a movie theater. It is clear that Darren is running this show and these little movies are his vision, but they are all informed by his friends, the problems, the interpersonal dynamics and the general confusion regarding the horrors of adult life. A lot of kids make movies at home, but I have never heard of these kids creating "little" movies about holocaust, homosexuals, nuclear wars and inability to fit and make friends. These children are confronted and deal with some heavy things! <br /> <br /> The power of this movie is the way Stein and Shell pull different scenes together so tightly and run interviews with the kids --- all now adults and all friends. This adds a new angle to the movie. How many of us stayed in contact with our boyfriend friends? These guys have. And, many of the issues with which they are facing are still running between them two decades later. <br /> <br /> In the middle of the conflicts - a confession of a crush reveals a heart still broken, a very normal sexual experience continues to be a "sticky" topic between two of the guys, some continuous resentment on the dynamics of relationships and always have a member of this team that is extremely busy with the center stage! Making perfect sense as one look at these home theater productions over the course of a couple of years. Darren Stein is a director. There is no doubt about it. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Stein and Shell take turns talking with each other from time to time and one can not help but imagine the discomfort in allowing us to peek into the young people's lives. This is particularly true for Stein who has gone through a great deal of success in the entertainment industry as a film producer, writer and director. From the first moment of putting the CAMERA on ME we can see the emergence of a gay little boy trying to figure it all out. We also see places in the artistic and personality ideas that are not always "beautiful" or "caring" --- and, this is a bold move for any artist to share with a hearing. <br /> <br /> There are many moments reveal, but the most disturbing and complex moments involve a movie in which we see a Jewish concentration camp victim being tortured and killed by a Nazi. We discover interviews and narratives that the Nazis play by a Jewish child and part of the victim playing by a kind child. It is a distressing moment of glimpses in the dark side of fear and how children work through the horrors of the adult world beyond beyond adult understanding less than a child. <br /> <br /> This is more than a few home movies. This documentary captures pain, beauty, joy and sadness in growing. Powerful thing --- and well worth seeing! <br /> <br />
