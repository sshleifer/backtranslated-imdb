This is by far the most incredible movie I've seen in a long time. The actors provide wonderful portraits of the characters in the movie. The story was accurately described. The story begins with a young woman from the British Isles and her father traveling to Nauvoo, Illinois container. He became a member of the Church of LDS and did not. He thinks it is ridiculous to make the trip and discourage. He encourages her to read about Joseph Smith the Prophet. This is where the Prophet Joseph Smith's story begins. This movie shows her life with some of the LDS Church history at the same time. It was graphic at times, but it was necessary. The emotional expression was very credible, which caused my emotions to spread out. Films were scary. The way the story was presented was touched. After the film was over, we just sat there to be able to move. I was stunned. For those who know very little of Joseph Smith, the Prophet Mormon, I would encourage you to see it. If there is nothing else but get some understanding of his life. For members of the Church, I would encourage you to see it. It will increase your testimony to the most incredible man. This is a must see.
