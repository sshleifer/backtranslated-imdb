This movie is Damian SzifrÃ³n's second immersion in the movie after her excellent study of "El Fondo del Mar". With "Tiempo De Valientes" it creates beautifully-made characters, distant prototypes and an unprecedented chemistry. I saw Szifron talent presenting every character in a lighthearted way but just enough to involve us emotionally with them. Its controls are magnificent, so it is restored to the movie in a great direction with a glossy glossy polished script, the characters laugh and cry with real feelings and invite the viewer to join them in the emotions and evolution of the screen. > <br /> The Spanish takes over the English, Buenos Aires urban landscape at night replaces Hollywood and the quotes are just as interesting as any other, so we have a movie to compete on Hollywood's car. <br /> <But I want you to see the movie mostly because I have never faced such endearing characters, all of them. It looks like the script suits perfectly with the actors and vice versa. I really believe in a movie made like Argentina is really up to the Competition.
