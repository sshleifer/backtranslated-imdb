Excellent story about adolescents, leaders, high school football stars. How Far Will You Protect Your Friends? Lying, killing? How many can you lose if you are not an innocent girl? Do Love Beat The Chances? Can you defeat narrow-minded city people? When your friend notes and you "lose", will you do everything in your power to make it pay for it, or will you be someone on it, and respect its right to choose? Can you violate it and show it as your victory over a "problem" girl? Can you stand by the one who's only sin is having an opinion in his own, to be able to make his own decisions, being chosen for himself? It made me think twice before giving my judgment about who was right and who was wrong, but one for sure - very disturbing movie and theme in general. Thumb up!
