Garam Masala is one of the funniest movies I've seen in age. Akshay Kumar is excellent as the womanizer with artifacts and 3 girls and engages at the same time. John Abraham is fun at times and this is one of his best works so far. Paresh Rawail is superb as usual in most of its films. Priyadarshan's director has delivered great movies in the past. Hera Pheri, Hungama and Hulchul being some of the best. Garam Masala is her film he was doing funniest. Three actress actresses on average. Rimi Sels does not get many screens in this movie. I was impressed to see how Priyadarshan made a movie with a simple storyline of a guy who had an affair with 3 girls at the same time. All 3 girls have a day off on the same day and finish the same home. Charged with loads of laughter, this is one of the non-stop artists.
