I saw this first movie when I was around 6 or 7 years old and did not really think it was anything particularly special. As time went on, I watched him a few times more and started to grow up on me as I began to understand the morals of the movie, which I will come later. For a while I left this movie alone and did not watch it for a while. When looking for an old classic movie to watch a few weeks ago (now being 15), I searched out the VHS in homeward tide. After looking at this I left on a natural high that I could not really explain. The film gives an overwhelming sense of joy that you never really expect. The nature films of three completely different creatures cooperate together to find their way home really send a message home that does not matter how different you are you can always get common ground, something we all need. The way the personality of the selected characters is really fantastic. In that you have an old golden retirement knowledge, looking after or 'lucky' to guide the fun of love if a little sluggish young Bulldog American, and clever sassy, ​​the cat is vulnerable, but confident. The film follows these three friends or peers on a journey that is so realistically impossible to create the magic that you begin to believe that this trip can happen. <br /> I do not want to sound like a soft tissue grabber when it comes to my movie to assure you I'm quite the opposite, but the most uplifting part of this movie is without a returning shadow debt, when shadow desperately tries to escape with luck and sassy, ​​sighs were told by him to leave. When both the animals return to their beloved owners have a silence until the shadow shadow on the horizon of awe at all. There is a fine line between rubbing and rubbish coral but this film is pure magic even at the age of 15. This film may not be Lord of the Rings, but for Disney to produce such a fantastic movie using animals and for it to ride myself in the way he does at this age he deserves 10/10.
