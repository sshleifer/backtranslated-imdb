I became a fan of the Omisid TV series: Life on the street 'late in running at the show, but became a fan very quickly. It was a cop show unlike any other: visually different from using it from the cameras that kept, viewer everywhere, and throwing its multiethnic and its mutiracial with diverse and fascinating personality, and that it covered the good and bad in a police, including the corruption and burst of personality that bundled up to the surface. <br /> <br /> Homicide: The movie, the follow-up reunion of the series, is as good as a movie-made-for-television movie. After Lt Giardello (Yaphet Kotto), now is a candidate for mayor of Baltimore, is shooting, casting members back to help get the killer. In addition, the cast members who left the force and those who died, also managed to have their place in the movie. The intensity and fire that marked the return series, and the skull will be with the same fire that marked the series. All in all, a terrific TV movie. <br /> <br /> Vote: 9
