I do not think most people give this movie as much credit as it deserves. I love movies movie movies and this takes the cake, especially for originality. Yes The scarecrow is a frightner fighting kung-fu, but why not? No one wants to go far. I really did not have this much fun watching a movie since Candyman. So the city chooses about this kid calling her scarecrow, even her mother does not care about her. Then he gets killed with the infused soul and through the scarecrow, who then goes on a killing spree. His break is relatively easy to assume once the film is going. Dedication to the end goes straight to a bunch of horror directors, but with most dedication towards Dario Argento really hit me like cool, these folks want to make movies in a new genre. Over the movie there is a lot of Arnold Rip's compromise, with a covering material you will definitely laugh at as sticking around he's killed the sheriff with a stick. I would say, grab a pizza a few friends a laugh or A $ Off with this movie. I love it for its originality, most fun.
