This film took me by surprise complete. I watch it 2 or 3 times. I really liked this movie. There was plenty of truth that brought this film. I love all the characters in this movie too. This movie makes a lot of sense because as society "gets more advanced" What is the culture of loose? By sounding preachy. I can really relate to this movie from my child's hood and it's lost apart from my life that will never return or ever was the same. This movie is on the top 5 movie I've ever watched. There is just such a raw truth that I feel when I watch the movie and it's not the kind of truth that you have to dig for its right in front of your face. The creators of this movie did a great job and I enjoyed this movie very much. This movie can not be for everyone, but if you have an open mind, I think you'll love it.
