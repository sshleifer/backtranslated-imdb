James Stewart and Margaret Sullavan play co-workers in a Budapest gift shop that does not really love each other, not knowing they're really romantic pale feathers who have yet to meet. <br /> A very good comedy romance, very engagingly played by it in two likable stars and a very eagerly-supported cast cast. The story well written and the film has that romantic innocence (not quite know how to explain it) that today's movie just does not have. This can obviously be compared to the latest You received Mail, and the original wins in every way. <br /> This is obligatory to watch every Christmas, I can not think of a better way to enjoy a Christmas feeling than this little gem.
