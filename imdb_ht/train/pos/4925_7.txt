There is also a lot of background noise where, which is a little distracted - car horn in the love scene, anyone? There are a lot of non-professional artists supporting the crowd scene, and this can explain why the rhythm of the movie is a little saggy to start with - not very likely to retake or reboot, though the final chase is vo hanging on for. There is not much harm to the actors lead either: Jack Palance is really scared as a charismatic, clever psychopath - the later stage as it alternately comfort and threatens the sick cousin is terrific, while Widmark, as it often does, stacked The upright man in the man on a mission at a credible level - most of the time. <br /> Someone should notice this - there is no supernaturals, no mysticism, no special FX, just a good full thread of character controversy, and a topical theme. Another review is mentioned by the John Kennedy O'Toole writer, and this is the place with the oddball oddball type of oddball kind of peppering this dark, sleazy, counter-clockwise drama. There's even a midget newspaper seller. <br /> <br /> Community? Which community? Do You Think You Live In The Middle Ages?
