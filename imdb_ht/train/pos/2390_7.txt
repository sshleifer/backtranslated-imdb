My 2 year old likes to show in Doodlebops, she looks up to her attention for a moment. The characters are interesting, vibrant and main colors with all. There are not many educational content that target target audience can benefit from, but they seem to have a theme every show and try to teach kids to share with respect to other basics, so I love it for that. It is well-produced and high production value. But it's really just an average show like most of the TV shows these days. We do not buy at the stock angle and our son puts everything Dooblebop. I do not think we would spend money to go to a live show, if they ever reached the city. Going to the Zoo or Science Center is a better experience for everyone involved and in my opinion is the best money spent.
