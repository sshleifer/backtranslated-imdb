I can not see the point of burying a movie like this in sarcastic sulphuric, when it is in no way designed to be anything more than a car to entertain the kids and preparing them for the next line of merry goods. /> <br /> This is a fun movie. My children are sitting quietly in the whole thing and love every minute of it. Granted, the villain is a bit on the head and his comic suicide and maniacal laugher, but this is a lot easier to take than dark, gloomy and very morbid Pok√©mon 3. <br /> <br /> Son I have been watching Pokemon since it started and soon will come to their age where they will "put in things childish things" and move on to others. I'm glad we enjoyed this together.
