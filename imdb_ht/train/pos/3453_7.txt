Even though this film has a first-rate list of fine actors, excellent special effects, and a storyline full of surprises, it has not been picked up for studio distribution, it goes directly to DVDs. Maybe it has information about the "anti-police" force, or maybe it's just one flick of action too much released during a glut, but whatever the big screen screens miss the opportunity, fortunately the new concept of direct disclosure of DVD allows us to enjoy it. The theme is old: rookie reporter discovered an inner circle of rotten cops - in this case the FRAT (First Reaction Attack and Tactics) team, a well-trained police crew created to clean Edison's mythical city at the point give it to crimes, drugs, prostitution etc. Work suffered the temptation of the poker goods confiscated with funds proving too much of an opportunity and now 15 years after its training, FRAT responsible for murder, drug trafficking, terrorist innocence etc. The lead dog is Lazerov (Dylan McDermott, who makes a really real gangster!) and his partner Rafe Deed (LL Cool J, even more scrub than usual and proving it can be a sensitive actor). Reporter Pollack (Justin Timberlake) captures winds in a "bad mistake" and reports his theory of fraud and corruption to his boss Ashford (Morgan Freeman's still fine fine). Gradual Polack convinced Ashford and immediately Wallace (Kevin Spacey, also a character actor still well) and helped Pollack in this investigation report. The closer to Pollack comes to the truth more surprises and bad incidents happen and the story runs pall shopping center toward a series of unexpected results. <br /> <br /> Timberlake lacks the charisma lead, especially in the company of these seasoned actors. But LL Cool J, Freeman, Spacey, and McDermott keep the well-oil machine in a rolling movie at the very end. No, it's not a big movie, but it's one that makes for a corner of the seat action flick with a message. Grady Harp
