I totally agree with the other reviews.All basically negative. I took a chance on this movie and was happy that I did. Glad indeed. I could not find anything wrong with it. Can not allow anything. The quiz is original. The operators are all likable and convincing.The Smart reminds me of Marcia Brady from the brady bunch. But this gal really can act. The setting of the Australian Outback is perfect. Incredible scenery.Grav band means Paul Kelly.God blesses Paul Kelly. Cranberries are also here. I've seen this movie twice in less than 24 hrs.I will probably watch it again. It's interesting. It's a thought. It's (was) probably better than nine-tenths of so-called Hollywood blockbusters which was also out during this time.Back in Beyond is a likable.Well movie film.I could not find anything wrong with it. Stop it out! My first review!
