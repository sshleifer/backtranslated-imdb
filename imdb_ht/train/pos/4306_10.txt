The only fact that I still think of the movie a decade later is what really talks about the movie. For me this proves Grand Canyon as a movie that will touch you in one way or another. I really believe that before the movie crash was Grand Canyon. The biggest difference between the two films in my opinion is the time to release them. I will not argue that one is best, but I will beg the idea that they share the same message. I would like to hear from those who have an opinion on this subject. I'll start a book that you can find at http://www.myspace.com/62229249. You can also find that I have post any other movie subjects that we can share, because I have a true love for movie.
