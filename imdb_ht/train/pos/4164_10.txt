Those are memories of children ... when things were new, and we were full of curiosity around the world around us; as we took the first steps in the long journey we called life. <br /> One of the first memories I have in childhood is this program hosted "Galaxy Express 999," about a young boy named Tetsuro, who goes on a train ride around the Galaxy, in hopes to take a mechanical body in order to avenge the death of the essence of his mother in the hands of cold-hearted, Trophy pick up mechanic hunters. Accompanying Tetsuro on his journey is Maetel, a woman of exquisite beauty of gold that reminds her of the mother she lost all those years ago ... Back in the early 80s as a boy who went to kindergarten and early years of elementary school in Seoul, South Korea, "Galaxy Express 999" was a popular popular animated program imported from Japan, which inspired young boys who dreamed of dreams of countless adventures in their frequent journeys tumultuous and exciting in their lifetime. The memories of tuning in this program are hosted on weekdays from 8 to 9pm before bed time ... <br /> <br /> Those were some wonderful memorabilia, never to have had yet ... While I was moving to America, and while I was living here for more than 2 decades, I sometimes wondered about this time and place, in a far country far away from America by a The vast oceans, in the children's program, and its hitting songs, and the boy named Tetsuro, his companion Maetel, the enigmatic conductor, and the Express 999 Space Station. Many last but many years ... <br /> <br /> Last summer while I was in Korea, I was able to track down an original copy of the "Galaxy Express 999" (1979) on DVD, and brought back a lot of nostalgia, heartfelt memories. "Galaxy Express 999" remains as fascinating as the first time you've discovered it all those years ago, opening these nostalgic memories into new discoveries, an important stone stage for young men who are tuned in and engaged in their life journey in manhood . /> <br /> Here's wonderful stuff. "Goodbye, Maetel, well-bye, Galaxy Express 999 ... <br /> <br /> Goodbye, in my childhood." 10/10
