This entire movie is worth watching just for the ultimate magnificent moment - it's the best of any movie I've ever seen. Sometimes, nice, funny, simply wonderful. <br /> I found this delightful movie, even with her in French take-it-too-seriously-deep meaning of things going on. I loved it - it's a beloved story. And I liked the Algerian route being knit in - and by the way the music during the final credit is great. I want the CD!
