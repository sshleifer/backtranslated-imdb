During a celebration of Kurt Weill in Brooklyn, WHERE IS MY MOST? was finally stretching for a screening. It's amazing that a motion picture, from any era, that has collaboration Weill-Gershwin can possibly be missing in the screens. The note stands tall, with a CD of the material, and Gershwin and Weill, only its fundamentals of its merits, which are considerable. Yes, the movie has its problems, but the score is not one of them. Ratoff is not in its element as the director of this music fantasy, and Fred MacMurray can not properly grasp the material. Then, too, the 'modern' segment is weak to write. But the fantasy elements carry the film into a high brand, such as doing the job of the two succulent ladies leading - Joan Leslie and June Haver. Both have the charm that this type of work desperately needs to work. As a World War II saluted in our country's history - albeit of a 'never been' foundation, the film has its place in Hollywood music history and should be available for everyone to see and find its considerable worth.
