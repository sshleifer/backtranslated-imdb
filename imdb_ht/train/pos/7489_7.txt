This movie has a lot of strong points. He has one of the biggest efforts outside of the Lugosi-Karloff-Chaney circle: Lionel Atwill, Fay Wray, and Dwight Frye, the leading leader of Melvyn Douglas. It has received all the right ingredients: batons, a castle and many of rock stairs, a mad scientist, townspeople candle and vampire hunt, a character "Igor" character, a beautiful girl, even a Burgomeister so-haired. The soft-focus camera work is moody and imaginative. There are even some good funny nicely spotted reliefs throughout the script. <br /> But it's not really a monster movie because nothing supernatural goes to the "Kleinschloss" ("little castle"). The plot revolves around the generic crazy scientist (nicely played by Atwill) that values ​​his work more than life. <br /> It's not top-tiered material, because they're a ho-hum resolution of the plot and some nasty dialogues for Dwight Frye. But it's worth a look if you like the early pictures b / w.
