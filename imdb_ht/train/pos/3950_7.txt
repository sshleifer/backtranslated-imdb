Finally, this classic movie movie on an official record is recorded from an old VHS, it's a classic piece of horror. It's a pity more of this neglected edge of the horror theme of official releases on DVD and VHS ... the movie movie film. Recommended for all fans of the 70s film as much as the horror trilogy. Those interested should find the book on the subject by David Deal - TV scary in 70 years. My emails for a chance to see it ..... Fabulous to see it again. <br /> It does have problems such as many TV cinemas have to be rather invented in the dept effects and even in 70 mins it may seem to stem possibly we all use more modern editing but still great things and far pies good than many frat theater released today.
