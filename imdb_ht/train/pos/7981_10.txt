In Mexico City, the former CIA killer and actually a decadent man John Kreasy (Denzel Washington) is hired by Samuel Ramos (Marc Anthony), with the recommendation of his old friend Rayburn (Christopher Walken), to be his daughter daughter Pita (Dakota Fanning) and his wife Lisa (Radha Mitchell). Later change the cold Christian behavior, make her live and smile again, and she feels a great affection for her. When the kidnapped girl and the United States informed that she was murdered by criminals, she swore to kill each person responsible for the abduction. <br /> <br /> "Man on Fire" is almost a masterpiece, and will certainly become a classic in the future. The story is excellent, never corny and although there are 146 minutes running time, the viewer does not feel over time. Throw is composed of excellent actors and actresses, their performances are outstanding, highlighting Denzel Washington, Dakota Fanning and Radha Mitchell. The camera has wonderful moments, and the scenario has stunning lines. I personally love when the character of Christopher Walken explains Manzano (Giancarlo Giannini) that the specialty of Creasey is death, and he is preparing his masterpieces. I agree with the user who commented that "Man on Fire" is one of the best, if not the best, film of the year in this genre. My vote is ten. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Flames of the Revenge"
