I do not know why critics have trashed this movie. I hardly agree with them anyway. <br /> <br /> The movie could have been a little scarier - I do not usually go to movie cinema! I even had to peck myself to see it in the daytime. I do not need to bother! ;) (The cinema was full of kids too, heh !;) ... Liam was great as always. I also loved Catharine Zeta Jones (Theo) and Lili Taylor (Eleanor-Nell) the house was very gothic and beautiful in a spooky way. Special effects and sounds were scary. I also liked the music, particularly Melody's little Eleanor and his trip to save the kids, how he grew out of his stagnant routine and life and finally found his power, peace and freedom.
