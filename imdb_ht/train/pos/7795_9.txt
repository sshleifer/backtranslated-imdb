This will be a different kind of review. I saw this movie twice on TV and would like to have a copy because it talks about Panama City and the beach in the winter time that is my favorite time to be there. It was the first movie I'd seen by Ashley Judd and it was great and I enjoyed all the other things I saw in reaction to the Sundance made an impression on me too, as did the director Victor Nunez, who has directed and writes several films about Florida. This movie speaks to me and I do not see anything and compare it. The scheme tells me less than the settings. Well, I told you it would be another kind of review.
