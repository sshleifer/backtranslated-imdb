Leonard Maltin must have watched some other films. (Even if I find his Guide to be quite a valuable resource, please respect his comment on this one.) It states "starting off well then fizzles" when it really reverses - "start cutting tepid capture fire ". The plot is as simple as it gets. Happy mother, happy father and happy child took a vacation to an isolated beach, incapable father of the crash, mother runs to help, meet and escape dangerous escape. The mother tries to endorse the sentence to help while dad waits and hangs on for dear life. <br /> <br /> Good white knuckler gives an electric bell by Ralph Meeker, suddenly appearing (director, John Sturges, his film in a clever way that will make you gasp) around the half as cunning, desperate the criminal. Meeker is a very flippant, reckless actor (at least here and in classical "kiss me dangerous") and it's happily hacking the keys into the film narrative and cutting speeds with the head down. Her character has a habit of grinning children and she says "Pretty clean, huh?" when it's especially happy with his misery. There's a funny break in the action when they find a flat tire and was inspired by her hostage, Barbara Stanwyck, "Do not go". He fire back "Where can I go?" (they're in the middle of nowhere) and it's done sitcom-free "Yeah, that's right". The abrasion between them is a whim. <br /> There are flaws, a bit ridiculous. There's a scene where police, who chased Meeker for some time, stops Stanwyck's car and evades Meeker's findings resting on his shoulder as a loving husband supposedly, and pretending to be asleep as he's been questioning. A. It looks unmaskile in this poses with B. I think it is safe to say that any adult appearing to be asleep during a meeting with the police would certainly arouse suspicion. <br /> Always a solid thriller that builds in an exciting and edgy conclusion. <br /> <br />
