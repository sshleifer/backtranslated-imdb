A major moneymaker for RKO Radio, Bombardier stars O'Brien and Randolph Scott as a trainer in a bomb pilot school. O'Brien and Scott discuss teaching methods, while students are keen for their affection at Anne Shirley. The O'Brien method proved sound during a bomb attack on Tokyo. Scott and his crew were captured and tortured by the Japanese, but Scott's deadly injuries managed to set fire to a gas truck, giving a perfect target for its fellow bomber. Stylistically, Bombardier is one of the most schizophrenic films of war, with moments of subtle poignancy (the death of trainee Eddie Albert) alternating with the ludicrous "yellow peril" melodrama scene (Japanese literal spirit in the teeth as American torturers are discouraged). Though it can not help but looks dated today, Bombardier remains a fun propaganda effort (the movie is sometimes countless listed as the first of Robert Ryan, who would actually have appeared before the cameras since 1940. <br /> <br/> Anyone interested in obtaining a copy of this movie, please contact me at: iamaseal2@yahoo.com
