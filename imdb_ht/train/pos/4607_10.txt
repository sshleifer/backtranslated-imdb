My favorite movie, Jackie Chan, is still "Drunken Meets" (1978), followed by this film from 1985, "History of Police." In it, Chan plays a super-cop Hong Kong who busts a lord's notorious crime and gang, and is then assigned to protect the man's girlfriend (Brigitte Lin) so that he can turn state evidence. As the story goes on, the gangster sends his goon to go to Lin, but Chan takes matters into his own point and foot, while keeping Maggie Cheung's girlfriend in Bay. Like "Drunken Master," "Police History" has a lot of signatures and top-of-top martial arts / choreographies that Chan has become famous for, climaxing into a fighting king in a crowded mall. In his role as director, Chan exceeds excellence, gives a charisma and comic performance that emphasizes the action. While light on the overall slapstick humor of "Drunken Master," in the heart of "Police History" is just that, a police history, a copious cop cop who might be often-copied in the years to come. /> 10/10
