This is a really good movie making. Sumitra Bhave has always made sensitive movies and this is my favorite movie by her. This film should have won the National Award and would choose to represent India in the Oscars. It is at least a thousand times better than 'Shaaws', which is going to the Oscars, from India, this year. It is such a pity that information on this (and all other American movies) about IMDb is missing and sometimes even wrong. Sadashiv Amrapurkar has played a very important character in this film and is not even credited on these pages. The rest of the cast and the crew are not mentioned too. Awards and nominations for this film do not give up when Sonali Kulkarni won Indian National Awards for this movie. There was not even one vote cast for 'Doghi'. <br /> <br /> 'Doghi' is not a Hindi movie. She is Marathi, and fortunately popping the song and dance sequence, not getting tangled in glitzy glamor and half witted designer dresses. It is a real life, storytelling story that is made with a rare understanding and respect. <br /> <br /> 'Doghi' that can be roughly translated as 'two women' is a story of sister, Gauri and Krishna. It is actually a very simple story, Sumitra Bhave by venture into many sub sites, and making it a very difficult movie direct. The entire movie is set in a non-descriptive village in Maharashtra and the screen rarely distant initiatives from the home of the two protagonists. There is no aesthetic lying in this one. The movie opens and we are presented in the whole house, which is preparing for Gauri's wedding. Gauri and Krishna father were a hard working farm, the house is full of joy; There is nothing to want in their simple lives. However on the eve of Gauri's wedding-to-be-husband is satisfied with a fatal accident. Gauri's father can not bring tragic news and he has a serious stroke. Without a strong, working family member may fall apart, but Gauri's mother will take responsibility. It works as and when it can, but it can not end up meeting. But life still is much easier than the Gauri. Superstitions, that people half-heartedly try to forget, make Gauri a lucky lucky chance. It is the overdraft of society. <br /> <br /> Gauri's mother writes her brother. Desperate for help accepting his suggestions. He took Gauri to Mumbai where he worked at home. Gauri sends home money earned and improved conditions. Gauri gives his life for his family. But when Gauri returned home for Krishna's marriage, his mother did not go out to meet him. It does not allow Krishna close to her and does not allow Gauri to invite guests. He likes Gauri but fears of life Krishna. This breaks Gauri completely and decides to return to his unfortunate life. But Krishna runs and holds Gauri. He begs his dear sister to return. Krishna promises to stand by her. Promises that they would face the world ?? together. <br /> <br /> Nothing is needed in this movie. All necessary and sufficient. Gauri goes to Mumbai but what he does never said ?? The subtle dialogues tell us what to know. It's just the story to do, which is profound in its simplicity. <br /> <br /> 'Doghi' is the cinema responsible. She responds to the topic she is busy. He is respectful towards his audience ?? It does not think they have the mental abilities of a four year old. <br /> <br /> The act is the first percentage. The direction is wonderful ?? The silence brings the story forward in a way, no words could have. The script is well researched. <br /> Anyone who appreciates good movies is tied to like 'Doghi'.
