"Mechenosets" is one of the most beautiful romantic movies I've ever seen. The name of the film can be translated into English as the "Sword-Guard". The main hero (Sasha) was born with an exceptional ability: it can protect itself from the very sharp sword from under the skin of his hands. At first it may seem one more superhero horror from the sensitive movie on unrealistic events and feelings. But it's not about Mechenosets. He hardly can even call the anti-hero. I think it is just someone who has lost the warning of his life and faith in goodness, justice and love. In his life, he never met someone who could understand and love him (except his mother). Each step is attached to blood; He took revenge on all the gifts he had given him a conviction for him. And suddenly she met it. It does not need to talk meaninglessly and explicitly. She loves it for what it is. He does not care what he did. The fact that it's next to it is more important than anything else. But soon he finds his secret: he killed two people (his former companion and his bodyguard) to protect him from his many eyes. Even then he could not escape his feelings. They try to run but it's hard to hide. Finally they have a serious car crash. She kaka; it is in a mental hospital. They do not know anything about each other, but he believes he will save her. It surmont a lot of obstacles, but finally find it. They run again, but they are not invulnerable. She is injured, she needs a rest, but police almost catch them. He does not know what to do, they drive in a corner, and then his sword starts to cut trees, helicopters around them, but there is no need for it, because it is already dead in his arms, and it is lonely people in the whole world anymore.
