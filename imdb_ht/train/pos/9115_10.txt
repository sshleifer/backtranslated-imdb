The idea is a very short film and a lot of information. The interesting, fun and visual viewer wants more. The producer has produced a short film of excellent quality that can not be compared to any other short film I've seen. I've rated this movie in the highest possible assessment. I also recommend that it is displaying office managers and business people at any facility. What comes out of it is the fact that those who have ideas have never listened, the voices they never heard. It is a lesson to be learned from any office that wants to go ahead. I hope the product will produce a second part of the 'idea'. I look forward to watching the sequence. Once again Congrats for the Halaqah Media produce a film of excellence and quality with a top lesson.
