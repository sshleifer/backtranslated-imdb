After seeing most of the film Ringo Lam, I can say that this is his best movie on date, and the most unusual. It is a piece of ancient China period cranked full of martial foot-martial, where where an underground lair is full of traps and dungeons playing as big as part as any of the characters. The action is fantastic, the story is tense and fun, and the series design is memorable. Unfortunately, the burning paradise was not available on DVD and VHs is the next-to-impossible to get your mite over, even though you are near the second largest China city in North America (as I do). If you can find it, do not pass it.
