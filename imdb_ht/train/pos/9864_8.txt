I watched 'Ice Age' in the movie theater and I liked the movie. Despite the fact that 'ice age' is very deceptive and scientific error, including people, sabers, dinosaurs and mammoths living in the same period, and even where the story goes (looks North America, but there are some features in Iceland for example) we can have fun. (unless you are very serious!) The planet is joining a large ICE, and many animals migrate to the south where it is warmer. South is a stupid slug that leaves behind her own family, which can not stand her again. Dead on his way, he meets Manfred, or how he calls '' Manny '' a moodyot mammoth that does not care about extinction or immigration and he's going to the north. Worried that he can easily capture, Sid decided to follow Manfred, and among their travels, found a human mother and his baby. The mother died but Manfred and Sid decided to take her and returned the baby to the people. Diego, one of the sabers, decided to follow and help them to get to a shortcut in the person's camp. What Manfred and Sid do not know, is that Diego is from a saber family who hates people and wants to kill the baby, and also pretend to betray them both to make them eat the saber. What will happen, will depend on Diego's behavior and awareness ... <br /> aka "An Era to Make Gelo" - Brazil
