A movie about the wannabee, never-being and less-than-hero made it against all odds. Where we have heard it first. But when the unfortunate are the Shoveller, the Blue Raja and Mr.Furious you know this is no ordinary conventional clothing or storytelling. <br /> A classic performance by Eddie Izzard as Tony P. One of the boys Disco Leaders and Geoffrey Rush as Cruel Arch is the actual show thinking of entering the casting. Even Greg Kinnear, at first glance an odd choice for the role of Captain Amazing turns out on place. Watch this movie if you're sick of comic-to-go stereotypes. Why could not anger be a super power?
