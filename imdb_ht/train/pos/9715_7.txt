Here's the thin, it seems that this is older then I thought it was. But it's still cool. The bike mechs are cool and the story works for the most part. There are some character problems that I expect to work out from Part 2 with my biggest complaint all of it seems to be a MACROSS hit. Not only the style animation but several character drawings. For example all the girls in this movie look like LYN MIND in MACROSS. The Mechs looks similar to MACROSS as well as the other characters. This is really not done for small children, it has graphic violence, nudity and graphic content. So make a brief short story to give this cool MACROSS hit-off 7 STARS.
