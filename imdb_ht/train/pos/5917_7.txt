Streetfight (aka Coonskin) is a very unique film directed by puppet animation Ralph Bakshi. It is a peculiarity of the cinema, and it is very much worth seeing. It is live mixing action and animation, seemingly influencing Disney's legendary legend in the South, almost as if it is a response to flickering films. Philip Michael Thomas, later Don Johnson's sidekick on Miami Vice, and Scatman Crothers, whose most famous role in Kubrick's brightness, is to escape prison. Charles Gordone and Barry White (yes, Barry White) are Thomas's friends and plans to help him escape prison. They are stuck in a police path, and Crothers tells Thomas a story about a black rabbit, a bear, and a fox that moves from the south to Harlem in order to find a more peaceful existence. The story is animated, and it gives many things to see. Like all the Bakshi films, most will be annoyed and will be influencing the animation. True animation lovers will pardon its clowns and fall in love with its inventive. The movie is very violent, very sexual, and it's mostly about fighting between races. For a long time, I thought I was looking at something very important, but after a while, especially after I made it look, it started to look more like a run-of-the-mill-blacks-run movie , on the lines of Superfly. It's very sloppy and does not really say anything. Besides, is not Bakshi white? Whatever the answer to that, Coonskin / Streetfight is still very much worth looking for animation films as well as movie cult fans. 7/10.
