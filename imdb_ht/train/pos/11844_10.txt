I started riding justice fairly lately, and, as anyone who ever got up dogs should know, I fell in love with horses and their world. I lean spirit on a whim, just trying to pack my life full of horse material-related as much as I could, and I was amazed by the results. <br /> <br /> What I was hoping was a feeling-good Disneyesque movie and animals talking to stereotypes every five minutes. <br /> What I got was an amazing movie, filled with beautiful scenery and animation, with an amazing storyline that has the potential of the hot one's heart. <br /> Spirit is a wild Mustang in the Old West, whose whole world has brought down to him when he discovers people to gently take over his land. The story unfolds with a wide array of characters, some people, some animals, all are well written and most are nice to look on the screen. <br /> I would recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys a good story, with an appreciation for stories and animals. One thing I forgot to mention, but that I feel important is that the animals in this movie do not speak. This was a really nice vacation from the Lady and Animated Movie that everyone today used to.
