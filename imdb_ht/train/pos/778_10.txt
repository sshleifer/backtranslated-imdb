I'm not much of an expert on acting or other film, but this film just hit me deep. I do not think I'll ever forget it. A scene especially (I think anyone who saw the movie will know which one I'm talking about) is printing my brain. <br /> I also watched the movie as Lilja 4-ever (as referred to by a previous commentator). It was also very moving, but not quite as straight to the point and brutal. If you are tender at all, either will wear tears in your eyes, but Anjos Do Sol (Angels in the Sun) can stay with you forever. <br /> This is very depressive subject matter, but I think, no, I hope the movie succeeds in bringing more attention to it. <br /> <br /> More people need to see this movie !!!!!!
