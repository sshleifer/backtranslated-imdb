"Point Match" and now "Scoup" was both convinced that not only is Woody Allen doing a neat job to make movies in England (and that Scarlett Johansson is the right cast member), but koroborated what I've read is for years: it should not focus on wealthy New Yorkers. In this case, Johansson plays journalist student Sondra Pransky, whom South Waterman (Allen) magician puts in his disappearance box, where he meets the ghost of assassin Joe Strombel (Ian McShane), who tells her that the killings series which was plagued by London being committed by millionaire Peter Lyman (Hugh Jackman). So, she gets to know her, and ... well, I do not know how much I can tell you without giving it away. But I can say that this is probably Allen's movie movie in the years. There is its unique ubiquitous style of humor (especially the line of religion). So, you're sure this movie. If nothing else, it will make you fall in love with London. But mostly, it's just for hilarious humor. Even if you do not like Woody Allen, you have to love this one.
