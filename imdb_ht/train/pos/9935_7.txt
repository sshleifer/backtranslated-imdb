My name is Domino Harvery. {EDIT * dizzying * CHOP} I - I - my name is Domino Harvey. {CUT, CHOP} My name is Domino Harvey. {EDIT. CUT. Playback} <br /> I never saw a director taking flack much for his style before. From now on it is obvious that most people do not appreciate Tony Scott's death, flashy, dizzying modifications. If I have to choose between her love and hate her, I would say I love her. It was bothered to distract at times, but the end result was very good and it's nice to see a director with a creative edge in his style and some originality (though he borrows heavily from MTV video). This stylist corner manifests itself as Keira Knightley plays the role of badass bounty hunter bounty hunter Domino Harvey and even his dialogue looks strange COPY. Otherwise it plays it wrong because I pretty much hate her character and does not sympathize with her little bit with her, no matter how much she suffered. We follow Domino through her life as she joins fellow bounty hunter Mickey Rourke, Rizwan Abbasi and Edgar Ramirez. The team gets tangled into the FBI and suddenly has a reality show under Christopher Walken's TV production company (what Christopher Walken is doing in every movie, by the way?). I guess it's a clever movie technique, because now Tony Scott is free to use as much MTV flashlight / Reality Show Foot correction as he likes. It has become a pasty of MTV culture at this point. <br /> It follows then that the story is said at a swiftly rapid-fire speed, and lots of raunchy strong tongue and gun violence. There are some funny jokes; it's all modern and surreal at the same time. It's a mess, but it's a rather enjoyable mess. It is ultimately flawed in many ways (the actors try too hard to make the characters "cool" for one), but it works. I give it a weak 7/10 that may seem generous when compared to the general consensus of movie actors who have been ranked this movie ?? but I feel he has some good ideas and executes them well. <br /> 7 out of 10
