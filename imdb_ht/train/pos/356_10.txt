Turned out to have a stylish production and that had to be a low budget. The character's variety is amazing, from limb-touch to limit 7ft ghouls! I enjoyed the relationship between driving, not too sentimental, but romantic enough to keep the interest going. I also enjoyed the mixture of humor (which can be very easy to get wrong, too much / not enough) which means that he did not get too dark or too spoofy. It was a great step up from other Eaves, Hellbreeder and Sanitarium efforts, in terms of scenarios and production. They have a great website that is worth checking out. Can not wait for mess, if the level of improvement continues, it should be fantastic.
