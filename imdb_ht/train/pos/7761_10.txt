*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** Released in 1956, and considered quite stingy at the time, the Douglas Circus on the candy-colored top candy is still something wonderful. The concern scheme goes on in a wealthy Texas dysfunctional family that includes big brother Kyle, who is insecure, weak, injured & very alcoholic, played by Robert Stack in a very touchy and vulnerable performance with his Marylee sluty sluty, played in an extreme way by Dorothy Malone. Madonna Malone's performance is telegraphed for us through her eyes, which she uses to show her emotions, mainly composed of lust (for Rock Hudson) and jealous (for Lauren Bacall). Malone is the only actress I've ever seen in movies that come in first glance. Now, do not get me wrong, performance says the least is absolute absolute, and is one of the supreme camps acting in the 1950s. But it is also awful, because as love and attract as Malone is, it's not a very good actress, and it can not be subtle or shadow. Performace it is in a note. He finds a wicked Mambo, and in a great assembly, like dad father who is still not good Robert Keith falls to his death by climbing a staircase, Sirk mixes it with an almost angry malone to make an orgasmic dance as he strip. Stack (which should have an Oscar) & Malone, (who won the award, but should not have) are the real stars of the movie, the ones that put all the hysteria, both sexual and otherwise in motion, while "real stars" of the movie, Hudson & Bacall fade gray and brown, which are the colors that they are especially costumed in. Hudson was a better actor then given credit for childhood play & pies good friend of the stack, and the strangle love interest in the malone that moans & groan on most rock in the movie. But Hudson does not want any part of it, and instead is in love with Bacall who is married to Stack. No one is very happy and no one is happy for a lot of time. The Stack-Bacall wedding falls apart from great time after a year, and Stack pretty much drinks herself into oblivion because she thinks it is sterile, and can not give Bacall a baby to prove it's a man. Circus who was a very clever man, and had a long and captivating career both in film and theater in Germany, ended his Hollywood career in the Universe in the 1950s and a series of intense bright colors "women's film they "or melodrama. Although they were mostly adapted from medicines or trashy source material, from the circus they became prince of the genre. Circus has a wonderful sense of color and design that he leads to play in these films to fill his age screen space and characters that played out emotional lives among unusual colors & lighting, making shadow, and many mabroid reflections . In the "Writing" characters are always peeking out of the windows, listening to door or sneaking around. So, in the end, after much violence, an accidental murders, a miscarriage & more circus ends the movie with a final and thrilling scene of a "reborn" and reforming Malone in a man-made costume, sitting in a fundamentals of a miniwell oilwell.
