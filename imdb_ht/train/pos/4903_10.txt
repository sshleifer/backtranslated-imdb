Inspired at least a bit by Ivy Benson & All Girl Orchestra, which has been doing throughout the year wars at the Covent Opera House House, this film Story attempts are not a senior Saxophone player to reform (almost) all the girls' band with whom she played as a schoolgirl towards the end of WWII. All the flashbacks on the original strip on stage bring us some wonderful music, and help fill in the background of the band members, and in particular the girls' relationship with the Allone Allen - Transvestite Troubled (who is trying Dodge the call-up) <br /> <br /> Ian Holm ("Lord of the Rings", "Cromwell and Fairfax") and Judi Dench turned into superb performance as leading Elizabeth, the conniving, facial Patrick, the drummer. Joan delayed Sims is perfect as the band leader, now playing piano at the seafront, and Jen Whitfield is growing up as the Salvation Army trap player. The emergence of Cameo by other growns like Cleo Laine, Leslie Caron, Olympia Dukakis and Billie Whitelaw make this an unforgettable experience. This film is a memory lane, which has a whole star cast in what must, not all right, to be a bunch of over-the-hill actresses. All I can say is, I hope I look good at the ages! Leslie Caron, in particular, is still an incredible fox, at 69 years of age. She certainly always gets my heart down! As I looked at her, I was mentally speaking to the Director of Distribution for not using women at the appropriate age. And I watched these girls up and discovered that each one of them is old enough to be done in London in 1944 (although this might be a bit of a stretch of Judi Dench). If you love swing bands, shine on nostalgia, or just want to see how good a woman can manage to look and almost three-quarters of a century behind her, do not miss this movie.
