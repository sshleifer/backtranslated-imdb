Cowboys James Stewart and Walter Brennan took the animals from Seattle in Alaska and over to Canada to file a claim. Once there, they have sustained and seductive, Ruth Roman traders and ice-cold, happy-go-lucky wicked James McIntire. John Wayne can get talk about more, but it's pretty good Stewart to do some excellent, Westerns hard-side too, some with the great director Anthony Mann. Frankly, I would take this, with the sequence of its solid action and fine melodrama, on North Alaska any day! <br /> <br /> The far country features some breathtaking scenery and cinematography that should definitely be shot in widescreen. <br /> <br /> Also, some solid support by Brennan is still reliable, Roman (who's great), Credine Calvet's incredibly beautiful, and James McIntire, who plays one of my favorite types, of bad guys, the kind that does not take it too seriously. This would make a huge double-bill and another highly recommended Man / Stewart northwestern-western west, bend in the river.
