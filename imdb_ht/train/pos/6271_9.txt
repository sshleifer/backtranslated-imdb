I liked this movie. It was very cool. It has it all: cars, shooting weapons, fighting, and even a girl sign. It does not excel in any of these, with the exception of the machines. A bit of shooting, a bit of battle, a bit of smooching around, and lots of cars, and a great chase near the end. The jump, you can say, is impractical, but according to our good friends here at the IMDB it is possible, so film is not as bad as people painted it. He had some qualities, and I liked to look at him. In fact, I loved the movie. And I did not need to close my brain to watch it. I did not always think "Is it possible?" or tramp like that. 9 of 10.
