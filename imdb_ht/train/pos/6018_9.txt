I saw this in the early 70s (when I was 16), and despite the slow slowing slow down, meetings, riots, etc., once the desert section began to fall into context and I loved it. (Always done, he was very good old age.) Then I was in what seemed to be a tiny minority. All critics seemed to focus on the lack of action and narrative. Fortunately, I'm no longer in such a minority. He has deftly shown (in a somewhat prophetic way) the politics, agitation, confrontation, brutal repression, commercialization and deception that lie ahead. <br /> <br /> Appreciation for this movie mayor has grown, and I am happy about that.
