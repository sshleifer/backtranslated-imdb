A really sweet film that has some similarities in 2001-hit "My Girl Sassy", but is able to enchant most of the time. The biggest opaque should go to the two leads. Ha-Neul Kim is both sweet and original, Sang-woo Kwon is both attractive and rebel. The chemistry between the two is very good. Director Kyeong-hyeong Kim uses some CG-inserts to pepper up the visuals and also offers impressive battle scenes in which Sang-woo Kwon can shine. I loved her a lot better here than in the very covered "Volcano High". And this boy has a future - these looks, these techniques fight, and a romantic lead. Not bad. <br /> Well, I can do it briefly: Nice movie. Rating points: 7/10
