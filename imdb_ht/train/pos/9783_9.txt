How would you say that fishing, and its complex narrative to deal with a multitude of issues, is "a small TV idea" is beyond me. In addition I can think of many films that have "a small TV idea" of the plots. Your obvious flu in the television industry ("Sue Smith has failed to rise above his TV background") is confusing. Particularly as you have such a "great time" working on television. If only we all could be talented as Ms Smith (no, I'm not a friend or relative) - AFI award winning Bridges in Christ, Road from Coorain, etc. Everything was done for TV. Come to think of it, what about these other "small TV ideas" such as "The Wind", "Bodyline", "Dismissal", "Balance of Justice", "Blue Assassins", "Water Under the Bridge ", etc. I think Peaches is a good movie movie that I was interested, and most of my friends as well, from start to finish. It is far from unprecedented yet I think it is among the best Australian films I've seen over the past couple of years. Who knows, with a few more watches (there is plenty to think about), it might just be up there with classics such as "My Voice Year Break", "The Devil's Playground". I really enjoyed this movie much more than "Somersault" and "Three Dollars". These films, I think, had the moments of surreal, atmospheric, realistic and faced with important contemporary issues, but as for absolute entertainment for mr.and mrs average movie films and me, it was very ordinary if not bored . When I went to a movie, I was always aware of the reaction of the audience in a movie (through reactions to movies and hearing conversations in the hostel and loo). Some out of Peaches shake their heads, some with negative criticism, but many seemed to enjoy the experience.
