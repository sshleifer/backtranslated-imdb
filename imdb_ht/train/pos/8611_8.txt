I really enjoy watching this movie. I was stuck in her watch while I could look at her later. I actually liked the second look since I was able to absorb more of the clever dialog between Natalie and Adam, the 2 main characters. I thought this way was evolving very thought-provoking stories. I was very intrigued and how Natalie went on to interact with her daughter's friend, at first it seemed that she went to spew a lot of animosity but once he started to communicate more enjoyable I had to see how this visit has gone to unfold. I was not disappointed. Gradually the secrets Sarah kept from her mother began to reveal a daughter that was not so perfect, a defective person was like most of us who wanted her freedom from a dominant mother who thought she knew her daughter, but unfortunately learned of a lot of pain that sometimes really loves someone you have to give them freedom. The viewers that stick to this movie in the end see a very touchy performance from Diane Keaton (who is still wonderful, even in some of her less well-received film-thinking towns and countries). The scene close to Diane Keaton driving home was well worth waiting for, revealing that anyone who loves someone else had to learn that we have to live our own lives, we love others, but not their own and finally we must let go. It is a difficult but well worthy lesson now and then .Thank you CBS for this broadcast, it's worth to wait long.
