I would imagine that if Steve McQueen knew he would go on to become an icon and start "Wanted: The Living Dead" even this year to film out, or to be in fluff the seven years later, he would not do it . But he did, and we are the richest of it. Make sure you are a classic camp. Horrors the way it meant to be driving-in the theater. It is fun and nostalgic. It is interesting that the last lines in the movie were: <br /> <br /> Lieutenant Dave: At least we had it stopped. Steve Andrews: Yeah, as long as the Arctic remains cold. <br /> They would never imagine 52 years ago that the Arctic would be thawing. The pate will be quick to return.
