I also am quite surprised to see how some people have voted on this movie, and just wrote something about it, although my comments are quite similar to those already written .. I love the movie. The superb act between Mastroianni & Loren. The way the film narrates: Humanity and love slowly develop between these aliens, and contrary to the same and continuously continuous market tomorrow walk through the fascist radio announcement (which happens to be a colleague of the party Mastroianni) and coherent they "go in and come out of the show". For me this is a very good movie about what it is to be human. Maybe some of us would argue that the anti-fascal "message" too clearly delivers, but I did not destroy the movie in any way. My vote is 10/10.
