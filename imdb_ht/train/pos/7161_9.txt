Liked the movie. Love the family cross the path of history. The only question is whether Sam gets killed then how does his family line line continue? Is her son Zeron's wife and zero supposed to be related but no mention of any other child? Hmmmmmmmmm. Never mention any other child before talking with and falling in love with the teacher? Maybe she had a baby before getting Kate Bandit kissed? Even with the errors of the movie. Just love it. The act was great. Not sure where the story was with Mr. Sir being a woman Marion in the end, but making her character funnier. The other "adviser" seemed to be concerned for the kids, but of course perhaps not so much. Poor Warden must have had a really stinky child to say so when he grew up.
