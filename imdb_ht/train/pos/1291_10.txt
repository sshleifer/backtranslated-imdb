This is a good movie. Something fun about watching money be blown at a super rate, especially from a kid's point of view. Take it for what it is, a fun little movie about a kid's dream come true, and what a kid can do with $ 1 million. Do not like it, do not look it. They make movies for monitors, not those who have nothing better to do then complain to their lives.
