... here comes the Romeo Division to change the paradigm. Let me just say that I was white away by this short film. I saw her, random, when I was in Boston at a movie festival and thank God for her everyday. I really, really believe I was part of a happening, like reading a Tarantino script before anything else did or saw the first screening at Streets Mean. <br /> I'm not sure what the short festival was headed to next or what the creative team has on tapes for future products, but so I hope I can be there for it. <br /> Again, a really incredible piece of movie making.
