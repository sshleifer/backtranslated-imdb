This is not Robin Williams's comedic, nor is it the original / crazy Robin Williams of fame thriller. This is a hybrid of the classic drama without over-dramatization, mixing with Robin's new love in the thriller. But this is not a thriller, each is. This is more a mystery / suspense machine in which Williams tries to find a sick boy and his guard. <br /> <br /> Also begin Sandra Oh and Rory Culkin, this Drama plays very nice as a news report, until William's characters come close to achieving his goals. <br /> I must say that I was very entertained, though this movie fails to teach, guide, inspect, or entertain. He felt more like I was watching a guy (Williams), as he actually did the actions, from a perspective perspective. In other words, it felt real, and I could subscribe to the quote of the story. <br /> <br /> All in all, it's worth a look, though it's definitely not Friday / Saturday night fare. /> <br /> It rates a 7.7 / 10 from ... <br /> <br /> The Fiend:.
