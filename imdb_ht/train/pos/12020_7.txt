The last hard guys found James Coburn a bandit making a long break free phrase in a chain gang. Do he and his friend's head for the Mexican border out of prison and security. No are not because Coburn has a mission of revenge. To kill the peace officer who led him in and in the process of killing her woman. <br /> <br /> That peacekeepers are Charlton Heston who is now retired and knows what Coburn is after. As he explained to his daughter, Barbara Hershey, Coburn was wound up in a shack and was involved in such an extended Waco. Her Indian woman was killed in the hail of bullets. It's not something he's proud of, it's a collateral accident in a manhunt. <br /> <br /> If we feel sorry for Coburn it allows us to know full well what an evil man it really is. Heston is his usual unusual, but the honors act in the hardest men guys go to James Coburn. It blows everyone else on the screen when it's over. Coburn gets the bright idea of ​​making Heston sure to trail him by kidnapping Hershey and taking it to an Indian reservation where the white authorities can not touch him. He knows that Heston made it personal then. Coburn's Gang includes: Morgan Paull, Thalmus Rasulala, John Quade, Larry Wilcox, and Jorge Rivero. Heston has Chris Mitchum along with his son-in-law to be. <br /> <br /> Last Hard Men are one nasty and brutal western one. Andrew McLaglen directed her and I thought she could be an original project intended for Sam Peckinpaugh. It certainly shows its influence with the use of liberal movements slowly to accentuate violence. In which there are many. <br /> For a small Peckinpaugh struggle, the last hard guys are your movie.
