Thieves Baghdad is a treasure. First and foremost, it's a good story. Even though my four children's main exhibits in this story, most popular in the stories of the Arab Nights, came from the Disney Corporation, the thief in Baghdad held their interest in the end. The story moves together at a fast pace and includes a twist or two that reduces predictability. Sabu, who plays the young thief, Abu, also measures up to any of today's young actors in appeal, judging from the number of times I heard my oldest daughter say, "It's c-u-t-e!" <br /> <br /> In 1940, the film won Oscars for movies and special effects. Today, of course, these effects seem very dating ("Look, it's Barbie flying in the air," declared my daughter in the eye of the engineering fly). But they fit into the story well. The movie is, after all, over 60 years old. Effects fit with the script. In addition, what is seen in the thief in Baghdad remains pretty state-of-the-art for the next twenty-five years. One only needs to compare the opening mount from a 1967 Star Trek to see. At that, it was quite a success. <br /> <br /> This qualifies as a family movie, though there are a few couples near the end. The act is so obvious and the blood flow as these almost as artificial as animation scenes. <br /> In all, a fun movie is worth looking for either an evening of entertainment, or for the historical value of the effects. I recommend it.
