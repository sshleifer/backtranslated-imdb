*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** <br /> <br /> This movie, the "divers", is really interesting. All I knew about it was that it would involve Nazi history, underwater scenes and everyone should speak Danish. But I decided to check it out for a reason, the fact that the story evolved around a submarine WWII German submarine. I had a German fetish aboard, especially debris that could dive on. So I was a bit skeptical about the Danish part, but to reason that the sub could squeeze that part. Knowing that Nordic films are not always good and are not sure of the size of my budget, they say at least, very uncertain. <br /> <br /> When you look I was ... surprised. <br /> <I had some thoughts about the actors being inappropriate, seeing how some are very young, of the main actors in particular. This was not a problem, they both did very well. As other actors, mainly composed of 50 people and beyond. This makes for some interesting interactions between young and old, not often seen on the screen. Not unique in anyway but somewhat scarce. And it's all right. <br /> As for the Danish language, it is almost impossible to understand. But that was no problem, having subtitles. Another problem was submarine in itself, I suspect would have inner vaccine as well as underwater vaccine vaccine in the submarine. Having decided that the budgets were thin, I thought this might turn out the best adder and down the terrible right into it worst. Again I was surprised, the exterior scenes of the wreck are beautiful and the interior scenes are very realistic. Having a german German fetish, I knew what the sub would look like, especially inside, and not left down. The team does some serious research. It's all right. <br /> I suspect more people than I'll watch this movie just to see some submarine scene so I feel I must give a "warning." The submarine in the movie is not a real model that exists during the war. It is a special special target. But give you a hint of what to expect, it's a cross between a Type VII, Type IX and a Japanese sub subway similar to I-52. She's a good design and make a beautiful wreck. The setting is on a Danish island or peninsula, I can not remember. It's summer and two brothers go to grandfathers to celebrate the coming summer as they do each year. The grandfathers are a marine of quality. The cinematography is quite beautiful, a lot of beautiful summer scenes in the islands dock, some love newfound teens, beautiful diving time and a general feeling of "perfect". Again, it's all right. <br /> <br /> The plot-wise island has become some visitors to the suspicious type, a gathering of people hired one of the boats, an old minesweeper and his crew. One of the visitors, a man in his 50's, has the German eagle and swastika tattoo on his back. The elderly citizens all remember when a German U-boat flowed towards the end of World War II and ever since then there were rumors of gold nazi in the depths. The grandfather was one of the young men who had searched for the u-ships shortly after German body started floating on land back in 1945. No submarine was ever found. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> *** WARNING - SPOILER *** <br /> <br /> I did not expect some elements of the supernatural to appear in this movie and she kept me in custody. Not a big fan of supernatural events, it does not matter well in the story and poses no problems. It's not like "From dusk to dawn" where everyone comes to vampires towards the end. This is a bit more subtle. <br /> OVERALL: Really good movie, I gave it an 8. Due to the fact that it is not a Hollywood movie with unlimited resources. I later learned that he had a fair budget and that some of the actors were seasonally Danish veterans. But even though this had a Hollywood production, I would give it a 7 or 8. Define worth while you. Yes, a child's story in a way, but then again a mature story. He had a lot of suspense and a grand Aura of adventure, which I found to be very appealing. And, again, the movie is really nice. <br /> <br /> / Medusa 2001 <br /> <br />
