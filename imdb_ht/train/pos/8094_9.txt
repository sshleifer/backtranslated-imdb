First of all, the adaptation is never as good as the book, especially when dealing with master writers like Tolkien. This adaptation works with the miracle of the Tolkien Universe and the 1970s psychedelia, aesthetics, and liberal culture. Yes - the animation and background painting is sometimes a little "rough" in its technical execution, but it's nice No less, and very evocative in terms of giving a unique "sense of spot" in each of the scenes . Furthering the absolute insignia of imagery is the utterly exceptional voice acting - this superior act of acting in the new live movies. And while the cell animation might not be the most "technically competent" animation it superbly captures the expressive body gestures and facials of acting while at once do not forget to be subtle and nuanced. The background paintings vary from traditional "fantasy" motifs abstraction outright, but the transition to remedial settings is constantly motivated by the narrative and contributes greatly to the themes of the movie. If you are a person who has to have extensive computers in a movie so that everything is visualized for you then I can see how you would not like this movie, but if you enjoy superior acting, transcendental, and JRR Tolkien then this movie is a must see.
