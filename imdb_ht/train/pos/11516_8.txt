I'm not an accomplice to John Cleese (although I thought "Fawlty Towers was brilliant), but I'm a fan, and when I saw this sit down, neglecting, on a rack of my local blockbuster, I decided to give it a try What I got was a wonderful surprise, and one of the 50 minute minute watching experiences I've ever been writing. The writing is typical English "goon show" schtick. In fact, as an audio skit, this would not from place to place on a "firesign theater" album.But the execution and distribution is the place on this "unusual" breed of type jaw-dropping performance that creates fans inside British trading. <br /> <br /> Brits They have a gift to combine satirical linen and closely observe "ticks" of character and timing, and the creators use both good effect here. The Cleese's paintings in "Holmes" seem to be plenty of Arkin's and "Inspector Clouseau" The seller, however Cleese has such a talent for physical comedy that he more than keeping his own. But the unexpected treat here is Arthur Lowe, who plays "Watson" as a jalously but invincible uncomprehending impenetrable and as superb distribution and delivery that it becomes the best aspect of the movie. I'd never heard of Lowe before this (his background looks like vaudeville and theatrical music), but he justifies all his career with this performance as far as I'm concerned. <br /> <br /> Some people would not be able to care for "unusual ...", especially if they are brutally capricious is not their "cuppa tea". But I'm very pleased I got to see this before it disappears in sight.
