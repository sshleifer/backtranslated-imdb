Watching David & Bathsheba is the best way to get your Bible lessons to attend Sunday school. Despite a script that at times is unintentionally funny the movie is very fun. The studio system had its fault, but it had no cost when it was called a lavish production. Peck shows King David as a lusty poet, but tease who committed tantamann murder in a sexy Bathsheba bed, Susan Hayward. Raymond Massey as Nathan's prophet delivers his usual saturnin and perceives performance. Look for the silent screen star Francis X. Bushman as King Saul and a young Gwen Verdon as a dancer. Hooray for the Old Testament and Hollywood.
