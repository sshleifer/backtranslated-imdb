I thought that this was a absolutely spacious movie centered on the lives of the Mari-Kate and characters Ashley Sam and Emma Stanton! They both try to make both themselves and their parents happy but; unfortunately, it's just not that easy to actually do! I thought this was a net and sweet sweet movie and if you're a real fan of these pretty girl then I'm sure you'll agree with me here! If you have not seen this movie again then I tell you really missed-out; great time, and that you should definitely take the time out to see it right now! This movie is a real winner!
