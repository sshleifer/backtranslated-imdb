The movie celebrates life. The world is setting itself up for the innocent and soul pure and everything has "Happy End", just like in the closing scenes of the movie. The movie has wonderful soundtracks, mix of neofolk Serbian, gypsy music and jazz. This film is very refreshing piece of visual poetic. <br /> <br /> The experience of watching is like you 'You've sucked into another colorful, romantic and sometimes rough world. <br /> Like Mr. Kusturica movie should be.
