Does any help help find the title and artist in the song, which played at least half of the movie. I can not remember what scene was playing. The words in the song are in a ballad. Some of the lyrics go like "It's way to tell you somethings wrong." It's nature way of saying it in a song. "It's the way to forgive you. "Please help me with this question. Many thanks ... I've been searching the internet for days, I can not get this song from me so now this will challenge me to get some one out which can help me with this affair. I wish I would pay attention to the scene when he played.
