What can someone say about Elvira who had not previously spoken in the world? The classic comedy that Elvira delivers in his first full-length budgets budget budgets. From the first frame frame frame, Elvira packs a punch acting that clearly tells Great Film .... eat your heart out, Bette Davis! See an Elvira forlorn, see an excitant Elvira, see an Elvira jealous, see an Elvira murder. You can do anything but wonder of the ability to act it! <br /> In the heart of this comedy masterpiece is Elvira's desire for Las Vegas show stars. Despite putting the "boobtube back into the boobtube" as a horror host (and the most), Elvira found the small emotional constructive screens .... and PHYSIC! Nuff said, he packs up his kit and head east .... a hotdog in one hand and a letter from his adventurous attorney who shows his erip 'fall' to the other. <br /> I saw this movie many times, I can almost recite it verbatim .... (verbal was just for the show)! <br /> Grab a copy, laugh yourself unusual, learn the lines .... <br /> Why not have the best Oscar comedy for this role is beyond me.
