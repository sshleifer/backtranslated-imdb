This was the second of three films that Irving Berlin wrote for the Astaire-Rogers franchise and it has by far the highest score and it's a bit unusual in that two of these numbers being played by Harriet Hilliard leaving the rest They must be divorced and / or shared between principals. As usual, the scenario does not need to keep us even though the file was based on a play, Shore Kite, which also served as the basis for a Broadway Music, hit the Deck. Anyone who actually saw Shore Kite in the theater might have been very moments bemused as the roles played by Fred and Ginger were created for the movie but that's important, as always, is the music, lyrics and hoofing is all from bottle right. It's a departure from the other titles of the franchise in that 1) we get to see Astaire playing the piano - in real life it was a accomplished pianist and several song compilations, one of which I built up in an awesome let-down , has been a lyric by Johnny Mercer and has spent a couple of weeks in the charts - and it is the only one in the series in which he played a serviceman, albeit an old hoofer who mobilized to the marine after they had finished Thrown by Ginger dancing partner before the story begins. It gets a little-known, but excellent Berlin number, I would rather take a band as well as duetting over I put all my eggs in one basket but the ultimate number is the prophetic - in 1936 rumbles in World War II was already felt - Let's face the music and dance, one of the most powerful ballads ever made by the team. So what if Randolph Scott is a little wooden and fish-out-of-water without either a horse or six-gun in easy reach and Harriet Hilliard does not exactly put the screen on fire; We came to see Fred and Ginger and the only question is, they are saved. Answer: In shovels.
