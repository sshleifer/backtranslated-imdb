I saw this film when I was 13 and I really liked dana plateau that later stared at different courses as kimberly drummond. I do not think it 's garbage .It was not meant to be an end to the documentary either. Its just a beautiful kids movie about 3 kids who go after people trying to find the boggy boggy monster. the guys get hurt and the children save them with the help of the creature .haunting shots in the Arkansas swamp and the scenery was clean. This is a good movie for kids, there is no real violence a few moderate but good fun kids fun kids.
