* I mark where there are flaws! General Comments: If you can take a serious movie, go see. Have an idea open and you will enjoy it. Do not let the theater because you get confused about what's going on! The film fits together nicely in the second half. I'll take my mother to see her again when the movie officially opens. <br /> I was lucky to see this in a screening a couple of weeks ago, when Will went around promoting the movie. It was great - spent much time with fans. Thanks for the photo going! On Will's Performance: A lot of times when you see a movie with a really famous actor for some other movie / show, you still think of them in their current performance as you think of them for their past performance. This is not the case with Will Smith in this movie. I did not picture the Fresh Prince (lol) when I watched this movie. He was completely and fully convinced of this very, very big role. He grew up as an actor. I think he will at least get a Oscar shake for this performance. <br /> <br /> On her character: Ben is very controversial and suffering. It's sad ... guilty-dog ... very determined, but very scary. Very true for himself. Her character has a lot of depth ... and somehow, they will manage to bring this life. About Emily (Rosario): Rosario has done a great job, Emily, a woman behind her tax. Perhaps it's not the shining star is in this movie, but it was very compelling. I think his character just did not have as much of work and as the will did. <br /> On the plot (no deflector): I admit that I do not like the movie until the second half of it. I knew absolutely nothing about the movie going to it, and nothing did make sense until the second part of it or that. But when things happen to fit together, wow. Surprisingly well written and well thought out. It's a very intense movie that really sticks to you. <br /> It actually takes a lot from you to watch. In the theater I was in, most people were crying towards the end - even adults. When you realize what Ben is doing, and why, it's a very powerful moment ... <br /> <br /> ******* Minor SPOILERS ***** That's why it's really hard to talk about The plot without giving things further. I feel overwhelmed about this movie really breaking it. There was a lot of symbols in the film that I enjoyed, though. I'll mention some of it here (without trying to give much away). <br /> <br /> -The fish that Ben has caught in his hotel room. At first, it does not make any sense. There was a lot of chatter in the movie theater when people realized the reality of the fish. <br /> I hated Ben at the start of the movie. At the end of her, I loved her and hated her. That's how convincing Will was. I thought Ben was a great hunchback to Ezra, a blind man just trying to make his way into the world. Why he was treated Ezra as well became much clear later in the movie. Wait it out though. Everything in this movie: Wait it out. <br /> <br /> -Ben is a basically good person who made a big mistake that he will not forgive himself. It's always clear if he did what he did because he tried to get rid of his own guilt, or if he really wanted to help people. I think he's a little bit of both ... I think he wants to help people, but also to get rid of his past. I love her character. You love her and hate her because you realize that what she is doing is nothing short of amazing. You hate her for doing so in her head (as a very good person), both physically and emotionally. Nice job Do.
