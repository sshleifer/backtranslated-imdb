I hate over-long French movie cinema, but my favorite movie of all time is longer and the talkiest French movie of them all. I saw it twice in the mid-70, and then it disappears. But I finally got to see her again in 1999, and fell in love all over again. What is most remarkable is that it feels every bit as cool today as it did 25 years ago. If you have not seen it, do not miss your chance!
