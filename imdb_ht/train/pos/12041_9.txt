This is a plain story of old ghostly spooky. I showed it to some of my friends in my movie club, and kept spellbound until the finish! There is no hundred or gore-just good old fashioned suspense. It starts from the beginning, and builds and builds. The finish is a real twist that keeps me unawares. <br /> Well directed and well-off. It is also a "piece piece" - set in the 1920s - has been added to the atmosphere. <br /> I was so impressed that I received the book by Susan Hill from Amazon. The movie follows the book rather than much. <br /> It's a shame it's not readily available on DVD. My copy is VHS. This along with "Haunted" are probably two of the best my stories ever had ever seen. That just goes to show that a little creativity outdoes "in your face" Gore any day!
