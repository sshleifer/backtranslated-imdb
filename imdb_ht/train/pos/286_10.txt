I read very much when he was in the theater and was all bad .... I think you have to make a certain kind of person to enjoy those movies. If you are not someone who enjoys the Waltons or Little House ... U will not understand and enjoy those movies ... <br /> <br /> Now, About Love Joy Joy ... I knew it was bad news from the start of the movie .... I wish it would show more in the end instead of leaving you just thinking it. This movie has lots of things to do with Jeff ... it's 6 years later so you know she'll be interested in girls. I mean that I enjoyed all 4 movies so far. ... Do not crazy about the books ... Do not wait until the next movie. How Clark's speech will do you every time. I would like to see January Jones make an appearance ... Maybe a family reunion or something.
