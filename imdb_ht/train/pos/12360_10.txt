I liked the movie. It is very well analyzed the Italian bourgeois society, how the leftists of the 70s gave up their ideal and come to a happy arrangement that they do not want to distract. For example, the aging psychoanalyst who is jealous of his own son, and does not want to remember in his more radical genes. <br /> <br /> For a long time wanted to buy the video after seeing the film a couple of times on the big screen and on TV, but it seems to have disappeared completely from the market, even in country Italy does not have one in the book shops known about the movie. a great pity. <br /> <br /> The one sex scene, which everyone seems to go on over, the movie has no harm.
