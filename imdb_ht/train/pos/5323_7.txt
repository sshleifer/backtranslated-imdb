There are a number of things that are incorrect, although this is not too important since what happened to people and when it is still in dispute. The most blatant freedoms and realities I think when they start playing at the Bruno Koschmidder Kaiserkeller, when in fact they played in the Indra and moved to Kaiserkeller later. <br /> I agree with Semprinni20 that the movie is favored in favor of the Best Burst version, but if it is the story consultant then I guess it's called the shots. I agree with Semprinni that the Best Play Recording plays on saying the last word on the subject why he fired. <br /> <br /> Although the film is not like a lavish production as the film later "Backbeat" I prefer this movie because it's more accurate, and because it has a better script and deeper characterization. There are many of the films that are quite substantial - as Brian Epstein tries to hide the fact that he was "queer-bashed," only to find out that the band knew he was Gay all along. Little touches like the band goes to a coffee shop and ordering "corn-flakes and milk." My favorite scene, which does have some Bassis in fact, is where at a Stuart Sutcliffe audition has just bought her bass guitar, but she can not play it, so she stands with her back to the ant try to fake it, but to keep up. This rolls rock 'n'. <br /> <br /> Well worth seeing.
