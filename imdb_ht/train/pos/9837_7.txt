Zombi 3 has an interesting story of it's done. Firstly, it is a sequel to Hit the Zombi 2 Fulci, and Zombi 2 itself was of course a marketing plot to trick people into thinking it was a late George Dawn Romero's death of the aka Zombi. Confusion enough? Basically, none of these films have anything to do with each other, but that cares about making money. I guess Fulci herself does not care about the production of half way through Zombi 3 when she decided to walk out. Bruno Mattei brought on board to help the movie pad and additional scenes to extend the time. <br /> <br /> Zombi 3 is your typical zombie ticket. Scientists have developed a serum on an island in the Philippines, stolen by terrorists to lead a plague, and zombies running amok. Scientists want to create an antidote, while the military is putting off everyone without prejudice. There are also short inserts of a radio DJ preached about how we treat the planet. <br /> <br /> Overall, I actually liked this movie. I hear horrible stuff, but I find the dialogue so very enjoyable. The film seems to be an attempt to raise awareness about pollution, military corruption, people playing God, etc. I get the feeling that this was at one point a serious film, but it jumped off in a strange, presumably way when Mattei came on board. <br /> In addition to cutting other zombie flicks, this was very reminiscent of the Crazies Romero. You hear the Radio DJ break the good news and, "When you see the guys in white suit and gas mask, Run to them for Help." This is of course played in the images of the guys in white gunning down zombies. And they just steal a scene from Crazies in which one of the regular, non-contaminated people were killed by mistake. <br /> The Gore Factor is very good at this one and hordes of zombies around every corner. How is it cool? Let me count 1 way? Zombies Birth 2. Fly Zombie Heads 3. Zombie Birds. 4. Zombies with no swimming pools in a pool. My favorite zombie was the machete-magnificent manic of the gas station. It was bad ass and almost broke all the building all trying to kill a girl. <br /> <br /> Favorite Quote ?? When a sergeant insists on a zombie cream, the scientists ask, "Do not you think once the ash is in the air, it will fall into the ground, and contaminate everything?" For which Sargender boldly replied, "Now you're talking science fiction." It continues to mention "Science Fiction" told the same scientists at the end when everyone died. <br /> <br /> Extras: Gallery, Trailer, and Interview, most notably the One and Mattei where he insists he has led 40% of the scenes, but can not remember that or any other important details. <br /> <br /> Under Line: A must see for zombies and fans of Fulci. <br /> Molly Celaschi www.HorrorYearbook.com MySpace.com/HorrorYearbook
