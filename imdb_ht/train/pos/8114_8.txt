If the scientists behave in such a way that H. G. Wells was confident in the future, history would not well have turned out the way he did in things to come. Almost 80 years ago, Wells wrote the fitness of things coming on that movie based and no closer to the world it described than before, in some ways further away. Players recognized as Raymond Massey, Ralph Richardson, and Cedric Hardwicke at the cast have more caricatures than real characters. It is the main weakness and the film, it's devoted to Wells's philosophy of science will solve all problems and the rest of us are crazy backwards. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Cedric Hardwicke is a doubt that people feel too far forward. And Ralph Richardson is a war that came from the destruction of another thirty years war with modern weapons. By the way as atomic bombs have not been invented, poisons have been judged to be weapons that almost destroyed humanity. <br /> According to Wells, science and conquests can never be mixed. Scientists as a group are far too much higher than the world of politics engage in things. Wells's life scientist certainly ran to fight the Fascistic governments of Hitler and Mussolini. These same people as in order to defeat them, subordinate themselves to the allies and fashionable atomic weapons that are unveiled in the modern age. If they behaved as Wells would like them, someone like Albert Einstein would have led a junta to scientists who would have established a new order after World War II. <br /> <br /> Wells did it wrong both in time and in development. It apparently never envisioned the computer as well as atomic power. Computer programmers are far more likely to be our leader in a brave new world than scientists at the time. Always these things come, helping towards William Cameron Menzies and the creations created to offer an exciting glimpse to yourself in H. Wells, certainly a respected thinker in his time though he did not quite get right shape of the things come.
