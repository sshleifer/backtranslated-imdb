The main reason to see this film is Warren William, who's head shape as the shyster campaign manager. It is electric, constantly finding ways to dig the public and defeat the opposite party in the middle of major disasters. William is a great actor - I feel that he has never received it due. Bette Davis as her lover also shines in an under-writing role. Personally, I found Guy Kibbee not quite right as the lame-brained candidate that William and others are trying to foal over the public. It seemed more like a blanket than anyone else. I'd rather see a real character positioning rather than a non-character. The story itself is plausible, funny and light. But Warren William and Bette Davis are well worth watching.
