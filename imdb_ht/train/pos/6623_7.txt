The first thing first, this movie is achingly beautiful. Someone who works on CG CG film as a lighter / composer, the visuals blow me away. Every second I was stunned by what was on screen As for the story, well, it's okay. It will not put the world on fire, but if you like your futuristic blade against you-to-buy (and not?) Then you'll be fine. <br /> I must say that I felt the voice act was particularly afflicted and detracted from the film as a whole. I saw it in the cinema in English, but I hope there is a French version floating around somewhere. <br /> <br /> Definitely worth seeing.
