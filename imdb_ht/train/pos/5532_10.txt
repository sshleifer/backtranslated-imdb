Maybe I'm partial in fox, fox story and all but I thought this was nice. <br /> I really enjoyed that it showed when Lily was not comfortable, like the fire and the room (trying not to spoil too much here). I think it's important for kids to see and try to understand. <br /> After reading some other comments I'm a bit confused, one says that at the end-spoiler - the mother and her son appeared, as she was one of telling her son about her story . The movie I saw did not have the mother or son to the end, simply a painting a girl with a fox. Can someone shine on that? Anyway I really enjoyed this movie, although some scenes may be a bit slow that would be difficult for high energy kids to sit down. Still worth it if they can sit still.
