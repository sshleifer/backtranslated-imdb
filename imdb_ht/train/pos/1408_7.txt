A Pentagon Science team seems to have perfected a serum that causes invisibility but when the lead plugin tries it out on itself it can not reverse the process. Frustrated and drunk with power, it turns the psychologist into the classic HG Wells tradition. <br /> This is a gleefully horrible man invisible man, rescued and relished by Verhoeven's ever-tasting and Bacon as genius-turned-looney-maniac. Like many of Verhoeven's works, it has a flawless sense of boy's-humorous comic book adventure (the underground secret laboratory where scientists work is just wonderful) combined with the most horrible visuals and sins (women in panties that they were groped and attacked by an invisible infamous, the beats beaten to death, literally gallant blood and wholesale killed at the last of the reels). Also, the story does not skip any new twists on an old idea, CG's special effects by Scott E. Anderson are eye-poppingly brilliant as we see vein and floor, cardiovascular system, muscles, tissues, bones and everyone literally appear from nowhere. In particular, a sequence where the team carries a gorilla back from the invisible state and scene where Bacon Devon Devane in a pool, they are absolutely breathtaking in the details and artistic inventions of their effects. The film also has a big band of Jerry Goldsmith and classic horror movie-film by Jost Vacano. The cast of genes is pretty much covered by the pedigree technique, but both Shue and Dickens are impressed from their depths. This is a great movie nasty movie.
