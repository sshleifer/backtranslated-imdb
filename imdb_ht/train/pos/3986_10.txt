I am a college student studying a level and needing help with comments from anyone who has any opinion at all about the theme of mothers in film, mom's. If you went to something similar or just want to comment and help me research more about this movie, any comment would greatly appreciate. Comments will be used solely for quizzes and will be included in my written exam. So if you have any input at all, im sure i can put them to use and you can help me get an A! I also study 'About a Boy' and 'Tadpol' so if you've seen these movies as well, I would appreciate it if you could leave comments on here on this page. Thanks.
