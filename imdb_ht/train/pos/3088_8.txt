Unfortunately for myself - I stumble over this late show in her life. I only hold a few episodes (about three) before it was canceled by ABC. I liked the characters, and scenario - but most of all the great actors! I was a fan of Sex and the City, so I saw two characters I recognized (Bridget Moynahan was & the character "Todd" was "Smith Jared"), as well as Jay Hernandez (From Way Carlito: Lift in power) and Erika Christensen (Swimfan). I like to watch young actors get them due, and felt like this show would push their career further along. I hope this at least gets out on DVD, and maybe WB will pick it for a second season sometime? In the meantime, I watched ABC's website in the beginning.
