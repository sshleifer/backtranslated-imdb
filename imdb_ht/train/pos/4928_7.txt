Given its time of release, the story that unraveled in 1950 'panic' panic in the streets was hardly a surprise. The body of an illegal mysterious immigrant was found and passed on as a nobody until further examination of a public health inspector who claims the corpse to carry a strain of bubonic epidemic. But with the current drama in the world today, this strangely helps this movie appear credible for today's viewers. The cast and crew are impeccable. Richard Widmark in his first role after performing his tools at 'Night and the City,' Jack Palance in his first debut film, also starring in this film is Paul Douglas with a young (and rather beautiful) Barbara Bel Geddes . A whole kill of incredible, non-professional actors (typical of Kazan director) filling in the remaining cracks. Elia Kazan directed, Joe MacDonald's film (he would later work with Richard Widmark again in 1953 at Superior High 'Pickup on South Street') and great Alfred Newman's score. Almost everyone who participated here has done better work, 'panic on the streets' is well looked at rewarding, however. Especially for the film-noir enthusiast.
