I really liked this movie and this made the audience that I saw and in Los Angeles. After the film, many people wept and told how many films were affected. I can see why he was such a big hit in his country, Sweden. The mastery film is directed with every brilliant character drawn so that in the end you really know those people and care about them. The music is very natural and the main song of the heartbreaking but inspiring movie. Would definitely recommend this movie for everyone to see - even those who do not usually go to subtitled films. Definitely deserve the Oscar nomination because of the profound themes of the movie reflected without pretense in a small-city community and people every day. It is a movie that unite us into this world to divide and show us the potential of the human spirit. You must see!
