I can not believe that people are looking for a draw in this movie. This is Laural and Hardy. Illuminated up already. Of these were a riot. Funny comics are as funny today as it was 70 years ago. Not a dirty word from either silence and being able to hold audiences at points. The comedians were not sophisticated by any stretch. If a cushioned cushion can not make you grin, there is no reason to look at any of the things that men did. It was a simpler time, and people laughed at things that were funny without a draw. I guess it takes a simple idea to enjoy this thing, so I'm eligible. Two comedy man teams do not calculate, We're just too sophisticated ... Are we not lucky?
