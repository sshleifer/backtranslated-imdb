Well, "Cube" (1997), Vincenzo's first film, was one of the most interesting and challenging ideas I've ever seen when talking about movies. They were just one scenery, a bunch of actors and a sketch. So what made it so special were all the effective directions, great dialogue and a bold condition that characters faced like rats in a maze. His second film, "Cypher" (2002), was all about its history, but it's not as good as "Cube" but here the characters were tested as rats again. <br /> <br /> "Nothing" is something very interesting and becomes Vincenzo coming back to his 'cubic day', blocking the characters once again in a very different space with no time once more Playing with the characters like playing with rats in an experimental room. But instead of a sci-fi thriller (even some of the promotional ads and countless trailers seemed like that), "Nothing" is a loose comedy and light that can be sure to call a modern satire on our society and also on the world of intolerance we live. Again Vicenzo surprised us with a great idea of ​​such a kind of thing. 2 actors with a white whitening storyline, that's all you got most of the time and you do not need more than that. While "Cube" is a clostrophobic and confusing "Cypher" experience, "Nothing" is completely opposite, but at the same time desperate. This film proves once again that a smart idea means more than just a millionaire budget. Of course, the movie fails sometimes, but its first idea means a lot and offsets any flaws. There is nothing more to be said about this movie because everything is a brilliant surprise and a totally different experience that I've had in movies since "cube".
