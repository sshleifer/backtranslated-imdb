That was definitely the case with the Angels of the Outfield. She was on TV last night and I believe I had not seen the movie since my sophomore year in high school and I'm currently in my college 4th grade. Although the movie has many flaws, it is just for touching that you can not help but sit, watch it, and enjoy yourself. It is also hilarious. Daniel Glover is just over the head that you can not help, but laughs loudly at him in most time. She adds to the movie and I'm sure it's exactly what the director wanted. You actually feel for the characters in the movie though the development is not the best. A must see. I highly recommend. <br /> <br /> 8/10
