SPOILERS <br /> <br /> A friend told me that NEXT MOVIE was the best Cheech & Chong flicker and came out of his way to lend me to BLUES brothers. NEXT MOVIE has no scheme, no rhythm, really has nothing to define a movie ... but it's funny. And for it is worth, Cheech and Chong show some heart. <br /> Well, in this little paragraph I put in the plot, but being that fifth of the movie, nothing happens that would usually begin a story. I'll just say Cheech's cousin shows up. <br /> <br /> There was no other funnier moment when Chong did Cheech drink twice? What about the rooster? Is Pee-Wee Herman's first appearance? You should watch the movie yourself to enjoy it. I do not think NEXT MOVIE has strong enough balls to make it awesome, but the film has heart and hey, my friends let me lend it to be a 7.
