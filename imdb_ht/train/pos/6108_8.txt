I enjoyed this movie very much. Many Korean people feel familiar with this movie because many of them have their teachers when they go to school. Quotes were average. The film would be best if the angel or camera movement was more irregular. Correction, however, was very good and unusual. <br /> <br /> The act was also very good. Kim Haul has usually played an innocent, weak girl in the Korean soap opaeras. But this time he plays a wonderful tomboy beautifully. Kwon Sang Woo also plays his role very credible. <br /> What I like most about this movie is, the emotion of the characters is not too exaggerated. There are many Korean romance films that the characters cry past the audience and I always think it was very stale. There was no such crap in this movie. <br /> <br /> Very funny and well done.
