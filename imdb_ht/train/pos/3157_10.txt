"This 70s show" is definitely the funniest show on TV now. I started watching her about two and a half years ago, and as soon as I saw her I could say she was a big show. I love all the characters, but my personal favorites are Fez and Kelso. Leo was also an awesome character while he was there, I really hope he comes back because he's hilarious. It's classic when Fez goes "you child a bitch!", And when Kelso yells "burn!", Which always makes me laugh. They are both great characters and always have something funny to say. Jackie was hot is just another reason to watch the show; It started out being really good looking but damned, somewhere around 5-6 season it just was really hot. I've seen most of the episodes more than once, some like 10 times, and there are still hilarious. This is one of the few shows that I can watch over and over and still laughs at as much as I did the first time I saw it. Throw is classic; Almost everybody is funny, where many shows have only a few funny characters. I'm going to be sad to see this show late next year, but it will go through the air as one of the best shows ever.
