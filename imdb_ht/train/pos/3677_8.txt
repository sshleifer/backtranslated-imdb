Fortunately seen this on a plane for Singapore recently (thought I would miss it at Cinemalaya filmfest). Betting, Watching Eye is a collection of 20 short films (about 5 min each) by 20 directors showing the various pockets of love in Paris contemporary. <br /> One of my Fave segments is 'Parc Monceau' by Alfonso Cuarn (Great Hope, Harry Potter and Azkaban Prisoner), made in one continuous shotgun with Nick Nolte features. "The Tuyeries Coen" starring Steve Buscemi as a tourist in Metro was hilarious! Juliette Binoche and Willem Dafoe at 'Place des Victoires' were haunting. <br /> For Maggie Gyllenhaal as an American actress / drug at the' Quartier des enfants The 'reds' have described anticipation and anxieties in such a short period of time. The time was just brilliant. <br /> Eliya Wood as a vampire victim of 'Madanine Quartier' was very surreal, while Emily Mortimer and Rufus Sewell Playing a cute couple in Pre-Lachaise Wes Craven Natalie Portman was beautiful as usual as the actress girlfriend of a vicious French boy in 'Faubourg Saint-Denis'. But despite the many paintings of young love, a More mature execution by Gena Rowlands in 'Latin Latin' was equally aww-induced. <br /> This movie is perfect for those who have ADHD because every sequence of drives is carefully considered. There are also a number of memorable quotes. One particular is this one from a cheating husband who evanescence Just let her mistress stay with her dead wife in the last days: "In pretending to be a man of love, he became a man of love."
