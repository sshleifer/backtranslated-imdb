I really liked this movie. All three stars (Connery, Fishburne and Underwood) provide credible performance, and Harris is enjoyable on the top. The illumination and angle shot of some of Harris' performances make her face look really demonic. The surprising turn of the end draw makes it interesting. Not a big movie, but a one enjoyable. I gave it 7 of 10.
