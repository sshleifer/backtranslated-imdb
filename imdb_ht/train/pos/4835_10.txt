It is a history of Siberian village towns since the beginning of the 20th century until the 60ties. It is about passion and feelings, on Russian souls, and very romantic. This movie is NOT action packed, it flows slowly. In the second part can find great songs - Russian romance. It is much better than Dr. Zhivago. The director of this film moved to America and made Runaway train for example.
