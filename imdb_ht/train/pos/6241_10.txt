At first I had the many reaction that left and after seeing this: that vaccines in fat burned people, etc. were cheap vaccines in a way. OK so it's doing Diane Arbus satisfied. . . whatever. . . but it was not long before I realized that this was not done in a disenchanted manner, as the images unfold I felt that the problem was entirely the audience: we are conditioned by Hollywood and also movies from just about all where actually they feel that they look at people who are above a certain age behaving in a sexual way is something unseemly, something that should not show. if this was all the movie offered it would be a great deal. However, the story of the woman and the abusive companion and her drinking friends really hit as a ton of bricks: telling stories very much, incredible performance, and thinking of the scene were etc. that blonde guy is a genius actor. Finally I want to contradict people who say this movie is all about how pathetic they are all. The old man who is on the make-up and the woman who finally dances for him is completely an OK character that breaks the mold, so do not overwrite the movie by neglecting it. The answer is yes his dog killed. This is not a rosy picture of the world but it's not. . . completely hopeless. anyway I felt really grateful in creativity to make such a beautiful movie all at all. I would not say each of the threads was as strong as the strongest, but I say this movie basically kicks the ass and would highly recommend it. . .
