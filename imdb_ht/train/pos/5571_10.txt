After looking at "striking" in a distributor's screening at AFM the other night, I must say that I was quite impressed. The audience laughed all the way through. Unfortunately, all territories have already been sold, so I did not have the opportunity to buy the movie, but I really believe it will be a big hit both domestic and offshore. I agree with the comment that "pour" should not be camped as a "Sex and City" male, especially because unlike "Sex and the City," "Whipped" is a satire on dating that has never taken too much seriously. "Knocking" pokes fun in relationships in a way that most sex cats would not dare. Also, the movie that I checked in the AFM was more of a plot and history than "Swingers," "Klerks," and "Sex and the City" combined. "Pouring" never slips down to a beat and gives the audience and comedies that do not stop. Amanda Peet's performance and the rest of the cast were all solid rock, which only made the film more impressive to consider the budget.
