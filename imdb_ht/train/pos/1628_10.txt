This is the most hilarious movie I've ever seen. Starting with four offenders being sent to the ancestors of the Military Academy Wienberg, a tone is set to gradually continue all over this goofball movie, and it does not leave up for a second .. It's tough to try for describe this movie; The humor elements, so slender and brightly apparent that on a first look it appears as nothing more than a funny twin teenage asshole. But it is oh so much more than that! Fresh from the minds of those folks over in MAD Magazine, the Academy's uphill serves up a formula and style that I have never seen seen double by any of the "funniest" offerings from Hollywood in the past years. Basically the movie is so full of infant cornball material that you might guess that the writers were a couple of 14 year old ones. Watch this movie if you like to act "immature". A classic. *****
