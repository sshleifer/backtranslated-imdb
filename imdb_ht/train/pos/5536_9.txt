I actually enjoy this show. Even as a young I was interested in all sports and including horse racing. It has always been difficult to make a series of corrupt battles and at the same time getting permission from the race tracks in film films on the controversial topic. An episode I particularly remember centered around a horse hoping to win a great race that looked a bit of color. A syringe was found in the stable floor and everyone thought it was drug but nothing was shown in the blood tests. All too late to realize the horse was not doped but had its knee cartilage removed. Like running a car with no oil and the engine that seized up, the horse broke down with tragic consequences.
