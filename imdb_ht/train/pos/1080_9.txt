Movie "comedies" nowadays are generally 100 minutes of humor, bad language, and kinky wool. Modern comedies appealed to the lowest denominator of the common, sick and slow brain. Sure, an occasional good comedy will come together, but they will become unusual all the time. <br /> <br /> "Mr. Blandings Build His Dream House" to show that 1940's Hollywood could, and it's just screamingly funny. Jim and Muriel Blandings (Cary Grant and Myrna Loy) decided to build a home in the Connecticut suburbs. The film follows stories, begins with home hunting, home-based digging, all the way to finish the house - and "honed-grass her soothes". <br /> <br /> Grant and Loy are perfect for Roles, of course (Grant is particularly funny as it watched home expenses pull out from control). However, the film is stolen by Blandings's wise counsel, played in perfection by Melvyn Douglas. To manage them in all of his scenes, Douglas is unobtrusive hilarious while watching the vast Blandings out of crisis in crisis. Reginald Denny as the architects of Blandings and Harry Shannon as digging the old waters well water well. <br /> I watched this movie many times and it still makes me laugh. I think it's a good movie to look when you need a lift, if you're building a home or not.
