I saw this movie in sixth grade in Christmas time, and I was really excited about seeing it, and when I heard that George C. Scott was in it, I was really excited because I really liked George C. Scott ! When I and my class were watching this movie, I was really in it, and when it was over, I was really impressed, I thought it was totally awesome! This is the best version of Charles Dickens' classic novel that I've seen too far! George C. Scott's performance as Scrooge is something else, I thought it was the perfect choice, it was Scrooge, it's the definitive Scrooge! I saw two different versions of a Christmas Carol, the other is the one with Patrick Stewart, but this is the best one! <br /> What it's really great about this is to act, I thought the actors were fabulous, everyone was, the demons, ti Tim, Bob Cratchit, everyone, they could not have found anyone that is better than what they were doing! But the best part of the movie was George C. Scott! When I saw him, I thought he was the absolute best! It's definitely Ebenezer Scrooge, I do not think they could get someone better! I do not think they could find anyone better to replace anyone in the movie! This film is probably the final movie adaptation of the classic by Charles Dickens, and I really think that you will agree, you will think that this film is awesome! I probably will have to buy this movie on DVD, because I thought it was totally awesome! I totally recommend that you see this masterpiece! This is the best version of A Christmas Carol, period. <br /> <br /> 10/10
