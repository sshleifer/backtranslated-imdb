Watching this several times as a child has been well experienced in 15 years ago, and now that I have found it still has a movie experience like some others. If it's risky, it's a great display of moral and life lessons to recommend watching family and children. While she still keeps up as an adult, I've been fortunate to have learned from her many times over years ago. Try to find it today is hard enough. . . but believe me it is well worth it does not matter what the age. Anime fans especially will find this a great entry in the Masami Hata's movie. With impressive artwork and unique designs, "Chirin No Suzu" represents a refreshing experience. While some of the lyrical songs are not so hot when recorded in English, music notes are nevertheless fascinating. But even the voice is far better than many published today. Sadly from the mid-1980s from RCA Columbia Home Video, and has not received any new format released in my knowledge, at least in the US. Look hard for her, and you'll be quite satisfied! It is an attractive, intense, enjoyable, and important landmark of Japanese animation.
