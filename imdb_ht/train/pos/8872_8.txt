This is the first movie I've seen in John Singleton and is a very good director. The movie starts out with a bunch of new inability and shows what's happening in several of them. Omar Epps plays a track star with a partial scholarship and has a hard time keeping up with her work. He is friends with ice cubes and beer dating Tyra Banks. Kris Swanson is a rich girl dating rape and gets acquainted with Jennifer Connelly, who is a lesbian, and is not sure about how to go. Michael Rapaport is a kid from Idaho who fell in with a neo-Nazis group and leaders are Cole Hauser. These are three main characters and Laurence Fishburne is a political science teacher who tries to help them. It's a great movie and it's unfortunate that the studio made several cuts in the movie.
