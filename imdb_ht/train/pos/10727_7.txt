This is a family movie, which in some people is an automatic turn. It seems that too many people do not want to see unfiltered films and feet, free and explicit violence to fill New York's textbooks. This movie is not one of these. It is cliche, it is formula, but it is also fun. It does not ask you to think, it does not ask you to accept the movie as reality. She simply does what a good movie must do, which is to stop disbelief for two hours and enjoy the adventure. Throwing is a good thing, while not excellent. As another commenter noted that John Williams sound notes were, as usual, excellent. And the fact that a lot of the film was shot at Huntsville in the real space camp made it even more credible. <br /> It was ironic that the original release of the film was delayed for a few months due to the Shuttle Challenger disaster, which could have played a large part of the original original theater, but the movie eventually helped to focus the dreams of many teens people go back towards space and possibilities that lie in it. So sit back with your kids and prepare them to enjoy.
