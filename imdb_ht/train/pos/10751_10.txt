The sum of this document up to a few words is the next impossible. Each fiber of your body tells you that this is not happening right from the open mount of rapid-fire images, up to the last shot in the clearing of zero ground, but each frame is real. The story was thought up by two French brothers living in New York. Jules (28) and Jideon (31) Naudet (pronounced "Nau-day") wants to make a documentary on the New York City Firefighters, starting with a newbie in the academy and following it in the nine-month probationary period for full- firefighters. Look for the help of close friends, actor James Hanlon (36), an actor and firefighter at Station 1, Engine 7, Naudets's whistle in the "Probes" of the academy and one, Tony Benetakos to focus the bulk of the documentaries. Tony <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />! Fire has a superstition on "Probation." It is that they are either "dark clouds" or "Dark clouds," meaning that with the letter, all kinds of fire follow the "Probie." The former means that little fire activity is followed, but one day, there will be mother in the fire. Tony is a "black cloud." After some first pain grows, Tony resolves to fire the firefighter as if he was a seasoned veterinarian. Then the plague comes .... <br /> September 11, 2001 begins with a clear blue sky and an early call to go out and see on a gas leak supposed to be away from Wall Street. Because Jules had little camera experience, Gideon handed a camera to his younger brother and told him to ride with the chief, T. K. Pfeiffer. By approximately 8:42, firefighters begin to use gas detectors on a grate. Then the sudden haze of what seems to have a fly fly low flying past the scene, and as Jules Pot equal, we see the first strike of the day. American Airlines Flight 11 breaks in the face of the North Tower in the 1 World Trade. Pfeiffer orders his guys at the fire engine and head to the World Trade Center. Once there, Jules asked to accompany the Chief of the Tower. Pfeiffer tells Naudet to stay close to him. Once inside, the full impact of the growing disaster begins to show on the faces of the guys whose only purpose is to save lives. <br /> <br /> Jideon Naudet decided to leave the coffee and walk down to the impact zone. Once there, it captures the impact of the second plane, United Airlines Flight 175, and 2 World Trade. He knows Jules is with Chief Pfeiffer inside the towers. Watching and capturing the crowd's reaction to the unimaginable, Gideon begins to take on the growing fear tape in Lower Manhattan. Inside a single tower, Jules records last seen the world, or loved ones will be in their son, father, uncle, grandfather, husband, boyfriends, friends as one by one, each firefighter, carrying 60 pounds of equipment starting The arduous job up to 80 stories to save the injured and block. Jules also captured the last glimpse of the Chief of the Pfeiffer will be in his brother, Kevin, as he left his selfless duty. Also keeping on video is the sticky sound of crashing hit pavement of the victims choosing to fly from higher floors to higher impact areas, much earlier than face deaths in the hands of the flames and smoke. But Jules is respectful, never once he takes a sensational moment ... the money shot. His work is professional in his baptism to fire. It also captures the eye of debris falling from the tower from after it hit by the second plane and the way firefighters were evacuated civilians from the building. Then Jules is caught up in the collapse of the southern tower and the first victim of the official took: Papa Michael Judd, the Chaplain for the fire department. Then, as Jules and Chief Pfeiffer make their way out of the fall of the collapse of tower two, one tower begins its structural collapse. <br /> <br /> What results is an breathtakingly, intense look from inside Ground Zero as Jules and Gedeon work separately from this day's document. Not sure if either is alive, every pair of the worst. As every firefighter reaches Fire Fire, they greet each other and embrace the joy of making it back. And at a time of overwhelming emotions, Jules and Gideon are assembled. As Jules weeps on his brother's shoulders, Gideon embraces his younger brother, as Hanlon makes the filmmakers the subject. There's an awful moment when Tony Benetakos, who left the station with a senior ruler, believed to have lost ... but returned to the fold, this "Probie" proved himself. with only three interruptions, 9/11 is a stunning success in documentary films. He ran the stands and the Hindenburg foot to show history as he unfolded. Naudets must be congratulated to handle the clay in the subject. At least, the tendency would be toward sensationalism, but Naudets's eyesight toward dignity and compassion. Narrated by Hanlon, we get the feeling of his words as he takes the audience in the events of September 11. Robert De Niro hosts the program in a deadly, restrictive way. She never seeks the camera for her own glory, rather than laying out the scene you are about to see. I also applaud CBS for the courage of this special airwave. Chastised for the attempts at grabbing appraisals, they temper their correction toward the emotions of families of deceased people. This is a must see for anyone who needs to be aware of what true heroism is. It's not about dribbling a basketball, or selling an album of hate lyrics ... 9/11 is about its best humanity. Heroism of its finest and the cost of freedom. <br /> <br />
