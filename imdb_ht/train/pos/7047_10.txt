This movie needs to be seen. The true picture of what goes into the world that I've seen since Darwin's nightmare. Go see it! And if you're lucky enough to have it open in your city, make sure you see it on the big screen instead of DVD. Writing this sharp and direction is good enough for ideas to come in, though hardly perfect. Joan Cusack is amazing, and the rest of the cast is also good. He inspires that John Cusack has received this movie and, I believe, had to use some of his own money to do it. It's a wild, absurd ride, obviously made without the resources it needs, but still succeed. Jon Stewart, Steven Colbert, SNL, even Bill Maher does not show the courage to say that this movie says.
