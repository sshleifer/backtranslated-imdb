I somehow missed this movie when it came out and discovered it late as thanks last week to a friend's recommendation. I can honestly say that I can not remember another dramatic intimate movie, which makes so much good. Writing this is dry, realistic, nuanced, and even prevented. The cinematography and editing are understated but inspiring, allowing the visual story to dominate in beautiful pre-ups and framing of images, capturing loneliness and alienation in most memorable ways. The act is also wonderful, and all of the characters become painfully real and vulnerable in the most compelling way a movie can offer. They reveal their innocuous weaknesses with unprotected vulnerability. A real triumph for Roger Michell and Hanif Kureishi, with the rest of the team. A must see for serious film lovers.
