Having only seen two of her photographs already, I've come to terms with Altman. Before, though, I still mark her style of film-making "boring." You just have to be in the right mind to appreciate her crazy genius. <br /> <br /> "HealtH" is fairly underrated, and very skeptical from print. In fact, I do not think he never even gave VHS. Why is that? When all of these crazy movies get DVD releases every day, is this one left behind for no good reason? Honestly, I had no real issues with this movie. It was, for the most part, always fun and funny. Almost all of the scenes are mysteriously interesting for some reason, be it the wonderful dialog or the subtle performances. There is real skill here. But the breath of Paul Dooley on the bottom of the pool half is fascinating. <br /> <br /> If you can, try to find a copy of this little gem. It's not perfect, but it's better than most of the storage out there to get DVD releases. Hell, I'd be happy with a nice VHS copy of this stuff. <br /> It's often on the Fox movie chain, though, so look out for it.
