If you think of a lot of Arthur's intestinal torsion, do not worry, you can always watch and love the Ghost Train, as well as the cute boy Back Room, it's a movie that is simply too damn good to be shaken by one performance, even those of the lead actor. Personally, I love Askey, maybe because I go to his world, rather than unexpectedly expecting him to enter me, which is a lot too many errors. The Ghost Train is so intense atmospheric that you could not conceive watching it without wonder in the deep world, black it carries you through, it is immersing in a way that some cheap and cheerful flag flag managed to be during the desperate early '40s and it's a movie that I would imagine that some people have ever looked just at once. Throwing them, without exception, extraordinary good, maybe Linden Travers lays it on a bit thick, but against the canvas at a railway station named in time war, he could hardly play a nutter and does not stand out. The sad track of the beautiful Carole Lynne earlier this year broke the last link we had with this incredible movie and now it's really in the past but waiting for patience for us to play.
