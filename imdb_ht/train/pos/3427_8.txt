This movie shows the worst part of surviving wars, memories. For many soldiers, men and women alike, return home can start real problems. I remember my father and his brother returning from WWII. For one of my uncle's war never happened. It survived the D-Day invasion, something analogous in the first 20 minutes of Saving Private Ryan. For his memory not only delayed but tortured him. He became an alcoholic like that made several of his sons' cousin. Go ahead 60 years and place the soldiers in a different war, in a different country, the result is the same. When I saw this at the KC FilmFest, I recalled that some of the wars never changed. The ideal young men and women do not kill emotionally from what has happened in Iraq, and especially if you are against the war you will become far more compassionate for the soldiers to try to do what they believe or they say is good. <br /> The tag line from the War of Vietnam War film says it all. "The first crash of war is innocent."
