I liked this movie. The first time I saw it when I was 20 (who was only four years ago) and I loved it very much, I brought my own copy the next day. The comedy plays well by all involved. I still have to return and revive the scene where Mr. Tsanders explains why he found water at 6 feet in a zone with 227 feet in another area. Also look for Jason Robards father who plays Mr. Retch. Talent runs through this family.
