A convincing, honest, miraculous, and unforgettable psychological film that touches on painful experiences caused by rape - "Descent" is a movie that has gone under the radar due to its lack of distribution because, frankly, the movie So it's brutal in its reputation, that if it was published teatrically, it might have met himself some strongly hate partial. The movie deserves to be discovered for, not only its black theme, and not just for its amazing direction and native style - but most of all for its performance. Chad Faust is absolutely stunning, bringing enough illness and sufficient vulnerability to one, not to mention, but to understand this fractured person who has a tight perspective on her sexuality and not only women are raped, but also the fragile insecurity deep in her own self. It is a supportive performance that is so complex, brave, and emotional on the Faust part. And hard to forget. <br /> However, the exceptionnel is Rosario Dawson, whose performance here is an absolute revelation. A tour-of-force of dramatic realistic ticks, with one of the most subtle, but loud-as-able performances in quite some time. While Dawson is seeing some good performance performance in some big-and-bad films, it proves here it has what it takes to deliver some emotional sweep performance and moving, jointly and thermally. The best film of her year (and 2007 was a strong one) - this mixed film and smart hit theater was released, I should be screaming for it, as well as Dawson and Faust. Too bad it was way too wet for a widespread appeal. Movie like this deserves best!
