The first 50 minutes of this film was quite boring. He focuses on Doyle's personal problems, including his sick wife, death threats by fans, a pushy publisher and feelings of guilt regarding his mental dad. Though these subjects had an important impact on Doyle's life, I was more curious about the birth of Sherlock Holmes. The last 40 minutes were excellent. We finally had a look inside the head of Doyle, how he created Holmes and why he had 'killed' Holmes. The actors are excellent. Including the intriguing Selden played by Tim McInnerny, Arthur Conan Doyle, a compelling role played by Douglas Henshall and Brian Cox as 'role model' for Sherlock Holmes, Dr. Bell. Places are good, especially for a TV movie and working the camera nice. If the first 50 minutes were as good at the last 40 minutes would be a toddler.
