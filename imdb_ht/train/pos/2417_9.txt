"Go Berserk" is actually one of the funniest candy movies I've ever seen, the period. Sure, it's a bit low budget, but it's a journey that does not stop the comedic of force. There are tons of memorable quotes. For example, when his father-to-be asked how much he earned, Candy said "Oh, I pulled down anywhere from thirty to thirty eleven dollars a year, gentlemen." Oh course, it is the Candy delivery that sells it. Just Classic Things. Eugene Levy also turned into a hilarious performance as a cinema filmmaker. A clip of her movie movie "Koun Fu U" will have you rolling. So if you're a candy fan and you want to discover a gem forget, I can not recommend this movie enough.
