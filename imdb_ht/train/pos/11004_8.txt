In a near future, most ordinary people of any suspect in the neighborhood of Morgan Sullivan (Jeremy Northam) are hired by Digicorp, a large corporation, to be assigned as a spy and stolen secret from competitors, Sunways. Together with her training, Morgan is brainwashed, assumes a new identity at Jack Thursby and travels to boring conferences. In one of them, he approached the beautiful and mysterious Rita Foster (Lucy Liu), who advised him that nothing seems to be. Morgan acknowledges a new reality, where he does not know who can trust. Sex "Cypher" was a great surprise for me. This film has not been released in Brazil, but the story is engaging and exciting is quite complex, with many draw points, with great scriptplay, direction and performance. At the very last deadline, I recalled Arnold Schwarzenegger's "Total Recall". This movie certainly deserves to be looked more than once, and I really did not like the last scene, when the independent spy discard disk discussion in the sea. In just knowing the director Vicenzo Natali from the fantastic "cube", and this second job I also saw stunning. My vote is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): N / A
