Taking one this accidentally, she was behind the movie box in what I thought I was renting, did not get out until I got home, watch her anyways. Absolutely awesome! a wonderful movie, and one of my favorite three ever, I recommend everyone! <br /> The story is enjoyable and easy to follow, this could easily messed up, but the actors and directors do a great job to keep it together. The actors themselves are fantastic, show beautiful characters and perform a terrific job. <br /> <br /> Find a copy somewhere .............
