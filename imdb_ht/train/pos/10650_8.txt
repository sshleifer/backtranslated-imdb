I rented this movie last weekend, cranked up the sound system surrounded, and got some big sounds from special to affect. This movie is a great movie rental, the special affects where enough to scare my fianc√©, but I noticed some suprisingly looking computer products. I did not go to the movies and see that, but it's a late night late by feeling like going out movie. I would recommend it!
