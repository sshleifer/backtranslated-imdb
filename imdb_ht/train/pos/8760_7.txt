It's refreshing to see a film that you think will end up happily just like almost every other American movie, and then wonder when it does not happen. I love a happy ending like many of the next guy, but sometimes it's best to show things in a more realistic way, and I thought Brokedown Palace did it very well. The finish, with a friend fundamentally sacrificing himself for the other, thus redeems the earliest poor behavior that got into the situation in the first place, was very moved. I almost did not do without the latest line, which proved he did not actually make the deed she was confessed, because that would have made the movie more about the friendship between the two girls, and less about the crime. If he did it or was not that important. The story itself is bound to the clich√©, but actresses have kept my attention and excellent performance. Very realistic, very fascinating. <br /> 7 out of 10.
