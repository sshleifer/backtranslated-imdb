I first discovered Alexander Korda's (1940) fantasy, THIF BAGDAD in the early 1950's on a re-issue bill as "The Wonder Show of the Century!" Both Korda Technicolor films, were the first show in BAGDAD and one book book on one never to forget the program. Music Miklos Rozsa reinforces both films. The techniqueolor of each was incredibly beautiful! The last of BAGDAD has stayed on my list as the best fantasy film ever performed. As the years passed, it became more difficult to enjoy the color of the way it was originally presented in. True Technicolor gave way to a Eastman color process in the 1950's. Both Cinema and Samuel Goldwyn review the movie both teatrically and on video. But Eastman Color Imagery was more pastel in nature and muted vibrant of the original Technicolor. The discretion of Laser discs in this title also had the pastel look of it - beautiful, but not as it should be. Now comes DVD M-G-M (December 3, 2002). THIF BAGDAD again has wonderful Technicolor look at it on a DVD that has nothing short of cut !!! It was so interesting to see it as this once again after watching the DVD once, and I looked at it a second time. The only "extract" is a Spanish version of Dubbed, sub-titles in both English and Spanish, and a very well-made original theater theater. Thank you M-G-M for this exceptional DVD release. Now one can only hope that the KATA COURSES FATHERS and a restored version of JORDAL Korda's book (for replacing in poor public domain imprints in circulation) will soon follow on DVD.
