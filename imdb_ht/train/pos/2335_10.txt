So t.v. should be. Then push Daisies live up to these expectations. A very well-crafted and well-designed show, Pushing Daisies is one of the few on-the-go shows that is integral, a good thing for the whole family and spark your imagination. It's not about normal action, sex, money or angle to kill at each other show on t.v. It's a show that makes you think and laugh, but although the basic scheme may seem impossible, the concepts are real to us all. Want something you can not have, hope for someone who wants you, running away from the past and looking for family, even in the easiest place, etc. ... <br /> I realize that ABC has fundamentally canceling this beautiful show things at this point, and will most likely replace it with some shows beyond points of integrity. I suppose everything is back in money ... it's too bad that there are now no other shows on ABC that actually make you feel good after watching.
