Nothing does not like on Moonstruck. I come from a New York family from Italy and I actually get a little home when I look at it. Actors and actresses, the plot, the subplots, humor .. they were all fantastic. It starts a little slow, but a lot happens in two days! I fell in love with LaBoheme because of this movie. On my list of favorite movies, Moonstruck is number 3. It is a "feel good" movie where you leave the brilliant "this amour" theater or repeat some of your favorite lines: "old, if you give it they shall eat and be satisfied, and I will chastise you until you die. " "Chrissy, bring me the big knife", "who's dead", "you love her Loretta ..... good, because when you do, they drive you crazy because they know they can." I still put Moonstruck on when there is nothing good to watch because it makes me happy.
