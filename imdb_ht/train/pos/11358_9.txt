The good DVD quality video is the only reason why I gave this movie a 9 instead of a 10. That would be so much better, this movie deserves it. This is really a movie that covers several themes together. If you do not like movies on serial killer, but are captured by the amazing bureaucratic culture of the former USSR, this film is a must-see anyway. <br /> I can not compare it to the "Silence of the Lambs" for many reasons. The road is the serial killer described, which made far better of Citizen X. You see several details of his private life because you "travel" along with the killer, which gives you some idea about the source of constant anger her and sexual frustration. The only other movie I've seen is that as realistic as this one was "Henry - portrait of a serial killer". If you were captivated by that movie you definitely need to take a look at citizen X.
