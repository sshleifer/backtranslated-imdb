As winter approach, our ABC television broadcasts, decided to have some reason to have a party at the Jane Austen Festival on Sunday night. This starts with a dozen-year version of the movie version of "Emma" on the last Sunday; more recent versions of three other novels, "Persuasion", "Northanger Abbey" and "Mansfield Park" are coming. <br /> <br /> The curious thing about this production by A & E Television Network, with the ever-reliable scriptwriter Andrew Davies, is that it has appeared almost simultaneously with two major buddhist movie versions, one start Gwyneth Paltrow, and "Clueless", an "upgraded" version, begins Alicia Silverstone, which carries the Schverly Hills scheme. Perhaps as a result, even with Kate Beckinsale in the lead, this production was diving without traces. <br /> As a general rule, many are lost when their novels shrink fit to feature film lengths. The one adaptations tend to both enjoy and remember that people have adequate rooms to develop both stories and characters. An exceptional example is "Brideshead Revisited" which has 13 episodes of 50 minutes back in 1982. You only have to compare the very ordinary film-length version of "Pride and Prejudice" in 2005 with the brilliant 1995 Six-Party TV Mini-Series . It should not be that a novel should be page filters by page, and some novels (often not very good) adapt beautifully to film ("Atonement" is a recent example), but the novel Jane Austen sort needs some time and space exercise their full range. <br /> <br /> Given the shortcomings of this type of adaptation, this output is OK. Kate Beckinsale gives Emma the right mix of self-insurance and vulnerability and Mark Mark is immediately Mr Knightly (he reminds me that Jane tries to recycle characters? Knightly is a more articulous version of Mood Darcy at P & P). Samantha Morton was a rather Harriet sound but Prunella Balance received blabbermouth Miss Bates perfectly? Sybil Fawlty on speed. Bernard Hepton as Emma's father was excellent. We saw the land wet, mud and poverty as well as the chic interiors, in the case of anyone who thought this was a particularly important age for all. <br /> Even though this was a condensed adaptation it was weird to slow down at location ?? Some of the conversations have instead come off, even allowing for their formalities at times. I would have to look at the movie again to be sure, but it might be due to the under-use of reaction shots. <br /> <br /> If you do such things periodically filmed it's a pretty nice example, and compares well with the Paltrow version. Anyway, there is more to come!
