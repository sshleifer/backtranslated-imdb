This movie is really special. It's a very nice movie. Starting with three orphans, Sho Shinji brothers and Toshi friends, they are poor children, living on the street, but one day they succeed in flying a bag full of money, and then they can live on, buy a home, and life seems to be better. They are making new friends, life-friends. But something goes wrong and gets enemies with it all ending up and killing each other. <br /> <br /> I was negative about this movie at the start, because when musicians (Gackt - Solo, former singer of Malice Mizer, Hyde - Solo, singer of L'Arc ~ en ~ Ciel, both very popular in Japan and Wang Lee-Hom - Chinese singer) is trying to become actor, but this is not like other music-go-actors -movies. They're doing a great job, with no experience earlier in movies (except for Lee-Hom, who was in two previous movies). This is absolutely one of my favorite movies. Maybe that's a little because I'm a very big fan of Hyde, but - it was that movie that made me discover it. <br /> <br /> Well, Gackt (playing the main character - orphan Sho) was a part of the group who wrote the script, and she read that insisting that Hyde should play Sho's friends, Kei the vampire. At this time they did not know each other, at least not like their friends. But after the film they became really good friends, and also showed us that they really worked hard on this movie and that they had good cooperation. The film has many different feelings of running the depression, Love, Hate, sadness, pain, loneliness, happiness and so on. I think the first few hours are the best, it's so nice. After people are dying, Kei leaves with it all very much. But still it's a great movie, it's the only movie that ever made me cry, it ends up so sad, but still beautiful. So if you have not seen this movie, you really should be. Because it is beautiful, but sad. You will not regret it. ^^
