I read somewhere (in a fairly panning review) that this is something of an animated live-action mecha, and I think they're on the right line. I first looked at this movie when I was very young and I was dying to see her again, and when I finally made just lately all memories were coming back flood. I do not think this is to be taken too seriously - it's just a bit of 80-year-old almost-a-TV-movie fun (it is set against the fabric of a fairly dark future, although that point does not inspire too much). What I admired most about this movie was that the dialogue was not sound generic - no clich√©, there is no predictable line - all in all just fun! Maybe time did not have that good movie, but still I can get appreciation for it in me. It does not mean perfect, but it's fun and does not try to be anything else. Let the nerds and comic-shop-guy worry about techniques - who cares? Watch it for yourself and make your own decisions. No opinion views of others.
