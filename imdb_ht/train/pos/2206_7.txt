Do not believe all negative reviews of this movie get. Yes, it is pricey to do. Yes, the gor is mockable. And, yes, the act is sub-par. However, this is an example book of an early slasher flick, and if that is "your thing" (mine!) Then you'll enjoy this one. There are enough good aspects of this movie more than compensate for their disadvantages. For one, the score by then unknown to Christopher Young is very creepy and accent the violence perfectly. The finish is a welcome break from the end upsetting optimism in most movies. And last but not least, the environment is what made the movie for me. The musicians in this movie could do a better job "dressing" the series making it more credible as a college dormitory. However, if you can overlook this default, the environment is great. Four colleges all alone in a large, abandoned, condemned building just waiting to be torn down ... it claims insolvency. When watching, allow your imagination to do some of the work and you can enjoy this movie as I did.
