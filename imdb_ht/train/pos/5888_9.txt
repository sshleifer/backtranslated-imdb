I could watch this movie in its entirety and was deeply moved by it. I was not sure if he really was a comedy or a drama - he had the element of both. Mary Tyler Moore and Valerie Harper both look beautiful - our image of 60-year-old woman has certainly changed since aunt Bee! They are vibrant, beautiful, sexy! The only disadvantage of this movie was that there was absolutely no mention of other characters in the either "MTM" or "Rhoda" show in the 1970s. I would think that since she was put in New York City (where Rhoda was wearing) that at least some mention would be made to her sister Brenda or that Julie Kavner would appear, assuming her neck was still in the Apple Big. <br /> It is my hope that ABC will make this a set and bring back for the invitation to invite all the past past in those shows. By the way, what was wrong with CBS doing this reunion, or a series eventually? Is not that the network that brought the "MTM" and "Rhoda" show?
