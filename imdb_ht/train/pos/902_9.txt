I thought this film was really really because, in India movies nowadays, everything you see is skin, music, and bad acting ... in this movie, you can see some traditions, ethnicity, and at least some descent. .. although some parts were a bit dramatic, guess what? That's what American cinema is all about! After watching this movie, at least you do not get a headache out loud all over the music, or any violence, it's just the truth, it teaches about love, and of course cares for those you love at all life ... I think it was an amazing movie ... Kids can watch it without a doubt, and adults will enjoy the simplicity that has been used to be deeply indifferent to India ... until all these hit rap, miniskirts, and skin shows became part of it.
