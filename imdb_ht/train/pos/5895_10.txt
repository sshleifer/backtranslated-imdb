I read an article about Olympic and Dan Jansen's personal travels before seeing this movie. I'm still intrigued by a story of hope and overcoming event life changed, and this was no exception. Background of the characters gives you a sense of family closures and how to positively affect every person's life. I can not speak specifically to the specific details of this movie, it is customary to take some creative licenses when organizing a script. However, Dan's mind and family are important here. It's a refreshing movie in a story that should be said. I felt sympathy for the characters and encouraged to the end.
