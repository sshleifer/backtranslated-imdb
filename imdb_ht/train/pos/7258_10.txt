I was lucky enough to get a copy of DVD in this movie lately and have now seen it for the 2nd time. The first time was on late night TV in Australia over 20 years ago, but I can never forget this movie is weird and weak .. Not many people like this movie at all because it is so original - fact that there Hardly any dialogue that speaks in this move - we just hear the thoughts of character - only one original aspect of it. <br /> <br /> Looking for a copy of this movie I found that the producer was dead, the main actor was dead, he was not caught up in any British television or film archive, that he never released on video or DVD, that TV networks around the world trashed it after the copyright runs from the 80's. When it was first shown on TV in Australia there was no recharging device for consumers. <br /> <br /> On the second look lately, I could see why it was unforgettable. At times it is very tense and unbearably claustrophobic as a Harold Pinter stage play. <br /> Again, if anyone wants a copy of this DVD please email me and I'm sure we can work something out Adam Adam (whiteflokati@hotmail.com)
