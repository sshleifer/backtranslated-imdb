My friends and I were just discussing how frustrated we were with the way movies and especially the romantic comedy they did. We feel offensive by the schlock that Hollywood is serving up these days as they act like all is well. <br /> <br /> Well all is not well ... with the exception of a few bright spots, like this movie. He does not have the big big actors, the big budget, I do not think he's got a great release (I rented out in Hollywood Video) and did not really have anything to do with the bigger romantic comedy budget. <br /> But he has what most of these shortages. He had great chemistry between their favorite interests, "Parker" (Jonathan Schaech) and "Sam" (Alison Eastwood). Love stories are not forced on us as much. The director took his time to allow these characters to really get to know each other. The stories remind me of one of my favorites, "Tootsie". Throwing in support added not only really funny funny moments, but depth of the story as well. James LeGros' character was absolutely priceless. Sam's gay friend was hysterically. Parker's interaction with his fellow employees at a Psychic Line was a lot of fun. <br /> I laughed, shouting, I remember how big she feels in love.
