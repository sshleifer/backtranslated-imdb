I think this is possible the fake movie I've ever seen. Robert Harling script is near perfect, just checking section "quotes"; On second thought, just renting the DVD, since it's the delivery that really makes the lines to sing. <br /> <br /> Sally Field gives a funny, over-the-performance as you've never seen anywhere else, and Kevin Kline is easy to hilarious. Robert Downey, Jr. is typically brighter, and in a very small role, Kathy Najimy is a riot as the costume beleaguered. I was never so much a fan of Elizabeth Shue, but it's great here as the real * person * who is surrounded by a savvy cartoon character on the set of "the sun is also sitting" - that rumbling you feel Under you Hemingway is rolling over in his grave. Either, or he laughs really hard. <br /> <br /> Five stars. Funny, funny, funny.
