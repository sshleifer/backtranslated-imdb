The "Gangster" genre is now one worn subject that is too often parody. In the retrospective series is an accumulation of previous cliches that have been used in its genre, fortunately the writers have advanced over this defect by creating a realism that has been applied to it. Sopranos are a legendary crime legend showing its content and psychological depths that are characterized by subtle nuances, humor and violence without violence. Tony Soprano's key protagonist is perceived as a dangerous general danger of fear and moral values ​​by his crew, however, Tony is in the two of the same characters that is earlier while the other conflicts with guilt and hatred. With out any inhibition or contradiction I still neglected to believe that the Sopranos have the finest cast cast in recent memories. All of this is considered to be an elaborate statement on the series, but I will not. If ever there is a visual dictionary of global consumption consumption for these vital, limiting, relentless, epic, uncompromising and sopranos actions, the smile will smile right back to you.
