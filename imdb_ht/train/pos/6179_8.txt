It is good to see that Vintage Film Buff was correctly featuring excellent DVD release as a "music", so that's what this film, pure and simple. Like its official renewal, Murder of the Windmill (1949), the murder plot is just an excuse for an elaborate girl show with Kitty Carlisle and Gertrude Michael who leads a cast of super-decorative girls Ann Sheridan, Lucy Ball, Beryl Wallace, Gwenllian Gill, Gladys Young, Barbara Fritchie, Wanda Perry and Dorothy White. Carl Brisson is also in charge of his strong voice in "cocktails for two". Undoubtedly the most popular song song song, he heard no less than four times. However, it's Gertrude Michael who steals the show, not only with her pronouncement of "Sweet Marijauna" but her strong performance as the girlfriend rejects the hero. As for the rest of the cast, we could have done without Jack Oakie and Victor McLaglen altogether. The only good thing about Oakie's role is weak weak gag and iconic icon, Toby Wings. In fact, give you an idea of ​​how far the rest of the comedy is over-romantic and over-exaggerated, super-dumb McLaglen inspectors simply can not put his hand on the killer though, you suppose, at that The example he or she is most likely to be. Director Mitch Leisen actually goes to great pain at the point of the killer from the same dumbest member of the cinema audience by giving the player concerned close-up after close-up.
