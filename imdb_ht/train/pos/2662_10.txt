* !! - SPOILERS - !! * Before I started this, let me say that I had both the advantages of seeing this movie on the big screen and in having seen "Authorized Version" in this movie, redone by Stephen King, himself , in 1997. <br /> <br /> Both advantages make me appreciate this version of the "shining," all the more. says that I have read Mr. King's book, "The Shine" on many occasions over the years, and while I love the book and I am a great fan of his work, Stanley Kubrick in this story is far more compelling. and scary. <br /> <br /> Kubrick really knows how to convey the fear of the psyche straight to the movie. Toward the film AK written in the scenario, he himself acquired the title "Magus" beyond question. Kubrick's genius is like magic. The movie world lost a great director when he died in 1999. Among his other outstanding credits: Eyes Wide Shut, 1999; Full Metal Jacket, 1987; Barry Lyndon, 1975; A mechanical mechanical, 1971; 2001: Odyssey Space, 1968; Spartacus, 1960 and many more. The Torrences (Jack, Wendy 's wife and Danny son) live in the Hotel overlooking the winter; Jack was hired as a caretaker. It is his work overseeing the maintenance of the hotel for the months of hard snow, until spring when the careless reopened its doors. It seems there are many rich and jaded tourists who will flock to the Colorado hills for a snow-filled summer escape. The hotel was an impressive piece of architecture and staging. It lets in the atmosphere, not a black, but at the same time "welcome" atmosphere, itself. Furniture and furniture were full period (late 70's - at the beginning of the 80's), and the landscape landscape approaching the hotel at the opening stage is brilliant. It not only allows you to enjoy the approach of the overlook, it also sticks to yourself how desert and isolated the hotel is from the rest of the world. Introduction to Wendy and Danny's character was a stroke of genius. You get the whole story of the past, Danny's "imaginary friend," Tony, and the story of Jack's alcoholism all rolled into this beautiful, self-introduction scene. There was no need to stretch the past history out over two hours into the movie; Obviously, Kubrick saw that in the beginning. <br /> <br /> Close day. Again, the scenic drive up the hills of the Hotel (this time, with the family going), the interaction between Jack and Danny was hilarious while also introducing a very disturbing exchange. <br /> <br /> The first trip through perspective is quite breathtaking, as the "staff" is moving things out, you get a chance to see the majestic fire, the high ceiling cathedral with expensive furniture, dormitories and mill crowns in the architecture. "They did a great job! Pink and gold are my favorite colors." (Wendy Torrence) Even "employee wings" are well designed and beautifully built. <br /> <br /> The labyrinth was a magnificent touch, reminiscent of the maze in which the Minotaur in Crete was Guardian. When Jack Nicholson stands in the proportional pattern of the maze and stares at the center, seeing Wendy and Danny entering, it's a magickal moment; one that tells you right away, has heavy energy in this house; There is something badly wrong, already started. "I do not want to go in there except I had at least one hour to find my way out." (Hotel Manager) <br /> <br /> Scatman Cruthers, like Dick Halloran, was genuine and open to his performance. Her smile was natural and her performance was wonderful. You might actually believe you were at the hotel, taking the trip to the kitchen with Wendy and "Doc." His explanation of the "shining" Danny was very well rescued, as was his conversation with the child on Tony and the Hotel. He was credible and sincere. The cut out and pan scanners at the hotel itself, and the mountains appeared behind, the cold air swirling over, misty out of the hot roof of the snowbound hotel, adds so much to the atmosphere of the movie. It also marks "half-way-hell" points, so to speak; Points turn into the movie. <br /> <br /> Shelley Duvall in painting Wendy Torrence was mastery. (So ​​what if he played olive oil ?! She just showed her wonderful diversity!) Honestly, before I saw the movie on the big screen in 1980, I said, "What? Olive Oyl? * Lol * (Popeye was also released in 1980.) But I took that back as soon as the movie began ... It's brilliant .. In this Fiend opinion, this is its best performance, at (although I liked it at Steve Martin in "Roxanne," 1987.) <Once Kubrick had established the pearly bits of the information you, the viewer, needed to be in possession: Torrence's past; broken arm Danny; Tony; the story of the hotel itself; the fact that Danny is not "mental," but rather clairvoyant instead, with the overall layout of the hotel; all of which you get in the opening 3 sequences; the film by Never stop being frightened. <br /> <br /> The two blindfolded girls of the previous caretaker, Delbert Grady (girls who appeared several times Danny, first by way of Tony in the apartment before family ever left for hotel) was iconic with which Danny could identify, and in which he was afraid, at the same time. They were haunted (and haunted), themselves and showed Danny how and where they were killed, in a way rather than graphics and material. Tony Kubrick's story was written as an assistant spirit, as a smart guide that he gained as a result of his arms almost wrenched into his body by his own father. It was ... "The boy is left in my mouth." He would manifest at the end Danny's finger and physically talk of Danny in order to talk to Danny. NOT loved in the book, I realized, where Tony was made by Stephen King to be projection to Danny as an older boy, trying to save his father. Kubrick has been quitting that she had somehow made it more scary when Tony "took ... Danny ... on." The idea of ​​Danny's older self conceiving back to his own lesser is not ... scary. <br /> <br /> The "Woman in the Shower" scene, performed by Lia Beldan (on whom I can find no other credit because she did anything before, or since) as the youngest woman and Billie Gibson (who also appears to suffer from a lack of credit for work before or since) has been seductively ovnoxious and disgusting. It was dramatic, and scary. Abominable and scary. When Nicholson gathered in the mirror, he saw his body decomposed under his hand; Looking at fear terror to her face was so complete and real. Jack <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />! The degradation of his character's mental state is carefully and well documented by Kubrick. Jack's immediate friendship with the Lloyd Bartender (like only alcohol, mental and drug substance drugs) shows it needs first in the atmosphere that Lloyd is her avid; namely, alcohol ... "The hair of the dog is my bit." (Jack Torrence) In Jack's case, she barks over the rocks, without charging Jack. "Ordering at home." (Lloyd the barrier) Nice to play on words. <br /> <br /> Jack Wendy's "scenario" find is nothing more than the page after page of the same line typing on and over, albeit in 8 or 9 different creative styles. .. when asked in the shade, "How do you like it?" and Wendy whirls and screams with the baseball baton in her hand ... so intensely. It's the point where he realizes how messed up the whole situation is ... how messed up Jack is. It's very scary, dramatic and deliver a strong presence. This is coupled with Danny's visions to the hotel complete with blood, imposed on the scene between Jack and Wendy, and with the confrontation ending at this stage, doing so perhaps the most scenic scene in the movie. "REDRUM" scene. Wow. What do I say? What mothers should not be totally frustrated by awakening to finding the young, troubled sons standing on them with a big knife, talking in that little freak voice, called "REDRUM" on and off? Even though he had no meaning, he would still be as frightening as the 7th level of HELL. It was something everyone could (and was) remembering (ed). Speaking of memorable scenes ... <br /> <br /> Nicholson's final assault on his family with an ax was perhaps one of these scandalous scenes in movie history. Ad-line linked to it, "Johnny Heeeeere!" It was a stroke of shine and is one of the most memorable scenes in the history of horror. He also went down to horror film stories. <br /> <br /> The Finish ..? Finish Kubrick was perfection. I felt it ended up very well. No smarts, no platitudinous complains, no tearfully idiotic ending for this movie. Just epitomize perfection. That's all I'm going to say about the subject of the finish. <br /> <br /> Who cares what has been taken out ?! See what Kubrick put IN. Rent it, look at it, buy it. It's a classic of the genre of horror, and for good reason. Li RAWKS! <br /> <br /> * I was my * ... Take this movie, with her sitck in your Stephen King collection, and take the 1997 "Authorized" version by King and his staff in Kiddie section. It's where it belongs. .: This movie rates a 9.98 from the Fiend :.
