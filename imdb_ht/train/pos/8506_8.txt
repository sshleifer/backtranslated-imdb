. . .But it was on a UHF channel and the reception was very soft. I would really like to own the movie since the reason I watched it in the first place is because I'm a bus driver and at the moment I saw this film, I drove this model bus. It was only (during his death trial some 15 years later) that I remember vaguely that OJ was one of the stars in it. I only remember that the driver and the bus had been shot up and wildly driving. I was looking all over for this movie does not have to take advantage, since it looked in the mid 80s. I liked the film, I do not know how to cry, but after summarizing the TV guide, and looking at her (although soft) I was left for everything.
