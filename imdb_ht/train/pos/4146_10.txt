Anyone who lived in the ages of Revenge of Nerds and Girlpower will appreciate this movie. He is one of those films that delivers everything you want in a "spring break movie" PLUS making it fun in the college movie genre. It's funny, she's got a die to die for (Amy Pohler! Rachel Dratch!, Sophie Monk!, Parker Posey! Jane Lynch! Amber Tamblyn! Missi Pyle!) And her guess to make you laugh out loud. Writer / Actress Rachel Dratch is a funny genius and Sophie Monk is such a big villain. Wilson Phillips! OMG! (I just repeat myself now ...) She will live on with girls who love Miranda July, but feel like eating ice cream and pretending to be mute.
