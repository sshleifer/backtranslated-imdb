Deodato brings us some moments of shocking and a movie that does not take itself too seriously. Absolutely a classic of its own particular style of way. This movie provides a horrible look of barbarism. If you find a chance to see this movie do this. You will definitely have a smile on your face most of the time. Not because it's funny or anything mundane like that, but because it's so bad it goes from other ways and gets good, though perhaps not clean, fun.
