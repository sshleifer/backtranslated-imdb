I chose this movie based on the scheme summary and quotes' on the back of the box. I'm not great at foreign movies, and they did not know what to expect. I do not really care for the translation either. But I absolutely love it! It has a simple, affordable quality that lets you feel good about life. I found myself laughing loudly. I would recommend this picture to anyone, even those who abolish foreign films and subtitles. This one makes it worth the effort.
