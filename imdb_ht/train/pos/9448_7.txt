This was, undoubtedly, the most disturbing movie that I ever saw. The first part of the film, though weird, has a light and fun quality of it. The journey begins on such a peaceful note, detailing and emphasizing the beauty of the hills of Appalachia. But that is misleading beyond belief. The obvious (inbreeding) problems and the flaws of the inhabitants of the country are only the first disturbing aspects of the film. I can still hear Bobby moaning in pain, and I'm scared of the thought. Len Lewis made me wince. But while the film was, over the whole, very disturbing and distressed, she posed some interesting questions. When is it morally, or right to take someone else's life? What can be our moral morality, or not, in some cases? And is dignity and moral integrity more important than life itself? Whatever a conclusion can be drawn from the film, it is a success of its own right (although certain aspects are chillingly real and gruesome).
