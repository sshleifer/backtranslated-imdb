I really liked this movie, and it returned to see it twice a week. Detmers nailed the performance - it was like a hungry cat on the rodeo, toying with her animals. He chased out of rage and lust, taking a "too young" lover, and scratching hundreds of pieces of madly madam mom in china fine on the floor. The movie was full of beautiful touches. The maserati, the wonderful wardrobe, the flower boxes along the rooftops. I particularly liked the ancient Greek class and the recitation of 'Antigone'. <br /> It has a feeling of 'O history' - that is, where people are meant to indulge in frantic frantic sexual. While walking in the fantastic apartment in the scrub, it is at ease - and why not, what holds a "Devil in the Beast"? The entire movie is a real treat!
