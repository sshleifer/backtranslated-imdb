I have now seen this one about 10 times, so there must be something about it I love! The 50 US US Sci-Fi movies have been pretty much a bunch of mixes: either intelligence was made and / or thought provoking or cheesy and cheap. Banned planet is a bit of both, but in that rarer for the genre color, it also has a top start with the script - although Shakespeare would not recognize it, he was based on his timeless, play and thus guarantees a certain amount of longevity itself if he did well. The story of one person identifying art is artificially infused infinitely by car a dead car race left to change over 200,000 years before. Along the way scheme going with stereotypes 50 and corn so much earlier you ask sometimes why you're watching it, but always doing. That likes triangle things ... yuk! Disney's cartoonery always keeps up well, with the original cartoon backgrounds on the covers of Galaxy Magazine etc. look good even after 50 years. Robbie driving the car over the desert in the far distance is a hoot though! <br /> In all, with all kinds, the best of its kind and we should be grateful that such a primitive printer has survived.
