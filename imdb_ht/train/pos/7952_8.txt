This is one of my favorite family movies. I liked it when I was little and still kept up with me now that I was older. I always laugh at all the old jokes and might even shed a water once. I never had much care for talking animals, or at least one-anime but this one I'm going to stand for. It's a very old movie but it will always keep somewhere in my heart. <br /> There is no other living creature that I can think of at the moment that I could compare with, let alone as much as this one. I could give too much credit to this film but I do not think to show. I really keep that big message that "Home is where the heart is." Or at least the message I found in it. Definitely recommend a good old film movie night.
