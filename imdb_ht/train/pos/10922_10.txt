When I was very young, on a local TV station, they would show kung fu movies in all sorts of Saturdays. I saw many of Kung Fu's movies on the weekends. I remember many of them. I saw great cops like Masters Crusaders, Blind Fists of Bruce, Kung Fu Zombies, Chaolin Monk Drunken, Rage of the Master, Tattoe Dragon, and ... Five Deadly Venoms.I remember the day clearly .My and my father just got lunch at Burger King.We were racing home to see what movie he would be on this Saturday. We ran home and jumped on the couch, turned on the lock and flicked it about 56. The intro is normal in many Kung Fu movie clips in the background with the words Kung Fu Saturdays on it .Then under that was the movie title. He told five mortals Venoms. Then movie started in a bit. I bit into my burger fun with the pre-credit sequence. I liked this movie the minute he came on. His favorite character was Toad Venom.The track was hard to follow at that age but that was not what was attracting me ... he was fighting. The battles were so ... amazine g. I moaned every time a commercial came up and soon the 2 hours of the best movie I've ever seen ended.
