Steve Carell plays Dan Burns, newspaper agony uncle and dedicated single father three girls. At a large dental family resident satisfied her perfect woman, just to find out that she is in a relationship with her brother. <br /> <br /> What's a man doing? "Dan in Real Life", but I would imagine the success or otherwise of this film flick will go down if you want to accept Steve Carell playing a relatively straightforward and immobilized part, rather than going through the comedy moves he has done, so successful. If you can not accept it, do not be afraid, "Get Smart" will be together later in the year, but for the file I thought it was very good. <br /> "The Real Life Teeth" starts off as you are typical, incidentally entertaining, family drama, but it gets funnier and funnier as it goes along with Carell's frustration and his growing situation. It's not original (but if you only see movies with original ideas, pick up cinemas would be very rare, did not they?), But "teeth of real life" is fun, and a good cast (which would not fall in love of the first and glowing Juliette Binoche's eyes?) to make the most of a sufficiently acceptable script that meditates on the meaning and passion of love. <br /> I hope Steve Carell pushes himself and does something as interesting again.
