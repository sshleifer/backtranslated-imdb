Screened at the San Francisco International Festival Festival under the title 'Come Undone', 25 April 26, & 27, 2001. The cinematographer uses the techniques that add to the storytelling. Even with fall / winter for 'present' and spring summer for the 'flashbacks' may have some difficulty keeping track of the continuity. <br /> Kit either lead is gay, the actors well-shows the herb relationship of real-life terms; from physical violence towards each other in their passionate lovemaking. The story pulls you into the characters a bit slowly at the start. But as the end of approach, you really care about where these guys will be next summer! You too, they will want an end to find out.
