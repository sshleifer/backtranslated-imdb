This movie is like hell! I think he wrote as a serious movie, but then when he came to film time, Michael Cooney said "Hey, let's throw in some humor and spice it up!" Characters are actually a little developed, too. Oh, and the death sequences are the best. One thing I hate, though, was hairdryer-weapons. What was all about?
