"8 Rule Simple ... TO DATE MY MENU," my opinion is an absolute classic ABC! I'm not sure I've not seen every episode, but I still enjoy it. It's hard to say that my favorite episode was. However, I think it was still funny when it happened. I always laugh at that. Despite the fact that James Garner and David Spade were good, I loved the show when Johannes Ritter was the leading man. If you ask me, spend suddenly it was very tragic. Everybody always gives a good performance, the production design was spectacular, the costumes were well designed, and the writing was still very strong. In conclusion, I hope some networks bring it back on the air for fans of the show to see.
