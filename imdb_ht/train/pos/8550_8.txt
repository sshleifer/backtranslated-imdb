Now I love American Pie 1 and 2 while 3 were great just for Seann William Scott's performance as Stifler but then the good was falling. The band holds unreasonably high standards and your character actually cares for handy but Naked Mile has the same joke and draws recycled lines (Erik Stifler's sex issue is like Jim's). It has some entertainment moments like the football game against the midfielder and the 'punishment' of Coozeman, but over the whole it has lacked originality and the 'Mile' was just stupid and moral. Not to mention the irresponsible girlfriend who does not want to have sex. <br /> <br /> Anyway enough on the nude mile. I watched Beta House with apprehension as I thought he could take the series to a new bar but I was pleasantly surprised. To be honest there is no real plot but it's full of hot girls (Ashley is incredible) and sex aplenty jokes. Yes it is formal with the old jokes but Dwight Stifler (Steve Talley) raises the bar with a tireless performance. The Greek Olympiad entertains especially the penultimate and final events while Christopher McDonald's is hilarious. There are weak points though. Coozeman is as irresponsible as he was in the first, I'm always confused as he ever got a party. <br /> While Coozeman is bad Erik Stifler is worse. John White made Nude Mile a pain to watch but at Beta House he took his performance into a whole new bar. First and foremost it lacks charisma, a prerequisite to Stifler. You really can not care less about it. The only reason I was bothering about her relationship was so Ashley could be on screen! It shines above him like the rest of the cast. Seriously John White is the ultimate in bad act and has about charisma as much as a dead fish. <br /> <br /> It tells the movie to entertain and scare the Coozeman that her girl is not exactly a girl is brilliantly funny. <br /> <br /> Overall this film is worth renting, get a few of your comrades in and have a laugh at the vomi-fest event and prevent your anger from Erik 'loser' Stifler.
