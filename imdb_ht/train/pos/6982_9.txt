Show good. <br /> The basic foundation is that mankind is at a crossroads. There are a series of moral dilemmas being faced. Humanity has made a number of technological advances, but is humanity mature enough to cope with its new toys? There is moral decadence in a virtual world. There are religious fans who want to kill them to get attention. I predict (based on the background of BSG) that there will be a problem with Cylons and slavery. In addition, there are other issues that we carry on ourselves. <br /> <br /> This show is not BSG - at least not as far as humanity was about to run into a ruthless issue that ultimately made their own. There are many shoot-em-up effects or space-based either - at least not in the first few episodes I've seen too far. <br /> <br /> What it has is very good story, character, and theme. It has also good performance of the actors. They can make a culture that is similar to modern-day societies, but aliens at the same time must be completely credible. Like BSG, this show is about humanity - our strength, weakness, potential, and default. It may seem a little odd that a human society on a variety of different worlds has nephews, antique cars, and chickens. But things are really more to create a semi-familiar background than anything else. Anyone who gets stuck on these details really misses the point. If you come from a mafia-style culture or a affluent culture with high-tech, people and human nature are not different than 150,000 years ago in a recent technology than what we see in the world today. Ask if the writers are trying to tell us something.
