Jacknife is a masterpiece of 80 years. It's a movie that breathes in amazing acting and a touch of many exciting things. In Jacknife both lovers of European movies and Americans can find things they are talking about. The scenario is very compelling and full of beautiful characters. Ed Harris is giving one of the greatest performances up to date. She shows her heroes superbly makes us feel broken in each line, in every move. Robert De Niro makes us once again think of it as one of the greatest actors ever in one of the most simple but also the most realistic performances in his career. Jacknife will never become bored as she shows her heroes clear of any characteristic of Hollywood's character. After the war There is not a hero. Everyone is a loser, and this film is about simple truth. Nobody can make his piece after a war, just like the heroes of this movie. Jacknife is about soul diseases in which war creates. Simply nice movie.
