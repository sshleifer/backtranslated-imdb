This slick and bravest movie still delivers. It is one of Frankenheimer's best films and the most iconic and easy to read Elmore Leonard's adaptations to date (and if you're scratching your mind thinking "but I loved GET SHORTY" you need to be punched in the face). In my opinion, no one captures the "feeling" for Leonard's character better then John Glover's 52 PICK-UP. Move to the story from Detroit (novel) in Hollywood (film) elevation factor factoring the story of amazing heights. Have someone, have a few beers and watch this movie. For my Leonard's favorite book references are: Swag, Punch Rum, Hunter Cat, City Primeval, and 52 Pick-Up. My favorite Frankenheimer movie includes SECONDS and CANDIDATE MANCHURIAN. I also had a special special place in my cold, heart movie for BANG DEAD and black Sunday.
