Classical, very influential low-budget gambling occurred in a horror icon and launched their career in both caretakers and Curtis stars. <br /> <br /> Seemingly insulting mans escape from mental institutions and returning to his hometown where he begins to conceal a local babysitter on Halloween. <br /> <br /> Halloween is a movie that never fails to live up to its reputation as a horrific masterpiece! The permanent skater's story and smart direction give this film chillingly good life that he must see really be felt! The direction often consists of these simple, shaded, dark streets, crack doors, which makes the same everyday environment in a small town neighborhood really crap. Its well-timeless suspicion rifle and its jarring shock makes them more effectively thrilling, which in itself is a feat of some horror movie ever managed! Plus, it is wise enough to give us some really versatile young characters and a very scary villain to keep the tension all the most. Higher kudos also go in strictly but perplexing notes to unnerving the music. In a sense, Halloween is a good example of a perfect horror movie! <br /> Throw is excellent. Young Jamie Lee Curtis makes a very beautiful turn as lovable babysitter Laurie Strode, it's so good that she would go on to be in a number of other horror movies before breaking into major films. Donald Pleasants are great to perform a perfect performance as Dr. Myer's, who's desperate to take it again. Support cast Loomis, Sol, Castle, and others are good too. So, as its own villain, Halloween is an irresistible force that never shrinks thrill and frost. It's a MUST for all genre fans! <br /> <br /> **** from ****
