This is a very funny movie! I have no idea if it translates well in other languages ​​or not. However, I think people all over the world can be identified with "Frank" and think it to some extent! These thoughts are hugely fun and women are enjoying this movie I'm sure! <br /> <br /> All members cast doing well, and this could film a tremendous hit all over the world if it was done in England or the US. But for those of you who are lucky enough to understand Sweden, you are in for a treat! <br /> <br /> Very recommended.
