Wow ... what ... a whirlwind. 30 is a very decent movie of all kinds I can imagine, especially during the early forum phase. There were movies that made them static and dull, such as "Dracula" and Bella Lugosi, and there were people who just did not give it a rest, sometimes in a good way and no more. This is one of the movies that does not stop for a minute, and that's both a wonder and a pity. Lloyd Bacon, who also ruled "42nd Street", had to be the King of Musical Era Depression and was probably excited and the sounds that were brought to the world of cinema, because he filled this picture with it . There should be a minute or two minutes without music or talking. It's completely crazy! I thought the movie deserved a 5 (or a top 6) because the rhythm was very poor, since it was insanely fast and I sometimes did not know what is going on with what they think. The characters seemed just running in and out of place, talking about things that did not interest me and probably no one else. I thought I was just going to be rewarded with a small headache. I noticed Lloyd Bacon also dropping the female lead to "42nd Street", Ruby Keeler, and "42nd Street" was a movie that ended up being the best part of it. And you know what? It happened the same thing with Paradise Paradise! The finish is absolutely incredible! It came, but down, the most impressive music I've ever seen. The final part presents us some musical numbers and those, believe me, something that makes the rest of the movie worth seeing. The numbers are flawless! There are three big and the most impressive bits are surely the second one. Suddenly the full screen and gorgeous camera work and invented, beautiful people and beautiful entertainment that made me forget my headache.
