This is the second film based on the life and times of ultra-hanging porn star, John Curtis Est, better known as John Holmes. Boogie Nights is also roughly based on his life. Perhaps a day someone will make a movie about the life of Tommy Byron instead. <br /> <br /> The problem is, that the story is not very well said. There are many episodes of Law and Order with more twists and turns than gems, and the director never gets the criminal case going with any kind of gusto. Val Kilmer has two problems - it's not nearly hanging like Holmes is (and there is no protesters this time around, unlike Boogie's Nights), and it's best looking than Holmes feelings. <br /> <br /> The principal does not present one person who is likable in the middle of the cast. The racist beliefs, which do not present it hanging on it, or his wife, and the police do not find much in the way of characterization. <br /> <br /> The best part of the movie is Eric Bogosian to tell Paris Hilton "get lost". <br /> <br /> Did you say that, anyone interested in the sleazyest side of the porn business in the 1980s or true crime should not miss it.
