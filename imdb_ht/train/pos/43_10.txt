I loved this movie very much. She really intrigued me how Deanna and Alicia became friends about such a tragedy. Alicia was just a troubled soul and Deanna was so happy to see someone after being shot. My only complaint was that since the beginning it was kind of slow and it took a moment to get to the base of things. Other than that it was great.
