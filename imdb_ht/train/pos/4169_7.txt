Yes it was a bit low budget, but this movie shows love! The only bad thing about it was that you can tell the budget on this movie would not compare to "Waterworld" and even though the draw was good, the film never really tapped into its full potential! Strong performances from everyone and the suspense make it refreshing to look on a rainy night.
