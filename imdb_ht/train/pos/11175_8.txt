So often with Stephen King adaptation, you just get a collection of characters reciting dialogues in the books. This really captures the heart of the book. Maybe because they do not use large fragments of text straight from the book, but it's a bit more of an improvement in the events in the story. A great part of her success is Miko Hughes as Baby Gage. Dale Midkiff and Denise "Tasha Yar" Crosby really act like his parents. There is a scene where Louis is cuddling gage, and they are very natural together. Fred Gwynne is wonderful. It nails accentuate Maine perfectly without falling into parody, and it's wise and warm just like jude would be. (8 out of 10)
