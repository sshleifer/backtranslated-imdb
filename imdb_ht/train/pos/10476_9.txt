My first exposure to "Whale Music" was the Rheostatics album of the same name, which I bought around 1993. I read the liner notes and the group said the album, which lives in an important place in my collection, was inspired by Canadian author Paul Quarrington's book. <br /> I picked up the book a few months later and devoured it! An amazing reading! I have since read the books many times, each time finding some new Desmond elements and its desire to finish the Whale Music. <br /> I found the movie in 1996, on video. I did not have a lot of good experiences with Canadian films, but this one worked for me. Claire's role could be cast differently, but in general, I think that Paul Quarrington's vision was nicely transferred to the screen. Maury Chaykin provides a moving performance like the Isolated Engineering. The movie deals with family relationships, love, and finding someone who understands. I would recommend "Whale Music" not only music fans, but anyone ever lost something or someone, and tried to find their way back to the world.
