I will never forget this movie or events leading to Jonestown in Guyana. It just seems so tragic but needs to be said. Power Boothe provides a commander's performance as the Rev. Jim Jones leader from scrambling to total madness. He would win him an Academy Award easily if he was released from the movie theater. It is the kind of mini-series you will not forget. You will not forget the images of the cult of brutality, control, and obsession of its leader. He got up and fell with the threat from the outside world to destroy what he considered paradise. The mass suicide is anxious, almost unrealistic in anybody's imagination as to why many people (900+) have gone wanting or resisted JOnes' order. They do not make mini sets like these again where we are leaving and out open mouths and hunger to know what happened to others.
