I saw this film on cable, it was really funny, from the stereotyping stereotypes to the great police guys, junk leno and mr mayagi from the young karate stars in this good comedy on a prototype machine part. I compared this movie to "RUSH HOUR" in which a local cop has partners with an Asian police officer to solve a case. The chase through farmers' markets in downtown amusement brings back memories. Soundtrack pleasurable, good script, I give it 10/10.
