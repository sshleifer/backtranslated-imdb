I watched this movie awaiting what I got: good sci-fi thing cowboy. What really surprised me was that Kurt Russell did such a great job with a very limited role. <br /> Imagine trying to act under these restrictions: you have hardly any dialogue, and because you're playing a hardass, military robots, you may not show emotions by using facial expressions! Howzat? Kinda like asking a diva to make a great aria while gagging and brawl canal. Although being verbally and expressly handicapped, Russell pulls on an incredible character. Robot it becomes human, in spite of the constraints. Men work! As usual, Jason Isaacs ensures that it will go down in history as a great portrayer of the Consumer Wicked - the one you would like to see draw and kantone. Connie Nielsen was sweet, soft, mother, and gorgeous. I'm not sure how many of my impressions based on it act and how much on her physical beauty, but it was hard to take one's eye to it. Unfortunately, Gary Busey's role was too small and limited. Many of the drawings are quite standard, and a fair amount of weakness, but as it has a sincere comic book feel, I do not see what's wrong with a few weaknesses. By the end of the story the guy has good winning, and the audience appreciates getting a great deal of emotional satisfaction. Yes! <br /> The sort of fever that Russell did not do a good job of acting is the same sort of weakness that fails the whole point.
