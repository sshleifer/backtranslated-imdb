I saw this movie today and I said, it was better than what I expected it to be about the hour before you go to see it. Personally I had some prejudice due to the language of it, but it totally changed my mind. The film was in most amazing cases good with the great actor and actress performance. It was a story about a boy who had a dream and made everything to reach her. This really touched me and as a movie, which is based on a true story, he convinced me. A new school, psychic pedicure and a young boy who finds it known to a new teacher, somewhat different one than the others and fighting for things even though they do not seem to work out. It shows how little things can make big changes in many things, and how differences can sometimes cause difficult situations. Also, I think the selection of actors has been successful. It really felt like you had some people watching their episodes as an outsider when they arrived. Before I spoiled this film and praise, I must admit that there were some things and situations that did not look and feel realistic .. like the one where the principal of beating Frits aka school. Martin in front of the class, at the end of the movie. He really was beating badly, but the only thing that he caused him was, there was some blood coming out of the nose when compared to the first beat at the start, when Frits got some points .. well I guess every movie have it's own clean .. that they say, that if I somewhere somewhere find this DVD from the store, it's sure thing, that I take it with me.
