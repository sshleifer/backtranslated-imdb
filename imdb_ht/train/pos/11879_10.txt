This is one of favorites ever. <br /> <br /> If the movie has a defect, it's that it comes to you as a raging bull. It's not so much to engage the viewer as his attack. '' Scarface '' is as hilarious and unyielding a production like Tony Montana himself. There is nothing that leaves the viewer's imagination. <br /> <br /> The Sanselop Moroder fits the action of a tee. Like the chorus of a Greek tragedy, it wrapped with gnashes, pipes and tugs, a constant reminder of Tony's inexorable fate. <br /> <br /> Not so much a history of precaution as a disaster in progress, 'Scarface' 'rips across the screen and the irresistible force of a runaway train.
