This film is the first movie experience for several people at the cast. All of them are experienced actors and played in various TV series and plays. Sahan Gokbakar is a well-known comedian in Turkey. It's kind of weird to see him in a thriller, while he's at the peak of his comedy career in Turkey. This film is Gokbakar's first shotgun shotgun and pretty much the first experience as a director. But they all did a great job. We are pleased to see these skirting young enthusiasts. They look very promising for the future of the Turkish film industry. Doga Rutkay's long-time romance at Sahan Gokbakar, is also a talented actress, who is known for her latest play in "No. 27" theater plays and several television series.
