Harvey Keital's best performance is so far the new century. Very nicely photographed, a nice snap-injection in pre-Castro Cuba. The story revolves around the nephew of a minor minor boss who develops a friendship with an American and Hollywood connection. It's really about the moment when a boy rises to the fact that the small circle of people he knows actually lives in a larger, more complex world that he does not yet understand the script. It is strong and filled with humor, the direction is dry. Over all, a really professional job that fits into well and traditionally in Latin American cinema. A weakness is the decision to shoot at five-sound English rather than Spanish - probably improve sales in the US. Unfortunately, this just makes the movie a little less convincing. But if you can see beyond that, you will find a sincere journey to another world. Recommended.
