The film only went into the movies in Indonesia this year (2007), two years after its official release, and after many illegal DVDs found its way to the public. Apparently popularity of lead the illegal DVD in the release of theaters, and still public come to watch. The movie is a great season, bringing Japanese culture into your home in a way out. In a sometimes humorist style, the story is told about a theater writer who writes a story for his theater, since regular play Kabuki play is something he finds boring. <br /> <br /> At first, the audience might be somewhat confused about what stories we are following, but when the story unfolds, we see that the love between a male and a female demon leads to a great story for a new piece of Kabuki theater. The audience remains in the darkness if this is a story that is supposed to really have come to Japanese tradition and mythology, but that does not matter. It's the story that tells the story with a love of theater, expression, vivid color, humor and tragedy, doing so a great ride on the roller coaster of Japanese cinema as well as theater. Let yourself go completely when you watch this movie, try to view it in a movie instead of on your TV at home. <br /> A crucial point though: The band is sometimes a bit annoying. Though most of it is great music, there is a moment in the movie that I think should have chosen some more dramatic music. But perhaps the fact that the story has moments of humor has made the director choose for lighter moments of music as well.
