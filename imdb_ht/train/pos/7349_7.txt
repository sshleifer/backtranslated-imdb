Of course if you read my review you've seen this movie already. 'Raja Babu' is one of my favorite characters. I just love the concept of a spoiled roast and a 24 * 7 servant on his motorcycle. Watch movies and emulate others etc. I like the scene when a rock craze in Khan Kader Khan while eating. Also, where Shakti Kapoor recounts a ghost story in Raja Babu's affair on a dinner table and Govinda's innovation put 'dharam-veer' to make sense. This is my favorite scene in the movie. 'Achcha Pitaji at Main Chalta Hoon scene' is just chemistry between two great Indian actors to perform a funny scene with no dialogue. It's brilliant. It is a cat mouse movie. Just watch these actors who help each other and always take the stage with each other. Its total entertainment. If you like Govinda and Kader Khan Chemistry then it must be a. I think RB is 6th in my list by David Dhawan. 'Deewana Mastana', 'Ankhein', 'Shola or Shabnam', 'Swarg', Coolie is no 1 'close to this gem in a movie. 7/10.
