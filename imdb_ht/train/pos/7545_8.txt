I really like it although while reviewing it was quite disturbing to me .. But as an animated fan I can totally understand this perfect artwork though some of it was against my culture and believe .. , hey, it's the world of art .. !! The beginning of the movie is very strong, weird and confusing.it is hard to understand what made me respect the one who did it. One person who is very open can do such daring movie .. it's absolutely not for kids..and even though the characters are beautiful and adorable but they go through some disturbing adventures that can not be erased (sorry if the spelling is wrong) from memory.
