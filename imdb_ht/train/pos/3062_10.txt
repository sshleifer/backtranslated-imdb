I saw this film a few months ago on cable, and it was fantastic. William H Macy is one of my favorite actors, and his performance was just amazing. He cares for his character, even when he's clearly doing wrong, and Neve Campbell gives a performance that is and out of a better performance I've seen by an actress this year. It is fantastic as a wild young woman who is wise beyond her years. Donald Sutherland is just plain crawling like Macy's father, and Jan Ritter is fine as a shrouded stuck among everything that happens I want that this was in the theater because I felt it in a movie that should be seen by a wider audience. This is a shame, because it's a hell of better allies than most of the new films come to the theater now.
