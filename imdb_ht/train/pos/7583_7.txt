The final chapter of the Razor Hanzo trance gives bay fitting for this fun series of samuraisploitation. Inoue replaces Yasuzu Masumura (blind creatures, red angel, Manji) in the chair's chair, but the style is pretty much the same, possibly due to Shintaro Katsu serving as the producer, apart from the titled antihero. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Of course, Hanzo was Hanzo, he is not taken away by the fact that he is a ghost, so he continues to violate ... ahem, his interrogation, using the device now habitually torn the gun. The plot takes in a series of blind monks that are also lining up as loans, corrupt officials, promiscuous wives and hacking needed and cut. Hanzo's superior officer, Onishi, and his two servants, scored the typical comics, and generally, it's business as usual. <br /> <br /> Significantly less complicated and easier to follow than the first (which is all over the place and a bit of a mess), less stylish, dramatic and bloody than the second (arguably finest in the Hanzo series), but still fun and refreshing on its own base. Complete with the trademark training sequence, the mandatory rape, swordfights, and a Hanzo mystery called on investigation, this will ultimately meet the fans.
