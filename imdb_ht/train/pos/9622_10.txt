I just watch this movie on Showtime. Well do not crash actually. If I had not only had 6 hours to sleep for the past two days then I would not get home early in work. If I did not come home early in the work I would not see this movie. I would not know what I was missing, but I would miss a lot. <br /> <br /> This is how this movie is. It almost plays on the effect of Kevin Bacon. This and causality (hence my verbiage above). Ever character is tied in one way or another. Action, reaction, interaction, non-interaction. This movie is just wonderful. I'll have to get a copy to buy.
