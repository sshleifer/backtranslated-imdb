"Dressing to Kill" is surely one of the best treats / suspense movies ever made. It's stiffer, stylish and highly suspended mix of gender and violence. The action is very good, the orchestrated score by Pino Donaggio is unforgettable and there's plenty of surprises (No Gordon), his psychoanalyst (Michael Caine), and a girl cost called Nancy Allen, is a girl whose girl (Angie Dickinson), her son (Keith Gordon), his psychoanalyst (Michael Caine) .The amateur in the film is a transsexual called Bobbi who is also one of Caine's patients. The movie is full of breathtaking moments: the infamous scenic starter scene is very stylish and beautiful Tory as well. Significantly recommended.
