First, I would just like to say what a great fan of me is Bette Midler. Stella is a very good movie and a wonderful cast (Bette Midler, John Goodman, Trini Alvarado, Stephen Collins, Marsha Mason). This is one of my favorite films ever. She deals with a mother raising a child on her own, she goes through a lot of things from her way to bring up her daughter Jenny to play beautiful by Trini Alvarado. This movie is very good and I suggest you pick up a copy to view it. Roger Ebert was given 3 1/2 stars! And it deserves 4! WONDERFUL! I give it 4 out of 4!
