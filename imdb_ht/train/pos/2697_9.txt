Nothing revolutionary here; just impeccably elegant, sinister movies. <br /> <br /> GARDE A viewer is prisoner almost exclusively at a drab police station, and mostly in one room interrogation, but director Claude Miller (who has made the movie this wonderful SWEET SICKNESS movie, among others ) intercalates glimpses in the exterior board as minimalist localization of senography. Miller's Migration, especially early in, is breathtaking, and his exult touch touches on the pivotal penetration of the interior-performing scenes for captivating look. <br /> <br /> Lino Ventura is superb as usual, succeeding to legitimize a character that, on paper, is clich√©: laconic, hard-rendering, the world-heavily homicidal detective. Ventura is living the role, making it completely credible, even if the script allows us to access the inside of it; The movie ends at that very moment it appears he will be forced to confront his failure for the first time. <br /> <br /> Michel Serrault is equal to the work as the suspected assassin child who is frustrating with single-minded cops. The exchange between the two is more common than often pregnant with tension and the aura in a constantly metamorphous field for a blood fight. Serrault's character is not depreciably cleverly crafty and cunning; Then later .... <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " , if necessary, can be closed at the expense of justice. For most of its length if the film shines as nothing more than an example of how to turn a potentially soporific set-to-tune scenario into a thriller drama in the economy cinematic economy.
