The Japanese animators have a unique freedom and animation, which is why they tend to be able to come out with movies such as those that finally end up on the anime-driven fan and the student's college floor, but get completely ignored by pretty many people outside in his country of origin. Cat Soup is one of those films that, from Western eyes, is supposed to have experience on drugs or deeply analyzed. Really, it's just a beautifully detailed surrealist tour. <br /> There is no real dialogue, which makes it easy to pass over to other interested parties without interest in things like subtitles. A cat and half dead (brain-dead?) Sisters travel to various landscapes of fantasies and associations. There is a general term of water, or lack thereof (perhaps because of the cat drowning in the beginning? Is it possible for the title?). There's an interesting sort in Genesis taken. There is a pig that feeds itself. An elephant made of water. And it's gorgeous, compelling, interesting, and fun - give you not to look around around drugs that can not experience anything unique visual without comparing it to an acid trip. Eventually the movie turns itself off, adding another compelling top-reflective level of the procedures. <br /> <br /> --PolarisDiB
