Keeping that end of this movie's browsing channel through the cable movie channels, and it was so intriguing to look out the next show. <br /> I really did not know what to expect after resuming the program, but I came away feeling this movie quite disturbed and distressed. He also gave me as an adult who went to high school in the 80's, a little better insight into what our kids have to withstand and these days. <br /> <br /> The fact that you do not see the shoot only adds to the chillness on the field. To see both children and adults struggle to understand and come to terms and their sensual shooting was at overwhelming times. And they will admit that I shed quite a few tears of all. <br /> <br /> In the whole, it's not a movie that I'd find out, but I'm sure I've seen it.
