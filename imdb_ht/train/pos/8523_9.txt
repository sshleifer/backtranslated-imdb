I've been a fan of the book ever since third grade, so of course I watched the movie, read the end, and then watch the TV show. It was a good show in itself, and now as an adult I still enjoy the show. My only real problem and he was that he did not follow the book. The first time I saw it, I was so disappointed that I turned it around. But this will come from a girl who owns a first addition to the book. But after I decided to give it a try again and ignoring the book (the kind of things you should do with the Harry Potter movies). I found the wonderful series! It was clean off and something that everyone could enjoy, just the amount of comedy right to keep everyone going. It's really enjoyable! Clean and Wonderful!
