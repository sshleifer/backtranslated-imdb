The last hole is one of the few Westerns ever faced with Buffalo Hunting, both as a sports and business and as a method of winning the American War Wars. Before the white foot stays on the other side of the Mississippi, the plains are used for American Bison cows as well as some of our major cities. Since the period last year, the hunt lasted, Buffalo was all but wiped. The 20th century, due to the efforts of conservationists, saw a revival of species populations, but not as hard as it once was. Robert Taylor and Stewart Granger are co-starring in a second film and this one is far superior to all the brothers. Here, Stewart Granger is a good guy, a world chartered Buffalo Hunter, who must return to a job he hates because of financial considerations. The partner he chose to throw and is Robert Taylor. Forget Taylor for this moment, I doubt if there is ever a sense, nastier soul than Charlie Gilsen who Taylor portrays. At the Devil's door, he was an American American fight against the prejudice up by a racist playing by Louis Calhern. In the past hunt, it is the racist here. He killed both Buffalo and Indians for fun. He killed one American family by stealing his mule and took the widow to one prisoner. Like some barber conquerors she hopes to enjoy the pleasure of Debra Paget's sexual favors. It's actually crazy when Paget does not see it so. No matter how often they refer to Russ Tamblyn as a half, I'm never really convinced it was any American party. It is the only weakness I found in the Last Hunt. <br /> However Lloyd Nolan, grizzled the old buffalo skinner Taylor and Granger brings together is just great. Nolan steals all of her scenes in and drives in. <br /> For those who love the real Westerns, who want to see a side of Robert Taylor never see on screen, and who do not like cheap heroicism, the Last Hunt is the ideal hunt.
