It's a stage game, suited to the screen. 95% of the film takes place in the gorgeous home of author Sidney Bruhl (Michael Caine). He is the author of a futurally fabulously Broadway play, but his last 4 efforts have been flopped - horribly. An aspiring author, Clifford Anderson (Christopher Reeve), who participated in a play-writing workshop to Sydney, sent him a copy of the play he had written. Sydney tells his wife, Myra (Dyan Cannon) play is fabulous - a sure-fire hit. But is it good enough to die? Time is saying. <br /> Clever dialogue and many twists and turns into the plot to keep this entertaining movie from the beginning to end. All the cast seems to have a good time. It's reminiscent of another fun Michael Caine mystery: Sleuth. Worth watching. <br /> <br />
