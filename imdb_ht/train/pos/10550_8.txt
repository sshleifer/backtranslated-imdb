I watched this as part of my neck at Aberystwyth University and it shook me that this is not a distributor in the UK. Well actually, it's not, because this film is all a Hollywood movie is not - original, creative, original and funny. It seems that today no-one really wants to see this kind of movie like, in the simplest terms, it does not comply with the generic conventions that most watchers watch for in a movie. Do not write a review for the IMDb for ages, but it felt inclined to give this movie a special inscription even if it is for 30 minutes between classes! Essentially, it is about nothing, as the two main characters were plunging into their own world of anything of a hatred in the world. The shining here is how the director sustains the interest of the majority of the time running with only two characters and when the only make-up-scene consists of half a home with a vast white, empty space. This is due to the large part of the stellar performance of the actors, both of whom offer some great laugh while at the same time being able to add significant emotional depth to their role. <br /> I would like to write some more, but I'm about a long time limit. However I encourage anyone and everyone to give this movie a try. A very unique concept leads to the screen in a coherent and well-executed fashion, and the combination of good performance, a strong script, beautiful sound design and (fairly) visual impression creates a very entertaining movie. / It's just a shame for some people to know about anything ...
