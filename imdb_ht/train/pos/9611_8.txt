This was amazingly smart for a TV movie, and quite true to my own experience of bulimia. He was actually well-researched, and I can only assume he was written by someone who went to a similar experience, because he had all the little details. The characters were beautifully drawn, and the performances by Tie Winningham and Alison Lohman were great. I think that what I like most was that they were specific and clever, and there was no dumbing down to the reasons for Bulimia the Beast (it was not a few "diet from control, which was caused by pressure to put on girls by the media, our pressure does not actually go to address ... "). Her mother was not completely clueless - too often on television they will take a problem that everyone has a few consciousness and try to tell us that the protagonists are the last people who do not do this ("diabetes? Oh, my world is all sick, doctor, please explain it to me as if I'm a toddler, "etc.). She was brilliant her mother was a psychologist and she did not see the signs. And the scenes where animals were sent were not mentally and sensationalist, and focused more on culminating needs for secrets, and out-of-control. The scene in which His mother told Bulimik would have made me cry if there was no other person in the room. <br /> <br /> Well, so I liked those bits. What did not work for me so well ended, led back to the television movie territory we know and not particularly love, but I guess they had to wrap it. "You, too, can cure your child's eating disorders, if you have a lot and lots of money and live in America ..." And I can just say again that I really love Mare Winningham. It's great.
