What's with all of these negative comments? After seeing this movie for the first time tonight, I can only say that this is a good holiday comedy that is sure to brighten up to one lonely people. When I saw that Drew (Ben Affleck) could end up spending the holidays alone, I wanted to cry. You'll have to watch the movie if you want to know why. Also, though I liked Tom (James Gandolfini) and Alicia (Christina Applegate) after a while, if you ask me, they were real snobs. However, this movie makes me smile and feel good inside. Before I wrap this, I would like to say that Mike Mitchell has scored a better holiday bash. Now, in conclusion, I highly recommend this good holiday comedy that is sure to brighten up a lonely lonely day of any Ben Affleck or Christina Applegate fan who has not seen it.
