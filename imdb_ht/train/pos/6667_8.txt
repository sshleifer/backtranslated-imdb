OK. Someone should not see this movie. <br /> 1) Do not see it if you do not like satire or black humor. 2) Do not like it if you were offended by _The Watchmen_. 3) Do not see it if you want a superhero movie. <br /> <br /> The rest of you, running, walking, seeing _Mystery Men_. It's funny, it's original, it's a succinct syndication in every malicious superhero cliche known to humans. Occasional jungle-high jungle jungle does not ruin the fun-language low-key pea at Jeanane Garafalo, Ben Stiller, and Hank Azaria, as well as a couple of fun smaller parts by Geoffrey Rush and Greg Kinnear. (Well to see Louise Lasser getting work, too.) I laughed all the way off. Utterly ourious, a bit strange, but-good.
