Bette Davis turned into an entertaining entertaining performance as Mildred Rogers in this 1934 film. The film looks rather dated now in 2003. It's no doubt well worth watching for film movie and Bette Davis fans but they can not There are many calls for the movie film today. It was thrilling to see how young Ms. Davis looks at this movement. The actors turn into performance that is fundamentally sound and the story is meaningful and interesting. Leslie Howard thoroughly cast as Philip Carey, the student-club student. This is a movie that has a strong message about people we choose to love and why. However, "In Human Bondage" did not seem to have a major impact on me mentally or emotionally. I felt a little indifferent and tear off the movie after watching it. I have an intuition that this can be the reaction that the director went for. You must be the judge! <br /> <br />
