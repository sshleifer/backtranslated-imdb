Trailers in this film can show the mainstream scene of mainstream violence or sexuality, but these scenes are just rare fragments, chosen to attract the audience. They are, of course, showing the main message of the movie: <br /> <br /> Those who are constantly kicking over their heads in their work and life, using their power, which they can have elsewhere , notoriously pressing others. And the low end of the asthma chain, especially the women. <br /> A movie that shows this as brutal as Hundstage is surely difficult to face, but there are those lifestyles that are even tougher. <br /> Technically the film is very much like short cuts, but including episodes of documentary genres, featuring people like your neighbor, playing just the way they are. Without any shine, and most disturbing, without hope. Its documentary style makes the movie even more disturbing, because you realize, these people come out, and there are many of them, although our society focuses on the beautiful exterior looks. Somewhere the industry industry has to do business, a small place that does not show domestic violence took place, somewhere expected to break. I'm sure you know these people. <br /> If you want to see a movie without any funny scene (some may think the disabled woman repeat ten in the shopping mall is funny, but it happens to be real) and without any melodramatic, go to watch this movie. However it will be lost when you focus on subtitles I'm scared, as subtitles do not have the proper transportation.
