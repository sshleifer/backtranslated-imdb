This complicated story begins fairly simply, and an English journalist accepts a wager from Edgar Allen Poe and his friend Blackwood that he can not spend a night at the Blackwood Haunted Mansion. Once there, the writer wanders around the dirty rooms and corridors, until the music with a glimpse of a valentine couple leads him to an empty room. She sat in the arpsichor and started playing the melody she had heard, and she was surprised to be tapped on the shoulder by the dazzling beautiful Elizabeth Blackwood. He informs him with a good / odd way / unusual way he has prepared his room upstairs and that someone still hopes for this night ... the night of the deceased. So start an amazing series of supernatural events that insult the journalist all the rest of the night. SPOILER AHEAD: It probably will not surprise too many viewers to learn that the beautiful Elizabeth is actually a ghost. This does not prevent him from falling in love with the journalist, but it makes things more complicated to pass for the average couple. This is a fun movie, and absolutely everything: ghosts, the spooky castle, repeated visions of past events, gender and violence (though both were tone down to the most recent American versions seen over the years. ) Hatian, fascinating Barbara Steele is the main reason to view it. He has a strange charisma unlike any other person you've ever seen in the movies. Recommended!
