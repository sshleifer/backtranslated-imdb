"Broken Bow" took us back to where it all started. Put 150 years in our future with 100 years before Kirk, Spock and McCoy. This slice of the franchise "Star Trek", is in my opinion the first series since "TOS" recaptures the feelings of wonder, danger and excitement of "Going where no one has gone before". Scott Bakula is perfectly cast as Jonathan Archer, the first captain of the first Star Ship Enterprise. He and the entire cast really show a true reverence for the Star Trek treasure. John Billingsley is Brilliant as the Dr Phlox Alien, and Jolene Blalock is totally appetizing as the thematic but logical Vulcan Science T'Pol. Broken Bow is in my opinion the best prime minister of any of the Treks, and I believe Gene Roddenberry would surely be proud.
