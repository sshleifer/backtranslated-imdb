One of my favorite movie ever, ever. Just beautiful, full of human emotions, wit, humor, intelligence. The story grows, such as lessons in life, just a wonderful movie in many ways. <br /> <br /> The cast are also fantasy ... a great selection of British finest talent around. I loved them all for each of the various elements brought in the movie. <br /> <br /> Italy has to be one of the most romantic places to form a story like this, - everything about this movie is working. <br /> I love it :)
