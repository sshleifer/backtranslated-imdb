Cary Grant and Myrna Loy are perfectly cast as a middle class couple who want to build the house of their dreams. It all starts out with reasonable plans and expectations, both of which have blown bits by countless hassles and an explosion in the original budget. There are many great laughs (though the story is a bit slim) be sure to entertain fans of the stars or the late 1940s Hollywood style comedy. A definite record comes when a contractor goes to a run down to any expense, which must have been overflowing too much at a 1948 hearing. As he exits, he assured the customer (Grant) that perhaps he could achieve a reduction of $ 100.00 in total ... or at least $ 50.00 ... but certainly $ 25.00. Hilarious!
