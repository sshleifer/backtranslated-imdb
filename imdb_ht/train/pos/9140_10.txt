I like this movie !!! The red rain came out the year I was born and had my heart since I could remember. Prince is so tight in this movie. I went to a special show in the Red Colors Laplace last night and was such a concert I was pleased to see some true fans cause this movie is so undervalued, it is really one of the greatest movies of all time . The music is intrerable. The film is about the "Kid", played by Prince, his family is dysfunctional, his band is the hottest act of town, and he has his eyes on Apollonia, an aspiring singer. There is no question why purple is my favorite color I can thank the "kid" for that. So, if you have not seen this then you need to be asap. This is a classic - 4ever!
