Pinjar is one of the few movies that really leaves a mark and makes you think hard. Put in India Partition, this movie shows the true reality of the partition of India. Urmila gets full marks for her beautiful and deeply emotional paintings in a woman suffering from no way to go. His freedom, personal identity and respect for family took overnight on a tragic land conflict. Manoj bajpai is simply brilliant as abductor remorseful it. There are several moments in the movie where one brings in tears. The film at point is deeply traumatic. Some of the partition scenes are chilling spine, but Urmila's endurance and survival are both remarkable. From a woman robbed of freedom to women who gave women liberty in similar situations. A remarkable film that should provide credit for smart characters and storytelling.
