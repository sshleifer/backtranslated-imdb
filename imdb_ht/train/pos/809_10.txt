A very good movie. A classic sci-fi movie with humorous action, and everything. This film offers a large number of aliens. We see the leader of the Alliance rebels and many of the Imperial forces. The Emperor is somewhat an original character. I love Ewoks who represent somehow the indigenous and Vietnamese wildlife. (Excellent reference) I liked the duel between Vader and Luke who is the best of the legend. In return on Thursday the epilogue of the first trilogy is over and the final Empire falls. I also appreciated the victory celebration where he achieved the Vader's redemption and returned to the Anakin Skywalker spirit along with Yoda and Obi-Wan. It gives a sadness and a tear. The greatest scene of Star Wars is among the movie: When Vader turns to the Emperor. Luke looked and found comfort in seeing Obi-Wan, Yoda and his father (1997 version by Hayden Christenssen). The best scene is when Luke is making a strike back to Darth Vader to protect Leia. There is a deep black in this movie despite having a good finish. I felt I was more than satisfied with the eye. And as always the music of John William will bring the classic of Star Wars universe.
