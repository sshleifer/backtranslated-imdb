Creativity creativity in America should have been released on a different network, or at least gave the chance to run its full episodes. Unfortunately, this was not the case. Given that American audiences (seemingly) have the attention of a gnat when it comes to the humor that does not consist of profane diatribes shoots, or has a concentration with ecological function (both sound and odor), such as this will be some and good away from. One of the main problems was that brilliantly known, he did for a rare audience who knew what to expect, but was seen by a hearing and board room that did not have a sign of what they were look. That is sad, but not unexpected. I would like to see at least three more episodes of this show even if it was produced for direct DVD release. The material and the interactions between animals were rich in sub context and there were other conversations just waiting to be had under the surface. But thanks to policy makers, these conversations take place only in my mind.
