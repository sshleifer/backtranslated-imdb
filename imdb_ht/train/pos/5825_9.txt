Most Stoogephiles consider this to be the best stooges bar to anything, and they're right. Curly is a cry of dressing as "Senorita Cucaracha", and Moe and Larry are in the form of "Senor Mucho" and "Senor Gusto", respectively. Christine McIntyre is the beautiful voice of surgery providing full rain - it's actually a singer opera - and it's wonderful. The Gran Gino Corrado is hilarious as a singer recalls Italian terroristized by the Stooges in a party society. Some truly funny, good, and very tight guys make this rise to the very top of production of the Stooges producers. What's even more amazing is that Curly had serious health problems at the time, and in several of the shorts she did during this period, you can see that she is obviously ill; Its distribution is way off, it speaks very slowly and haltingly, and it has problems around. Fortunately, his health was in an upswing when he made this movie, and it shows. Classic Stooge comedy, and enjoying not even fans of Stooge (I had a girlfriend who could not stop the Stooges, but even laughed at this one). A must-see.
