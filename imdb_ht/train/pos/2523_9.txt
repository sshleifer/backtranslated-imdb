When I first heard about Children's Moon, I thought it was a joke. After a few months, I figured I guess it's real. The few comments I read were not made by sukaling fangirls was not much promising. When I gave the opportunity to watch it, I was well prepared for plain, wince, and otherwise need to close my eyes to avoid the silliness .. I was more than a little surprised, and in a good way. <br /> <br /> Yes, Moon Child has moments in cheese, cannons, and general dorkiness - I think of the quality impossible to avoid when it involves Gackt Camui, a man not known for his sanity, - but all in all, it was completely enjoyable. <br /> No, it's not a work of movies but it's very, very happy, fun, and fun choreography, a touch note, and a fun cast. I know little of Japanese movies so I can not really judge the act, but considering the fact that the cast spoke a language or extreme foreign dialect at one time or another and that a couple of them have almost no experience, I was rather impressed. <br /> If you can enjoy a good action movie, a good drama, a good comedy, watch this movie. At least rent it since it comes to Region 1. <br /> On a side note, there is zero homosexual / homoerotic content in this movie. I did not even see much of a subtext. Do not let those who are over of these things ruin this for you.
