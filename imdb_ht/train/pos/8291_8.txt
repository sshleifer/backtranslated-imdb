"The Lady in Question (1999)" begins Gene Wilder is a well-known mystery drama that reminds me of the old black-and-white Raymond Burr Perry Mason series. Both Perry and "Cash" keep me guessing up to the end. There was plenty of suspicion and a motive for the murder, but I had no idea what character it should be. Gene Wilder has a special wisdom on her, even in her facial expressions and vocal influences that make her perfect for the party. The portions of the film described acting actors have done very well. I'm sure this is an additional challenge for throwing off the zoom. I'm not surprised to see that he did some of the writing for the movie. Even his song was a pleasure. I love her in this role more than her former "sillier" role as the "Young Frankenstein" and "Willy Wonka." I hope that A & E will continue this series. They should call it something like "The A & E Gen secret mystery." <br /> <br /> The music fit the period. I enjoyed the cool live combos and the balanced melodies. I was a bit clear at the start if we saw a flashback or if the action took place in that time period. And I do not agree that the inclusion of the profanity required to flow into the script. For me, always distracting. <br /> In general, my wife and I well liked this second at a well-crafted beginning of what we hope will be many others - just like one of our other favorites: Raymond Perry Mason Burr's.
