"Who Loves the Sun" works its way into a small subject matter that is likely to understand enough and favors keeping the story not only engaging, but often hilarious. It was a while since I found such a well touched, quite enjoyable movie. <br /> <br /> The movie is gorgeous, the eye drawing and beautiful scenery and quiet landscapes. The beautiful peace contrast images and tensions between human eyes are very flawed, and the characters are very enjoyable. Due to the excellent cast all five of the major players are pretty interesting and dynamic. I recommend "who loves the sun". It's a really funny movie that takes an impressive look of hurts that we can hurt on each other, and the process is amazingly hard but equally rewarding in forgiveness.
