I do not like "inflation classes" but I just gave this a 10. I can not think of anything I did not like about it. I saw her last night and got up today thinking about her. I'm sure the Hollywood renewal that someone told me about, and J Lo and Richard Gear, will be excellent, but this original Japanese version from 1996 was so emotional and thought-provoking for me that I'm hard- Pressed thinking in any way that it might improve, or its surroundings change to a different culture. A story I found worth watching, and with the s-fight or gun or go away or anything in the sort! Imagine that! <br /> All the characters seemed quite developed, ... even non-main characters had good character-development and enjoyable acting, and the casting seemed very inappropriate. <br /> It's still hard to find a good movie-music in our days and ages, and maybe that's not quite qualified (there's plenty to learn how to dance, but there is no song) but I really think Gene Kelly and others who have championed a place to dance in our lives would have thought so much of this movie and the dance role in helping to tell a story about a man of medium-sized, successful and family in Japan, looking for a thing ... he does not know precisely that. <br /> <br /> For those in Japan who contributed to this film, thank you for creating and doing it.
