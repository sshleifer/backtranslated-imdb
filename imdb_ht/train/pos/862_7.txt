Carla is a secretary who is essentially deaf without his or her hearing aid. When he finds himself busy at work, he can hire Paul to help him out. Paul is just out of prison, and his past is not entirely behind him. To say too much about the story, which has many twists, would be a mistake. <br /> <br /> The most interesting thing about this movie for me is how sounds are used to indicate when Carla can hear and when it can not - a sort of "point of hearing" (such as point of view ). The early scenes that set this up, as well as the early character development of Carla and Paul, were more interesting to me than the twists and turns later on, some of which were hard to follow and / or stretched out a credibility bit. There are also some unpleasant violence. Back to the positive side, the cinematography was very good. <br /> <br /> The movie is worth seeing, but maybe not to look out. View at the San Francisco International Festival Festival on 4/28/2002.
