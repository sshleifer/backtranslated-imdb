This movie is among my favorite foreign films, some of the others are Amilee and my life as a dog. The similarities to these films as with many great foreign films are that it takes a mundane slice of life and transforms it into a sincere profound lesson. <br /> In Japan, a man who is bored with his mundane life and ruts in his married life, sees a beautiful Japanese woman staring out the window in a dance studio. At the time that he took his train to pass, he was enthralled by it. But is it only by her beauty, not far from her eyes, or a connection that will both discover to share? <br /> <br /> Do our Dance have memorable wonderful characters that have to deal with painful facts by the transcendents around the world of dance. Crushing traditional molds and stereo types in Japanese corporations, they risk all for happiness and find that happiness is not too far away. It is one of those movies that is so magical and meaningful, and, by itself, transcends the mundane by showing the true magic and miracles that their lives can.
