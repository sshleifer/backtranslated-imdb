I watched this film well over 100-200 times, and I love reading each and every time I watch it. Yes, it can be very corny but it is also very funny and enjoyable. The movie shown in the movie is a real camp that I actually went to 7 years and it was described as really camping, a great place to spend the summer. Anyone who went to camp, wanted to go to camp, or sent a child to camp should see this movie because it will bring back wonderful memories to you and your kids.
