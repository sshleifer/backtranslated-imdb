I give this movie an + + for the sheer camp of it! As Dietrich's daughter Maria Riva wrote in the book about her mother, "If one sees the Allah Garden in the context of high camps, it can be very fun." And how! I laughed with the pleasure of overwrought and amazing, ridiculously, fantastically melodramatic dialogue. Viewers who have read the accounts of the Toupee Boyer (he keeps coming unstuck in the heat) will snicker every time he makes an appearance. <br /> <br /> Dietrich and Boyer rarely look at each other when giving the lines - Instead of gaze in the distance, presumably for their face can be photographed in the best and most advantageous corners of the you're starting to a turkey might as well look good!). Dietrich Costumes are out of the world. As Riva notes in his book, Dietrich managed to steal the Paramount's Travis Banton and have her draw some of the most widespread gowns, such as the beautiful dresses & cape. <br /> I wholeheartedly agree with the revisions of others who rave on the Technicolor. It's really hard to believe the movie was made in 1936 - the color is fantastic. In short, if you look at the Garden of Allah with a gentle attitude and embrace its silliness, you can not help but enjoy it.
