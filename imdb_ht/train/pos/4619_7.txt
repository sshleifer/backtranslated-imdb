The first, I'm a big fan of 80s movies, and of Jennifer Conelly too. So, yesterday, I wandered into a local used book / movie store and found a VHS copy. I read back in and sound good for $ 3.99, it was a good deal. So I took her home and popped her into the VCR. What a sweet film! At my age now, I relate more to movies such as St Elmo's Last Night or Fire, but still I remember what it was like to be 15/16 and in love with an older guy, etc. We all There are these little little when we are younger. But if it does not work out, we're heartbroken and we think we will never find it. But of course we do. Several times. It's that kind of sweet quality that I really got into this movie. The feeling of "Oooh! I remember when something like that happened to me ..." is all across it. Characters are interesting and well developed. I recommend it to anyone who loves movies 80s, teen movies in particular, or anyone just wants to go back and remember a simpler time in their life.
