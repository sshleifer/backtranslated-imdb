I am very sorry that this good and whimsical movie (which I saw soon after it was first released in fifty early soldiers) had such a poor reception more recently. In my opinion it has been much underdeath - but maybe it appeals more to the European sense of humor than (for example) the American: Maybe in Europe can understand and appreciate its subtlety and more situations, since we are closer to some of in real life! A particular mention should be performed in the limited but good music - especially the catchy and memorable song "It's a fine, fine night", which is provided separately on a HMV 78rpm file (10 etiquette prin, I think!) fifty soldiers. I would encourage anyone interested to give it a try if you get the chance: you can have a nice surprise.
