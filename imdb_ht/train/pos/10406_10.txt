Abu, THIF BAGDAD, helps King Ahmed regain his kingdom from a cruel magician. <br /> <br /> As Europe went on to war with the world's major sections, it was going up in flames, London's film Alexander Korda revealed this escapist prize prize from the legends of the Arab Nights. Replaced with swords and sorcery, he gave audiences in 1940 a brief remake from the titles. It is also a fine piece of film, featuring good acting with a smart script. Conrad Veidt gets the top bill and deserves it, playing the evil sorcerer Jake. His face satin and the perception of his eyes make one remember the grim roles he played with those enough during silence days. Here is a cruel worth to look. As the juvenile thief, Sabu is perfectly thrown into this, his third film. While not a hero in the typical sense of the word, his character is certainly heroic in title & action. <br /> <br /> The rest of the cast does fine work. John Justin is both energetic & sensitive as the unenlightened king who must learn about the realities of living the hard way; Sabu gets an important part of the action (when he does not transform into a dog) but Justin is an appropriate athletic way when needed to be. Lovely June Duprez plays the prince princess in Basra, coveted by two very different men. The late late appetite of the film, massive Rex Ingram shakes itself as a genius and an attitude. <br /> <br /> Allan Jeayes uses his good voice to benefit from the Storyteller. Miles Malleson has become another unique role as the Sultan child of Basra, forever on her mechanical playground (Malleson has also been responsible for the play screen and the movie dialogue). Morton Rarities Funds show the king the blessing of legends. Mary Morris, later an outstanding stage actress, plays the double role of Jaffar's accomplice and the six-armed Silver Dancer. The movie began in Britain, but difficulties during the war made Korda moving to southern California, which probably explained the presence of American Ingram in the cast. Art Direction, at Vibrant Technicolor, is the most attractive, especially history of fairy tales in blues, white & pinks. <br /> <br /> ****************** ******* <br /> <br /> Born Sabu Dastagir in 1924, Sabu worked in the Maharaja at Mysore's Stables when she was discovered by the company Korda and placed her camera. His first first film (ELEPHANT BOY-1937, 1930 DRUM-1938, BAGDAD-1940 SERVICE, JUNGLE BOOK-1942) was best and he himself worked in Hollywood when they finished. After the distinguished military service of World War II he resumed his film career, but he became infinite prison for years of ethnic minority films, black NARCISSUS (1947) being one exception to great. His final movie, Walt Disney's TIGER WALKS (1964) was an improvement, but it was too late. Sabu died in a heart attack at the end of 1963, only 39 years of age.
