Breaking Glass is a movie that everyone aspiring to be in the music industry should see more than once. It's a very dark story about the way a record company manipulates a singer to do things way and make as much money as possible from it. Look at some of today 's research for a TV style show star on both the UK and abroad I still recall this movie. Though not an expert on the subject, the winners of these shows tend to have one big big first hit and then it's down from there. This movie predicts what they show even though the effect looks the same. After getting rid of his manager, he was very brilliant by Phil Daniels, slowly but surely the record company changed his lyrics and put it on stimulants and it was eventually totally burning. You star tomorrow potential ... THIS WATCH AND NOTHING !!!
