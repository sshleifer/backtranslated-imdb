As I drove from Skagway, Alaska to Dawson City, Yukon a couple of years ago and was impressed with the scenery, I can not help but want this movie even though it has beautiful colors and Scenic views would have been shot at where the current. Jasper in Canadian Rockies is a wonderful place, but still not real where the movie takes place. When the story moves to Dawson, it's when I feel Anthony Mann, who used to get out well, could do much more if he was filmed in the current place. James Stewart here is again a man fighting in his head, one side of him does not want to get involved with helping people stand in the way of making money, and the other side just can not look away from people being murdered. Ruth Roman is the ambitious woman who does not care about whom she steps, Corinne Calvet is the beautiful girl. Man is excellent directing the shootouts, but the high point in the film is how it does in the scenes out there. He uses the outside as much as he can and is helping the winter landscape, the predominant white, as it was with the green of the "Naked Spur" and the brownies of "The Man From Laramie". Like all-the Stewarts, this is a traditional western, with a difference in the elaboration of Stewart's character that is much more complex.
