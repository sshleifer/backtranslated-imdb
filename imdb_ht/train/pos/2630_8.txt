The "Lion King" is without a doubt my favorite Disney movie ever, so I figured I should give the suites a chance and I did. Lion King 1 1/2 was very good and had good laughs and fun with Timon and Pumba. Only problem, I feel sometimes no explanation is needed because they can create trail holes with just the feeling of wanting your own explanation. Well, I would highly recommend this movie to King Lion King or just one night and family. It is a fun flick of the same laughs with familiar characters as the first. So, hopefully, I'll get the same with the third installment of the Lion King series. Sit back and just think Hakuna Matata! It means there is no worry! <br /> <br /> 8/10
