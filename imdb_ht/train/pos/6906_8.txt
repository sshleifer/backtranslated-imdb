I enjoyed this movie. It was funny, cute, funny, and fun. There was a fine cast and really got upset by some critics for the reason that I really do not understand. No, it was not the "Grapes of Fury" or "Casablanca" or even "Moonstruck", but it was an enjoyable movie. Julia was excellent playing the psychotic man behind the man. The story is a little funny to be sure, but this is not high drama, as. I've seen a review of the film, probably the single sole good it got up and then ran into it a night when looking for a movie. I never heard it was supposed to stink until after I saw it, and I'm glad I saw it. Eventually bought the VHS tape on the bargain, and I looked at it once a couple of years.
