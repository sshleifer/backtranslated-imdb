There are many problems with Mystery Men. First of all, there are too many different characters for all of them to be given complex or even interesting personality. Special effects are detected in the story and are not really special. Paul Reubens is wasted in a domestic, youthful role as a character that simply farts and speaks of an unacceptable accent. <br /> Now on the decent parties. William H Macy, three words in the sky, and his performance as the trap is perfect pitch. The Sphinx is an exceptionally entertaining character that is just mystical and merely extracting from the mysterious traditional proverbs. Ben Stiller is very fun as well, showing a weak character tries to make it into the great superheroes league. All of the characters do, and that's an area that I get particularly ironic. That's because all the indie movie indie actors are trying to do it in their big league in Hollywood. <br /> <br /> To be honest, the reason I thought it failed in the office box is that America did not find irony. <br /> All in all I liked the movie, but I feel it would work better if more effort was put into tweaking the script rather than having CGI landscape unnecessarily and effectively.
