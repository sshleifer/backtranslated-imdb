I first introduced to "Eddie" by friends from the "across-the-pond" which knows I love intelligent humor. I'd rather be a comedy who might think they can do while entertaining like George Carlin and Dennis Miller. In "Dress for Kill" Eddie gives the same kind of social humorous observation that stimulates your thoughts on a subject all while causing your side to split at the same time. There are a wide range of subjects in this stand-up and they are simply hysterical. The piece on how to decide on the name Englebert's scene will leave you at point !! Thanks Andrew and Catherine! ... and "do you have a flag?"
