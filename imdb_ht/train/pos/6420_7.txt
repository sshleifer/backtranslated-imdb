This one is great! Robert De Niro and Cuba Buy has teamed up to make a powerful and very influential movie. This is the true story of the first US Navy Diver and the obstacles he faced in reaching his certification from a racist Masters Diver. Along the way, he must face plain nerves in all his classmates, not one of those who want him in their class. They move out of the barracks when it comes to. Finally, she gets certified and goes to have a great career as a US marine diver. Look at this one! It's a great story of honor and honor. As the story unfolds, we get to look at racism gently disappearing and everyone begins to respect people one at a time.
