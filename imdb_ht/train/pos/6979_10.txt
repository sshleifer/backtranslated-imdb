This is the real character and drama drama story at a level that sings most of what we see on television in the word. <br /> I was impressed right from the start. Do not be set if you are not a female Sci (like me ...) This can happen to the earth, the fact that it's another galaxy just makes the show more interesting. There is no space space or laser gun (no anyway) so far I've seen up to s01 e04 and I've gripped and wonder what will happen next as there are many possibilities. Throw to play roles and passions. Eric Stoltz is especially strong. <br /> This show really stands alone well, it does not matter if you look BSG or not, in fact they are different. I've read some negative reviews in science that were expecting less drama and more aliens with ray gun etc. but I would say to ignore them. <br /> This is a really positive start at a show. Lets hope they do not cann it after 1 or 2 seasons as they normally do with good show these days.
