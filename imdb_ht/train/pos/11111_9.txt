Sopranos are perhaps the most top-opening series you might have ever wanted to watch. It's smart, it's original, it's funny - and it brings the mafia genre as most people can not resist watching. The best aspect of this show is the overwhelming reality of the characters, placed in the underworld world of New York's crime families. For most of the time, you really do not know if the wise men will be stitching someone in the back, or buying them lunch. <br /> <br /> More additions to the realistic approach to the characters in this show is the depth of their personality - These are dangerous people, most of them murderers, but not God if you do not like them too. I laughed at the wisecracks, torn them when they made it in trial, and felt frightened of the sheer ruthless pity of a serious criminal. <br /> In the suburban environment in New Jersey is absolutely perfect for this subtext show - people are not always as they look, with the strong contrast between humdrum and actions taken by those seemingly petty criminals weighing up to the same chances . <br /> <br /> If you have not already, you most definitely should.
