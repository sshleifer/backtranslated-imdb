One of my favorite shows turned into the '70s. As I remember he went on air on Friday (or possibly Saturday) night on the Nine Network (?) Here in Australia. Darren McGavin and Simon Oakland were many together. <br /> <br /> Each episode usually got to a bigger point with Kolchack who is engaged in hand to combat with some sort of supernatural opponent. In their credits, the writers have made a concerted effort to get away from the usual round of vampires and ghosts as much as possible .. <br /> I remember an episode in which the adversary was the spirit of an ancient Indian Chief who / 'as a massive electric current that began murder in a city hospital. The final confrontation saw Kolchack trying to break the 'power power' in the midst of an explosion of sparks and floating flames. Oh well .... you had to be at the time but it was an interesting idea. McGavin always loads a lot of energy and enthusiasm in his role and this was one of his best. / <br /> Definitely deserve somewhere in the "Hall of Fame" TV. For quote Tony Vincenzo .... 'Your Kolchack is about it' ... Or, in the case of the Hall of Fame, 'of it'!
