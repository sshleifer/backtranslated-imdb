I saw this movie and even though I kind of know who the killer was in the beginning I still love watching it. I would recommend it to others. It comes on live movie network forever. And I think since it's close to Halloween might play it more. So please be on the look out for it if you are interested in watching it. I believe Alicia Silverstone has played her party very well. I really like it as an actress with people. It looks so nice and down to earth. Kevin Dillon's performance was so for me. I'm not trying to hit him or anything else but I believe Matt, his brother could pull this evil Evil pipe killer better. Kevin just seems too sweet for me. But I think he did okay.
