This movie is a lot of fun. What makes it great especially is two things: one simple way to embrace stereotypes, and discussions in the costumes and superpowers. There is an extremely appealing ceremony of the parody; The second is the sweetness of the characters and the quality of chemistry. Claire Forlani deserves particular note as the object of Mr. Furious's desires. There is a boatload of talent here. I realized some of the great expectations they could make, but this film is a lot of fun, and kind of sweet.
