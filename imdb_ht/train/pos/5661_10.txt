I see a lot of folks on this site who want AG to go out on DVD. Well, I bought it on DVD. (From Borders, no less!) While it's great to have this terrific show in a DVD box format, I'm upset by the fact that they added very few in the way to the "extra" (A director of directors from Shaun Cassidy on the Pilot Episode) and the episodes shown in the same order were put out on TV. The missing episodes that have never been shown before were running on the Sci Fi Channel in the box set but they tackled on the final DVD. If you buy the DVD series, find the current order to be viewed and you will be happier. (You will need to swap the DVD in and out of your player to see them in order, but you'll be happy.) <br />
