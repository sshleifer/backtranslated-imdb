Very nice action with an interwoven story that is actually not sourced. Interestingly enough they deserve watching instead of jumping past to get to the good parties. Having Jenna Jameson and Asia Carr√®re help her live up, too. Jenna in that sweater and these glasses is just surprising! Worth up just to see her!
