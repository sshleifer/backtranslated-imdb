Written by Oliver Stone and directed by Brian De Palma, SCARFACE paints a picture of easy memory. Al Pacino turns into a stunning performance as Tony Montana, a Cuban refugee becomes a powerful player in the drug world as he mercifully runs himself to the Kingdom of Florida. This gangster movie is harsh, violent, loud, gross, unpleasant and must keep the record pronounced words "f - k" most of the time. Nearly three hours, and yes it can get repulsive. A clever conscience constitution holds you in your seat chatting to crush a Christian master without mercy. <br /> Also play interesting characters are Michelle Pfeiffer, Steven Bauer, Robert Loggia, Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio, F. Murray Abraham and Angel Salazar. Pacino proves to be one of the greatest in his generation. He managed to bring the reality of his character that left a strong impression. This will not be a movie for everyone to let your thoughts move away from a disaster. Is this powerful enough for you? Crime does not pay for long!
