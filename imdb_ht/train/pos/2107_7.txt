I recently bought this movie with a lot of other LaserDiscs from eBay. Generally, I'm in war with action movies but occasionally I love romantic comedy. If you're bored by special FX FX today and high glossing your romantic mates you should check out Shop around the corner of a quiet evening. What I like about the movie is that the characters have a lot of patience. There is nothing false or pretentious about them. Take Mr. Matuschek for example: When he finds that his wife is cheating on her and one of her own employees she tries to inject herself. Not only because of the humiliation but because it was unfair to the character of Stewart. (OK, wet example.) <br /> Yes, the focus of the movie is narrow and the plot is predictable. But still, I loved it very much. If you like Notting Hill then you'll love Shop in the corner. In fact, Hugh Grant reminds me a lot of Jimmy Stewart.
