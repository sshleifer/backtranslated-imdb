As far as film goes, some are worth the time and energy. but with a recent resurgence of parody surges like Date Films and their makeover, it is a breath of fresh air back and discover a really funny farmer like Johnny dangerously .. After his mother has no end to medical problems, little Johnny goes to work for the crowd. What freeze is a series of gags, most of which work, there, however, the flop are occasional. But an alien gangster who can not master the American language (profanity of wisdom, at least), a rival gangster and a tremendous attempt to shoot her mouth (... once!), A small brother with D.A. who came from Johhny Dangerous, and a hot hot young starlet for his affection has Johnny occupied. <br /> And the viewer is busy laughing, for the most part, as every gangster-movie club skewered by a talent throw and decent writing. <br /> Not perfect not a long shot, but definitely good for a smile on a bad day.
