Summer is a must see for children and adults. My son had great fun watching all these funny birds and ice bears. We can learn a lot from this film and we should be proud of our great treasure of the earth. Some animals are in danger of disappearing. Exactly that issues should prevent all the authorities from our planet. <br /> <br /> This documentary offers many exceptional pictures that I have never seen before. Then it is well accompanied by a music in the sky. The principal has done a great job here that gets high respect. There is nothing that can stop me and my family to give the highest percentage of the land. I hope so much that this will create an end.
