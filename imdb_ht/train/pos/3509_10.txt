I saw this movie shortly back and it's still at the top of my favorite movie list. It is amazingly combined with what really makes the movie are the details of Tid Bits (such as 'Bustelo Coffee Coffee' being reused as a cup to wash her hair seed) that people do not see because you will not understand that THE PHOTO IS UNLESS ONLY. This is just one of those films that are very cultural specifically and in particular. Please do not hit this movie if you have no prior knowledge of the foundation he built on. I fully see what the writer / director has gone for, and has hit the target perfectly! This movie is very worthy of a better rating.
