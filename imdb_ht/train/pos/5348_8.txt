Another good movie Arnold. This futuristic movie has great action in it, and is one of Arnie's best movies. Arnold is framed as a bad guy in this movie and plays a game of death. This film is excellent with a large sci-fi movie / action movie. I've always loved this movie and it has to be one of the greatest adventure movies of all time. 10 out of 10! PERFECTION
