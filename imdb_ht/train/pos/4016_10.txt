This wonderful little movie has all of the elements that made the Spaghetti Western exciting and fun: GREAT music (none of the few .. if not only .. Boy composer works in the genre, Nora Orlandi ), sequence of excitement (and very greedy for the day!), with beautiful scenery and sunset (all in Almeria, Spain, of course). She also had a very good story with a beautiful romance of her romance. The actors performed wonderful works - and truly outstanding performances from Lawrence Dobkin and Rosalba Neri (in the most important role of a girl in a Western Spaghetti .. at the Leone Cardinal in "Once upon a time in the West"). Without posting any crowd, let me just say that this movie has one of the best finishes of any movie I've ever seen!
