This is an exquisite movie about the search for some Bliss in everyday life. Rally, work the camera, emotions, haunt the music score and the best charm of this picture to make it a must see. It is not easy to appreciate by the frantic or emotional stunting. The only flaw I can see on this movie is that it has not been captured in a more technically perfect movie format. It deserves Todd-AO, Technicolor and finest sound formats available. (An intimate film can be made in seventy-seven.) Gorgeous Italian villas effect on its people could make even more lushly and little ones would be even more pleasant to see and hear. As it is, it always requires attention as a sweet moving movie. I can not stop myself from watching it every time it comes to satellites. The transformation of the characters from, tight and frustrating is always a joy to look and I really should recommend it more often. The casting is perfect, the mood is perfect, the act is the highest humiliation. It is a medium-sized movie and choices to make. It's deep and thoughtful without blurring the viewer up with heavy hands. Watch it in one sitting and let it have its effect on you. If you do not find it, maybe you have not lived enough, or something else wrong with you.
