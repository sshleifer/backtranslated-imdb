Most of the feedback I've heard about Bullet Machine has been very mixed. A couple say that they think "he asks". Well, give these people I say, get some f @ ckin imagination and go f @ ck yourself. This was a very fun sticker. <br /> The story begins with this mechanical insect that attacks and somehow transforms its hosts into these GWW-suits looking, deathbots are called Necroborgs. Eventually you learn that mechanical bugs also put a little parasite on you, which then is able to control your action due to your hot-nervous system. Unfortunately for the love-seeking young people alone, they came across the path with the mechanical bug, and before you know the transformation they are taking place and without splattered. Is there a way to stop the transformation? Maybe a way to stop this mechanical bug threat? Why do the Necroborgs fight with each other? Are two singles desperate to express their feelings of empathy and embarrassment? It's only one way to find out. <br /> Go to bullet machine I was a bit saddened by the mixing reactions, but it turned out to be a great surprise. A few questions unanswered, some mean acting at times and a little confusing is just the weakest points I can think of. From the animated feeling, the parasites become little characters themselves and even in the low budget feel, this movie hit the right mark more than it lacks. With a story that constantly develops interesting enough to keep yourself asking questions of all mixing with the cool effects make-up and blood splatter, this is one fan cats in bizarro / horror / Tetsuo / fans splatter should check out .
