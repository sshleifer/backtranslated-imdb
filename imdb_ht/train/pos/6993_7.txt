This is not Bela Lagosi's best film, but it has received a good old style approach for some 60-storey settings. <br /> <br /> Bridges are thrown dead at the altar like flies. I think I would postpone the marriage until after the holding, but it's a horror movie, so I guess people ignore the danger for some reason. Anyway, Lagosi is a mad doctor, who needs fasting and blood money to keep her aging, ill and healthy wife. It still eludes the Keystone cops do not hide their body from a hunter (who would think of looking for a corpse to a harsh?), And their brides just caught on getting zapped. <br /> No movie like this should be filed without a female reporter Lois Lane who wants to catch the criminals on her own. Good to resolve the crime, the bad to keep his mouth closed at all times wrong, guess which Lagosi chooses for its next intended victim. I love "Little Haunted House" where Lois Lane gets blocked by a thunderstorm as a guest at Lagosi's disaster mansion. Hide passage, a vampire-like wife, a dwarf Igor assistant, and so on. Good stuff. <br /> Well done rhythm to keep the movie moving, and the story solves itself in an ordinary but satisfying way. If you love old horror movies, this one is worth a look.
