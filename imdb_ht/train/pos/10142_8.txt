Perhaps it's just because I have an intense fear of hospitals and medical items, but this one got under my skin (pardon the pun). This piece is brave, not afraid to go over the top and meet as they come in terms of movies. Not only did I find myself feeling so much hated for the screwer and much of sympathy towards the "screwee", I felt myself overpowering and feeling pain in disguises in certain junctions that are really rare and delightful for a Horror viewers somewhat jaded like myself. Some parts are very reminiscent of "Hellraiser", but come in as paying taxes rather than imitation. It's a heavy piece to surrender that does not offer the viewer much to consider, but I love being attacked by a movie once and a moment. This piece carries it and does not apologize. I liked this one very much. DO NOT watch chicken foods too.
