I'm one of those who would pull a thousand of broken glass to see a Hal Hartley movie. FROM TRUST WITH IRIS HENRY FOOL AND (my Hartley favorite) NON These unique Hal's movies in movies are an acquired taste. Influencing even mystery parts / espionage and wispy comedy seems to be solid. The comedy is not in your face necessarily, and often runs through a whole scene before coming to fruition. And in the case of GRIM FAY, end Henry Fool. <br /> <br /> Parker Posey star like Grim fault, abandoned wife Henry Fool and mother of Ned's only son son. Faulty live a quiet life until it comes home one day to find a CIA agent in his kitchen. His name is Fulbright (Jeff Goldblum, MAN of the year) and wants Henry's cottage. There are many Henry Fool notebooks and they've all been supposed to have nothing but crazy diggers. Apparently there's more to them. Secret research weapon or terrorist path? Who knows Henry. Fulbright agent tells Fay that her husband dies, but this is quickly surmised as a locker to find fault from her home and searching Henry (and she works ... but not the way she thinks). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < He also made a deal with the CIA to find his brother James Urbaniak from prison (he would help Henry escape the land of Henry Fool's original film.) Multiple events reached rapid succession: One with another to death, Henry discovered that being caught in "securing" by a jihadist, Fay liberated his brother, but unknowingly his son's life risk, and the CIA became its reality for endangering Faience. Hal Hartley obviously likes to play with themes. And he does the extreme here. Even the character (Grim, fool, Fulbright, Fogg) has implicit meanings of their own very funny. The on-the-top spyware films have given much time screen, too, as flaming guns in the stop-motion sequence, never hit our heroine even though it's right in the line of fire. Now that I am surrounded by this creation, I'll say that Parker Posey's overly painted Fault Grim is not the best part of the film, which is a shame to consider how much time it's on the screen. I realized this was probably what Mr. Hartley wanted: a non-married woman but in the extreme Italian. But it was still painful to look at times. <br /> <br /> Even so, fans will probably devour Grim Fail and beg for more. Though this was not Hal Halley's favorite movie, I know I'm ready.
