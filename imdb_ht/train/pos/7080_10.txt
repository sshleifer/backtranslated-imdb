Terry Gilliam gives a stunning movie, which I enjoy. Bruce Willis, Madeline Stowe, Brad Pitt and even the appearance of Little Christover Plummer make the movie absolutely brilliant! That's just the Terry Gilliam movie I've seen, with Twelve Monkeys definitely in my head 10. I think this is one of the four best Bruce Willis movies; and Brad Pitt is best. Brad Pitt delivers a perfect performance. Maybe one of the ten best performer actors I've ever seen. She played her role (Geoffrey) very compelling. Bruce Willis' role (James Cole) was also quite compelling. Both Bruce Willis and Brad Pitt act extraordinarily well. And the brilliant story returns the great performances; and back up, Terry Gilliam's superb leader.
