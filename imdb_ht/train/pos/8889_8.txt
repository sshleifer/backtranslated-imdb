I have lived during these times and I think the program holds the heart of the era. I think it should have been dealing with more of Afro American issues but I think it covers much of the program. She was afraid to sit down and watch the riots on T V hoping that they would not go as far as your family home and that she would not get burnt. I thought Jerry O'Connell did a great job showing a green coming back from the war. I went to school with guys back. Some have changed more than others and some are not so much. It encouraged me when someone commented that a problem was not covered enough or it was not fun enough. Live in it and then comment. I thought the movie was great and that everyone in it did a remarkable job. Thanks for a (sad and fine) journey down memory lane.
