Pet Semetary (1989) 9/10 Family Beliefs just moved to the small town of Ludlow. The family consists of a father, Louis, a mother, Rachel, a Gage brother, and a daughter, Ellen. Welcome to Jw Crandall. Today is 89, and can basically tell you about the whole story of Ludlow. <br /> <br /> Behind the new home, there is a path leading to a pet cemetery (spelled pet seminary). When Ellen wants to go up to see her, Joy voluntarily takes the family on a trip. This is the beginning of hell for the family of beliefs. When Rachel and the kids go, Ellen's cats church dies. Today feels that Ellen is not ready for the death of her cat, so she suggests Louis following her further up the path past the pet cemetery. <br /> <br /> Judy tells Louis to land this funeral, once used by Mikmak Indians. Louis Spice Church, without the help of the Judge. A couple of days later, Church returns, alive, but in hell. This film was one of two horror movies that might actually scare me, aside from the "Exorcist." The greatest performance would never be Zelda, Rachel's sister and spinal meningitis, or Victor Pascow, a ghost who tried to help the Christians from making mistakes in bringing things out of death. Movie plays a morning party. It is simultaneously sad and mysterious. She goes along with the beautiful movie. <br /> 9/10
