This is a great movie from the lost age of archaic made-to-TV drama. My favorite actor, Robert Culp, skillfully cemetery of a trajectory of strongly liberal and faith in the system, kneejerk conservatism and fear of crime, and homosexual psychosis. Adolescents are a stupid stereotype collection worse, and the eventual event in this film makes the Dragnet episodes look even threatened by comparison. But what's really bright in this is the great pace of the movie, building the fear and paranoia by degrees, as well as the feeling in all of California's settings. Cars are really great as well, as I remember. I give this movie a 10, and I challenge anyone to watch this movie and not enjoy every minute. Remember, just because it's made-to-TV does not mean it's not great art.
