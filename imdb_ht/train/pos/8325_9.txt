I liked the idea of ​​this movie from the moment I first saw a trailer for her. Einstein was still one of my heroes and the image of her as the sweet, playful, slightly angry genius was enough to get me to watch the movie. The spices added to Matthau as Einstein made it even better. The story is pure fantasy, but one succulent. A auto mechanic falls in love with a beautiful woman, who is happening in Einstein's niece. With the help of four Fairy Flowers in Physics, Ed is emailed on a quest to win Catherine's heart. Throw a jealous fiancé (which shows the worst in experimental psychology) and Eisenhower in the mix, and you have the best fun. The movie is full of great character actors and sweet fun and daffy performances. Walter Matthau plays Einstein as a miserable imp; Cupid with a slippery rule. Tim Robbins is pretty endearing as Ed and Meg Ryan play a step above her normal rom-com level. Stephen fried is a joy like "RRRatman" and Ryan's fiancé; who misses one sweetheart bone in his body. <br /> <br /> The movie falls below radar, but it's a delightful treasure that does not grow stale and repeat respondents. It features first-rate writing and performance and is a gentle treat in a less than gentle world.
