Thanks to Warner Archive, I can once again see this variety of variety varieties that are launched in everything but the kitchen sink. (The bath, however, is present.) This movie gives the screen time to all those who have been dealing with Warners at the time. If some of the artists seem familiar to some, it is because they are great in the days of silence, and most faded with the popularity of the talkies. Some artists are truly remarkable in the vaudeville era as well. You will be most impressed with Winnie Lightner, who makes two numbers. Also there are that French stars, Irene Bordoni who croons a love song in a sexy way. Perhaps one of the major highlights is two-strip Technicolor "Chinese Fantasy," which has been restored to this version. It's really nice and it's stars Myrna Loy and Nick Lucas. Finally, there is the massive "Lady Luck" finale that goes on for almost a quarter of an hour. This is really a season in the early-talkie era. Any old movie-movie will love this.
