This Oliver production is the mastery of displaying the evil layer of the human soul. What makes the remarkable story is a brilliantly unseen shining character, who blocks this darkness as it leads an innocent boy to the dangers engraved safely in the hands of his own family. Yes, though Oliver is walking in the shadow of death, he's not afraid. A stick and staff have console him. In the end, it is saved from the dangers of humanity. At the bottom is Fagin, the most cruel of the many. Fagin gaze repainted in its ways not once, but twice, yet refuse because it is willing to pay the price. Fagin is worse than Bill Sikes, because it raises little pikpok to become bloodthirsty. In the middle is Oliver. His innocence is volatile, but it is also secretive. The best is Nancy. Lack of trial, he ignores Bill Sikes' violence from his deep need for love. But unlike Fagin, in the probable life of his own, he repented of his sin by saving Oliver from Bill. Things are not as they look like. In my opinion, this quality is what makes art worthwhile - unforeseen. I would give this movie a "10," but its made-to-TV band and 70 ambiance were distracted. In general, a good parable and a story quite suitable for all audiences.
