A subject of life and death, what you can really say is the proper justice of the genius and beauty of this movie. Powell and the visual imaginer of the Pressburger know no limits, each frame is filled with bold composition basically. Switching between the bold colors of the "real world" of the black and white black in the sky is inventive, which shows us visually just how much more vibrant life is. The final court scene is also fantastic, as the judge and jury down the stairs in the sky to hold court on Operation Peter (David Niven). All performances are spot on (Roger Livesey being an exceptional), and the romantic energy of the movie is beautiful, never had a more romantic movie than this (if I have not seen it). A subject of life and death is all about the power of love and just how important life. And Jack Cardiff's movies are just enough to watch the movie alone, the way Kim Hill's face light makes it all the most beautiful, what a genius, it can do something as simple as a table tennis game look interesting. And the sound design is also impeccable; The way to remember the remembrance of the crucial point was a decision way ahead of its time <br /> <br /> This is a true classic that can restore faith to anyone in the movie, under appreciating on his initial release and today's audience, but one of favorites ever, which is why I give this movie a 10/10, in a word - Beautiful.
