Anyone who thinks anime is nothing but sex and violence must be silent forever after watching this movie. This is a fine film that tells Tetsuro's demands to avenge her mother's death, but also grows in the process. The trip on the sort of train to represent Tetsuro's trip from childhood to manhood. The music and visual films of the film are a bit dated (you can say it is a 70's film) and the animation is only slightly better than your average "Star Blazers" episode. But the story and the characters are so strong, it really does not matter. A must-see for any animation fans!
