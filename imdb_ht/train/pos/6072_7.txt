Branagh and Fishburne deliver excellent performance in this version of the classic Shakespeare. Branagh plays Iago better than I saw the character played in movie or scene. Some may say this movie is overly Iago-centered, but I do not agree. Fishburne, Othello's Dark Noodle in Iron Film, has delivered a powerful performance. Fishburne has always been a good actor, but this performance as Moors in Venice can be one of his best. <br /> <br /> The only problem I have with this movie is the simple subtraction of a number of important scenes. Character desdemona gives far less depth than it has in the play. In this movie, it might as well not be added to all. One of the worst cuts made by Branagh in this film was the subtraction of a conversation between Iago and Desdemona at the beginning of the second act. This part of the show shows that Desdemona may not be the innocent child he is describing as in this movie. There was a number of subdued painful integrity of this movie. <br /> However, if you have not read the play, or seen a movie version of Othello before, I recommend this movie. The story, cut or not, is still incredibly enthralling. Acting, as stated previously, very good. If some significant scenes were added, and Desdemona's character was prioritized somewhat further, this would be a great movie. As it stands, it's still an admirable version of the original. I give it a marginal recommendation.
