The story and the characters were some of the best I've ever seen. The graphics were good for the PS and the cuts off and overshoots were amazing. I beat the game at least 3 times and love every second of it. I felt the problem protagonist facing was credible and realistic and I believe he deserves an end. or at least one noticed. If they rest for the PS3 I would buy the system for just that game and maybe its amazing mgs4 also the idea and execution of the dragon system is enough to warrant a rental and top of the ad invented although sometimes copied (stupid beauty wand) combat addition system and the draw to make this game a definite purchase.
