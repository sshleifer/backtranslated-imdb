I had no problem with the movie, which I thought was very good. It is the current LAPD crime video scene that disturbs me. I wonder if the lion's door REALLY thought that the general audience would like to see people brutally beaten to death with all over the place. Padon Lion's Gate, this was an INCREDIBLY BADGE IDEA !!! <br /> <br /> Returning to the movie: The cast was excellent, especially Val Kilmer as Holmes late John. John Holmes was a sleaze, mistreated the women in his life (Lisa Kudrow as his wife, Kate Bosworth as his girlfriend), and it is hopelessly funded by drugs. His connection to Eddie Nash (Eric Bogosian) created a spiral that caused murderous gloomy gems. Exactly how much were Holmes involved in the assassinations? We can never know all the truth of the story (Nash is still alive with a free man), but the movie does a very good job however.
