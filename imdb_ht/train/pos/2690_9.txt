La Teta and the Luna (Breast and Moon) describe the life of a 9-10-year-old child named Breast who is obsessed with breastfeeding growing in Catalunya. I love this movie because the characters are very honest and very human, like all the characters in the Bigas Luna movie (also director of Jamon, Jamon). Breast reminded me of how intriguing and exciting life can be at that age. Also being from Catalunya (North-east to Spain) has brought lots of memories to my mind. This movie shows how beautiful Catalunya is, lovely people, beautiful lives and especially many non-impressive ones.
