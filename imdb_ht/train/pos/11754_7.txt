Robin Williams does his best to combine comedy and pathetic, but comes over a bit of Fallout. Donald Moffat is too one-note as his father in law. Jeff Bridges is excellent though that the quarterback, with Holly Palance and Pamela Reed are wonderful, bringing the movie to most of its rough spots. It's full time nicely but little more than that.
