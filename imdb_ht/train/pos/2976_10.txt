For a comedy this has a decent and inventive plot with Trey Parker and Matt Stone's detailed committee is perfect. There are dozens of funny moments of this fantastic film. I especially love the crowd in color and the way the conflict in the arena sports scene. Robert Stacks Unsolved mysteries parody is also very fun.
