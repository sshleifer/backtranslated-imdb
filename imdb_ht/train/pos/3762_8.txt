Alex Winter and Keanu Reeves return as the two dopplers of San Dimas who get sent on another journey into a life as a person from the future feels exactly the opposite way he was introduced in the first movie. The only difference is that travels are "somewhere" between heaven and hell and ends up being both. When they meet Grim Reaper, they get the chance of a life after playing it for a chance to return and stop from evil robots from damaging what the future is supposed to have. In addition to playing roles they have ... er ... perfected, they also play (and revive a couple of extra sales in the process) some classic games (I even have my original copy of battleship in the closet). <br /> The reason I loved this movie is better than the original is because it deals with "what it might be like" instead of "what was." Without the Torment, I can not give you more information about this (I guess you'll just have to look at them both and decide for yourself! 8 out of 10 stars.
