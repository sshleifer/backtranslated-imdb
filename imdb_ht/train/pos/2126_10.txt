Many on love and life can learn to look as they are in the shop around the CORNER. <br /> <br /> Ernst Lubitsch has another quiet triumph to add to his credit with this beautiful movie. With brilliant dialogue (courtesy of his longtime collaborator Samson Raphaelson) and wondrous performances from a cast of talented performers, he created a truly memorable movie. Always believe in playing up to the intelligence of his viewers, and fascinating sophistication about the slapstick, the director concocts a scintillating seasoned cinematic rhythm and elusive, enigmatic quality known as the? Lubitsch touch. The story is set in Budapest (and there is a mix of accents among the players) this is in no way consequential. The simplicity of the scheme is that any major American city or town can easily be the locus for the action. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Jimmy Stewart & Margaret Sullavan are wonderful as the clerks of love and romance and then with each other - without knowing it. The dialogues - so adeptly handled as they seem completely natural - perfectly translate the confusions and quiet despair as they seek for fellow souls. Theirs is one of the classic love stories in the cinema. <br /> <br /> Cherubic Frank Morgan has a more serious role than usual, that of a man of great passage in his little world to crush when he finds himself to be a shell. A stage stealer accomplishes, allowing no emotion to escape unvented. In addition, Morgan provided the film with its most joyous moments - near the end - when it determines that most new store employees, a young poor, enjoy a memorable Christmas Eve. Joseph Schildkraut adds another vivid illustration of his list of screen portfolios, the time of a Lothario toadan, aconophant who well deserved the punishment eventually fled. Gentle Felix Bressart has his biggest film role as a family man who really can not afford to participate in intrigued stores, yet staying a Stewart firm friend. Sarah Haden seizes the small role of a sales clerk. William Tracy is hilarious as an amateur ambition boy who takes advantage of unforeseen development to increase his sales force. <br /> <br /> In the small role, Charles Halton plays a no-nonsense detective and Edwin Maxwell appears as a doctor. The Mav Films will recognize Mary Carr & Mabel Colcord - both bloody critics - at the single scenes as grandmother Miss Sullavan and Aunt.
