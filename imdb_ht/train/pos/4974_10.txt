It was a delightful presentation. Hemo (Blood) as a Greek god played well by the animation and worthlessness, arrogance, superior snobbishness and innocent astonishment. The Quote (or Scene) I clearly note is when Hemo tires in "All this plumbing ... you have not learned my secret all" and threatened to storm out, the scientist replied to one word "Thalassa" - salt water that horrifies writer fiction but hemo mollifies and so cleanses so neatly into the chemical aspects of blood. <br /> <br /> These are a splendid mix of entertainment and information to make this a classic as cool and discouraging today as the day it was released. Encouraging interest and imagination is fundamental to teaching children to love learning.
