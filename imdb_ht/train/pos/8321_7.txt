This is a beautiful movie, though the quotes are dummy. It was sort of a guilty pleasure to watch. Meg Ryan seems to be able to pull the role of this kind of movie (another example is Joe vs. Volcano's). That's what makes him a star, in part. Walter Matthau, of course, has that ability, too, and he really puts himself in the role that makes a fun, entertaining Einstein. I suppose you could say that they are both good at show love characters, though love in different ways (love young woman vs love lodging).
