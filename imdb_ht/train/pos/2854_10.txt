A lot has already been told about this movie and I would like to join people who praise her. It's a very unique movie that uses elements of different genres: drama, comedy, gangster movie without making a mess in it. At points you just laugh loudly, at other points you feel for the characters that have errors and failures you look. Sabu's genius has been able to show some consequences of the film. One is that where all three people chase each other have an erotic day dream about a young woman being just passing through the street. This sequence is very well done and illustrates the characters of all three runners very well. It is erotic and funny at the same time. Another example of Sabu's genius is part of the film where the runners get tired. The first one, the typical deficit among the three men, summarizes the woman who leaves her for another person is back again, and you see them dancing with each other and in the next shot to dance with her head deeply moved. All the runners reach this point where they think they have something to go back or they are on track again. And in part of the movie they stop chasing each other, running in line, just laughing.So here is it all the beauty and ludicrousness of what we call life that Sabu managed to show off the movie. Its characters fail (to the end?), But it does not steal them from their dignity. "Monday" and "Postman Blues" make the justice Sabu claim that he is a genius. Go look at them! <br /> <br />
