I also saw this film at the Santa Barbara Film Festival. It was an excellent movie about adult family relationships. Paul Reiser wrote the film and included some similarities in his family. It was funny, hot, intense, and moving, as well as fun. A movie like this would do very well with the word of mouth review. I would definitely tell my friends and family to see this movie. Let's hope they will have the chance. I would miss this movie as one of the best movies I've seen in a year. It does not have any violence, action scenes, murder, sex, so obviously distributor questions if you do not pick it up. Believe me, there are people out there who would like to go see a movie like this that has plenty of value, instead of the many typical big bush boxes we usually provide.
