"Lost", "24", "Carnivals", "Desperate Housewifes" ... The list goes on and over. These, with lots of other high quality, show proving that we're in the middle of a golden age in television history. "Object" is pure engineering. The incredible, personal and psychologically unrelenting layers, stories, insisted by sublime cinematography (incredible use of the word, when describing a TV-show), a killer note, great performance and correction. Anyone who is not familiar with this, they miss one of the most important creative TV shows ever. It may have its problems, when watching only one episode a week, but the DVD format is actually an incredible way to watch this. Hope to keep it (as I'm sure they do).
