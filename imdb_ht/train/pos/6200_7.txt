Henry Fool is a better movie. But this is the perfect way to follow-up a movie like 'Henry Crazy.' To take Henry very seriously, 'lying' him with his mysterious aura. Even the shot open at Henry 'Crazy' when Simon put his ear to the ground as Henry comes walking on the hill is much more fully manifested in 'Grim Fail.' Jokes over-the-top, with more or less meta-jokes (on writing in the movie and the jokes themselves), are good but the opening of the movie is a little saturated in them. Also, Hartley's Dutch angle throughout the film is jarring, yes, its intentions, but it's compelling and over-utilized, it goes beyond jarring, what I would like to call, annoying. It's a flawed movie, but one must see for any Hartley or 'Henry Crazy' fan. <br /> But do not listen to stupid reviews, do not watch this unless you've seen the movie first. The intrigue, satire and essence of this movie is totally lost if you have not seen Henry Crazy. It's an end. It's just mute.
