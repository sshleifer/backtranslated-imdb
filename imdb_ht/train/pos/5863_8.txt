Even 15 years after the end of the Vietnam War of "Jacknife" came too late or was even useless. It's one of the few who try to deal with the second sad side of the war: Time after. Different in movies like "taxi drivers" or "rambo" that used to feature the main characters such as heroes breaking into a bad post-war movie environment allows the audience to face a different view on Vietnam veterans. Their development is shown very precisely before and especially after the war. These issues are obvious but in all this tragedy there are always feelings of hope on the basis of love and friendship. "Jacknife" might be quiet in Vietnam ever, but after nearly 15 years this is really compelling and includes justifying. Moreover, it may be that the war has not ended, yet; at least for some of us. <br /> <br /> The three main characters are amazing. De Niro has done one of her best works but Ed Harris is the star of this movie. Possibly, this was his best performance ever.
