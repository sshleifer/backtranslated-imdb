Good story with excellent animation. The influence of Frazetta and Bakshi is obvious, and that's a good thing. Anyone who enjoys the Conan Barber or dungeons toys and dragons should enjoy it. The battle between good and evil is clear off even though it may appear that at times our hero is neutral. Most commonly used in fantasy goblins are usually described as having white pots and blonde hair and elves and orcs having black skin and hair. Anyone familiar with Frazetta, Bakshi, or even Tolkien works know they are not racists. Anyone who enjoys fantasy fantasy would love this movie. It is not for small children due to violence and sexual orientation. The well-timed casting and the performances and music were the first percentage. I hope someone put this gem on DVD soon. I consider myself having a VHS copy in good condition.
