One of the things that interests me most about this movie is the way the characters and their associated stories are developing on the fly. I suppose the writers wanted us to find interest in the characters by force the characters. The situation of using the art and craft of furniture design and construction was a unique theme and / or analogy for what families / brothers and sisters went through in life. The complexity of having a twin serves as a surrogate father and even husband added great tension towards making this movie emotionally interesting. Also, although the story was not one of the masses could directly relate to (these Jewish / twin / family business) terms are universal as every family has a black sheep in it. This made it very engaging.
