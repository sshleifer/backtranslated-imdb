Valentine is now one of my favorite slasher films. The death scene is elaborated and most of the act is good. Marley Shelton made great as the female lead (better than Jennifer Love Hewitt's "I Know ..." movie). David Boreanaz, which is the main reason I've seen this movie, has a pretty bit, but she plays well. The exception to listening to good actors is Denise Richards. It was terrible in this. The only scene I was pleased to see him was * SPOILER * his death scene. All in all, it is a good movie to watch. You should definitely watch this before watching "Call" or "I know ..." again.
