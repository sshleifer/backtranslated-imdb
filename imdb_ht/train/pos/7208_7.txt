Playwright Sidney Bruhl (a beautiful Michael-Caine-on-the-top) would kill for a hit game. Entered gigantic kid (a solid Reeve) that just writes as a play. Ties to this bruly surprise wife (superbly played by cannon) and a German psychic (a very funny Irene Worth) and you've got yourself a flick of comical humorous movie. <br /> While not up to "Sleuth" standard, "Deathtrap" is no less a very capable, twisted range of funny comedy ride based on a terrific play by Ira Levin. The performers are obviously having a garden day with the material, and Caine in particular delivering head toggles and gusto lines. The movie loses a bit of midway to the steam and the finish is a lot less satisfy than a hilarious one in the original play but overall "Deathtrap" is solid, fun and thrilling.
