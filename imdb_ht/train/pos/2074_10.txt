Another 4 Channel Channel has long been before it's time. Convincing acting from Phil Davis and the rest of the cast. Sexy, intelligent and funny. I remember watching him at the time and even then asking around, no-one really heard about it. But trying to find someone now who can remember it is even harder. Maybe Channel 4 does not work well enough in the drum up the enthusiasm needed. Either that or the general public is too much interested in the TV's vomiting is Big Brother. I suspect the letter. Downloaded in black where Garth Merengie encourages Channel 4 to release a DVD in this series. Hopefully the same can happen with North Square.
