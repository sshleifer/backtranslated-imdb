I said, I liked Vanishing Point. I saw the original, and this is a very good rumor of it. Even if it does not follow the original scenario (that's why I gave it 8 out of 10), it's still pretty good and this is probably a better storyline. <br /> As for the car, quite the DJ's comment at the end of the Challenger goes 185 mph in the bulkheads is extremely improbable (but if you look, the speedometer needle was wobbling at 145-150), but even though I did not see one on the engine at one of the scene starting from the engine, the original storyline had a supercharged Hemi, so it's possible. For those of you who say aerodynamic would not allow it, the Chrysler 300C virtually aspiring today can go 168 mph, and if you look at this, go on a highway and it's like pushing a brick wall in the wind at 70 mph. Plus, in a tunnel wind tunnel if you put an air dam on the Challenger it would probably be more aerodynamic.
