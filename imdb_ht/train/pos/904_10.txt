Suraj Barjatya is best in wedding movies. And here it is; back to his basics on Vivaah. As the story goes this is a story from the wedding pledge. A movie you can watch with all your family around you. A movie you will hate watching alone. The story is simple, but the good music, cinematography is excellent, the best direction, everything about the movie has a class of its own. There are plenty of scenes that will make you cry and make sure if you are watching the movie with your boyfriend, you both will definitely keep each other up to the end of the movie. <br /> <br /> Shahid & Amrita today gave us films earlier than Ishq Vishq, & Shikhar. Though Shikhar was a good movie she was not accepted well by the public. A really Shahid & Amrita movie.
