The first time I saw this movie on a local station on horrors on Sunday afternoon back around 1969 or 1970. Uncut. I was just a kid at the time, but I loved it and was not really afraid of it. I thought it was such a cool and very original storyline. Thinking back, I'm still surprised that he's been showing during the day on T.V. enkut over the years. I've been looking for this film ever since, seeing it over and over again, and always enjoying it. One would think John Waters would idolize this movie. He got to be not only a scary movie, but one of the sleaziest, the trashiest films ever made at that time. And amazingly, you do not hear about this one as having the cult such a movie like "Bloody Feet" or "The Hills Have Eyes" bought over the years. He had such a cult, but he should really become a cult classic, in my opinion. As far as I know, this was a little before the birth was out, that's probably one of the first true films "movie". In fact, this movie contains elements of Hershell Gordon Lewis and a little Russ Meyer threw in for good measurements. Anyway, I recommend this to anyone who likes garbage, sludge, black and white horror movies from the early '60 (I think the date of his late 1960s).
