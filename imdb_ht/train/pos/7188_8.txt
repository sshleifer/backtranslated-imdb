Along with the "King of Men Rocket", this was repeatedly repeated on BBC BBC in the early mid-eighties. If I've loaded up a time capsule in this period both sets would definitely go in. Someone watching it for the first time is thinking it's funny but this is one of the best examples of "Serials". Don Del Oro will make you laugh (when I was little my nickname for it was Mr Dustbin himself) and it was funny about being shot in saying "bullet you can not hurt me" then it will break back, seemingly less happy. I also like being dispatched to Sebastian in the first episode. <br /> I watch this again because I had good memory in it's back years, there are some good exhibits and good music, it contains the ingredients you expect including water, rockfalls, bin trek ... From Episode The first (and Ralph Faulkner) swordplay was not nearly as good as I remembered it, and yes it features the inevitable "flashback" episode! It gets 8 out of 10 because it constantly suffers from slow speed, padding and other tricks. If you are interested in these series I recommend William Willney's book, "In a door, in a fight, out of doors, in a hunted" although there is a small entry on this series of it.
