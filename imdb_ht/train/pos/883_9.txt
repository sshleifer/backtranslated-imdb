I stayed back to look at "It's my mouth," a plate of Freedom of Peace before me. The food was quickly forgotten as I became engrossed by Jacques Audiard's original director and co-writer and superb actor. <br /> <br /> Carla (Emmanuelle Devos) is a secretary of a company that develops major building projects. It actually has some important responsibilities that do not often fall into the secretary who is capable and ambitious. But it is not a male hierarchy that will exploit but not reward it. Works pile up as soon as it can handle it, Carla said to hire a secretary. Include former constitution and general layout of Paul (Vincent Cassel). It lies on his / her skills and in fact there is no any legitimate enterprise might require. After a serious misunderstanding by Paul as Carla's interest in him, the two became their allies. An original friendship begins. In a cascade that would have made a real Carla a great contender on the "Apprentice," he trumps his egoistic boy to work with Paul's conventions. Exit the rival. <br /> <br /> Carla is usually deaf without hearing aid. With it he hears almost virtually. It turns the hearing aid to isolate itself from unpleasant sounds and annoying people. It is also very lonely. They made a heroic makeup effort make it appear plain but it's really nice. He does not have a boyfriend. She babysits so a friend can have a bondage (she is a French movie) worse and humiliating, she accedes to a girlfriend's prayer that she hangs somewhere while her friend is having her cut and her boyfriend in Carla's bed . Not nice. <br /> As Carla and Paul get to know each other better, this is not the old criminal who can reprimand in one capital. There's a side story, by the way, in Paul's relationship with his freedom officer who completely compares the main conspiracy and has his own great surprise to finish. <br /> <br /> "It's my mouth?" Engineer Paul acknowledged that Carla's ability to read, even at a considerable distance, is more than the entertainment entertainment he initially seems to be. <br /> From a developing hooker. Ase says. <br /> <br /> Paul and Carla are a true criminal oddball couple. He wants to love, but he will also accept money. He wants her, sort of, but business must come before possible erotic satiety. Together Cassel and Devos are strong actors wearing a strange crime story at the end of it is very compelling. <br /> <br /> Rent it or buy it, but if you enjoy a good crime story you will go for "It's my mouth." And you may well want to watch it several times: I do. <br /> 9/10
