The best of the seven Fuller Sam films that I saw (including Park Rings, running at the Arrow, forbidden!, Corridor Shock, The Naked Kiss, The Big Red One, and This Movie), Pickup South Street counts as one of the best movie noirs. It represents Fuller's most controlling. I love it when it is out of control, of course, but almost everything in Pickup is perfect. The movie is absolutely beautiful. Richard Widmark star as a pickpocket that steals some microfilms that meant to go to spy spasm. Jean Peters plays the woman who brought the movie to her boyfriend, played by Richard Kiley. Peters is forced to get Widmark and get it back. He found him in a feather pigeon playing by Thelma Ritter. Widmark and Peters are attracted to each other, which shift Peters loyalty (which, with the fact that he learns to work for communism; Cold War items are really interesting). The love story is made a little quick and not entirely credible, but it's not so bad that it's unexplored the movie (unlike Fuller's movie, Row Park). Richard Widmark is great. This should be one of his best roles, but I'm not so familiar with his career that I can say for sure. Thelma Ritter provides the most memorable performance. His role in filming an emotional emotional resonance, and his final scene in this film is as touching as any one you will find in the movie. I will never forget it. 10/10.
