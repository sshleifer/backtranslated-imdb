I just returned from Hong Kong on my summer vacation and saw the ZU legend. I thought he was leaving a * s! It was so creative and unique. It's the Crouching Tiger hiding dragon and a lot less drama. Though some have thought there were many special FX (yeah right!), You can not complain about the cast. Zhang Ziyi and Cecilia Cheung are so fine !!! Legend of ZU ..... kicks a * s !!!!!!!!
