Dudley Moore is fantastic in this classic largley unknown. This movie is a very spiritual film that is largely dependent on the actors talent. San Dudley Moore, Jan Gielgud, Liza Minnelli, and some others, this movie could be a disaster. It's not always good to shoot and at times there are some very coral music that tries to force an attitude ("psycho" that's like the music of the wedding battle), but the act of overcoming it. The character Arthur is hilarious, with his drunken comment. But it develops well into a more mature character, well rounded as it learns to live by its own free will. The end is fairly corny, though. I will not give it away, but it might improve. Worth to see many times.
