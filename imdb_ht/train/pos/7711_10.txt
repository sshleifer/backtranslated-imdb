Well, so Robbie is a little hokey-looking by today's standards, and some of the acting is very aiming, and most of the special effects could now be doubled by a 12 year old old kid with a decent computer editing program. And do not get me started on the poster. <br /> This is still a great movie, 40 years after it was released. I grew up watching "science fiction" on the local local television "Local Science Fiction / Adventure Theater" on Sunday afternoon, so I saw quite a few SF movies from the '50s. At a time when most movies were content to slap a tire suit on someone and have her demolished a miniature model in a city, banned planet forever raised the bar and it showed that it was possible to make a film science fiction that actually had a draw. I am skeptical that many SF films in the '90s are still considered worth considering in 2030.
