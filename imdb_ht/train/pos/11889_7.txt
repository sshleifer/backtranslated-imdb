Well-done, but basically remember low-life melodramas that, according to the accompanying interview with lead Isabelle Huppert, writer / director Pialat infused and a good deal of autobiographical detail; giving the mostly unsympathetic characters involved, it does not make any compliments - and it seems to have been a troubled man, as Huppert also says Pialat often disappears for the end of the day during the shooting! <br /> <br /> The act is exactly the same, however; Despite the relatively young age, Huppert and co-star GÃ©rard Depardieu (as the title character!) were already at the forefront of modern French stars - a statue that, with various degrees of success, they both hold on that day. /> <br /> I have 3 more of the Pialat film in my "VHS To See" pile, albeit all in French without subtitles English; Due to this reality but also realistically oppressive GOULOU - in spite of its undeniable artistic value - I can not say that I'm in any hurry in particular to check them out now.
