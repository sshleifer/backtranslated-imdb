This movie will not sit well with some, but it is a must see. I am glad someone finally brought to discuss the facts of how American couples worked to make a name in their community and how many of them felt trying to stay there as the "other" African Americans moved. (Minor Spoilers) <br /> This little showtime movie is almost like a Spike Lee Joint ... you have a Black American boy (Danny Glover) who worked his way to HARD in the traditionally white professional professions of the 1970 la. Like any American, he moved his family to be compatible with his upwardly mobile situation, but forgot, there was still plenty of trouble going on. Only African Americans in the neighborhood of the time were maids. Who Owns a Home? Wow. <br /> Then the mix of started. His wife (Whoopi Goldberg) said to "get involved" to do all the other women in the neighborhood. And just when the man thinks he and his family are "in", the next door next comes to another African American who got in because they got the "Lotto" (Mo'nique), and in his eyes he He wanted nothing to do with them so he does not want the neighborhood to think they look like. He, of course, is in a better gauge, his new neighbor is "ghetto" not a should not be! Who had a problem right now? <br /> What does this movie show you are great pain it takes for this family to fit into, and how to lose themselves in the process. It makes you wonder where racism starts and ends ... and with whom. It shows how no matter what color you are and how much you have, you can always close yourself off from the real world and help people around you. It also shows how African Americans are when the "mixed" neighborhoods such as those falling into the trap change their mind in the culture suit (filling with blonde hair and blue eyes, yourself!). They laughed along with their jokes, they do not know they are the joke and they do not know .. why. <br /> But in general, this movie is about 'people'. No matter what race you are, this movie gets into how horrible you can towards your neighbor and toward each other ... all for the sake of fitting .. as long as you feel you have more money than others, so that automatically makes you better - and you forget the struggles you were with those who came behind you. <br /> <br /> Again, NOT for everyone. But take a look and judge for yourself. <br /> <br />
