It is a rather good film, but too American in its predictability. Changing Kung Fu for Soccer and Turkish Families for a Pakistani, and you get to watch her bend as Beckham (2002) almost scene scene. A nice feature of the film's backbone is the progression of battle with the mysterious Ninja under the highway, starting with miserable losses and slowly progressing until the last battle is a win against himself, as master of Kung Fu insist several times. At a different level, the Danish life looks quite different than the image it has by foreigners: non-indigenous immigrants who make a large proportion (actually, the majority) of the Danish citizen, graffiti in the suburbs of Copenhagen, taunting of the girl the immigrant begging in the movie. All show a different picture than one has in mind when someone hears God's word.
