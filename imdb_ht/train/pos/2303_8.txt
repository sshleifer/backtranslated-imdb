THE MOON OF PEOPLE is a warm and moving coming to drama age santing around a farming family in the 1950s. The main story follows an old girl (Reese Witherspoon) who has developed a crush on a 17-year-old neighbor (Jason London) who finishes up for her older sister (Emily Warfield) and how a tragedy would not be expected control the family's dynamics forever. In the 1950s with tenderness evoked here and the scenario gives you the character come to care about almost immediately. Witherspoon has already started displaying Oscar-won talent he would develop in this early role and London made a good leader. Warfield has a quiet maturity in the role of the older sister who is also effective. Kudos Sam Waterston and Tess Harper are playing the girls' parents and Gail Strickland, who plays London's mom. I have unexpectedly been moved by this tranquil and affecting drama that burns up strong emotions and gives much meaning to the phrase "family relationship."
