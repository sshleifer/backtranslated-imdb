Musician Irving Berlin gave Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers another pluperfect music after Top Hat if that was possible. Although in this case as Jerome Kern Confection Roberta's being in, follow the retold fleet to Randolph Scott and another singer, this time Harriet Hilliard. Randolph Scott is a marine CPO career with Fred Astaire is a former vaudevillian who was enlisted by the Navy to forget his former partner Rogers generation. But now the two are on the shore side. Fred and Ginger take up the right place to leave, and Randy accidentally meets Harriet's sister Dyer Ginger who flowers in a real beauty. But Randy's a typical love 'em and let' em sail. <br /> <br /> Again Irving Berlin wrote a full hit note with her tightly overseeing production. Ginger has made some really exceptionally vocal and let yourself go that he and Fred later dance. But the real hit in the show is to leave the face of Music and Dance which is a number making in a sailing show. Sung first by Astaire and later danced by the fear, Let's face the music and dance is one of the great romantic numbers ever written for the screen. The dancing on this one is absolute magic. <br /> I'm sure when I mentioned Harriet Hilliard some young people might wonder what was. But they will know immediately when I mentioned her in conjunction with her famous husband Ozzie Nelson. This is right Ozzie and Harriet. It's something of my mystery why Harriet stopped singing when she just came to David and Ricky's mother on television. Then he did not even keep his own name. <br /> By Ozzie or Harriet was singing on television. Ozzie was an imitation of Rudy Vallee as a singer, but Harriet could really bring a tune. He sings to get you behind me Satan and the Moon and I'm here, but where you, both with real feeling and the class. I recommend you see Follow the Fleet if for any other reason than to hear a scarcity of Harriet Hilliard incredibly forgotten today.
