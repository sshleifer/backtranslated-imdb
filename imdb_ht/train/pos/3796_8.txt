Jim McKay has made one of the best films you will see all year.The quiet simplicity of this film draws you to from the opening shot and never allows to go away. There is not one fake score in the movie all. Not one.All work. The camera but kept has never been distracted and always where it should be. Three young ladies whose lives are still real. There is no one to beat where the audience recalls we are looking at actresses to perform a role. These are just real girls trying to find themselves there. There is no political agenda , hiding or otherwise. This is the cinema of its most basic, and although it will probably only be seen by a handful of movie viewers, it deserves a much wider release. special hats go to Hugh Hefner to give the movie-makers and money the subsidy needed to get this important movie. I can not wait to see what Mr. McKay does next.
