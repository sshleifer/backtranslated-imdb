A wonderful movie by Powell and Pressburger, whose work I now want to explore more. The movie is about what we see as real and real, and how the two can be so difficult to distinguish between each other. So much injection and acting, although David Niven does not seem to have 27 years old, as his character claims to be. Fun to see a very young Richard Attenborough. This movie made me think, while I watched her, and later.
