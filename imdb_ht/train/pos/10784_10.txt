Though not in the entire movie, Andy Griffith again plays his best role in this CBS TV-movie. The plot is easy-Griffith's character's death and his last wish is that his wife and children spread his ashes is the place he called (hill somewhere). Even if it will never be seen on TV and never be released on video, if you get the chance to watch this - TAKE IT.
