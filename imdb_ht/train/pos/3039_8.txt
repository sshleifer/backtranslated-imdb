Frank McCarthy has been producing the Academy's award winning Patton Biographical Film Track with a tremendous amount of money from another American general Douglas MacArthur. Gregory Peck gives a strong characterization of the man, his genius as well as his selfishness. With MacArthur you never knew well where one started with the other left and over time was entrusted. The whole story of Douglas MacArthur would be a six-hour movie or a mini-series TV. He would cover it from his day on border posts and his family in his time at West Point where he still has the highest average average achieved by a cadet. He would talk about his service to the Phillipines as a young officer, his legendary building hero on the battlefields of the First World War in France. He would also say about shooting on the Bonus Marches at World War II veteran in 1932, probably putting the final kabosh on any chance President Herbert Hoover had to get re-elected. During the recent years MacArthur and Hoover had a swing penthouse at Waldorf Astoria in New York City. Such a topic should be avoided. <br /> This movie focuses on 1941 to 1952 and she says in flashback. The film opens with MacArthur addressing the student's body in 1962. As he spoke in the famous Peer Honor Country speech, MacArthur's head turned into World War II and his desperate struggle against the Japanese advanced on the Corregidor Island and the fields of Bataan on Luzon. The film took him to his fight to win back to Phillipines, the occupation of Japan and the first 18 months resulted in his relief in order by President Truman. MacArthur as a movie would not work at all if it was not for the portraits of Dan O'Herlihy and Ed Flanders as President Franklin D. Roosevelt and Harry S. Truman respectively. Part of the movie I loved the best, see MacArthur and her relationship with both of these guys. <br /> <br /> FDR by O'Herlihy captures the aristocratic squire and exceptionally devious man who was our 32nd President. Roosevelt was a man who got his points across and strange intricacies and intelligent. Sometimes he likes to grumble a little too much for his own sake, but he was the master politician of the last century. Notice how it deals with MacArthur both as a battlefield commander and potential rival at the same time. <br /> <br /> Truman by Flanders is like people remembering him, a blunt person talking to MacArthur's notorious minds from Gitgo. Of course read in the story of how Truman relieved MacArthur in 1951 for insubordination. MacArthur was insubordinate, no doubt about it. But I could write a whole on the Truman-MacArthur relationships. Along the way he does not need to ever come to a crisis. I always felt that FDR would have been dealing with everything in a better way he was still president then. MacArthur was also grandly eloquent and Gregory Peck captured some of the eloquence of some of the orations that made him as much a legend as victory over the battlefield. Listen to Peck's Japanese surrender, I leave you in MacArthur in the nation before the joint session of Congress, and of course the speech of the cadets in 1962. Watch the magazines and see if you do not agree.
