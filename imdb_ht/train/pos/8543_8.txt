This was one of those films I probably would never have chosen from the shelf, but it came on IFC one day, I said - Eric Stolz, William Forsythe ... why not? If I would change the channel, I would really miss a treasure. <br /> <br /> The subject is depressing - young author is paralyzed by crashing crash conversations at lower class rehabilitation centers. It would be so easy and tempting to make this a worn-out manicure. But that does not happen because it was written by Neal Jimenez, after he even accidentally paralyzed. No Hollywood happiness here. All the patients in the parish come from different wildlife origin, but they share a feeling of helplessness, so they are in the mercy of others. Pride is very good as a "Lone Wolf" type, forcing off embarrassing dependence on his girlfriend (Helen Hunt); Wesley Snipes is the kind of an old lady whose family is falling apart; but William Forsythe took the cake as a tough guy to make a person pay for taking away his independence.
