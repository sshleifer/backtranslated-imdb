I loved it! The plot was weird, Drew Barrymore and DC made out were left for both of them. Drews act has dodgy in place but this might go down to his life at the time. Dennis Christopher as the shrill was very cool, and as always he did his best - I'm a big fan of Dennis anyway, so I bought the DVD. <br /> I did not get the finish! That strange animatronic red skeleton thing looked just like it was from filmschool, which is OK I guess but it could have been more. <br /> <br /> .... and all the stuff with the knife - if it was so uncomfortable why did not they just get rid of it? <br /> <br /> It was very confusing as when was this unusual Doppelganger thing or when it was DC - or was Dennis ever? Because the doubleganger made out with Dennis and Patrick. At the scenes with Patrick if he was Dennis as the Doppelganger then I think Patrick would notice. <br /> <br /> The music was OK but cloudy in the places, the whole orchestra note seemed to revolving in a theme but this theme was overdue. <br /> A great blend of many blood and gratuitus shots in Drew naked. <br /> <br /> All in all a bit of a GPM-couple movie fun. Do not overdo it, do not look for secret messages and a fantastic script because you do not find it. There are some diamond and goofs dating - wATCH it and just have a little bit of fun with it!
