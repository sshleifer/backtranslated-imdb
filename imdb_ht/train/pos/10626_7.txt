This is a little decent cops made in Michigan, about a guy who is haunted by his past, with his abusive mouth (Gunnar Hansen) and has grown up by so-well-adjusted. In fact, it is absolutely bonkers, but try not to be too obvious. He also had an entourage, his own little demon & angel who followed him around. The demon never says a word, but really, no, and it's Max Schreck-Creepy. Let's just say that the angel very much turned his attention to that, as Eric is busy doing things that make him feel better, such as "liberating" people that he decides to need, especially beautiful young women. This is a decent portrayal of madness, and you are kind of your own at some point figures to figure out some of what's going on, but in general I watched this from starting to end very much focus on the movie because it definitely occurred to my interests. It's a little lacking in some areas but nothing I can really put my finger on. A decent effort and worth seeing if you like cops killer series.
