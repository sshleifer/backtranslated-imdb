I saw this movie in Winnipeg lately - appropriate, given location to use. I first read Lawrence's book back in 70's and for me, it's still a very powerful photo of the trials of aging in our society. He remembers when I was young, and he resonated even more now. When the movie came out, I was keen to see if the story could survive. and were well impressed, especially with Ellen Burstyn's performance. It manages to give us a complete break, even though the character is generally nicely and judgmentally - someone you do not want to live with. It's great to be able to see the favorite characters come to life so genuine.
