My son was 7 years old when he saw this film, he is now on a Russian fishing vessel, saying that the movie he was most impressed with and was waiting for himself all these 39 years is The movie of the legendary Boy and the Eagle. He asked if it was possible that I get this for him. I'm sure a lot of things go to her head as she has only 3 hours of daytime and she's been on this boat for 3 months and will have 3 more months before her contract expires. Since we have Indian blood she connects with this film. On January 27 he will turn 47 years old and I would like to be able to get this movie for him. He lives in Thailand and has been a commercial seller for the past 17 years and as we all know this is one of the most dangerous tasks. Can you help me get this movie? Thank you in advance, Dolly Crout-Soto, Deerfield Beach, FL
