Although I have not seen this mini-series in over twenty years I can always remember how the balance between characters, draws and stories of wonderful adventures in place. The use of special effects prevented a poetic effect rather than literally telling in the story. The two versions I saw were armed (English and French), but the actors appear to speak their own language not only Italians for having a sync problem. It does not spoil the story story. Among the castles of Pappas Irene as Penelope is the most recognizable of the North Americans. Recommended to all followers of Odysseus' ever return.
