The movie begins with Vincent Price on to begin her performance as a magician. However, mid-way at the show very successfully, the police came up with her shut down. It seems that his old boss has cheated him out of the tricks Price created - even those he did in his own time at home. As a result, the price justifiably kills the wrong man. The problem is that while the viewer understands why Prix dies and most probably thought this was something good, because Price was a bit upset, it just could not stop at one (sort of like eating potato chips a). <br /> The movie was full of magic tricks very spectacular and spectacular (including a large circular saw with a crematorium for the shows), twisting big draw as well as exciting action. One thing you can not tell about this movie is that it is dull. While it's far too subtle, it's fun at all, though and well worth a look. <br /> <br /> Have I never seen the Vincent Price version of HOUSE OF WAX, I probably would like the MAGICIAN MAD a lot more and scored it a 8 or 9. It's because while the MAGICIAN MAD is a wonderful movie, it's very reminiscent of the movie that's before it (HOUSE OF WAX). The bottom line is that since house of WAX has been so successful, the formula has been re-tore into the follow-up movie. Both made in 3-D, both have a scheme where Price has all justification to kill but it can not stop once it commits the first and both are great fun to watch. The bigger differences, and some, is that HOUSE OF WAX was in color and was more of a horror movie and the MAD MAGICIAN was definitely more of a mystery. My advice is to see this movie AND HOUSE OF WAX (the Price version only). They are both movie films 1950's.
