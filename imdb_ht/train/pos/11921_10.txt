This movie was one of the best Disney movies I've ever seen. great for the whole family to look. Their ideas can be a little far-fetched, but it's a feel-good comedy and the act is great. love the little boy, jp. and award-winning academies the Adrien Brody winner may have been very short, but very memorable. highly recommended.
