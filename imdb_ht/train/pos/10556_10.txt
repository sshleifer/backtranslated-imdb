I did not know what to expect but I'm glad I was going to see it. A smart, slightly twisted comedy that makes you think. I was not quite sure how a director can create "nothing" but leave it to Mr. Natali and the brilliant people of C.O.R.E. to create another low budget series that looks real (as real as nothing can be). Well worth your time and money, if you have the opportunity to see this, please go. You will be glad you have done.
