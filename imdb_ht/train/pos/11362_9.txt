I believe this is the most powerful photo HBO Photo made on date. This movie should have been released in the theater for the public to see on the big screen. It is available on video so be sure to look for it and check it out. Chris Gerolmo has done a great job with the direction and the scenario. Their performance from Stephen Rea, Donald Sutherland and Jeffery DeMunn are unprecedented. A masterpiece in the genre.
