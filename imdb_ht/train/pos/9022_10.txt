Well, Tenko is undoubtedly the best British TV show ever, performances, directing, filing, suspending, drama ... everything is fantastic about it. a little later in its final season, this film ends up picking up the nicely and modern threads a superb story for fans of the show and newbies. I can not recommend this movie anymore, get it and watch it. But I advise looking at the first series, as the first 2 epic even better than this fantastic movie. <br /> An obvious (10/10)
