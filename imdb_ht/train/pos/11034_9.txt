Eric Valette is obviously a film-maker talent, and so the two men wrote the script. Therefore, Mal√©fique is a great movie, made with just a few bucks, but also tons of imagination. Well, I'm a bit exaggerated, but I'm sincere. So, if you like darkness, movies, go and see this one. It's really worth it.
