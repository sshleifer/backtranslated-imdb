Great Caruso shows the unique talents of Mario Lanza. It shows great ability to act and is in the form of a lyrical singer, scary and Dorothy Kirsten, soprano of the Metropolitan Opera. Indeed, I give to say that he has some songs better than Caruso (checking A'Vuchella from Tosti and La Danza from Rossini). The MGM artistic department and music have also done a great job. This movie might be perfect, not for the left presence of Ann Blyth; we see that he's trying his best, dressed in the fifty style of stage just before 1920 - unforgivable. Lanza deserves a better lady, and Blyth should stick to less demanding production. Also noted that Mrs. Kirsten sings most of the opera drugs in the movie with Lanza, giving the wrong notion that Caruso had a permanently leading soprano.
