People C'mon, look at the title! LOL! I remember seeing this movie on Saturday night features lent last year. It's a great, cheesy monster and hilariously bad act acting with wonderfully moronic hillbillies that adds to the Schlock factor. 2 redneck boat rental guys are the movie! LOL, and you will love the pirate scene where the English guy and his wife talk about all the stars and it's in the middle of the day and the sun. Sanglan hilarious !!! You can tell them just did not care about plot, they just wanted to blow in filming in the movie as fast as possible. Below, you'll love it if you like the Schlock 70.
