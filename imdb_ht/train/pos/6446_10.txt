"So in Heaven" was probably one of the 3 most beautiful films I've seen in my life. That it does not have the Oscar, I will not shed a water. This film is of a kind class of its own, that an Oscar win would possibly be detracted out of it !!! My dear friend Anders (Nyberg), you made true magnification and feathers here! Home Pollak, with your creation, and everyone contributes, we all gave a gift to love in our world. Between the points of entering this world of you, then exit it - you really can say that you did it better! A special personnel tells you my soul's thanks to all of you, that you've brought back some precious memories from the second decade of my life. I grew up in Sweden, and my mind and presence of Beingness was formed and shaped by many beautiful influences, people, traditions, music and nature. My blessing is with gratitude to all of us. With love and light, George-Gabriel Berkovits Soulhealer, Johannesburg, South Africa
