I also went to very loss of personal loss (twice) and this film shows the wrenching reality of the experience very well, life out of balance, nothing makes sense, well meaning, etc. ... It was nice to see Ally again. He is one of the favorite movie actors ever. <br /> I laughed and cried as the story unfolded. Great story and cast. Well done!
