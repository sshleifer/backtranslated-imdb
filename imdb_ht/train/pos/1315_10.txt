I've seen this film more than once, on television. I always watch it again ... NEVER turn the channel. This film is full of frustrating surprises, and absolutely corner-of-your-seat suspension, without being overbearing or stupid. Helen Hunt's talent is breathtaking show in this movie! I recommend this movie to everyone !!!
