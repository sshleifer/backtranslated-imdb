One of the great things about many of the superb Chinese movies you can find, if you're lucky, in the video stores, they are very recognized the rehab of true, true stories. Farewell, my concubine, the Emperor and the killer and this movie are perfect examples. The film makers take a true story and work hard to create a movie without compromising their reality for dramatic or commercial convenience - the feature of many Hollywood, and especially Disney films. <br /> <br /> In this story we followed the later years of a famous street scene scene armed the King of Masks for his Masters of Sichuan Art Change. Together, he lost his only son many years earlier and searched for an inherited male carrying on rare art and dying in a society that prohibited women from having such work. Master Wang sold a son by a slave trader. Everything is so good that he gladly prepares to spend his art. But the son eventually found out to be a girl. From there, the story is very interesting, with a good performance by Master Liang of the Sichuan Opera - a regional operatic style related to Beijing Opera. Fans of Fascinating Conkub should look carefully at Liang's paintings in a male role playing girl in Chinese Opera. It can help them come to understand that the players in the role women were probably not homosexuals or castrati, but those who are psychologically conditioned as to be totally unaware of their own sexuality.
