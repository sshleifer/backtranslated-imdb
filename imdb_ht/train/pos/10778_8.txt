Now this show seems most of the other shows in its kind in the middle of the 90, but the only thing is about this one is that it's different, using a lot of comedy and action in one such and maybe a little bit of drama too. I personally thought it was a good show, I can not understand why it would be canceled. The good thing is that the fan base of this show is still alive since 1997 up to date. <br /> <br /> I hope the WB brings back the show or even makes a movie, which I know is going to be impossible, but hey it does not hurt to dream, does not it? <br /> In any way, I would recommend if you have not seen it get the DVD in all 13 episodes, because the characters are great, the good story lines, the comedy is good and the whole show is just great .
