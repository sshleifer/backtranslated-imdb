I like this movie. My only desire was that some of the original songs were changed. <br /> It is true that Frank Sinatra does not get a chance to sing as much of this movie but it's also nice that it's not just another Frank Sinatra movie where he's mainly singing the song. <br /> I actually thought it was best to use Marlon Brando's own voice as he had the voice that fits and I could not see a man with this great voice pulling on feeling gangster in his voice, . <br /> <br /> The Stubby Kaye "Sitting, you're the rockin 'boat" is a foot-tappin' song-a-long that I just love. It's a tough act to follow with his version and I still love him the best. Vivian Blaine is just fine in this part and "Adelaide's Lament" is my favorite song. <br /> I really thought Jean Simmons was perfect for this party. Maybe I would not have first considered it but after seeing it in the party, it made sense. The Michael Kidd Corporation is timeless. If it had been the scene in 2008, I would not change anything. <br /> I find that many times something lost out of the scene version of the movie version but that keeps the feeling of the stage even if it was on film. <br /> I think the film was well disposed. I've done in the regional version of this and it's one of my favorites in this period.
