The 'Sentinel' is one of the best movie horrors already made in the movie industry! I think it's very scary as very few movies actually are. Alison Parker is a model with some fame. It's a lawyer called Michael Lerman, and she's as a best friend, another model called Jennifer. Everything was great in her life, until she decided to live alone for some time and rent a beautiful and old apartment. The problem is her neighbors, who are very, very strange. Suddenly Alison starts having health problems with faints and frequencies; She also remembers some painful things about her past who make her dream or illusion. But everything has a purpose, and it has to do with the new home it lives ... <br /> I personally get the 'Sentinel' a very crazy movie, and along with the '' Exorcist '' are Two of the scary movies I already look. When we discovered that Alison's house was only occupied by the priest and himself without my frozen! It is also terrible to see that he needs to be blind to the end of the movie in order to be the new Sentinel to keep the monsters away from our world.
