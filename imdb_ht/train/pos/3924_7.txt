This film 1939 from director John Ford and writer Lamar Trotti tells a fictional story of young lawyer Abraham Lincoln, his trial (literally) and his tribulations. It is a sentimental film that is reasonably well done but hardly impressive. The casting of Henry Fonda as Lincoln looks like a mistake, so while the actor has the high quality doleful for the party, even with several inches of makeup and a fake nose it's too cute for Honest Abe, who was famously family. It's a good try out of Fonda, who's nothing if it's not sincere, but miscasting it to launch the entire movie. Throwing in support is excellent, though, and includes Alice Brady, Ward Bond and Donald Meek. But Ford is too reverent in his treatment of Lincoln, who is presented as just shy of a saint, and at the final stage the movie goes way on the head.
