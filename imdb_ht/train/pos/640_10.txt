Me and my sister saw the premiere last night ... it was so good we were stuck for everything .. hahaha .. i think i'm hooked for the season !! .... they are some really good actors in this stuff .. The coaching guy and the player who loves to burst were very good and the draw had already received me but I do not really understand how they will keep him stretched for a whole season .. there are probably some big tho tho..i cant wait until Tuesday .. finally Jeremy sumpter who is it? I can say hes going to great! it was soo good we fell in love with his character right away .. cant wait for the next episode .. go Jeremy! <br /> <br /> 'Aimee
