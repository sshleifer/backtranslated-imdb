Who came up with stories is one sick person. I rent it for sleeping our sleep party and all six of us have fun out to cause all of us in a class to act together, and we know a couple of actors in the classroom. In addition to everyone screaming all night tears, I was Freaky Freaky. I kept thinking of my God, if I got to go to the peak toilet I'm going to break into the middle of wiping or something. I could not even go to the bathroom because we watched this horrible horror movie. I also thought why are all the topless girls in this movie but we do not do any of the boys units? You should make a horror movie where the killer is a girl and chopsticks on the units. I would watch this over and over. Call it hard or soft or stupid like that. I only give this movie a 9 because you FREAKED MY FREAKS.
