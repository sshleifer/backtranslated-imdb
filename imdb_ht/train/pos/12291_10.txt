A true classic. Very well-filmed and acting. Reveals an area of ​​Paris that is alive and filled with comedy and tragedy. Although the area 'Hotel du Nord' and the hotel itself still exist, it is not as gay (in the original sense of the word) and happy as it once was due. The film makes one eager for the past, lost, with a sigh and bittersweetness.
