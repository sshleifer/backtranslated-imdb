A brilliant Russian emigrate system consists of Stanislavsky 's winning bridges - making it with his lovely wife GRAND Slam Sweethearts of America. <br /> <br /> What could just be another funny soap opera that is high by fine production & excellent acting in the status of a very enjoyable little comedy. A few unexpected touches are thrown to keep the viewer's eye-catching attention - the way in which the principle is presented as a face on a deck of cards; The introduction of an acoustic acrobat in the draw for no other reason than to enjoy a bit of lunacy; and the way in which a wide variety of different types of Americans are shown to be transfixed by listening to the issuance of the game to be concluded. <br /> <br /> Paul Lukas & Loretta Young do very well that Bridge the Sweethearts - Successful & Satisfying and Miss Young passionate love and lovely (though the script keeps him powering on a cigarette too much). They are fun to look, even when their behavior is not always the most credible or compelling. <br /> Frank McHugh gives another good performance as an odd happy tender writer who worships Miss Young. Glenda Farrell's delightful custom-tailor-made customizable custom in a role as McHugh's dancer. Roscoe Karns manages the quick-spoken dialogue as a radio announcement. Slimming Ferdinand Gottschalk is wonderful as a snobbish bridge expert. <br /> <br /> The MOV movie will recognize Dewey Robinson as a partner nightclub partner; Emma Dunn as a sob reporter; Paul Porcasi as the owner of the Russian Nightclub; Charles Lane as a Russian man; and Jimmy Conlin as a kibitzer in the game the final bridge - all unquestionably. The film took advantage of the whim for bridge deals swept across the country since its development in the 1920s. It expects the viewer to have a basic knowledge of the intricacies of the game and it does not try to explain anything uninformed.
