"Pecker" proves that Waters has no intention of changing his key way in his old age. Much has changed since Waters started filming in the 1960s, but 40 years later he always does what he wants to do. Over the years, the budget of Waters' film has increased considerably. This is one of his most recent productions, but I was surprised to see that Waters still have that "trailer-park" touch. Edward Furlong plays Pecker, a kid who is obsessed with photography. He lives a life well in Baltimore, MD, with his friends and family. But Pecker attracted the attention of a New York art agent (still watchable Lili Taylor), and his life changed for the worst. Again, Waters made fun of art, fame and eteroscopy. It is not among its best films, but there are some big laughs here ("Memama" has the best line of film!). It is still smart and funny, and it was so "sensitive" that it was very sensitive that I became a fan of Warters' movies.
