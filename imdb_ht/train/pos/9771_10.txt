Compelling and innovative! At the beginning of this criminal who underrated Whoopi Goldberg shouted writers filmed a parallel between Theodore Rex and the 1941 Orson Welles classic "Citizen Kane". Writers are justified in drawing as a seemingly disparate parallel, but the public looks too often hoodwinked in seeing overly hyped Hollywood Schlock appreciating the subtle similarities between these two movies. The "Citizen Kane" Charles Foster Kane frightened and admired by his colleagues and beliefs, much like Whoopi Goldberg in this film. This movie is about finding love in everybody's differences. It is an epic exam of the fear of abandonment and the need for love and acceptance of a society dominated by greed and self-absorption. Anyone who is afraid that Whoopi Goldberg and Theodore Rex have formed a dyad for their age, and only the justifications comparisons of being Bogey and Bacall, Hepburn and Tracy and Hall and Oates. If you would like to look at an uprising, selulous philosophical examination of some of humanity's deepest drives; Bergman-esqe but not as depressing, Theodore Rex should see immediately!
