This movie is a true masterpiece, it really is. It's rare you come across as a movie flick with joy, full of fun, laughter, anguish, and a little drama keep you on your toes. <br /> <br /> A true family movie, Homeward Bound tells the story of three brave pets, who set out to cross the Rocky Mountains in an attempt to find their masters, following the changes to go through and the obstacles encountered on the road la. One of the truly stunning things about this film is its ability to provide human personality creatures - the acting voice is that good. Shadow is a wonderful, old, wise, and brave character, and watching him trying to escape Sassy in the river was a very powerful move. Luckily - who would not like a dog like lucky? It has to be the most mischievous and pompous puppet ever shown on the big screen. And Sassy is a very hopeful thing for a cat - he has me at his point when he was mocking the keeper; 'I Kitty Kitty Kitty ... not about your life, chubby.' I was really afraid of it), shadows fell into the ditch (almost in tears) and then finished fantastic, when every three pet returned home ... including good old shade! <br /> A favorite forever - anyone who does not like this movie must just not like animals. Rent it or buy it right now, and it will leave you with happy memories that will last a lifetime.
