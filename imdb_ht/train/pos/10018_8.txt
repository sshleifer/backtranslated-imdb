This night reader is better than people generally say. It has weakness, and it seems to have a genre identity genre, no doubt, but I think its creepy atmosphere and intriguing performances make up for this. The whole thing feels like one of these fireside "this happens to a friend of my friends" ghost story. A great complaint about the film is the rhythm: but the slow and sometimes awkward rhythm is deliberate. All that unfolds in this film holds well in the realm of realization, and real life just sort of dump together? So there is no brilliant end or earth-shattering revelations, there is no "confrontation" scene. Thanks to the sky. You have to get in the area when watching this movie, forgetting your reservation and your expectations of what makes a movie (movie) good movie. Williams is not terrific, but it's easy to meet the needs of the story, his more characteristic is somewhat generic ("No one") as it is the Everyman, the avatar that we ourselves enter into the story. The Toni Collette should be nominated for an Oscar (though it might not have it). Give it a shot. For quality and content alone, the cost of night is surely in the top twenty percent of movies coming out these days.
