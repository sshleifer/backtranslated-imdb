The title of this movie does not make a lot of sense, until you see it in operation, because it's the sound that someone delayed to do while working his imaginary trolley, which is what he does all day . And he's just one of many odd characters in this surreal and lively, tragic story of a group of people slum in Japan. <br /> There are two drunks that trade wife, have a man and aspirations. Make an architect, and her young man whom she sends out to ask for food. There's an old wise man who seems to be the pillar of sanity of all that goes on around him, and there is a businessman and some serious nervous ticks that have a wife who treated him (and all other people) like dirt. <br /> <There is no particular draw in this, really, it's a bunch of stories that drift back & forth between each other, sometimes funny, sometimes tragic. All in all I thought it worked very well, and I was dying to see this for a long time just based on its description. I was not in the least disappointed, and I would definitely recommend this. 9 out of 10.
