Daddy Daniell Steel, what a refreshing story. This film praises the importance of the family and the importance of parents in their children's lives. How rare is that? In those moments of "Heather has two Mommies" (or ever, you fill in the blank spaces) it is easy to see why this term is not for everyone. With the role of Dad being important I hoped this would be another Daniell Steel legend. How disappointing it has to end. Each character was important and did a fabulous job to carry their roles. I would like to see each character developing over the years. I liked this movie, it is one I will defiantly watch every time it's over. Good story, good act, and I hope this is not a spoiler, but there are no sex or malicious language. Yes it touches my heart. Alert, get Kleenex ready. What I find sad is that this side of family life rarely shows today in our entertainment, be it TV or. The movie. Daniell if you listen, you go girl, give us more.
