Some of the act was a bit suspicious. I note that Alexander Walker (Evening Critical International, yeah OK, is now dead) launched a warranty on this film saying it was a shameful Protestant NI portrayal as a murderer. Now with the respect of all NI protests, this film was wounded based on the Shankill Butchers (who was loyalists) and who fortified Belfast in the 1970s. Believe me, they have not called butchers for nothing. My main monument on this film is to show that there is no ray of light or hope, it's all bankruptcy & gloom, I mean made the girl in the end there to die. Perhaps this sounds corny, but it could have been taken to the contrary that not all Prods & Tiids are bad or totally good either.
