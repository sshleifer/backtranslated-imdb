CONTAINS SPOILER With the exception of John Wayne, no other actor sits above the James West wallpaper, and this movie proves it. This superb story of revenge is centered around a Winchester rifle, there is one weak spot I can think of: the cast of Will Geer as a very unparalleled like Wyatt Earp. The casting of the villains was good: Stephen McNally, as Cary Henry Henry, Dan Duryea as Waco Johnny Dean, and John McIntire (versatile to play both good guys and bad guys) as a slick gun runner. The confrontation between Stewart and McNally on the cliffs is great! I would have this Western fireplace against crops in all Westerns made today. They would not stand a chance!
