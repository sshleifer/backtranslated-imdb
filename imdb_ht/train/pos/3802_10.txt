Dragon Hunters had to be the best-looking movie I've ever seen. It was jaw-dropping. The movie is about a couple of couples in search of some cash, strange dogs are blue fur pee fire, and a girl who dreams about becoming a knight, and sends on a quest to go to the ends of the earth to kill world gobbler, an impossibly immense dragon. But honestly, it does not even matter what the movie is about. Because it is jaw-droppingly gorgeous. The gravity of this fantasy world is different, so the architectural block and sphere of land floats around among cathedral and castles and towns alike, and there are jungles in flower Lily pads. The world is so creative, so uniquely beautiful, and a sort of lookup muebles look at it. The world looks like a gorgeous paint series. The monsters are visually stunning as well, as a fire dragon consist of a swarm of evil red sticks. Some of the plot is not too original, as the protagonists want a firm in Mice and Men and never seem to be able to do it in the world; but the gorgeous graphics, some seriously sinister scenes, and emotional-evoked dialogues make this spectacular movie.
