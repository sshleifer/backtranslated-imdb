1933 seemed to be a great year for satires ("duck soup" for example) and this one fits in well though it is on the mania and bridge deal. The tone is such a funny piece from the New Yorker, appropriate, since the movie starts with the page "Goings About About Town" in this magazine. The only odd thing is the casting. Made a few years later William Powell and Myrna Loy would have been perfect. However, after 1934, you would not have adultery busy in a sophisticated, young and beautiful Loretta Young fashion, in some supplying or thin, or a group of prostitutes who listen to a radio bridge contest. Even if you know nothing about bridges, you may still want to check out a rare example of Hollywood satir.
