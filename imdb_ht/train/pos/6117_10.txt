All I can say about the series Necromaniac / Schizophreniac 2 is ... if you are even remotely "PC" or you do not have a serious sense of humor, then you probably get it. As ill and disgusting as this movie is, it's really a comedy and not a movie "movie" at all. If you can appreciate someone who pushes the boundaries of good taste and political equality to the most extreme imaginable limits, to the point where it gets so out of it that it's funny, then you have to see this to believe it. This film is so out of control that a large movie studio could not handle this with a 10-foot stake (with a condom on the end). In my opinion though, better, the most extreme piece of art comes from underground ways. If you do not stick to the same old formula that people are used to seeing, then they reject it. <br /> I saw piles of terrible, boring, z-class, indy cinemas that were just a waste of a good VHS tap or DVD-R tapes. I also saw piles of fragrant bombs coming out of the great studio they called them a complete garbage on millions of dollars. When a movie NO BUDGET such as those from Ron Atkins / John Giancaspro came out and erupted all the other "shocks" films completely out of the water, you really need to take a second look at the entire Indy movie scene. After seeing this, you can really see how many libraries a Indy movie indicator can have when working on their own. <br /> <br /> The funny thing is, even the others who saw this movie and "hate it" admit the fact that they laugh all the way into it. I do not think it's possible that anybody gets bored looking at one of those two. So if you do not take everything you've seen in the mainstream media too badly, and may laugh at a misanthropic, puppet touch puppet that has finally broken, you've seen it. You can just be able to see it standing alone, classic class that it is. Both Schizophreniac / Schizophreniac 2 are among the favorites in my collection of over 1000 dvds.
