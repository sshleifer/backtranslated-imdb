Amazing good early efforts from Alfred Hitchcock. One of the original playbacks written by Hitchcock himself, this film shows remarkable story structure. He kicks off with a boxing boxing contest that one-round champion "One Round" Jack loses to a challenger at the hearing that's going to be a professional prizefighter. The film then slows down to develop the characters and presents a love triangle between Jack, her girl and the professional boxer. The rest of the film is a dramatic rematch between the two men, this time for the heavyweight crown. Even in this early movie, Hitchcock shows her talent for movie cinema and placement proposals. A Brewery bought for the girl by the boxer continues to pop up all the movie as a symbol of her infidelity. The only great movie doctrine is that the art of filming a boxing match had not yet been perfected in 1927. The final match, as a result, ended up being a bit of antimicrobial. The story, though, is what brings this movie into.
