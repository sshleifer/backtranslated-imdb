It was quite a while since I watched this LOTR. I'm currently hunting for a copy to buy. Bakshi's work is indeed true of the original work. Visuals are ingredients and sometimes haunted. <br /> <br /> inconvenient? Occasionally, the film is confusing or injured. There are one or two times the scenario slows in a crawl. But in general - buy this movie. It's great for kids, adults and collectors.
