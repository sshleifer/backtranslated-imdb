I've always enjoyed Kenneth Branagh's version of the Shakespeare classic, as she always does a very good job, but in this movie, one of the entire movie lifts is no other than "still-great-actor" Laurence Fishburne a. Surely she has made some poor choices in film, though she is a wonderful actor, but in this one we really give Othello's real: the passion, the intensity of jealousy as it grows stronger Well presented to the Fishburne paranoid, we're finally giving a black Othello! <br /> I do not think they could choose a better Othello. Who else could give him that mix of sympathy / antipathy, love / hatred and, to forget, these eyes of fire ... ...? Branagh is good, but not in his peak, Desédoona Iréne Jacob is fairly good but a bit weak, also Laurence Fishburne truly lifts it and makes it a very interesting and enjoyable movie. Look at it.
