Hidden Frontier talked about and reported by several agency agencies for their long commitment to creating the best Star Trek stories and giving an example of the Gene Roddenberry's camaraderie. Focusing on homosexuality, depression, war, and acceptance of different races is on par or over those in the series of trekking and cinema. The production value started as smaller and shuttered, but over 7 seasonal production acted to improve, the more complex stories, and the visual graphics have gotten smoother and more impressive. In Season 6 Episode 1, countermeasures, has one of the biggest space battles in trekking history. Boats make well and battle the impressive and exciting spaces. Plot the real Frontier is not the boats or their origins, but it is the person with the interaction and the character growth. There are also nods in other trek series and movies with places and characters we all know. I recommend that any fan of the trek check out countermeasures and you will be hooked!
