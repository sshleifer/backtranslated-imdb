Far away my favorite second favorite Spielberg made, after Animaniacs. Though the ratings were low, so I still enjoyed it and loved it, being so funny and I worshiped the cast, wow Jess Harnell and Tress Macneille were in there and were just fantastic, thrown at all brilliant , especially the legendary Frank Welker. <br /> I would like to see this cartoon again, being so scary and jokes were brilliant. Also I can remember the hilarious moment where brain comes to it, you hear his voice and played the theme of instrumental PATB, which was just fantastic, i love it in these cartoons when cameos pop in. I wish this drawing and Animaniacs returned, I loved them
