Many of the comments and comments I read about this movie say this is a rather stunning movie and performance by Clara Bow. Although the story-line was rather typical of Clara's silence later, I still find it a bit heart-stirring and incredibly fun. Clara plays a happy Hawaiian-go-lucky girl who will stop at nothing to win the man he loves ... never mind that this man is married! Clara's lack of modesty was shocking in the day, but I believe he is convincing the sweetness and overall pleasure of the movie. Though definitely not a brilliant story-line (quite typical, actually), this movie is a beautiful showcase of Clara's ability to make the audience laugh.
