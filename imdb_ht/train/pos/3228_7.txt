David Webb Peoples meets Paul Anderson ... if it sounds strange for you, then you're good, because it is. <br /> <br /> Peoples is known for its scripts and moral implications of what is good and evil, the value of life, etc. ... It covers the problems of Bladerunner, Unforgiven, and very beautiful In all scenplays it has something along the lines. Paul Anderson's first successful film was a violent thriller. No wonder so there are all his other movies! And here is a violent thriller with moral implications! Peoples' script is well noticeable in the first half of the movie. Trained soldiers from birth, teach to kill, and never had a normal life. They are replaced by better, genetically engineered soldiers and Todd, one of the original soldiers, who live on a planet and left to die. There he must deal with a refugee group, some who want him to stay other people hate him, and have an interesting drama here. But after ... <br /> <br /> ... The bullets begin to fly as the new soldiers move on the planet for a military exercise and try to kill everyone. Large, violent, strong action forces and Peoples script 'turn into an action-festive Anderson. It's hard to believe that the script was originally written in this way, but the finished product is better then I hope. Fun, a bit, though admittedly not very, thought-provoking, and exciting once the action begins. 7/10 <br /> <br /> Rated R: a lot of violence
