This is one of my favorite comedy ever. Do not want to condemn the uninspiring form of her heroes, but take for what it's worth and not as trivializing alcoholism, the movie is simply a lot of fun. It tells the story of an easy ever-present drink, irresponsible 40 something Bachelor named Arthur who is inherited a vast wealth, but only if he married Susan, choose because the family thinks he might do something in it. Arthur proposed, but then unwisely dropped for Linda, a waitress and little thief. Dudley Moore is perfect as Arthur, the most entertaining drinker in the world, whose antique is a laugh a minute. Admittedly, Moore IS Arthur and I agree with those who can imagine no other actor in the role. The ladies in the piece are also well described. Liza Minnelli sparkles like Linda, and she's screenplay with Moore is great. Jill Clayburgh plays Susan, the richest and most suitable woman for Arthur. However, this film is literally performed by Sir John Gielgud, who presents Arthur's sarcastic but moral butler, Hobson. Obviously, these have had a great deal of Hobson's long-term mutation. Hobson is Arthur's best friend and the next spellman purveyor and advice. The most interesting relationship in this movie is not Arthur's romance at all, but his unusual rapprochage with this witty and of course ever disapproving servants. It is the Butler you will remember much longer after the couple closes credit.
