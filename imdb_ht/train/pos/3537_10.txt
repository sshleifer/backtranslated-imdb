This James Bond game is the best bailout game I played in my life it is my favorite James Bond game so far because: <br /> <br /> The missions in this game are really fun can be really hard to make it more fun to play missions to have plenty of action the weapons you use are really good. The cars in this game are scared the car missions have lots of action and they are really fun to play. The voice on the actors is really good and it is cool that Sean Connery makes the voice for James Bondage also the way path looks like it's really cool because it looks just like Sean Connery when he plays James bail in the movies and the other character look very much like the look of the movie. The graphics are a great good in this game James. Also the game follows the movie pretty much, but not all but most of the time it does cool. <br /> <br /> overall score ********** from ***** *****
