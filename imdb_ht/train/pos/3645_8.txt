A fine story about tracking your dreams and actually taking a stomach to do something about them when the lucky hit. Nothing was easy for Morris either-he had a family, job, ops elsewhere, a mortgage, etc.-it was not like he could just drop what he did with blithely hop on the greyhound to play ball AAA for 4 months. He took courage. I'm glad to have shown her really, almost up 'til he got the callup in the students. <br /> I can remember seeing her pitch against the Red Sox (I think ...), it was a great story. Though Morris actually looks more like John Kruk or a Watson Mills than Quaid-okay. Quaid does a very good job of playing the man, teacher, coach and 'oldest rookie' .... As someone in the same age group, I certainly can ID and his behavior. You're not quite too old to do that you've dreamed of as a kid, but she's getting there. You must do it sooner than drying. Believably said, nicely modified, rhythmic, acting, good to see apparently familiar to the end of Royce Applegate, Brian Cox and Rachel Griffiths here. <br /> Good work all around, happy to see it hit. <br /> <br /> *** outta **** ... who would think that the Tampa Devil's rays were the subject of a good movie early on?
