This is one of those movies that have made too many promotions for. If you look at T.V., then you might as well do not watch the movie. Almost all the funny scenes are spoiled in the forecasts, except one that just happens to Jennifer Annist being the silly one. It is typical Jim Carrey humor and it is really funny. Just do not go see this movie waiting to be amazed. All in all, if you like Jim Carrey or this comedy is a must-see, otherwise just watch the forecasts and you'll just be as satisfied.
