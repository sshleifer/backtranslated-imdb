I thought this was one of the best movies I've seen in a very long time. It was a great storyline and showed that people are so complicated in all sorts of different ways. Recommended it to all my friends !! I still enjoy a good story line and this movie has one of the best I've seen in a long time. I could see myself have a daughter and do the same things that Natalie did get more about her life and love. It shows how we have not only life and family; However, there are parts of our lives that we do not share with them - as it may not be in the best interest to know all the details of what we do not do, we are proud of. /> I look forward to another movie, and they will keep my eyes off.
