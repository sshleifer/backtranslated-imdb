"Diamond Diamond made a point in the first episode that other people in the world did not have domestic animals, but Europeans did, and that's why we were able to make steel and invented complex cars." --- Obviously, the person who wrote this comment does not understand this reason behind this documentary or the original book. Please do not break this great piece by your own specialty. The reasons are more complex than the sole thing you mentioned. Please read the book as it is a great source of information. I loved it very much. This book is even taught as a textbook at some universities.
