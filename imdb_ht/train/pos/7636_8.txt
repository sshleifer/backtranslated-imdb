It was a few years since I saw this, but remember it and would like to see it again. Its kind has become a "therapy" for me and a personal experience in my own. <br /> A thirty-five year old man lamenting a high baseball game in which he "missed the ball" and his lost team. He thinks about it 20 years later, "if only I'd hit that ball" and how his life would be better because of it. Then, it gets a chance to find out .... and get a little more that he has to bargain for. <br /> It reminds me so much when I was in high school, I twice tried out for exercise / dance team and did not do it. This team was the closest thing to a sorority in my school. If you were on it, you were "all that." I did not try out until my last two years in HS and after a second I took it really hard. I would hit and mingle my legs seriously just before tryouts and wear bars to cover the crush, and caused me to do it. That was in 1987. <br /> In those years, even now, sometimes I think "If only I did not hit my leg I would never have worn those stupid bars." Now I do not sit and think that my life would be any better or even any different I did it, but seeing this movie made me realize that we never really know how different things can not change a little way back in the past. Who knows, he can change the course of events to point out that I would not have met my son's dad. <br /> I would recommend this movie to anyone who has only one moment in the past wanting to change. Be careful what you want to press
