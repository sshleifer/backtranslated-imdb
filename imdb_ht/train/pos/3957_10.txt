The three stooges were still some of the many actors I loved. I love just about every one of the shorts that they did. I love all six of the Stooges (Curly, Shemp, Moe, Larry, Joe, and Curly Joe)! All the shorts are hilarious and also many other great actors and actress stars that a lot have in many of the shorts! In my opinion Three Stooges are some of the greatest actors ever and is ever funny comedy team! <br /> <br /> One of my favorite Stoog shorts and Shemp is none other than Mary beware! All of this short is Christine McIntyre, Dee Green, Doris Houck, Alyn Lockwood, Johnny Kascier, Nancy Saunders, Lu Leonard, Maxine Gates, and Emil Sitka. Green and McIntyre give great performance here! There are many funny parts here. This is a very hilarious short. There is another similar three short stooges like this one called Bridless groom and I recommend both!
