Who would have thought Andy Griffith's "Helen Crump" (Aneta Corsaut) had a Steve McQueen movie in his past? But that's just one of many strange and wonderful things about the movie-1950s-fighting-creative film, which would be best described as rebels without a cause to meet God's knowledge of outer space. The rebel is Steven McQueen (who would soon decide that "Steve" sounded less prissy), a good boy and just enough stick to be interesting; The very romantic yet complementary girlfriend is the aforementioned Aneta Corsaut. It was bad enough when the dates were interrupted by hot-rodders, but they were considerably more nonplussed when they encountered a gelatinous man-food What He's rides down to Earth on its own Hotrod meteor - and starts gobbling up townfolk right and left. But will the UPS grow up to believe them? Of course not, what they know, they're just kids! The movie is teeny bopper in its teeny bopping better. The actors take the script rather than very seriously, and many look at feelings of every other eye, and "adult" support at cast probably says "Kids!" very third sentence or so. But the real hobby of the movie of its creatures, which is quite imaginative, well executed, and often manages to generate a surprising degree of suspicion. And although clearly on the cheap side (check out these miniature devices, guys!), The BLOB is actually a fairly well-designed movie - and there's that catchy little sung to throw in for good measurements. The 40-plus crowd (myself included) will enjoy the movie as nostalgia, but this will not prevent them from capturing right along with the youngest all-letter-and-white-pen 1950s sensitivity, and the movie should be a great choice for either family-movie night or a more sophisticated "ups only" get together.
