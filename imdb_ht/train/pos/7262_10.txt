My daughter, her friends and I have watched this film literally dozens of times. I bought it twice and some little girlfriends absorbed with it. Immediately, I rent it many times. It just never gets old! Blockbirds do not even have to read them again and I tried to buy, get, rent it for more than 5 years. Without a doubt, this was and is my favorite movie in my childhood ... it has it all! We laughed, we were crying, we discussed real life and how difficult some children have it in the world. There was nothing to pretend about this movie. We are dealing with every second bill with each line! Thanks a million to repair our faith in human nature. Sincerely, Shelleen and Kailin Vandermey. Craven, Saskatchewan. CANADA, eh !!! :-) <br /> <br /> Out '07 update: <br /> <br /> Who we judge if a rich woman falls into love with a poor person; or someone who has love chooses to raise a child who does not own it. It's not for me or your life. It's not just credible, it happens every day. Thank you God! Keeping my trust in human living nature !!! celebrate !!!!
