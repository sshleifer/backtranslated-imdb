"Catfish", 4th of these designs is a good thing. At least I love it, so I'm surprised that this is getting mixed reviews. <br /> <br /> This one is more of a grim story than a funny one, although it has moments in comedy. The atmosphere is dark and spooky. Suspension is another solid element here. As for humor, it's mostly black humor. <br /> In this short, Tom listens to a candle radio guide at night and is absolutely frightening because it's about ghosts, something he believes. While Tom is afraid of death, Jerry is watching everything and can not help but laugh the whole time. In fact, Jerry quickly finds a way to torture him more and more. With the help of a white shirt and a vacuum cleaner he creates a huge "ghost". <br /> <br /> Tom is experiencing the horrible experience of his whole life. Although Jerry scared Tom without a good reason, the way the story is finished is to be funny. Plus, once again, there is no violence here because this is one of Tom & Jerry's oldest designs. However, I do not find that jokes in 9 lives 9 almost aspired to the vaccine. <br /> <br /> When Tom finally found that it was all a Jerry's plot and that Jerry made a fool out of him Jerry is «caught with hand in jar cookies» (she deserves to discover). But Tom shows an incredible patience before reacting. It's hard to see Jerry in about a minute. The funny thing is that Jerry invited Tom to laugh with him and took about half a minute to realize that Tom is looking at him with a very serious face. Jerry tries to be funny, but Tom does not laugh. <br /> <br /> Overall, this is a different, peculiar and remarkable Tom & Jerry experience.
