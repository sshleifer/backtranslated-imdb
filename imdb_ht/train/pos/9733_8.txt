'How to lose friends and alienate aliens' is a fun, if loose, adaptation of Toby Young's in the same name. It's also a great title for helping to meet the line requirements in IMDb review! The basic thing is the same as the book and certain dramatic incident, but a romantic plot is added and the finish is certainly Hollywoodised. Simon Pegg, despite playing an essentially irresponsible person, is usually familiar with comic and pretty much wearing the movie. Strangely to think only a few years ago she was just a sitcom guy sitcom and now she was rubbing shoulders with Hollywood names. There's a good cast and it's a fun, easy look - a guy's 'ugly Betty', but funnier.
