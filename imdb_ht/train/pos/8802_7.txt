This is a very interesting project that could be quite brilliant. Pick up 11 important international directors and allocations each of them 11 minutes, 9 seconds and 1 frames to create a segment of their choices; Each brief explore the global reverberations of 9/11. Without using any crowd, I would say that Ken Loach's piece is the jewel of the crown, and Mira Nair's short (segment "India"), based on a true story, worthy to be made of a full movie feature. One also achieved, while watching her short, why Alejandro González Iñárritu is one of the best directors in the world today ?? It simply is a master of the medium, which also has a profound understanding of the subject. Unfortunately, not all 11 parties did. Youssef Chahine, in his segment "Egypt," assumed the Arab position of self-collective guilt, which piece could potentially be the most interesting one. It fails miserably. The short chahine is poorly written and seriously executed, at least enough to stand out amongst other, superior chapters of the movie. Despite the imbalance in quality, I would still give the 7/10 movie for concept, if not for execution.
