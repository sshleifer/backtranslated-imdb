I just looked at I. Q. again tonight and forgot how I loved this movie. It's nice fun and leaves you feel that all is right with the world. I love the Mozart Allusions all over the opening and "Einstein" plays "Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star" on the violin to him Kolib A Small Night Music during the IQ test at Ed Walters. I like that a woman is described as smart and encouraged to have a career, a unique special status for the 1950s, the time in which this film is set. (I also was a teacher, but stayed at home raising my children, so please do not think I'm some free woman free.) It's wonderful how a man who is "only a fat monkey" finally see to be as important and worthy as Catherine's fianc√©, a clinical behavioral researcher. The message to me is that we are not what we do, but which we are defined in many more - no labels. There are many small gums and one-material that almost relieves if you do not look and listen carefully. <br /> I kept a few things in the movie that are not listed on the goofs page. At the stage when Ed Walters is speaking in symposium, there are 3 instruments (protractors, menstruation, etc.) hanging on the right side of the chalk ledge. In the next camera shot, there are only 2. In the credits on our video, it gives Tony Shaloub's character as Bob Watters, by Bob Rosetti as he introduces himself to the movie and is listed here on Imdb . <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br/> I highly recommend this movie. It can be a piece of fluff in some estimates, but there are many more substances than many give it credit for. Not only that, what a great cast is assembled here. Watch it and enjoy!
