Got one of the best political satire I've seen on date, with an excellent performance for Cusak, Tomei, and all the actors to support. <br /> <br /> Excellent plot, very well placed and an unexpectedly very good twist to the end. The scene of action was well filmed & choreography. Very funny. <br /> At all I give this movie a big thumb. It is highly critical of US military intervention in the mid-east, and as such, it may receive bad reviews from people who do not share the same political policy, or those who are simply too politically ignorant to appreciate the black and DRK. Indeed, in places, the comedy was so close to the truth that it was borderline between comic and tragic.
