I liked this movie! It was all I could do to break through tears while watching it, but it is really very uplifting. I was hit by the performance of Ray Liotta, but especially the talent of Tom Hulce's twin brother's portrait that is mentally slow due to a tragic and terrible childhood event. But Tom's character, though heartbreaking, knows no self-pity and is so full of hope and life. This is a great movie, do not miss it !!
