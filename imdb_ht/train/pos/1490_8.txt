Everyone has a love first, and even if it is difficult to define that feeling when you are younger, it's painful inside you. This is Malaysian filmmaker Yasmin Ahmad aimed to prove his fourth feature, a most complex movie of emotions is narrated in a simple, straightforward fashion. This is an approach that is especially practical in this case, as the love story of the movie core involves two children aged twelve, and would therefore make any attempt at "deeper" analysis seems convincing and firefighting. That they are not also testament to the surprising performances given by leading actors, Sharifah Aryana and Mohd Syafie Naswip. The former plays Orked (already seen as an adult character in Ahmad's picture, Gubra), a lively, almost rebel girl, possibly influenced by his "British" breakthrough (his mother studying in England), contemptuously playing with dolls, prefers to play violent sports with the boys. Then one day she met Mukhsin (Naswip), who came to spend the holidays at her aunt's house, and suddenly she changed her habits: goodbye fistfights, hello bike-riding and trees will climb. But what does that mean? Are they just friends, or is something more implicit, something neither of them is yet ready to understand, let alone accept? <br /> <br /> Give the young age to their protagonists, answer the borders, and so, as in several "smaller" films a choice that leaves a butterfly, but ultimately meets depression: the natural, unfiltered act (especially the Aryana) gets to the heart almost immediately, with a strong casting support (Orked's family most of all) to help keep the minimalistic narrative pleasure and seduction. The bottom-of-the-earth approach is not always effective (the hilarious subplot of an adulterous neighbor falls too early too), and it is difficult to justify representing the Pulp FIC invoice at the beginning of the feature but the emotional force The young romance is enough to make this an interesting piece of Asian independent movies.
