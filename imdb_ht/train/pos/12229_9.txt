For me there is something so appealing and nostalgic about low-budget Sci-Fi. As a kid in the 50s that all had. In 1957 I saw "The First Man in Space" in a movie theater with my dad. It was Marshall Thompson starting with some other poor slob who got the title role. It is also about a space mission to go bad where the astronaut becomes a grizzly killer. Pure the Good & Plenty right from me. The memory of these heebie-jeebies still lives in me. Melting incredible people are almost a re-made only in full color ... this is where the scenes are well lit. Just have to love it for what it is ...... a little over an hour of dark sound, lousy, and strange music. Bravo!
