Engineering William Cameron Menzies and Herbert George Wells craft this extraordinary film, with ambition and difficult dimensions to get today. They predict the Second World War and the way Britain has attacked, and also the fact that the war should be followed by a space race. They change the time; in the film of the war and the exploration of their space much longer, but there are plenty of things to be the qualitatively correct that it's amazing. We even see a helicopter (the movie is bigger than them). <br /> <br /> Unforgettable giant aircraft with a futuristic meritocracy of similar scientists Roman and bubble-helmet: if you can see in these funny costumes you can appreciate the state of art architecture by master from The 30s, the Well Vision of a rationalist society, interesting reflections on the nature of power, and John Cabal as the archetype of adventures and inventing the human, one of which chooses reality forms and should not be formed by it. <br /> <br /> 9 1/2 out of 10. Inspiring as that final monologue by John Cabal.
