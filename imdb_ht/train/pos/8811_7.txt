Eleven different markers from different parts of the world are assembled in this film to present their views and ideas about the WTC attack. This is one of the best efforts you'll see in any movie. Movies like this are rarely made and appreciated. This film tries to handle all possible nuclei in WTC. Here are some of the most important stories in the movie that make this movie unique. <br /> There are stories from Samira Makhmalbaf (Iran) where somewhere in Iran people are preparing for the attacks from America. There is a teacher trying to educate his students by informing them about Innocent People who were killed in WTC massacre. Then comes a story from Youssef Chahine (Egypt) where a movie maker comes across conversations face to face with a Dead Soldier in the WTC attack and a Hardcore Hardcore Terrorist who was involved in WTC attacks. Then we see a story from Idrisissa Ouedraogo (Burkina Faso) where a group of Five Innocent kids saw Osama bin Laden and plans to kidnap him and win the reward money from America. Then we see the story from Alejandro Gozalez Inarritu (Mexico) where you see a black screen and slowly you see the real foothold in WTC building down. And those who stuck in the building jump out of it to save their lives. The other most important story is from Mira Nair (India) where a mother is struggling to be respected for her dead son whose name falsely trapped in WTC massacre! After September 11 attacks, our heart beat automatically starts pumping if we hear from anywhere in the world .. First is the World Trade Center and the second is Osama! This movie has totally changed our perception and made a strong point of claiming something more in it. <br /> I will definitely recommend this movie to everyone who likes to have these types of Home DVD Collection. Definitely worth every penny you spend. But please do not expect anything more than the movie in this DVD. There are film courses in the movie makers, but there are no extra features.
