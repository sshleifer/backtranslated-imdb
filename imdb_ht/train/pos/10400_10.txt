Probably the finest fantasy movie ever made. Probable color, spectacular, incredible, spot-on Miklos Rosza notes music that is perfect for every stage and mood. Acting is superb as well in what could be stiffer and firefighter but less, but here the poetic dialogue is deftly speaking, sensitivity (humor is subtle and delightful as well). <br /> Doubtless Spielberg and Lucas have been enthralled by this one. Along with the "Four Feathers" (1939), one of the two finest pictures was published by Alexander Korda and London-film with one of the finest footage ever made. <br /> A true, compelling classical!
