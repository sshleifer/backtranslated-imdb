Errol works for the Public Safety Department and his job is to verify sexual offenses. Sometimes it pushes the line to work and beats off sexual offenders. I do not blame him, but his boss is ready to retire so together come Allison. Errol is now training her to do her work and it's like shadow work. Allison is a bit naughty about the work from the beginning but does not realize how much it really is and it's all the Erow's fault. She starts going away with her mania to find a missing girl when her work is not to be a police officer. It's a fairly decent movie about a crazy guy who pushes the boundaries and works out her "Dimension of practice." Errol has done a great job, but in the safety of Allison security. It had some good mysteries in it too and just when I did it calculated, there was more to it.
