Love Joan. Great performance. What's not good in. I watched this movie and then Jane Eyre right after ... it just keep getting better. My heart was racing. Great old movie drama. Just what I want from a classic movie. Facial expressions are worth the entire movie. I'm glad I have it on video. Do not know what more you need in a movie. Beautiful woman .... wealth ..... greed ..... assassination .... detective ...... a suit ..... <br /> <br /> costumes are very nice. Tell me what the budget was for this movie? Want to still make movies like this. Each time they try to just seem to make a cheesy movie. The black and white film still holds a certain mystery.
