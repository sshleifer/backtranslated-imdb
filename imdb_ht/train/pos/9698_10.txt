I've seen this movie many times and for my life, I can not understand why some people compare this BABE. This film is not about the secret life of every beast that can secretly speak. Instead, she is on a parrot who learns to speak in helping her owner, a girl with a serious stammer, to overcome her speech integration only to be separated from her in a hearty wrenching scene early. Then the big tour starts. Paulie Parrot sets out to try and find her one friend, Marie. <br /> <br /> Along the way, she meets many wonderful and very embarrassing people. She fell in love with a girl parrot and she lost it. She gets into a life of crime and then captured by a bad scientist who wants to exploit her. <br /> She told her story of a sympathetic janitor in the lab who agreed to help her escape and find her dear Marie. <br /> <br /> Tony Shaloub shines as the Sweet Janitor with an open mind and great heart and is determined to help little Paulie despite the risks. Jay Mohr plays the parrot's voice and one of the characters that surprised it comes across. <br /> There is a little suggestive language but this movie is suitable for most kids and even more so if parents are joining on the fun and also look. It's a witty, intelligent, animal-adventure season and finally a beloved story about a bird and his girl. She searches for Marie ending an unexpected surprise for most donors; t know much about butterflies. <br /> <br /> Children who saw the green wood rods in Los Angeles and Pasadena are especially benefited from seeing this film and understanding that birds, especially butterflies are not livable. All children everywhere, they will see that the animals form deep attachments and that love and loyalty to a dog or parrot is a gift to be scruffy. So, no BABE here, more of an incredible journey with a twist. <br /> Enjoy and try not to tear up during the sad parties.
