It's not perfect with some point plots and images at once obvious and optimally, but it has the desired effect and impact and tells a visionary story and evidence. <br /> <br /> This first part sets the scenes - human society has developed advanced robots and abilities, especially humanoid, to serve people who make menus, unskilled jobs, jobs, construction etc. and so the population has become lazy and humiliating towards them. A robot, however, rebels and kills his owner, stating in his subsequent suit that he simply did not want to die. It is destroyed, but when mass destruction robots are ordered to protect humanity many robots stand up in protest, and many human sympathizers along with them. <br /> <br /> The imagery here is exploitation, riot and riot riots, the Tiananmen square, the holocaust and a very provocative scene of a robot in the guise of a human girl is getting harried, the top layer and Then shot dead as he pleaded 'I Really'. it puts on the ground, clothes and torn pots and breasts hanging out.
