Robert De Niro, Cuba Gooding Jr, Hal Holbrook, and the rest of the actors and actresses of "Honor Men" combine to make a fine film. Mark Isham wrote the filmscore, so you know the music is really fine, too. <br /> But: After noticing a kill of goofs, loopholes, and over-dramatic heart-string futures from the start, I made a promise to ignore them and sit back to enjoy the movie. If you can do that, it is good _really_is_ good. <br /> The story of Carl Brashear, a true-to-life hero, is inspirational enough to last a lifetime. Watching it up on the internet ... The whole story is more amazing than the movie, as the Director admitted in his comment. There were only three African-American marine US divisions in the Second World War. However, none came to the status of US Navy Master Diver. Carl Brashear was the first African American diver. AND it was the first animated diver ever certified or recertified as a US marine diver. (Facing applause). On the negative side of the movie Ledger: Should I tell you of only one of the "many loopholes"? Yeah, I'll mark this comment as having "spoiler" and doing so ... The first pivotal scene where the helicopter hits the radio and sink of the sea: they would never have time to stock up a full Mark V diver, though he was legendary master Chief of Billy Sunday, in time to be only "... a couple of minutes late" saving the pilot. <br /> So, for loopholes, goofs, and sub-dramatization, I derive "Honor Men" from a perfect 10 down to a 7. <br /> <br /> Can Hollywood ever realize that the truth Countless is so much better than its on-dramatic story-telling approach? I doubt it. Too bad!
