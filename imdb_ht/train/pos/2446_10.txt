Since the beginning of the Carmen show was there. He was one of the best characters. Why got rid of it? The show is not the same as before. It's getting worse. The best episodes were with Carmen in them. You can not replace someone from the beginning! This is like South Park without Kyle or playing the Chucky Blood! It's not good! The nervous that replaces him is just, ugh! Mad. It does not fit into the scenario at all. It was one of the main characters, and the niece could not replace it. He was an awesome actress. Way is better than the nasal. Get it back, or you will lose a TONE viewer.
