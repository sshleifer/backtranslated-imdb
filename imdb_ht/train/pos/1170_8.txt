The night of homeless living is a comic parody of the 1978 movie (with rumors of 2004) of "Dawn of the Dead" .Only this time ... and the homeless. The episode contains people Homeless people come to South Park and people can not know why. They treat homeless people like zombies who want to change with a few of their parents finishing on the roof of a supermarket like in the movie.So now read it up to the boys to find out where they come from and how to get rid of them. This is a fairly funny episode and some good moments like the boys singing their own version of 2pac / drdre songs "California Love in ".Overall a good episode. <br /> <br /> 8/10
