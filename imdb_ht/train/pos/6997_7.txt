One thing is to make sure ... you should not watch this movie if you have a bad day. The story is based on a sad event and follows a character who has lived with a sin that he can not handle. The story is dripping your foods rather than the usual dumbed explanation so it keeps you wondering what's going on. Eventually the points along with their performance make sense. All the characters were OK and Wil Smith did another good day at the office. <br /> There is no doubt a lot of moral questions to be asked but if you just accept and buy into her agony then it's easier to accept what she's choosing to do. If you agree or disagree is irrelevant. The trip it takes you on is interesting enough, if not overwhelming. <br /> A good movie enough that unfortunately left you a little sad at the end. I would recommend this movie if you like the sort of places you have to think and not just look at explosions and battles.
