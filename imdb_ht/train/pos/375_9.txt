This was one of the most moving movies I've ever seen. I was about 12 years old when I watched her for the first time and every time she was on my TV my eyes stuck in her. Act and draw them amazingly. It looks like it's true and it touches on many controversial subjects. I recommend this movie to anyone interested in a good drama.
