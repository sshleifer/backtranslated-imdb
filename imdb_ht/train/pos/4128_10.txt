With all the violence on TV and local news, it is worthwhile to have a show that does not have any violence or adult language but is always fun. My children are waiting to be with us each week. Each of us has a favorite chef and favorite judge. We all enjoy Elton Brown. We love to learn about the background of the main ingredient, unique vegetables and condiments. We play together at the guess house that the winner will be. <br /> It's a great hour of entertainment, as well as information. Best of all of our purchases, bussle life, it is a family-time spent together.
