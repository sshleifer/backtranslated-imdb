Halloween is one of the best examples of independent films. It is very well done and has more psychological element in it than you could achieve at first glance. It's a simple movie said very well. The music is perfect and is one of the most haunting notes ... If you have not seen this movie again, you must check it out. Throw is all terrific. I wish they never did end after the end. The first was by far the best and should have ended as it did without having a sequel. It was fun to see Jamie Lee Curtis in the movie. It did not seem to be age (it's just as gorgeous today, without the hairstyle and clothes dress). The scene of the mask is one of the horrible things ever!
