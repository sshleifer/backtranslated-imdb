This film was published year I was born and will be, like me, 70 in 2007. I watched it again last night did not see it from high school. While she was full of 30's feelings and the act was a bit stereotyped, nevertheless, she was superb. Pearl S. Buck's story has come to life in magic chemistry Luise Rainer and Paul Muni. The novel that took the Ms. Buck Nobel Prize for Literature comes alive under Sydney Franklin's baton that along with an excellent script recounts the story of peasants, Wang Lung, whose father finds a bride for him, a slave girl from the kitchen of a local homeowner. In the history of the buck, Wang's success is underpinned by his willingness to listen to his wife, most of the time, and love of the country. In the end he came to realize that his wife, like the land, is the source of his wealth, happiness and immortality. Buck's story always had strong women cast in a critical place to influence the outcome of world pre-feminism events. German born Luise Rainer brings an attempt, but determines the Chinese female life-lover in his paintings in Olan. Muni as well captures the naive but honorable Wang, eventually holding between the two worlds of the rich and the peasant. Other classic characters include Charlie Grapewin, Dorothy Gale Cancer Henry Henley from the Wizard of Oz, Walter Connelly as Mewing, conniving uncle and Keye Luke as Number One Son - but this time by Charlie Chan. A classic can be defined as a movie you can watch time and again and never tire. If this is the case, this movie is a classic, no doubt too.
