I remember being scared of movie films when I was younger, and gradually getting less so until getting jaded enough, as I'm sure many other viewers have become, so that the bunch of gory movie Products in the past years have entertained me but do not scare me or make me bitter. "The dentist" turns around. <br /> <br /> The setup looks simple: a mental dentist unstable reaction to havoc on the mouth, and perhaps body as well. A clever twist, though, is that the dentist is the protagonist film, so instead of having one dimensional bad guy with no clear motivation, his development is the most extensive of any character and it is very human and credible. The viewer so feels empathy for her as well as his victims, and instead of hoping for justice to come to him, I find myself hoping he would somehow find a way to cover up his train and return to a life normal. <br /> What really "makes" a horror movie is the violence. And the "Dentist" makes it much better than any other movie I can think of. The first, the film has tons of tension, which is something that modern gore films tend to miss. In one scene (2), the dentist is emotionally unpleasant and has seen a baby patient for the first time. As it reaches the child's mouth, you hope, for the dentist and child's sake, the meeting ends without injury. I'm not going to spoil what's happening. Secondly, when the gor comes, it hits all the worst, squirm nerves. Again, I will not give anything away. <br /> Of course, being a movie that you've never heard of, it's flawless. Most importantly, it's only for horror fans. Also, as another review mentions, does not take place on a span of just a few days, we do not really get any background on the characters. And the tension drops slightly during the very end. But really, the fact that we would even want to know background about the characters is how good it is, and the bulk of the film is sufficiently solid that any small fall in tension can be forgiven. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />. "The dentist" made me scared and quite comfortable, and for this he touched my full approval.
