What do I say about an absolutely beautiful movie? I saw this in Atlanta, Georgia Dragoncon considered that this is my main city. I'm very much a sci-fi aficionado and enjoy film type action. I spent to be up all night and was about ready to call her a day when I noticed this movie playing in the morning. This is not a sci-fi nor film action of any sort. Let me just start saying that I'm not a fan of Witchblade nor Eric Etebari, having watched a few episodes (her performance in which seemed stingy and robotic). But he managed to really have me over to this performance. I mean really winning me on. Having seen Cellular, I did not think there was so much of the way to act for this guy. But his performance as Kasadya was simply amazing. He was very convinced as the evil devil. But there was a lot of depth detail that this character absolutely surprised me. I later watched her online and found that Eric won the best-well-deserved Actor award considering her the best of her career and my respect. Now I keep reading about this fx and production of this project and let me just say that I did not pay attention to them (sorry Brian). They were very nicely done but I was even more impressed with the story - which I think was even more purposeful (See movie like Godzilla with great effects just really turning to me). I could not sleep after this movie thinks it over and over again in my head. The situation of an abusive family is never an easy one. I showed the trailer on my internet and it almost cried because it affected him so he lived and abused. This is one movie that I think about constantly and would highly recommend.
