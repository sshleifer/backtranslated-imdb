Red Eye starts in Texas where hotel receptionist Lisa Reisert (Rachel McAdams) is about to catch the last 'red eye' flight back to Miami where he lives & works. While waiting for her plane Lisa meets the beautiful Jackson Rippner (Cillian Murphy) & they both seem to hit him there, then when they ride the plane they discover that by a coincidence they sit next to one and others. Once the aircraft is taken to Jacksonville 's airline that it really is & seemingly likely meeting was not a coincidence, Jackson says it works for someone who wants to kill Charles Keefe' s National Security Secretary (Jack Scalia ) & they need to change their room at the hotel where he works in Miami. Jackson tells Lisa to telephone the hotel and make it happen or his father will die ... <br /> <br /> Directed by Wes Craven who is perhaps best known for his horror movie like The House Passes On The Left (1972), A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984), The Serpent and The Rainbow (1989), People Under The Stairs (1991) & Trilogy in Shout of Slasher's Young Short, Pony , rapidly rhythming into small like Eye Red looks a great departure from the movie Craven sort usually done. The script by Carl Ellsworth makes for a horrible comedy thriller that I have to admit I really enjoyed, at only 85 spotting minutes of its length of a very quick moving, economical & straightforward sort of point in the movie that focuses almost entirely on a tight, taught to draw rather than going through various directions and lots of subplots. Some may like this approach as I did while the other can not but I think it draws you to the action a lot more as it comes thick & fast without the movie slowing down any & gives you a chance to relax. I really like the draw for red eyes, make sure a movie like this always goes to have one or two difficult times in terms of drawing but the hell, it's a movie made to entertain & for me, that's what he did. I really love the central character, Lisa comes across as extremely likable while Jackson Rippner (an obvious play on the name of the notorious Victorian Jack Ripper killer series) is a mischievous slimy and a cold 'I only do my job' kind of mentality. Another plus is that I did not think anyone behaved heavily stupid here, everyone actually seemed like human beings & films to play out of a relatively possible mode. I really love this & it is one of the most recent Craven films most recently. <br /> <br /> Craven turns into a solid, tough, tight, teachable & fast paced thriller with an attractive cast, some good action & an interesting draw. It certainly does not hang over & once it starts the action & tension it never lets up, away & away the most effective part of the movie is when Rippner is keeping Lisa hostage in the plane & once the movie changes to Miami & Lisa's home becomes a little more routine but it's still good. A special gentleman goes to Rachel McAdams who is absolutely gorgeous in this, I could probably look red eyes again just because he's in it & looks like stunning dead. Those who see Wes Craven's name attached to the red eyes awaiting a horror movie should think again since there's no horror in it at all (despite the IMDb list 'Horror' as the red eye). I'm not sure about the finish, on the one hand it was nice to see the villain is living for a change that goes against traditional expectations but it might have been more satisfying to see Lisa killing him in some ways. /> DreamWorks apparently gave Red eye an initial budget of $ 44 million but reduced it to $ 25,000,000 although it's still a very well-done movie with brilliant production value. Actually shot in Los Angeles & Florida in California. The film was supposedly written to husband & wife Sean Penn & Robin Wright Penn intended for their drive, but eventually the musicians opted for at least lead. As I have already said Rachel McAdams is the best eye candy & is a total babe in this & worth watching the movie for her own. Oh, & it puts a decent performance too. <br /> <br /> Red Eye is a really fast rhythm to teach tension full of thriller little that I enjoyed incredibly, I did not think I would like it as much as I did that & I'm glad I decided to watch it . This definitely gets a referral from me & Rachel McAdams really is hot stuff in this ...
