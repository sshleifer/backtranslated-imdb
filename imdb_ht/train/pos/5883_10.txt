I look, intrusive and fascinating, do not act vocal and physical. The roles each character plays with excellence. The lyrics, words, every gesture, the east, said it all the movie talked to me. He underlined me of a different perception of a person who believes in mankind. Who believes in peace and gentleness. I was also born of unbelievers, not sacrifices and human dignity described. Powerless, demented and without feelings. To desire power at the price of mankind, so incredible. This movie makes me frightened for people who are not in this world anymore. And with sadness I think of them. I love this movie for conversations and expressions to face it all. Let this movie be blessed.
