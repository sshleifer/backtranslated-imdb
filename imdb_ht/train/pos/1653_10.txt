I agree with everyone who says that this series was the best of the genre 'spy'. My husband and I were captivated by it when it first revealed in the U.S. and watch every episode. I tried at that time to buy the series (I made tape all around it) but it was told by WGBH that it was not available. I even considered Ian Holm to see if he could have a copy! As with others, I bought with it the Deighton series (in part to understand the complicated scheme.) If the original version ever available on DVD, I'll be among the first in line to snap a copy. Portrait of Ian Holm at Bernard Samson vulnerable but courageous was amazing. (It's still amazing.)
