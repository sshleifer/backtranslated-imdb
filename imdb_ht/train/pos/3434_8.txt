If the Australian office ever needs a promotional movie for recruitment then this is it. This is one of those movies that are in the heart of the right place, and you can look again and again. Miranda's performance touches as it shows an aspect of Australia unimagined by many Europeans, in that it can be cold, wet and weak, just like anywhere else and just like any other place that is important to those who surround you. The characters in the movie are warm and welcome and make the prospect of a career move to a 'dead milk office' a thought to be considered. Miranda went on to make movies bigger, but I hope she still holds a thought idea for this one?
