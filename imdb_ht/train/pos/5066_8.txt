I know some people think the movie is boring but I do not agree. It is a biography of a very complex and extraordinary person. I loved the characters in the movie and thought that leaving Archie's life a mystery captured her humanity. I do not think the purpose of a good biography should be detailed in a person's life, but rather the complexities and the relationships that are interesting. And what is more fascinating than someone to successfully reinvent themselves? "Men come to these dreams - you've been dreaming well." Good job at Lord Attenborough. I also wanted to mention that Nathaniel Arcand really stands out for me as a charismatic actor and I hope to see him in more films.
