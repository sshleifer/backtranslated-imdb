I loved so much about this film ... the time taken to develop the characters, the attention to detail, the superb performance, the stunning lighting and cinematography, the wonderful soundtrack ... It has a combined intensity of the lightness Touching that will not work for anyone who wants to typically fast-paced action to flick the movie. If we lived on Elizabeth day, I would say this movie a bit like a Shakespearean tragedy. But since we do not, let's say it more like a Drama-Thriller movie. The draw is simple, but the story is complex. The film is smart in the way relationships and issues are explored. Many of the story shows rather than said, which I get to make it more subtle and moving - and that works well for a story based on a comic book (or graphic novel). At times I felt I was actually there in the 1930s, part of this story - had such a realistic yet dream-loving quality in the style of its saying. <br /> I do not often prefer movie books based on, but in this case I do. (Even though I was enjoying the book too.) I bought the DVD, which is great because it has some wonderful scenes to delete and insightful. <br /> (I've also taken my little cousin, who's a little younger than the boy in the movie, to see it after I've seen it for the first time because it has the problem home and I wanted to use this as a way to start a discussion of problem-son problems with her .-- and the discussion.)
