This film probably has a $ 750 budget, and it still manages to overlook Titanic. I rented this day I crashed my mother's car, and it was the only thing that encouraged me beyond belief! It has to be tied to the 'Assur in the Assassin Bimbos'. Things to explore are: 1. The drive to blow blow chinese girl performer 2. Blond in bleach in the sassoon shirt that never changes 3. Flinstone-like jumps from drive 4. Together in clash torn by the right Before it gets to kill (do not worry, I do not ruin any surprises, for it's soooo predictable) 5. The guy who finds it necessary to complain. 6. The mental patient who plays a convincing job of being crazy does not poke out the eyes of a manic. 7. Hours are followed by the end involving the teacher and the priest. 8. Quit writing grafitti on the wall toilet. 9. Last, but not least, the wonderful special effects - especially the elbow in the boob that made a ... sky help me ... blow up noise <br />
