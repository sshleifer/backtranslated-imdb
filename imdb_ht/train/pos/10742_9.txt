Difficult movie to comment on, how do you say it's bad? Well it's not, but then it's equally hard to say it's a good thing. What it is, is convincing to look, it's as close as you will get devastated utter devastation without. It is the pictures of Tsunami approaching the coast of Thailand brought to life, you know you want to turn away, but you have to look. The Naudet brothers occupy the book very well, even in most of the tragic circumstances, have to look at something that's happening in another country or panders or insults. The facts are about the cellulose and the little needed for the viewer to understand or understand what is happening. <br /> <br /> You can not change history, and you do not want to, this movie stands as a testament to mankind in its worst air.
