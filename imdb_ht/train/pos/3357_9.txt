While Rome has gone mad to celebrate Hitler's visit - uniforms, bands, parades - two other from home, in a big building, and wind up meetings. She is Sofia Loren, who is the wife of domestic public brutish and mother of six children. He is Mastroianni, a radio speaker who was fired because of his homosexuality. Both of them need companies and understanding, both get them to each other. <br /> <br /> The movie covers a span within a few hours. The color is faded and everything takes place with a sound track in military markets and airborne radio hysterics. Strangely enough, the Nazi - the Horst-Wessel-Lied - ends up becoming a romantic theme music. <br /> <br /> Beautiful movie, excellent recreation in a special era of Italian history with a touch, sad story. Mastroianni is as good as we have come to expect with Sofia Loren to perform a superb job, very far from the usual driver's skull, the people of Neapolitan fish. Do not miss it.
