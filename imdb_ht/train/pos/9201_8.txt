Dev Anand (or Prashant) and Zeenat Haman (Jasbir / Janice) are brothers and sisters brought up to single parent families. Jasbir (sister) is growing in a rich environment, but it is not enough to take her to reject her life and finally get into a hippie movement that eventually leads her to drugs. Prashant (fee) on the other hand grows in a less affluent environment but grows up to a maturity level. The story marks Prashant striving to save his little sister (who is ever in a vision) from a hostile hippie setting. This film stands the test of time, commenting that cults and hippies are a place for those who give up on their lives when they should rather stand up and must count in the face of adversity. The great musical compositions of this movie mean different things in different situations and in different people, and the director carries out a strange feeling.
