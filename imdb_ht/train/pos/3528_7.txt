I rated this movie 7/10 which is an average of 8/10 for scenario, direction and 1944 output value and 6/10 for acting. My acting rating in turn was calculated at 4/10 for all the screen characters except for that played by heroine Ella Raines as Carol Richman who was excellent at 8 / 10.Also I commend Thomas Gomez as Inspector Burgess who has convinced characters that he personally does not think the verdict verdict on Scott Henderson (Alan Curtis) was just to look at alibi his nayib .At two of them form an alliance to prove Scott Alibi. <br /> I have this movie about a "Suevia Film Noir Cine Negro" DVD in Spanish as "La Dama Desconocida" with the original "English" band as an alternative language, since although I could not find a full English version.I was however worried to see another performance by Ella Raines after being impressed with her performances as a heroine of "Impact" playing a single girl parking garage.Here Ella is doing another heroic role to believe in innocent in his engineer's boss, he denied several hints that he should return home to Kansas (his pet's name) prior to solving the missing aliases. The fact that he is secretly in love with boss it is a little hard to believe that she formally just seemed to have had a formal business relationship with her. She had also designed children's home and playground so I thought that "family family" was lit in the brain of Carol . The "Movie Code" in operation, producers could only show the metaphorical sex and here it does in the form of furious drumming played by Elisha Cooke jnr.Carol doll itself as a girl of virtue easily in an attempt to lure drummer The other character, Jack Marlow (an associate of Scott Henderson) is played by Tanch Franchot whose performance I found too much theater and wonder why Carol, for example, did not notice it constantly and strang Try her hand alone. Here's the scenarios should be improved and have been further suspended as the theater has telegraphed the scheme far too early at the hearing.
