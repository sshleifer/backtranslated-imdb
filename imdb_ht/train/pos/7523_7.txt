I saw this film at the Palm Springs Festival 2006 Film Festival and it's a movie and it's not a movie since it has shot HBO to fire on cable networks sometime this year. This film presents page as a slave slave slave with discipline and film actress B & D films that have had enough talent to become a real actress. The page was a bit more than that and the movie touched on some of its other roles in patterns, but not enough to balance out the icon pinup icon in the 50's. This film is supposedly based on the book "Real Bettie Page" by Richard Foster. He was shot in black and white to feel the 1950's nostalgia. I have a book entitled "The Life of a Legend Pinup" that has a lot of great pictures of the quirky career of Page and I must say that this movie reproduces on film, and Gretchen Mol as Page, many of these pics popular with accuracy. Mol himself and Bettie's black nut with brown contact lens is Bettie Page. Not only does she have to look at Bettie's Page but she has the smile and personality features that came in the camera down perfectly. And her body is near a copy of the page as soon as possible. Interesting sex. The story is kind of slim and tabloid and certainly could be a lot better. But this is a very good TV movie. I would miss it 7.0 in a scale of 10 and recommend it to watch when it comes to TV.
