I must say that I wanted to see this film for a long time, and I was not disappointed. Acting in Dominic Monaghan is simply fantastic. As a party insomniac myself, I can relate to how the story develops. I've never experienced anything in the sort of awesome moments overlooking the sleep and it can be scary. It was a big movie, worth every penny. I hope that one day I can work with Tess myself, it would be an honor and beyond. I can recommend it to everyone. Perhaps not small children as they may be scared. But if you are a ensemble like me, you will understand the world, the mysteries and the fear. You will love it. <br /> <br />
