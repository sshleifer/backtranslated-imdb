Soapdish can come down as one of the lowest rated movies. <br /> A stellar, thrown without selfishness who understands exactly where the movie went with the role played by it. While everyone hammed it up, there was no one-upmanship. Kline showed understanding and great physical comedy, Goldberg and Downey knew how to carry on a comical conversation while someone else was talking, I could just go on. <br /> Do not pass this movie by!
