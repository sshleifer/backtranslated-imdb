Who feels to understand about this movie is that it is not a start, middle, and end, it is just the conclusion of a TV series of 26 long long. So remember that when you all talk about how the world has not been explored enough. That's all done in the TV show. As great and stunning as the visuals are, I think *** SPOILERS *** argument between Lian-Chu and Gwizdo near the film's end was what really made me love this movie. Seeing my character was following in 26 episodes fighting as it was agonizing, and seeing Gwizdo walking sadly cut by himself among the floating ruins while Lian-Chu's file blade was almost worn-jerking. <br /> Then we got a total contrast with Lian-Chu fighting these insanely awesome dragons (who were featured in the series) while Gwizdo is insulting and indirectly threatening to kill Zoe. * Blaze * I am surprised that this particular scene was not mentioned more of the warnings. Any kid with a niche in the sense will be able to see that Gwizdo did not himself and was completely intent on this unusual girl. It was enough to hurt me, and I'm 15. <br /> <br /> The world is amazing, the plot is a lot better than most multi-million blockbusters, and it was a great way to see some in my favorite character goes. Look at that. :)
