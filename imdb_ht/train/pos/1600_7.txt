This is not a bad movie. It's not wildly funny, but it's fun and fun <br /> <br />. It was a funny moment. Cher gives a good <br /> performance in a very opulent real-life role. It <br /> <br /> performance alone is worth the look. If this film came out [...] today it would not be named, but not 'his 80s standard <br /> <br /> was excellent.
