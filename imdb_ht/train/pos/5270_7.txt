This movie may be really bad, but it is a lot of fun. The bad act and poor direction improves the film's hysterics. The twins are very funny in the Conanique roles. If you go to this movie waiting Conan first or Excalibur, than you will hate it. If you look at it while in a good mood and accept it as good, fun dumb you will have a good time. Look for the scene where they try to hang their fees, its funneling scenes in the movie. I wish the science of theater 3000 would do that !!
