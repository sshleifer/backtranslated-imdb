This is a low budget film and a cast in unknown with a minimum of aside shoots. Philippines substitutes for Thailand and nobody actually goes to Hong Kong. The stock shot of a Cathay Pacific aircraft jet plane at the old airport makes the transition perfectly. This movie proves that you do not need a mega budget nor a starliner star to produce an excellent movie. It does not have the gaps or excesses that young peers often stumble. Solid artisans from people who know all the aspects of making films and who understand their compromises between art and box office. An excellent piece of work!
