Sleepwalkers are animals that drain the life force completely out of people to survive ... but they can only use virgins (it does not explain why). Charles Brady (Brian Krause) is one such person who needs to feed his mother Mary (Alice). It goes after likable Tanya (Madchen Amick). Will he escape? <br /> In one hand this is a great movie support. Fast-paced, lots of blood and gore with a beautiful, tight sense of humor. There are many references to jokes for horror movies (Castle Rock is mentioned once). Also Krause is excellent (who would think he could act after "Returning to the Blue Lagoon") as is Kirge and Amick. But I get this annoying movie. <br /> It was written for the screen by Stephen King and it's maddeningly waves. Slewalkers never explained completely. Where are they from? Why is this called? Why should the son feed his mother? Why cats hated and can kill them? What power after all (in one point Krause makes a car disappear and change color and style!)? Why do they need to feed the lives of the people? Why should she only virgin? Why is the son sex with his mother? None of these are explained leaving the confusion story. It's really too bad because, these questions aside, this is an excellent screen movie. Excellent makeup and special effects too. <br /> Fast, gory and lots of fun. If only the script was the best. Also, a fair sex scene between Krause and Krige has been modified (you can say) to get a rating R. I can only give this a 7.
