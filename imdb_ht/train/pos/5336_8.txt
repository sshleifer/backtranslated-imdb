I really love this movie because of Australia, Chinese movies like these never get to show during prime time. I must say this is one of the best movies ever, explaining the difference between the people of Hong Kong, and the Chinese continent. It really shows that there's discomfort between the two, but they can only get better as their HK learn Mandarin. He also showed me how China's main indie rock scene exists, and that Chinese people know how to strum the guitar and get funking at home! Anyone saying that China is not ready for rock music? Daniel Wu is absolutely superb, with his own voice and circle, honest act, and a total chick magnet. I recommend this movie to those who do not know much about Asian people to purify themselves from the typical Western stereotypes, and those who just love Chinese / Asian movies like myself. Look at that!
