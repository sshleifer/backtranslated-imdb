When the scientist and family of Man Matt Winslow (Robert Urich) finally accepted the invitation of the Micro-Digitech Corporation's work in a space suit project, he moved with his beloved wife Patricia (Joanna Cassidy) and Robbie (Barret Oliver) and Daughter Chrissy (Sun Frye Moon) in a modern home in the composite society. They met Tom Peterson friends (Joe Regalbuto) and his family fully adapted to the new form, and Tom invited the Winslow family to join the Steaming Springs Country Club. Tom tries to seduce Matthew telling him that every member of the club has a professional meteorologist's assignment of Micro-Digitech, but Matt does not tempt with the offer. Later it is presented to the director of the club, Jessica Jones (Susan Lucci) who befriends Patricia and convinced her to join the club with her children. Matt feels unchanged in his family behavior and decides to investigate the club, finding a bad secret about Jessica and members. In the 80's, when I saw the "Invitation in Hell", I liked this movie partially reminding the "Stepford wives," and those who changed the behavior of a suburban compound. I've just seen it today, and I get a great metaphorical message against the big corporations, when people literally sell their soul to the demon to rise positions and earn higher wages. I'm not sure if the author intends to interpret this in the story, but I think it fits perfectly. My vote is seven. <br /> Title (Brazil): "Convicting Inferno" ("Invitation to Hell")
