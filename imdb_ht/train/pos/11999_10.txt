I saw this wonderful production, and I wonder if someone can tell me anything about the actress who played the Miss-I'm not sure of the character's name. I went to BYU with her and lost touch with her-His maiden name was Kim Luke- and I wonder if someone has any info about it. It's not in the credit list. This production was exceptional, a worn torn all over, superb acting by all. I guess I do not even want to put it in the general category of 'acting', more like 'portrait and feeling the amazing events that led to the opening of the sky for this final dispensation' ... something like that. If someone worked with Kim or having a website or something please let me know !!! It was fantastic in her role, by the way .... Thanks, Melissa Thorne
