Director Raoul Walsh was like Michael Bay at '40 and years before. And I mean that in a positive way, since I definitely is not by Bay-Hater. His movies are just simple high quality entertainment, as with the movie Raoul Walsh being in his day. <br /> <br /> "Mr. Jim" is good quality entertainment. In addition to a first-class director, he also features a first-class cast, and regular leader Erlin Flynn in the main part. <br /> <br /> What surprised me was how the boxing matches were carried on the screen. They used some very dynamic camera-work, which also really made the boxing uplifting boxes and interesting to watch, and the final championship battle against John L. Sullivan as the final highlight. <br /> <br /> Biopics of the '40 and earlier on were obviously still very different from the biographies that made this day present. Modern biography often glorifies its main topics and shows life from fundamental to births of death and everything, especially emotional aspect, in between. The 'Old' biopic has just made the same as movies that were not based on real-life real people, which means that film-makers would often use an amount of use of creative freedom and personality to the main character and event which came to his / her life. This film is also not just a biography on a boxing legend, but also forms a beautiful portrayal of the period when illicit battles enters the modern era of boxing. <br /> <br /> Errol Flynn does a great job of showing the real life of the famous James J. Corbett boxer James Gentleman Jim. Not too many people, but Flynn has done some good work at the current '40, in which film is one. Fysicaly itself also looks like head-shaped. It also looks quite different from the path without its trademark mustache in this small movie. The film also features some good actors to support and some good acts at all. A great and fun movie that still really really keeps up real estate today.
