Why is this movie not the best 250? This film looks still amazing amazing 56 years after its production but it could only be done in the aftermath W.WII because of the perception of the almost death. People were more aware that their lives could be stopped at an unexpected moment. And what after life? I liked the scenes in the end and the trial and all of the people gathered. The Flegm Judge (Abraham Sofaer - a typical British judge), Dr. Reeves (Roger Livesey) advocates Peter Carter (David Niven) as well as June (Kim Hunter) against the American prosecutor Abraham Farlan (Raymond Massey I - there is a reason it is an American -). It's all so imaginative! Michael Powell wrote, headed with this amazing movie product that is a real "tour-of-force". The message of the film is clear: in the universe the law is the most important, but the earth has nothing to go beyond the love between humans. The way in which this beautiful story is said is far more interesting than any Hollywood movie ever made.
