Robo Jox is trying hard, but basically a series of battle scenes is strung together - robots against robots, man against men, man against women. The first was potential, but it seems the script has not really given the couple to more drafts it is necessary. Still, it was fairly good, for a science fiction movie action. Part of it was because the script was not Joe Haldeman. For those who are not familiar with the name, Haldeman wrote the novel science-fiction award-winning "The Forever War". He is considered one of the best fighting armor fighters, right up with Robert Heinlein's "John Stakley's" vessel troupe "and" gun ". And this movie is really more like a giant gun fighting gun gun, rather than giant robots. It is closest to what the fans wanted instead of the travesty that were the "Paul Verhoeven's Paul Verge," which made only a resemblance to the novel he was based on. Despite some assumptions, this really is not based on Homer's "Iliad." A couple of names were all in common. Achilles whose foot robot was not parallel to the Iliad, which did not include Achilles' death. Neither was Achilles ancient a noble warrior. He was stronger, but also vengeful and petty. Even the robot jock kill at the first stage does not fit. It was called Hercules, while the Greek Iliad would have Heracles. Effect was fairly good for the time and budget. True, it was not comparable to "Terminator 2" a year later, but that movie cost ten times a lot. The suspension movement was almost as good as the Robotics Walkers of the "Hit Empire Return" and "Back on Thursday." Best, in fact, passes a lot of Ray Harryhausen animation, which is highly regarded, but well-dated. <br /> <br /> Do not bring high hopes to this and you probably will not be disappointed. It's better than a lot of other small-low budget bars and even some great-budget blockbuster wannabes that have the best effects but far worse scripts.
