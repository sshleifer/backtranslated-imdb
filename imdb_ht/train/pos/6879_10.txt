The "Groove Tube" was one of only two Ken Shapiro movies, one of the other was equally "Modern Problems". This one is just a full-scale parody of television. Aside from Shapiro - apparently did not do anything after "Modern Problems" - the movie also star Chevy Chase and Henry Winkler's cousin Richard Belzer. Three cast members (plus some others in smaller roles) appear in various skits. One of the funniest features Chase in a commercial Geritol-spoofing, in which he describes the medicine as his wife's band, and ends with him. There is also a pornographic news program, a disappointing cooking show, and the epic story of some drug dealers. Anyway, everything is just a real looking. In my opinion, the three best TV-formats are one, more "Tunnelvision" and "Kentucky Fried Movie" (although I might also include the "Truman Show"). Really funny. <br /> I wonder what ever came to Ken Shapiro.
