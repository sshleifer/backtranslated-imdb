OK, let's get this clear. I'm really not in sci-fi, but for some reason I love Stargate SG-1. Jack O'Neil took his SG-1 team into a Stargate. A roundtable that creates a wormhole. It gives you the ability to travel to distant worlds. It might sound like the usual Sci-Fi-series, but it's not! The plot is set today by some distant millennia as many other sci-fi series. I find that great. It gives you things, things and what you can relate to, and you can jump in the range at any time without having to learn many new themes and names of all the gadgets. They are some of course, but thanks to O'Neil who loves to maintain a simple terminology, there's not much. <br /> <br /> The series has a nice mix of humor, action and drama. If you enjoy loads of special effects you will not find it here. They do not use many bad people, but a limited amount of good to make special effects.
