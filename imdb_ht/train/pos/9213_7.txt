Gómez Pereira is responsible for some of the most humorous comedies in the latest Spanish cinema (just take a look at his curriculum), so I did not expect much of "Cosas Que Hacen ..." ... In fact I do not know why in the world I decided to look it up. Anyway, I just did ... And what a surprise. It seems that Gómez Pereira was finally mature and now she could make a good movie. It's the latest deal deal with the midlife crisis, the irritating, and the seeker for a second chance after you lose it all. The last hour of the movie (more dramatic) is the best part, and it's just worth watching the movie. Also, we have Eduard Fernandez play the main role, and I keep thinking about it is the best actor of his generation (not far). <br /> <br /> * Me Rate: 7/10
