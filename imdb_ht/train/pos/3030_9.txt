This film has scenes that come back to me in the strange moments - that intense scene with Mr. Muckerji tells Mrs Melandez that someone she was talking to witnesses the girl being pushed out the window by a woman who fits her outline - - is one that rolls around - the way it keeps referring to by - in a Greek accent "Mr Muckerji" - and then when Boyer discovers he has just taken poisons and gives him one last feel You've got to the side of the head before he's dead --- it's a fun! "Foolish - crazy - all my life" ... etc etc - you get the point .. I have to buy this one. I like the Dan Seymour Act - it usually plays some alien sultan heads or foreign police and appeared in Casablanca with lots of great pictures.
