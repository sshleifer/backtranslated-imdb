An ultra-modern house in a affluent neighborhood appears to be the cause of each of the inhabitants it is rare (and deadly) behaviors. Or at least is character Lara Flynn Boyle, Col Kennedy, discussing. Following a series of deadly events in a gaggantuan next door, Col knows something has happened. Mark Paul Paul Gosselaar also stars as the mysterious architect. <br /> My opinion: The next House works door because of Lara Flynn Boyle and their place (beautiful house) and stylish set. Boyle is a talented and dynamic actress, not to mention absolutely stunning. He brings the credibility of his character and makes the film intriguing. Without it, it would fail. "So alive" declares a prospective buyer in the home reference. Yes, he lives. But the story itself is not so much. <br /> Prevent Boyle's presence, not many is happening here, as an enormous amount of movie spent watching or waiting to see how the house will affect its current master. The results are predictable. But I love it anyway. The film movie cinematography in a polished look. 8/10 on Boyle's account, the premise of an ultra-modern evil, location and cinematography, and decorating and wardrobe.
