Young, handsome, muscular Joe Buck (Jon Voight) moved from Texas to New York to think he will make a living by being a stud. It gets there and finds out quickly that it will not be easy - it goes to one experience degraded after another. At the end of his rope he climb up and disable, sleazy Ratso Rizzo (Dustin Hoffman). Together they try to survive and get out of the city and go to Florida. But will they do it? <br /> <br /> Very dark, disturbing yet fascinating film. Director Jan Schelsinger paints a very gorgeous portrait of NYC and its people. That way it's dating - the city could be this bad in 1969 but it's cleaned considerably by now. He also uses each movie trick in the book - color turns black & white; trippy dream sequence; flash forwards; flash back (especially involving a rape); cut shock; the strange sound effects ... or her name. It keeps you disoriented and off center - but I could not stop watching. <br /> There is not much of a story - it basically centers on the friendship between Rizzo and Buck. There is an implication that they may have been lovers (the final shot shows shows). It's just a portrait of damaged characters trying to survive in a cold, cruel, urban forest. This was originally rated X in 1969 - the only reason that the MPAA did not think parents would want their children to see. But it was a big hit with high school (back then X meant no one under 17). It has also been the only rated X movie ever to win an Academy Award as best photo. Hoffman and Voight were up to acting as Sylvie Miles (Mysteriously) is in the picture for a total of (perhaps) 5 minutes! He eventually dropped to a R (with no cut) when he reviewed in 1980. <br /> <br /> Also this excellent song "All Talking" was presented in this movie - and he has become a major hit. br> <br /> A great movie - but very black. I give it a 10. Do not see it on commercial television - it's cut loop and incomprehensible.
