An enjoyable game, which offers fun playing with easy toys and easy replay capabilities. Stay true to the comic and give a low learning curve to give this game something not seen in most cartoon stocks today. Also, scenes of narration and animated use (though long animations are replaced by slide shows on the Nintendo 64 version) use all the advantages of the platform's capabilities.
