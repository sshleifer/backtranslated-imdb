It does not seem that this movie manages to please a lot of people. The first, not much seems to have seen it in the first place (I just was thrown into it by accident), and then judged by the reviews and the rating of those that did many did not enjoy it very much. <br /> <br /> Well, I did. I still tolerate managing his looks with his charms, and even though I did not consider him a big actor, I know he can do very well mad (I love his Jones). But this performance is all different. It's not nice at this one, and it's not good. His character is completely different from anything I've seen from him up to that point --- old, ugly, broken, determined. And, in my opinion is so far better performance ever, pull it well. I guess it's a sign that an actor does his job if you can not imagine anyone else doing it instead --- think Hopkins as Hannibal Lecter, or Washington as Alonzo's Day Training. That's how good was to be here. <br /> <br /> The rest of the cast was fine by me, too. I guess I would not throw Danes into that role, especially because I think it's too good-looking for it. But it actually does an excellent job, keeping it unattended and a gurus in head shape, which is no small feat. Strickland easily delivers the best support, in a party that requires a considerable amount of hand. I actually think he owns the key scene with Gere and Danes, and that's quite a success. So what about the rest of the movie, apart from some excellent acting? This story is perhaps not quite surprising, there are some 8mm-me aspects of it, but adding "broken rookie veterans" to the person-manituous storyline, and also (like the Silence of the Lambs) adds a sense of urgency to Try to save the girl and the next retirement of the character Gere. All that is a set of developments in the two main characters, as they help each other settle in their respective new stations in their lives. That's a lot accomplished in a 100 minute, but it is done well, and we end up caring for the characters and what's going on. <br /> <br /> Directions and photography were adequate. I could do without the modern musical-video camera movements and cuts, but then I'm an old warrant, and it really was not all that bad, in fact I think he's helped The atmosphere of the movie, how you could guess, not and great is not a happy one. <br /> <br /> Worth to see.
