Those engaging the movie camera so early in the century must have calculated some of its potential very early on. This is a good story of a kind of playboy who needs money and inadvertently sells his soul to Satan for a lot of money. Unfortunately, the soul is double to him, he must confront him often, tearing his life apart. There are some wonderful scenes with manic fading out and, of course, the scenes when the two are on stage at the same time. Part of the middle is a bit dull, but Faustian's story is still in the minds of the viewer. One of the things I have to mention is the general inattractiveness of the people in the movie. Also, they are pretty much worn away from many actions that would have at least given some life in the stuff. I've first been told in this movie about 25 years ago and was finally able to see it. I was not disappointed.
