This hilarious line is typical of those naughty sisters say. (It's funny about its own and very funny unintentional theme, too.) Only two of the sisters are really bad. Boys are bad, too! One gives Pinup poses with salacious comments where he goes. The other got up to look like Marilyn Monroe. He has sensual people, a little mouth separating mouth. And, do not give anything away, it is even more bad than the other. <br /> <br /> All three sisters are played by starlets. People fall into life by John Bromfield. He had something in a career. <br /> This looks like today possibly the first-to-be-the-core soft-core panda ever marketed. Well, of course not the first, but the raciest at that time. <br /> <br /> Girls are as small as possible and let's not forget about the female audience members: Bromfield shows beard and an electric razor - who has this fetish? - make-chested. It also shows wet skirts in a swimsuit. There's a real scheme here, too: the girls' families, seeing, are cursed. They tend to suicide - or dramatic deaths that may occur in succession. The movie is not bad. I really do not know where he's been shown. Maybe it's been done for drive-ins. Somehow, and I might be wrong, I felt that the typical male audience was not the main target here. The women are scantily dressed. They often resemble liquid coverings such as Detective Police or jackets in novel novel. <br /> But the guy seems to be central focus. Not everyone in the movie loves her, but all the girls love her. And I think the audience also means. <br /> It's lots of fun - and on its own theme, too.
