Cillian Murphy and Rachel McAdams stars in this thriller / thriller action written and directed by the master of suspense, Wes Craven, himself. The whole movie begins with some issues at the Lux Atlantic, a hotel in Miami. Problems at all fixed by Lisa Reisert, the manager of the hotel. Then he goes to the airport, and that's where all the problem begins. She meets Jackson Rippner, who does not like to call Jack because she's called Jack Ripper, if you know her and I mean. Then they ride the plane, and crazy enough, Rippner and Reisert sit next to each other. For the next half hour, Lisa is terrorizing, tormented, and scared by Rippner. I will not give anything away. Then we move around where Jack is chasing Lisa at the airport. Then Lisa goes to his house to see if his father is okay, and crazily enough, Rippner is already there. There are almost twelve minutes of violence and intense throughout the scene. In total, about 25 minutes of intense action comes to the end. <br /> Not only was the intense movie but it was a great draw. As I said, I will not give anything away because it's so shocking and thrilling and somewhat disturbing / scary. And the act out of every single character in the movie, even those who have no line at all, have all become perfect. It was incredible. Everything was scary in this movie! The acting, the music, the effects, the make-up, the directive, the correction, the writing, everything was wonderful! Wes Craven is definitely the Master of Stop. Eye Red is definitely a must-see and definitely worth spending your money on. You could watch this movie over and over and over again and never get bored. <br /> <br /> Red eyes I said is better than 10 out of 10 stars.
