Starlift is a beautiful and exciting throwback to those of all music stars that each studio has set out during the Second World War. When you've got starring such as Gary Cooper, James Cagney, Doris Day, Gordon MacRae, and Randolph Scott, etc., in the movie with such people as Gershwin Brothers, Cole Porter, Jule Styne and Sammy Cahn supplying the music, it's an easy to take film. And the plot is not even by the way. <br /> What draws involve Air Force mobilized people, Dick Wesson and Ron Hagerthy, are trying to meet Warner Brothers starlet Janice Rule using as a gadget the fact that both from Youngstown, Ohio and father Hagerthy The dentist was the ruler as well as half the city. The scheme works too well that Louella Parsons is soon putting them as an article in his column. Yes, Louella's in the movie as well. She must love Warner Brothers or Jack Warner treat her more than other studio employers because she also uses this studio to publish her Hollywood Hotel Radio program back in the day. <br /> But the rest of the draw also touched on the real-life efforts of Ruth Roman also plays herself to find her studio and others performing at the Air Force bases for military and women going to Korea. Some of the names I mentioned and others sing and perform at a demonstration at the Air Force Base Travis where a lot of this film was shot. <br /> A special number shot for the talents of Phil Harris that sang / tell a Stranger Look Out Stranger, I'm a Texas Ranger assistant and assisted by Virginia Gibson, Frank Lovejoy and Gary Cooper. Yup, Cooper seemed to have a great old time kidding his image. <br /> This is the oldest in cliches when you say they do not make them like this again, but they really do not because you do not have a studio system that has all this talent under contract. This is one thing about the end of the old studio system we can mourn.
