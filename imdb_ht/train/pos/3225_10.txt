When I rented this movie to look at it, I knew it would not be a sensitive movie. Instead I thought of it as a disbelief in reality where someone will get a serious beating. And you know what he worked. Kurt Russel did what I though was a remarkable role in showing the emotional soldier that he was. I recommend this movie if you come out with the boys and want to watch a good action movie.
