BABY FACE is a fast paced, wise split, knows smirk in a movie <br /> <br /> lasting only an hour and 15 minutes but oh that a clever 75 minutes <br /> <br / > yo! That's a story that covers so much land could be said in such a short time that most of today's movie makers shame. Screenwriters at <br /> <br /> today should study the economy of BABY FACE and cut off the bulge that <br /> <br /> many debris of the films. <br /> The story is not nonsense. A woman amorous up in wealthy first bottom, <br /> and then on the bodies of the men who fall madly in love with her. Make sure the production code loused it up with a pick up, happy ending, but it's not hard to see in which direction the wanted writers <br /> go, so enjoy what's and use your imagination. for the rest. Stanwyck is terrific as George Brent and Douglass Dumbvrille as a hapless thirsty. Not a big movie but certainly a one enjoyable. If <br /> you never saw BABY catch it next time it shows the cable <br /> <br /> or rent the tape. It's worth effort.
