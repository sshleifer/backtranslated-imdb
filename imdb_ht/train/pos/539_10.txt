The first was good and original. I was a bad movie movie / comedy not bad. So I heard a second second made and I had to watch it. <br /> <br /> What really does work this movie is the character of Judd Nelson and the script is sometimes clever. A very good script for someone who wrote their final movie destination and the direction was okay. Sometimes there's the scene where he looks like it was filmed using a home video camera and a vibrant look. <br /> Great make-for-TV movie. It was worth the rental and probably worth buying just to find that odd charming look and look at Stanley Judd Nelson's doing what he did best. <br /> I suggest the newcomers to look at the first one before watching the end, so you'll have an idea what Stanley is like and get a little background history.
