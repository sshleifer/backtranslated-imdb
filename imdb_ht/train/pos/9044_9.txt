I recently saw this movie due to Jake's recent success with Brokeback Mountain. I figured I would see the films that I missed. I had no expectations going to the movie so was surprising that I had to miss this movie at all. He is an enticing father and son, and he is also a storyteller story. I even poured a water into the finale of this wonderful story. This appeal movie for all ages. The only reason I give it a 9 out of 10 is that it slows a little from the middle, but it comes back strong to the end. The act was great, the story was magnificent, and the cinematography was fascinating to the environment in the movie. GO to see this movie! Rent it, buy it, watch it, love it! I know I did!
