I can always remember first seen on TV. I could not believe TVNZ left it on! I've owned it! A lot of humor will be lost on non-NZ'ers, but give it a go! <br /> Since finishing Back to Y Matt Matt and Chris have gone to bigger and better (?) things. NZ's greatest dagger-anger stuntman, Randy Campbell has often appeared on the British television series in Steel. Yes, he still f ^ @ ks up all his waterfall because he was too drunk. The 'Voodoo House' album has also been released since the release of 2 albums, Saba Brown and Back in Brown. The group consists of members of Back to the Y team with singles such as 'I would give you one of my beers (but I've only got 6)' and 'You have not even been born in the 80' continue their humor. The South-South-West Film Festival also featured the film 'Devil's length' film made me do it 'that will be released early in 2008. , if you do not get these funny guys then you can just F% ^ K OFF!
