I have personally seen many Disney movies throughout my life, though absolutely none of them match up in any way Bedknobs and broomsticks. Although I personally would not have crossed live-action and animation, it was an improvement on trying to dress up as an animation character. The three hole film evacuated from the global war of sentence to remain with a woman and socially awkward woman in the country. I should say that the casting was brilliant. Angela Landsbury made a perfect Miss, while David Thomilson made a great exciting interest to love interest. Endlessly still surprise me and this was no exception. It's neither happy nor sad, though I do not know if this was intentional. The dialogue was not great, but considering it was designed to be a kid's movie, which is OK. In general, I would give the nine performances out of ten, the six dialogue from ten, casting the nine out of ten and the eight costumes from ten.
