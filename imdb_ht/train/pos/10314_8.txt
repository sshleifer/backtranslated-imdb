This one and his "Pilgrim Soul" are two of my favorite episodes in this new version of Twilight Zone. As I mentioned in my comment on the new series, there's something missing in this new series. Perhaps they emphasize too many lessons learned. It is a little more mawkish and sentimental than Serling's version. However, this episode can be considered as sensitive too. I think the appeal is that no matter what they do, lovers can never unite. I remember that I was not surprised by the Korean movie "The Mare" (later remnant of the "Lake House." I think it's because I saw this first episode so it lost both the impact of the film later.
