The movie is more about to correct than owl hair. It's also about Aboriginal, Canada, English, a Gray Owl and the North Bay Nugget. Excellent story. <br /> This is an excellent movie, more like a book, which raises interesting questions about cultural identity and value. The key scene is Gray Owl admitting his insposture to correcting and reacting. <br /> A few observations on the user ratings. Note that the evaluation users are bi-polar clustering at 5 and 7; it's not for everyone, but there is one stronger. This film is muted and neglected but will be noticeable for years to come. Also, some women have watched the movie but missed it more than men. Has it been marketed well? <br /> <br />
