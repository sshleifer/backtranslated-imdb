I really enjoyed this adaptation of "Emma" .I saw it many times and I'm still looking forward to seeing it again. Even if it only lasts 107 minutes, most of the novel plot and sub-cemetery They have developed in a satisfactory way. All characters are well described. Most of the dialogues come directly to the novel with no comic jokes added like Emma Thompson's Sense and Sensibility. <br /> As an alien, I particularly appreciate the perfect dictionaries of the actors. The setting and costumes were beautiful. I found this version well on a par with 1995 miniseries "Pride and Prejudice" but then the producer and senarist was the same. Kate Beckinsale did a really good job describing "Emma" that Jane Austen said she would create a non-only one but she would like. It's snobbish but it was just enough young and inexperienced to be always enjoyable. Strong brand was also very good at describing Mr Knightley, not an easy part, I think, even though he does not have charisma shown by Mr Darcy Colin Firth in pride and prejudice. Even the end stage (the crop festival) that does not reach the novel gives a tight end except for when Emma shows being cold and almost unpleasant with Frank Churchill whereas in the novel he has well reconciled with him, even telling him that he would have enjoyed the duplicity, had he been in his situation. An unusual departure of loyalty is otherwise shown throughout the movie. I find the most beautiful and elaborate costumes than other Jane Austen's adaptations.
