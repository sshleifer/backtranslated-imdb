In the process of trying to establish audience sympathy with Jake Roedel (Tobey Maguire) the Northern Nomads and Jayhawkers filmmakers. Missouri has never left the Union and the Union Army an invasive force. The Southeans fought for the State's rights: the right to their own slaves, to elect the legislature and the crooked judges, and to employ a political eviction system. There is nothing nobody in this. The Missourians could easily travel east and joined the Army Confederation. <br /> It seems to me that the story has nothing to do with ambiguity. When Jake leaves Bushwhackers, it's not because he sees mistakes in his way, he certainly does not give himself about in the virtue of the cause of abolition.
