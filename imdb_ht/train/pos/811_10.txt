When I think of the Return on Thursday I think epic. Yea, Ewro was there? They are an interesting addition to the movie (not to mention the same as the Vietcong who has also been able to take down an advanced technology arm and primitive acts). Thursday is definitely darker then the rest of the movies. Emperor Palpatine (described by the actor actor Ian McDiarmid) was the one of the best parts of the movie. Palpatine is so evil and vicious, Vader looks like Mr. Rogers compared to him. Speaking of Darth Vader, what is an amazing end to such an iconic character. Vader is truly a modern Greek day tragedy and I think people can now understand and appreciate this after Sith's Revenge. His redemption in the end has moved and truly brings a happy happiness again for you. The best part was of course the special effects. It's amazing how a movie from the early eighties can still stand the test of time and graphics. The scenes at Jabba's Palace (Leia looks amazing in that metal bikini) and of course the three-way battle in the sequel are still stunning look. In the deep Jedi scheme and emotional moments (primarily between Luke Vader and Palpatine and when Luke reveals the truth to Leia) and special incredible effects is a tight end of one of the most favorite franchises in cinema history.
