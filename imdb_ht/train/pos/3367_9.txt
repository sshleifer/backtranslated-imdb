This movie has great acting, great photography and a very strong line that really makes you think of who you are, how you define yourself, how you fit into, if you accept to play a role or break free. There are already excellent comments related to these aspects. I want to comment on the formal setting of the movie. Basically, it's two people on one roof. There are units in place and time, with 2 protagonists, and the radio acts as the choir. Many directors have turned the Greek tragedy into films, many directors have filmed contemporary stories as if they were a Greek tragedy, but no director, in my opinion, succeeded as admirable as Ettore Scola in approaching the purity and strength of great Greek tragedy two of the story lines and formal settings. A masterpiece.
