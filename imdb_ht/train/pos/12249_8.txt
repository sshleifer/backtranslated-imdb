Jane's old dress history looks very popular these days. I've lost count in the number of versions going around. Probably the reason is that "corpses" are "red" at this late date. This mini-set TV gives it a proper saying the novel. Headstrong, Emma's opinion is a beautiful "modern" girl when you think about it, though the ambiance of Jane Austen's world may seem an artificial tad to us today. If you do not look EMMA, I'll only say that Emma is independent enough to get her comeuppance. It's worth looking at them to find out how. Honors acting here go to the ladies: Kate, Prunella, Lucy and Samantha. They could almost have had a psychic connection to old Jane!
