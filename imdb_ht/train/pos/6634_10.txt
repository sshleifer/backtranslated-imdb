How would you not miss this movie with 10/10? I admit to saying that this film is not very fun but the goal is not telling you a story but history! This is the first 'real' movie in the movie theater (the 'Prince of Galles' was first, but it was not technically perfect enough ??) and it has a dangerous sense of international value. Those people that you can see are finishing their working days in the movie were lucky to participate in a historic moment, becoming the first people to see themselves moving! And above all the shot is a nice shot! And it's very moving when you think about the first people they've seen! What a Moment! Background for science first (because the Lumiere brothers first invented the cinematic for scientific purposes) and for later art. A movie of reverend!
