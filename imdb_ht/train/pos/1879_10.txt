I was too young to remmeber when I first saw this movie. But I've seen it for the second time about 7 years ago. My sister told me I saw her. Now my whole family has memorized it. We quote it at least once a day. I absolutely love this movie.I always laugh after all this time. Sure, it's really a really, really drinking millionaire who is irresponsible. The whole point is that it still has the lost humanity of the others that we see in the movie. And that he is willing to give it all up for love. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who wants a laugh. A lot of laughter. Its weird, sweet, and if you are a movie smoker, it will highly change your mind to "funny". Look at it with a group of friends or family and I promise, you never have anything to talk about ever again with some Austria lines in mind. It will make you laugh for the years to come. <br /> It is really hard, in my family, to find a movie that everyone likes. But this movie, I feel, made us closer. And I know he'll do the same for you !!
