I like this movie like no other. Another time I'm going to try to explain its quality of the uninitiated, but for the moment I quit a few of the remarkable pieces of the dialogue, which, please remember, is the whole language of a blow. Aussies and Poms will understand, everyone else-well? <br /> <br /> (song song lyric) "It can shed a beer, it can pick a queer, to his last double-breasted Bondi gear." <Brr /> <br /> (another lyric song) "All pommies are bastards, bastards, or worse, and England is an e-hole in the universe." (during a television interview on an "artistic program"): Mr Mackenzie who impressed you artist since you were in England? (Answer Barry) Flamin 'bull-artists! <br /> (while discussing a young naive young girl): Mr Mackenzie, I suppose you have hordes of Aboriginal worshipers back to Australia? (Answer Barry) Abos? I have never seen an Abo in my life. Moms do most of the solid yacca (ie hard work) round our seats. <br /> <br /> This is just a taste of the hilarious mascarade this bonser Aussie flicker movie. If you can find a copy, look and enjoy.
