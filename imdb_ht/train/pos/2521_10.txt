I must admit - the only reason I bought this movie was because I'm a big fan of Gackt and a big fan * Hyde. I was expecting a good movie and a lot of shots that, to say, fun in the feminine eye, but a little cheesy story. I mean, the summary sounds really out. And now that I've just finished watching it - I feel I need to tell the world of its brilliance! Hyde and Gackt both gave heart-wrenching performance, and my eyes were always warm from the weeping that lasted for the last half of the movie. You get sucked into the story, and you really feel for the characters in the end. The element of vampirism - which I love, but it's very easy to overdo or break a movie and - is subtle mixing in the storyline as to make it something simply exotic, normal to this setting, rather than a random addition needed in the story . I ranked him in a 9 out of the first 10 ... and then I went back home and tried to think of why I did not give him the last point. Comes with nothing. So a ten out of ten it is. After all - I'm not much of a criticism - the fact that I bother writing a review at all to mean I either really hate the movie or really like it. You can tell what I'm on with the Moon Moon.
