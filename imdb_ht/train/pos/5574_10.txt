Peter M. Cohen has a winner satire about the mating game, twisting around inside and out inside. Bachin's film criticism of mainstream media publications as "offensive" and "raunchy" only uses its underlying intensity as a refreshing and focused section of human sexuality and passion. It is in the tradition of what I call "facts based" satire in the footsteps of "The Company of Men," "Chasing Amy", "Your Friend And Neighbors" and "Two Girls And A Guy" . Cohen's dialogue is hilarious and I was always intrigued by how perfectly he captured the real speed in today's conversation. Brian Van Holt, Zorie Barber, and Jonathan Abrahams are three distinct, untold gender-obsessed predators along with the papers of recently married couples (superbly played by Judge Domke) to turn upside down on their own theme by a female predator (Amanda Peet). Under the satirical cash surface of a romantic comedy far more satisfying than most studio products of sugar.
