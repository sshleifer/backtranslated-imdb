Reunion Group is a very comedy gem. It's 1982 and the 1972 class of Lizzie Borden returns high for having 10 years reunion, among them the usual stereotypes, the couple, babe, the fat guy & nerd etc., but the alumni for a bumpy night, one of Their classmates are Walter Baloer, the classroom vision that was subject to a comedy tour by the rest of the class on graduation night and since then was in a mental home, Walter Night and now plans to deal with humiliation, ,,, <br/> <br /> Despite the black site, this is really just an excuse for lots of very funny gaps & set pieces. To say too much more would loot the movie, but if you enjoyed the nude gun & airline movie you'll love this, & what other movie offers a comedy music by Chuck Berry? A great comedy that deserves a wider audience.
