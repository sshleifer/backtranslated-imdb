This is one of those unfortunate films that have suffered even more sad, unfortunate death in the box office. I saw this film in a local art cinema, in revival form, shortly after it was tanks in mainstream movies. It certainly deserves to be approached a second time (or even a third). Sandra B. takes her to the limit by saying words & take on some well-known songs in this piece (her version of Hank William 'I'm so lonely I could cry' could easily move you to the water ever). Perhaps one day, the audience will be ready to take this movie a bit more seriously (but not without some well-placed laughs, too). The movie moves at an animated pace (thanks to some nice corrections), so some viewers will not find it stingy & boring. Perhaps a revival is just down the pipe.
