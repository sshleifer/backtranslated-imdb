"Thieves and Liars" present us with a very naturalized deposition of levels of corruption affecting several Puerto Rican and forced them to make difficult if not impossible to choose from their lives and their loved ones. Throw is excellent, considering that some non-professional actors; an excellent choice that increases the level of reality in the movie. The photography pushed the story without intrusion, as it should be in this type of movie. Scripts captures the idiosyncrasies and attitudes of "Boricuas" in a very deep way. Sometimes it feels like you're watching a documentary! Watching this movie you feel as if you were in the corner of the real Puerto Rican society and the invisible stand watching it was implored. I loved it!
