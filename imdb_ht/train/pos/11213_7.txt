This second film is just as interesting as the previous one except that there is no suspense. We know what it will do and what will happen before it is even hinted on the screen. Then the fun comes only by the way the various tricks occur with the succession of them. We know there will be dynamite in the car, that it will lose a wheel, which the car will have an accident, just talk about the car. And that's what's happening. Now the details and features are for you to discover them in the movie. For it can be backed up by some mute women is obvious and has come but we know that it has already been seen in it and that it knows it is dragged into a trap. Now how is it going to get out of it? That's what you have to discover in yourself. And do not worry it will get the main trafficker but how is another story. A speed boat does not match our busy beaver on the river. We also know when it will be injured. They did not know that the bullet-proof jackets were in those days. He really recently discovered that some GIs did not have the kind of equipment in Iraq. But what is the meaning of such a movie? This stresses the hunting of the traffickers and blind that does not see that it is the ban that creates the problem. But the film is a constant and perfect illustration that has no value that forever can stand in the path of moral crusade against the forces of evil. Why not just legalize these goods so they can be properly observed and under surveillance? When something is not illegal or pushed out in the way it is all the less fun to use, make them. It is the prohibition or restriction that is attractive. <br /> <br /> Dr. Jacques COULARDEAU, University of Paris Dauphine, University of Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University of Versailles Saint Quentin in Yvelines
