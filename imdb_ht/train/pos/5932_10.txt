Best Stephen King film along with IT, though this one is more fun than scary. <br /> <br /> One to throw with Alice Alice and Brian Krause with a fun comedy from King himself; <br /> <br /> - quite annoying horror in an entertainment scenario; <br /> -Good use of music, Santo & Johnny's "Sleepwalk" in particular; <br /> <br /> -like characters in a typical royal setting: among nowhere village; <br /> <br /> -lots of humor. You can not really get the right crisis here because it's too much fun with the head; <br /> -wow, but really beautiful makeup effects like they do not do anymore! <br /> A 4.5 Rating: I do not get it really. When was the last time a horror movie was as much fun as this one?
