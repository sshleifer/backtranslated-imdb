As far as I know the real guy that the main actor is playing to see his performance and said he was an exceptional painter, I would agree with him. This is a fantastic movie about a good gift boy / person with a special body parts to help him. Oscar and BAFTA win, and Golden Globe nominated Daniel Day-Lewis play Christy Browna to cripple man with cerebral palsy that spends most of his life on the floor, in a wheelchair and brings to his family. He has a special left foot though, he can write with it, paint with it and keep things with it. He learns to speak later in the movie, it's very good for a guy like him. Also start Oscar winning one Oscar 2 win, and Golden Globe nominated Brenda Fricker as Ms. Brown and BAFTA have Ray McAnally as Mr. Brown. He was nominated by Oscars for Best Director for Jim Sheridan, Best Writing, Screenplay-based material from another medium and best photo, has been nominated for BAFTAs for Best Movie, Best Performing Arts and Best Screenplay adapt. Daniel Jou Lewis was the number 85 of the 100 Best Movie Stars, the number 20 of the 50 largest British actor, was No. 9 on Britain's finest actor, and was number 15 of the world's largest actor, and the movie was the number 28 of the 50 largest British films. Exceptional!
