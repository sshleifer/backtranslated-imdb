I liked this movie. In fact I liked being an actress in this movie. Iwas as a pregnant teenager in the second half of the movie. You can remember me more clearly in the classroom scene when the werewolf has exposed himself to film. I was the girl in front row and my hand was planting on my face in the reaction that we were watching over the film projector. In fact the doubles have taken me a few times so it's hard to miss that mistake. Fingers up to full moon high. Wish it become cable soon.
