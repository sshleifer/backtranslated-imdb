After seeing you received mail and feeling ashamed, I decided to see the original movie that inspired this one, the Shop Around the Corner. I was amazed at this movie. It's a true gem and from that moment one of my favorite movies ever. Acting is so perfect, the story is so beautiful, that if you have not seen it, I would like to encourage you to see it today. I do not mind re-doing and sometimes I like the new version more than the original one, but this time has admitted that you Got Mail is a poor adaptation of this classic. Do not miss it, go to your video store and rent the Shop Around the Corner today!
