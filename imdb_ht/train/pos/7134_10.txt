John Thaw is an excellent actor. I must admit that I was impressed by his series of roles in an old digging curmudgeon that reluctantly agreed to take in a evacuated from the streets of London (WWII time era). That being said, the movie is excellent. A very moving story with a satisfying ending. Some of the characters are a bit underdeveloped (particular school teachers), but none of them are essential to the scheme. Basically, the story is about the old man and the boy, and the movie needs little else.
