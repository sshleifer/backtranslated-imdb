Gola Rowlands plays an actress who loses his grip on reality by witnessing the death of a fan of his money. It becomes increasingly delusional from reality, and as a result of her emotional turmoil she intrudes and works as an actress. In the sense that it breaks all the rules of acting and improvises everything, still manages to engage audiences to make the film interesting (if a bit self-important) as a parallel to Cassavettes' own struggle as a moviewriter. There are many ideas to throw around, and as a result it gets a bit muddled (I always reflect the relationship between the deceased fan and Rowlands, among many other things), but the ways they are presented in the correct form make it an always interesting and think-provoking film. Would be great on a double bill and Mulholland Drive. <br /> <br />
