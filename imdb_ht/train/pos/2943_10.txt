I think this is still the best routine. Some others, like the Rock "bring the pain," and "Men are Pig" Allen's hilarious; "Damon Waynes stands last" is also funny in a tough way - but this routine does not have any errors. All the jokes are funny, and the time limit of 70 minutes is perfect. Just long enough to last 20 years. I just love how it allows the audience to be totally themselves and without restrictions. I'm a fan of classics and for a guy who watches a lot of Jim Carrey growing, watching a funny comedy is getting pretty cool. Do not put in a category with Ellen and Newhart, but something you can look if you stuff. Thank you Eddie, blessed God.
