I probably doubled my knowledge in Iran when I saw secret newsletters (2001). Now I know about four more times (I doubt I've learned a whole heck of a lot of my daughter's daughter (1991)). Offside is a superb Irish comedy budget on a group of girls (working individually) going to a decisive football match for the country's seats in the World Cup. Women are not allowed to attend football matches, so the nation's forces have been mobilized to save any women who try to get into their heads. Some (teen?) Girls try to crash the party by dressing up like boys, but they hold. The film is mostly set in this pen holder where the girls were arrested by soldiers, waiting for some over-punishment (although the girl dressed as a soldier claims that she was one insignia away from being executed !) <Br /> The movie explores the absurdity of the situation. Think that barrel women from football matches come down to it being too raunchy an experience for the fairer sex? A philosophy is unknown in the west less than 100 years ago. This mascarade comes to a head when a girl needs to go to the bathroom, so a soldier scans his quest to cover his eyes so he can not see the graffiti. The conflict is not entirely on the battle of sex: at some point some friction occurs between a rural who is rural and the urban girls. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, this film is not too esoteric culture that comedies have lost on this neighbor and cultural culture of the Great Satan. You must be in the mood for her, but no one should avoid this movie because they think they will not find it.
