This is one of my time ever to love movies and I would recommend it to anyone. On my list of favorite movies (list mental, self) are only on par with it is movies like Lord of the Rings series, Spirited Away and Fly away home. <br /> I can really relate to the main character Jess. At the beginning of the film it is a shy girl and a slightly odd background that has a lot more friends who have boys than these are girls. He really sucks you in his life. I certainly can not blame any of the protagonist's acting, or anyone else in the movie. <br /> <br /> The football was fun to look even for someone like me who has no idea about the rules. The movie is never boring. The novel is really nice and did not make me blush touooo hard! One of the things that really made it though was the Indian factor. Jess' parents are American and there are so many colorful American conventions throughout the film to provide a very interesting cultural insight as well as everything else. The Indian people are also hilarious! Essentially this is a coming of great movie about choosing the path you want and fighting for it. <br /> <br /> Feel good comedies are becoming the movie's favorite film movie genre. They're funny, they're refreshing and make you feel good! ^ _ ~
