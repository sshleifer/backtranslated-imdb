This is an animated movie CGI based on a French 2D animated series. The series runs briefly on Cartoon Network, but its run was so short that its inclusion as one of the potential Oscar prospects for best animated film for this year leaves most people I know will be "Huh?" This is the story of Lian-Chu, heart heart muscle, and Gwizdo, the brain in the operation, who along with Hector Fire farting the dragon, it is more like a dog. Traveling the world offers services as dragon hunters but never getting paid. In their life come Zoe, the fairy tale loves the niece of a king who will be blind. It looks like the world has been devoured by a huge monster and the king's rider is sent out never back or if the return to come back like ashes. In desperation the King hired dragons hunters to stop the World Eaters. Zoe of course tags along ... <br /> <br /> What can I say to others then why this movie is hidden under a rock? This is a really good little movie that is completely off the radar except as easy Oscar contender. It's a very well-designed, fantastic movie (the world it takes to have floating grounds and crazy animals) which constantly went to my "Wow" in it. The English voice cast and Forrest Whitaker as Lian-Chu (one of the best vocal performances I've ever heard) and Rob Paulson as Gwizdo (think Steve Bucsemi) is the first percentage. Equally large is the script that does not speak down to its audience, using some real expressions not normally heard in animated films (by Disney or Pixar). It all really well done. <br /> <br /> Is it perfect? No, some of the bits go over too long, but at the same time it is humorous fun. <br /> <br /> If you get the chance to see it. One of the best animated films from 2008, and will be on my surprise to my 2009 list.
