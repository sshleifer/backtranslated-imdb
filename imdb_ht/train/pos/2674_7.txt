If the redundancy of getting into the boat, on the boat, on the bus, to the bus .. is a way to waste time then you should go back to the Hollywood movie that wrapped this party up in One timeline in order to get to the money shots. and in doing so let you disconnect with the limbo of cinemas that result from not really showing the realities of life. The journey time is drawn out of sequence actually allows the frustration viewer even with 'wait-in-line' feel the characters to keep. Frustrated? yes. Vital? Indeed. Limbo in this trip is the key to 'roots' in this Turkish family. Beautiful movie with great acting. Tris, but worth it.
