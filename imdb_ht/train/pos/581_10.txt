A River Run Through It's one of those movies that deserve to be seen in the theater so that the majesty of his movies can really appreciate. The act is wonderful and understated, with every gesture and smile and nodding meaning. Brad Pitt gives a radiant performance and Tom Skerrit is powerful as the father of the preacher. The movie moves like a river, you have to be willing to follow it in ebbs and sink, but it is well worth it in the end.
