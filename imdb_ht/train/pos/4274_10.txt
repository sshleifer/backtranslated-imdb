I love this film a lot, but it's a fact, that you can not understand it, unless you are from the former Yugoslavia. Most of the actors are now dead and so were the best actors of former Yugoslavia. I appreciate that this film is now on Divx and I can have it in my collection. Macedonia. Serbia. Montenegro. Bosnia and Herzegovina. Croatia. Slovenia. <br /> All these were ancient Yugoslavia, a skin dissolved in the Balcan nations. It could be a dream country, if Slobodan Milosevic, Franjo Tudjman and other nationalists would not poison the nation and the sick people.
