Farrah Fawcett has spent the best part of her post-Angel career in our confused, with an occasional performance performance performance that sandwiched between her Playboy Playboy and Letterman escapes. But when it comes down to it, there is no deny that this girl can act. Far from a tale of epic proportions, this well-made TV-movie is gentle, quiet and occasionally moving. Fawcett plays the black sheep lamb to his home only to find that he missed the last days of his mother's life as well as the funeral, much of the grief of his sister more sturdy and presumably more sensitive. Brad Johnson plays the Love Interest, with a unfamiliar story with all the typical elements of television drama - but then there's always that confusion Farrah to look, and it does, indeed, remains eminently observable. (And yes, I admit it, I had that poster post on my wall road back). Either Hope gets three and a half stars (out of five) on the Corkymeter. Bosley would be proud.
