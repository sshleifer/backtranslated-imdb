It's difficult to head this movie in many ways. All jobs really well here; Distribution, acting, scripting, and cinematography are all first-rate. For the movie, it's a moving, violent story of love and redemption. For the film critic, there are many sharp techniques and merit techniques. Some tactical blunders, and as they discussed the charts, the end lack realism if one is solid formal and angle training agent CIA. However, I took the end as being more moved due to the fact that rather than pursuing the CIA's pragmatic approach, Kreasy basically praised her soul in the ultimate without regard to the consequences. Like Jesus, Kreas becomes overwhelmed in sacrifice, if it actually makes sense to pragmatic or not. In any case, I appreciate the fact that Kreasy dispenses with conventional bourgeois morality and just the one-off mock one by one of his methodical requirements for justice, which actually results in redemption both for himself and the innocent. <br /> In any case, this movie is very worth seeing if you're at all attracted the genre. An excellent band, great writing, unprecedented designs, and solid performances across the board makes this a top-100 movie (or better) movie.
