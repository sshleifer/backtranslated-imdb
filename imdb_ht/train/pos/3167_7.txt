This is one of those films that explores the culture of Eastern culture in Western culture. <br /> <br /> Love over Tokyo time is a sad movie about the inability of opposites to attract due to major cultural differences. Ken, rock n'roll fan, married Kyoto, a Japanese girl, so she can stay in the US when her visa expires. The marriage is only expected to be temporary, that is, until Kyoto continues to legal status. But Ken, who seems to be losing in every relationship, takes a sympathy to Kyoto and tries very hard to do things work out. This, despite his friends demanding that Kyoto is dumping and getting rid of all the girl's engagements are bad for our stone roll except excepting some singing songs about the broken hearts and all of this. <br /> But Kyoto comes from a traditional Japanese breakthrough, and does not expect to marry Ken ever this time. Not only that, he is homesick and wants to return to Japan. It's sad at that this is finally someone Ken thinks he can love and be with all of this, except one time he thinks he's got someone to feel that way over, the girl is not waiting to stay long ago. It's not that he does not like Ken, it's just that he's used in a whole way 'of life. She says, "I can not tell her how I feel English, and Ken can not tell me how she feels in Japanese." It is a love love story rather sad and a 80s killer techno band music. <br /> I pick up love over Tokyo Time because she reminds me of one of my favorite 80s movie, Tokyo Pop. And, for those of you who love Loving on Tokyo time, check out Tokyo Pop (a New York singer goes to Japan and joins a Japanese American band), except it's a movie and a happy ending. <br /> <br /> <br />
