Not a bad martial movie. Fighting scenes were good. Michel Qissi did a good job directing his first film without Van Damme. History has worked without language and excessive blood. Screenwriter Jeanette Francessca has a good line of history that works. It would be great to see something else in it's the same way. She loves the art and she has strong prominent women. It was definitely worth seeing. I recommend the movie to all drama and martial arts lovers.
