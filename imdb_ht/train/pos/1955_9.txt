Just kind of movie I like. There are some very good British actors as well as the salt and salt Sharon Stone. Catherine Tramell (Stone) masterfully mastered a well-educated group of people, playing on their weaknesses in collecting experiences to write a mystery book of murder. She plays the female psychopath quite well while using her sex appeal to convincingly show what can be considered one of the ultimate Black Voices. Trams are used in black places in society and freely participate in sadomasochistic arrows in 'never visiting after dark' side of town. From the beginning, there is nothing short of a rating R here from the dialog alone. Stone could also be described as a sort of female Hannibal Lecter, a femme fatally without the meal plan.
