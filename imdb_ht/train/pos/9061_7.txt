I really liked the movie. I remember reading it several times as a kid and was happy to see a movie made on the book. <br /> I was kid-sitting for a boy and a girl, aged 11 and 8 and they talked to the girl in watching the movie. But happily, in the end, he was happy that he saw it and even said he wanted to buy it on DVD as soon as it came out. <br /> There are some great laugh-out-loud moments and the movie did not like "gross" as I hope it would ... that it was pretty high up on the gross-o-master ... <br /> <br /> The only thing I can not figure out was that they had the "dilly" line of what was done by Woody in reference to his private party ... that I was the moment only shooter (and you could hear the adult audience at the moment of the film in the movie) ... I have no signs why these are put in the movie; He added nothing to the current movie except for that shock / gasp factor ... other than that, a very good movie. Nice to see the "Pepsi" girl all grown up.
