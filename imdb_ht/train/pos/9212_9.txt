Yesterday, I went alone in the cinema, because here in Mexico, most of the films from other countries are part of what's called "alternativa camera" (alternative camera). But after I saw this film, I realized that not all foreign films are alternative. Abort, this is a good example. But I said that I enjoyed this movie so much .. I was happy this movie is a teaspoon of hope in those days. And the main lesson for me .. is that at the end of the day ... the love is the main force behind us. This is a good option to see a good movie of Spanish ... and I must mention the good music .. especially the main song of the movie .. What says that you would like the voice ... Excellent song ! !!
