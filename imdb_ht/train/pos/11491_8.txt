Unborn is a very, very different movie. James Karen & Brooke Adams are in the movie and do well. This film is built solidly and keeps you going. Even though I think you must be a horror fan to watch this because of the scenes with the plot. There is only one short scene sex with no stripping that might have been left out and in some people this scene can disappoint someone like me in the movie and think that something breaks a good movie but that's it's time it happened. There is a scene where Adams characters go dark and kill a cat, but you can say it is not real. The music is very different, but very good. Unborn in my opinion is a really creepy movie that's superbly unpredictable and that's quite strange! I recommend all the horror fans of this movie!
