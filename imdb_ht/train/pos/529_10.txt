This is one of Hollywood's most negligible water ever produced. - A British WWII teenager who has aircraft is about to crash, has a radio contact with a young American woman who is comfortably brave the pilot, knowing that in minutes he will die. For some reason those who should certainly die dies away from the junk and eventually learn that he's meant to report in the sky. When a messenger sent the pilot to accompany him to heaven, the man refused and demanded to be "his day in court" to discuss his case. The man argues that his situation had changed during the final moments of his earthly life, which he fell in love with and became a different person, someone who deserves a chance to live on. <br /> The "heavenly court" is a fun movie theater! The "jury peers" are a definite record. The story, as fantastic as it seems, is a one engaged and will keep you spellbound for the time almost 2 hours time. The final scene is simply beautiful and will require a "Kleenex" treatment for most viewers. This movie is in my favorite ever 10, it has my highest recommendation!
