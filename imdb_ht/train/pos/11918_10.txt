"The Angels of the Outfield" was originally a 1951 film by Ted Turner; Disney remakes it in 1994, this time, using the California Angels (now the Angels Angels Los Angeles) as the team (Disney used this property with the fantastic Anaheim Team's fantastic team; also, yo, huh ?????). <br /> This movie was about a couple of orphans who wanted a family. A man promised the boys a family, only if the Angels won the basket. So he called God a night on that. The boy who prayed could see the coming help on the road (and ONLY the boy's boyfriend); for example, when the first angel went down, a player hit a ball so hard not only did the broken stitch, so did the ball !!!!! For many of the Star-Star Star in 1994, the Angels were at the top of the AL West (in which my home team Rangers are one and still). However, they lost a game because the boy was in court instead of the White Sox / Angels game (there was no Central Division of Baseball back then, hence Chicago was in the West), and no no angels were there to help. So they created a new rule: no angel can help in championship games. But wait! In the final championship game, the Angels won !!!!! It was a miracle indeed! <br /> What I like about this movie: This is a good movie. I mean, I pray every night for the past few years asking for help for school and stuff; look at me now! My job was good !!!!! So for one, it shows that if you believe God can send his angels down to your help with any problems that you can have in life. And second, this is a family baseball movie, which is always interesting. This is an old Disney movie, too; I saw this just recently in the New Disney Channel (blech !!!!!). <br /> <br /> "Angels of the Outfield" will change your life forever once you've seen it !!!! ! <br /> <br /> 10/10
