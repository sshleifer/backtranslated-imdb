When I started watching the show I said "Oh, no! It's as corny as Elfen Lied and not even bloody!". And indeed, the setup is almost identical, and a young boy living in a big house all alone, then suddenly gets involved in a fantastic adventure while sexy young girl comes live with him. is where the resemblance is suspended. Love's love is almost as subtle and intense as one of Inuiyasha, while their childhood remarks and behaviors are very few. The magic setup is a reindeer, because it's about seven people, seven servants, fighting for the Grail of God, all the domestics being a famous person, half of all the masters came from the same school, the settlement engagements, etc. However, it soon dims and disappears from the beauty of the cartoon and the script. <br /> I actually watch all 24 episodes in one day and, without comparing it with anime that I loved more, but being different, I must say I was very happy.
