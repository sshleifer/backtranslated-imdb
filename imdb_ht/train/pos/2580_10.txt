I say the principle of domino is an enormously underappreciated film.anyone that takes time to investigate our contemporary history of conspiracy, jfk, rfk, mlk, g.wallace and in fact many others can only draw the conclusion that the author In the principle dominoes really knew what he was talking on.roy tucker might lee Harvey oswald or james earl ray or sirhan sirhan or arthur breve maybe even John Hinkley or timothy mcveigh.to mentioned a few scenario scenarios that included spyware , big business and political assault is not really a fiction, but a threatening part of our history is our valuable, but the domino principle is more real than fantasy.if this causes a little loss of sleep, maybe it should take my word for it, investigate ourselves.
