This is a little little and little sad story of cultural differences. Kyoko is a beautiful Japanese woman who runs to California to escape from a failed relationship in Japan. Ken is a Japanese American manual worker and aspiration of stone and red limestone but small concrete offers a potential partner. Kyoko "married" Ken in order to be able to stay forever in the US, with the understanding that although they will live together until it becomes a "green card" the wedding will be in the not only. It soon develops that the parties are not about the same wavelength - or maybe in the same "time zone", hence the title of the movie. As an immigration lawyer I saw such "arrangement" take on a life of their own, so I was happy to see how the creator develops the dramatic possibilities of this situation.
