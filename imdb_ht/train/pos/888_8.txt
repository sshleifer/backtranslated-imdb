One of the best kung fu movies, but not quite as impeccable as I was hoping to give the glowing reviews. The movie starts out quite well, and the jokes have been visual enough to translate the language barrier (which is rarer than you would think for that time), and make the sequences of non-fictitious dialogues (for a Kung Fu movie, this is a great compliment). Unlike other Chinese action movies, which were always pieces of time or (in the wake of Jackie Chan's police history) drama drama, pedicab drivers gave us a look at contemporary rural China. Unfortunately, in the last 1/3 of the film he took a mosaic of black melodrama tragedy that I thought was necessary. <br /> <br /> The action is in general good, featuring a duel between Sammo and 1/2 of Shaw Brothers' only 2 stars, Kar-Leung Lau and then a fight to the end and the higher guy who always plays jet It's bad guy. There are only 20 minutes of combat here, which is standard, but what annoys me is evident in speed up of the camera boards. I find that they have half film speeds to avoid hurting each other, but there are lists edits and then there's this. It really takes away the battles when it's obvious that the foot was messed with. <br /> <br /> That said, if you love kung fu movies, my opinion here will not distract you, and if you do not, you just wasted 2 minutes in your life reading this.
