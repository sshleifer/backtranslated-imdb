I suppose I still feel that Hotel du Nord was studio-tied, the movement of those cars and cameras were just too easy to list and the scene was being filmed aside. But there is no problem - it's still a lot to mix beautiful compositions from Marcel Carne. The plot seems somewhat corky at times, as if making it up as they went along, but because it is unpredictable to keep the attention at the bitter end. Money shots when 2 lovers are lonely in the rooms saddled with some rather than treatment, but it's all so nice to fall into any unanimity that can be accepted. Are these 2 young people's sympathies in a pre-war cancer in France or moisturizers simply? Suicide packets are common; if the suicide is young and healthy and their lives before they untrammeled you would think anything else than they were just foolish? <br /> <br /> Arletty played part of prostitutes well - she kept that zip on her dress up in anyway! I've only seen a few films and works - it's the most impressive invention as pimp in HDN - my problem is fundamentally: every time I see her face I think of Sonnie Hale's evergreen! Remarkably atmospheric, well-acting and movie photos and much more than having a few look to find it all in place. Annabella and Aumont made an exceptionally beautiful couple; Francois (Heurtebise) Perier in his 2 films had a small entertaining party as a gay man. Everything in all: wonderful.
