This movie has moved me beyond comprehension, it is and will remain my favorite movie of all time, especially because it has almost all emotions all rolled in its 157 minutes. Which is the most difficult part of my taking is that every time I want to hear the amazing music and songs in the movie, I have to put it in my DVD player, so I asked if anywhere anywhere knows which song The songs in the movie and where they can get, as I watched everywhere I can think occasionally over the past 5 years. Let my favorite movie be when the lawyer says "But your own words require direct confrontation, is not that a direct call for violence?" Biko responds: "Well you and I are in confrontation right now, but I do not see violence!" <br /> <br /> CRAIG ROBERTSON Fife, Scotland
