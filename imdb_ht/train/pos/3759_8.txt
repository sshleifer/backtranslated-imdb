Two years later ... Bill (Alex Winter) and Ted (Keanu Reeves) will come near rock stars in the future but still need more work in the instruments. In the future, Bill & Ted are in the popular public story, but then an evil man (Joss Ackland) is set to kill Bill & Ted by sending Cyborg look-like to destroy them. Siborg is sent to present past and actually kill Bill's real and Ted. Now Both men are spirits and they have to travel to heaven and hell to save themselves and their futures. <br /> <br /> Directed by Peter Hewitt (Tom and Huck, their borrowers) made a smart end to the effects of visual effects. Much more funny and fun than the original. William Sadler (Shawshank the redemption) steals the show as the Grim Reaper. DVD has a good Widescreen anamorphic (1.85: 1) transferred to a fine-Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. DVD has the theater trailer and a fun behind the featurette scene. The end of this was a Box Office hit as the original, but it is also (Believe it or not), one of the best suits ever made (depending on your point of view). George Carlin dared his role in the original shortly. Pam Grier also appears in a bit role. It is an enjoyable fantasy comedy. (**** / *****).
