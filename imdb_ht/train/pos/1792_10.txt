I had the pleasure of watching this beautiful movie last night, with the wonderful addition to a question and answer session with the director following the look. I suspect that the first commenter never lost a parent or someone very close to death. I had so many losses, and this movie talked to me. One of the biggest themes is how we do not deal with questions / issues / stories with our loved ones until it's too late - they're too incapable or dead before what's happening. Talk to your loved ones, listen to and record their stories, tell your loved ones, resolve differences. I liked the message that there is no mistake. I love painting the director in the relationship of the two daughters - as one of six brothers and sisters, it's clear to me he understands how complex these relationships. His story as a cinematographer also comes in loud and clear - what a beautiful movie! The casting is exceptional - a movie must not be missed!
