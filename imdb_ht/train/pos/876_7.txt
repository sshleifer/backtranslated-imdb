A super, strange movie from Audiard, My mouth is a pulpy, lonely-hearted thriller. It's perfect for the graceful grizled charisma of Vincent Cassel and features a wonderful performance that comes from Emanuelle Devos. Devos is a recurring feature of Audiard in the same way that KAIRIN Viard pops up for Jean-Pierre Jeunet: unconventionally beautiful (he is referring to everyone as unpleasant in this movie), versatile and able to be a subordinate profile. <br /> <br /> This is almost the definition of her role as Carla, a dog in office set-up, teens by her colleagues exploiting her deafness. But he finds an Ami d'exploitation, if you like the former Cassel Paul. Each explains the other original talent (lip and lip) to fight in their respective situations and form a romantic romantic raccoon. Devos / Audiard manages Carla's cow and his assistant, warming inner and secret world, stylish flair. In this film (2001) Audiard is already clearly in control of his handling of tension action, and investing his frame with a truly haze experience that will become the big hit - A prophet - in nine years later. 7/10
