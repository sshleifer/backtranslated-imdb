First I'd like to say how great this is. It is surprising and sometimes shocking. And to say at least in my 11 year old and this is my favorite movie, I can definitely stand a boring movie, but this is anything but boring. It's like a trip to humanity. His strong realistic displays over this monumental masterpiece. It's a heart attack in two downs and outers (voice and Hoffman) that build a mutual friendship. Joe Buck (VOIGHT) A Texan naive label comes to New York to make it rich by entertaining women. Soon she meets Rizzo Ritzzo Rico (HOFFMAN), who is a poor man barely able to pay rent. Ratso gets Joe's manager but soon both men can not get Joe a job that results in stealing foods. As they try and survive on the streets of New York we realize how difficult it is. They can not find Joe a girl until they meet a lady at a party. Joe makes some money and soon Joe takes Ratso over to Ratso's dream spot, Florida. The final five minutes of heart breaks some of the greatest moments in the movie. From MIDNIGHT COWBOY we get a style of disturbances and sometimes disturbing urban life.
