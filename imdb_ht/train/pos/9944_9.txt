Sure, the scheme is not Oldboy. It seems only "great" movies these days are amazingly shocking or high budget / hyped in some ways. <br /> <br /> Kick Spin is a drama / comedy about a group of people who decide to pour their hearts into tae kwon do. Whatever you expect from this movie, you're guaranteed to feel moved to work, pain, and expectations that the characters force themselves to experiment. Even though comedy at times, many moments and characters are quite well-done: there's the old guard character who takes things too badly, the Hoodlum turns good-guy who just wants a second chance of life, the substandard- The substitute would be happy if he just won once in his life, and many other characters balanced with their own problems - but most importantly, their own hopes and dreams. While the plot and the goals of the movie are simple, the aspects of the movie simply emphasize the development of their characters as they overcome personal and personal interpersonal struggles. <br /> In short, this movie will let you feel fresh, determined, and satisfied.
