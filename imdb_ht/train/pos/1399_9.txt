This is one of the deep episodes in that the plot really seemed like an excuse just to have fun. But I appreciate this light-hearted approach and this is truly one of the best episodes to see on a purely fun level. Think about it - crew members are encountering white rabbits and Alice from Wonderland, a tiger Bengal, a samurai warrior, a knight on horseback that kills McCoy, and a host of other rare murder events that just makes no sense all until the very end. Despite all the danger, you just can not take everything very seriously - it's just too fun and the whole episode looks very surreal. So, on a non-aesthetic level, it's great stuff.
