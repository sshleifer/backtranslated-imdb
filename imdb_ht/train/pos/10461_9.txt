Cherish's vow is a wonderful movie. It is based on a novel in the same title, which was equally good, though different from the movie. Really make you think about how you would respond if you were in the shoes of the characters. Recommended for anyone who has ever loved a parent, spouse, or family member - in other words, everyone! Even if the production is not quite Hollywood quality - there is no great special effect - always, the values ​​and ideals describe more than make up for it. And the cast made a great job of capturing emotional connections between family members and the devastation that occurred when one of them became sick. <br /> You do not want to miss this!
