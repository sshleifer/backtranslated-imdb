My mother took me this movie as a kid and I long saw it every year as I did my other Christmas favorites. What do I remember most was the silly Devil and Santa looking at his telescope. I wait with the look of T.V. Guide each year afterwards to see when it's shown. I would usually get it playing on a Saturday afternoon. I only found the movie in English that took something special away from the movie and was eager to get a copy of it in Spanish. I hold this beloved movie in my heart and never suffer from nightmares as others might suggest. Yes, it's a different film about Santa Claus and that's what makes it special and unique. I can not wait to get a copy of this movie and watch it with my kids as I explain to them my favorite parts and memories !!
