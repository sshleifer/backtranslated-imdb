This movie is so beautiful, it's hard to find words to describe it. This is the only time I can not decide which was the best, book or movie. <br /> <br /> Whoopi Goldberg is awesome, and Oprah Winfrey, like a good actress, could be funny, happy and miserable all at the same time. All along the film was well directed by Steven Speilberg, and should not pass them. 9/10
