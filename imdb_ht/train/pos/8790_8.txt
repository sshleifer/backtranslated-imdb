Movie Hilarious. I saw this movie in 2002 Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras Film Festival, and laughed from start to finish. The act was subtle but very funny. I'm not entirely certain about the "real world" influence, we do not find that here, but the movie keeps up without the understanding of showing. Heather B steals every scene he looks at, most notably when he does not read the co-star of the essay. Very recommended. I would like to see this release on Video / DVD some time in the future.
