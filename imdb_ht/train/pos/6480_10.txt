This is by far the best war document ever done. From the very start of the first episode when Sir Laurence Olivier describes the terrible events of the Oradour-Sur-Glane 'Day of Soldiers' coming. On the final days of the war when the mushroom clouds appeared on Japan, I never missed a second in this classic series and I remember it well though it was tested back in 1974. Each and every aspect of this tragedy was covered in detail. This whole series should be mandatory to look for many of the world's children as possible for the tragedy of the Second World War by repeating and prejudiced, hatred, greed and intolerance not confused with patriotism or religious zeal.
