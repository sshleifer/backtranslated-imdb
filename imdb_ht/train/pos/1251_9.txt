This documentary explores a story covering the latest Pilger's "Freedom Time" book, which was released in 2006. It reveals the shocking expulsion of the native of Diego Garcia, one of the Chagos Islands in the Indian Ocean. /> The islands are technically British citizens, as Diego Garcia is a British colony, much like Mauritius, the nearby island where the natives were captured, used to be. But the British government ignored their return to their country, as the island is now a military base for the U.S. army, which has been used as a basis for the bombing in Iraq and Afghanistan. As usual, the Pilger's protection is shocking, especially as it documents the treatment and the current living conditions of the islands survive. Interviewing her all round is excellent, and her bend to a Parliament representative where she uses her own Government information to comb her down, ranks as one of her best. <br /> <br /> Pilger also uses dramatic recommendations to stack a series of recently released documents that completely grow British plots to evict their native. The tissue of this foot and the interviews, with the music of the island, really increases the impact of the movie. <br /> It is not easy to watch, but "stealing a nation" is John Pilger at its best. Recommended.
