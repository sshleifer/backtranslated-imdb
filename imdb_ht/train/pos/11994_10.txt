As for so much about here I can not help but praise the cast and Crew who have developed Talespin and others have been doing to all my children, as everyone who has commented here has well enjoyed the Quality of not only The animation but the quality of the story lines and the characters. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />! , It is obviously the greatest work of engineering to be produced at Disney's date, when Disney "pulled" it out of the air to realize what they did and I'm sure the souls were tortured by sorry ever since. br> <br /> I'll take a moment to explain, From the first who is ducktales to the last that I think Darkwing Duck, Disney was plagued with failure due to political pickers and took a quantum growth back since, They prefer quantities of quality now not to mention the full room of the monkey for the story, I could not have my kids watching the numbing ideas "cartoons" they now throw in the pairs that they all turned to Homer Simpson must have some time in the future and 50% of the blame would be on me to allow them to watch it, I could not let that happen, that's why I have ALL shows them from the late 80's in the middle of the 90s on a Harddrive so one day My children can not be corrupted by the "crap of drawing" of today and groomed the last piece of childhood I have and hold and I must have that all Talespin. <br /> <br /> My Talespin is without a doubt the best ever legitimate animation in the world on account of its depth, charm, wit, compassion, emotions and lack of quality quality and story lines In what many have today, you see any of the content in saying "Ed, Edd and Eddie or anything else you can think of?" Garbage products today may seem like some 3 year old Hyroglyph describing a Picasso. <br /> <br /> The next time You watch an episode and Talespin; take a look at the woodgrain on any wooden objects or buildings like Higher for Hire and Saliva on the Quality of Cunning with the effort put in this animation, the same firing origins are made as if they would use them again and again, the buildings look true in the Deco Art movement that was popular in the long-standing time, even the cars are True to life, OK not all of the episodes were fantastic in animation but the lower grade scenes were covered up by the superior scenes for every word unlike all it seems it all from the end of the episode and You would probably never even notice at all unless you've concentrated and have a careful attention. <br /> Something I love this is what I like to call "The deliberate mistakes" or "Intent errors" in every episode and some have two, For example in the deep sheepskin where Rebbecca says "You're up to a Baloo "and Baloo responded," Who, I!, I'm as innocent as a schoolboy "take a look at Rebbecca's eyes, I've got 'checking the rest of the Baloopers but just keeping an eye out next time. <br /> <br /> Everyone elses the comments are bang over with 100% correct, I have nothing else to add that others have not said already over here, Disney, SEARCH and smell the coffee, You have been asleep for more than a decade, Stop garbage products and bring back Quality of Animations and Stop "Cartoons" products, We've seen the evidence of what you can do and we want it back as quickly as possible.
