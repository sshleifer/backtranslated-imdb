This movie was just brilliant, casting, landscape scenery, story, direction, everyone really suited the part they played, and you might just imagine being there, Robert Redford is an amazing actor and now the same thing also the director of Norman's father was from the same Scottish island as myself, so I liked the fact that there was a real connection to this movie, the spooky remarks of the movie were great, it was just brilliant, so much that I bought the movie as soon as it was released for retail and would recommend it to everyone to watch, and the fly-fishing was amazing, really called the end it was so much sad and you know what to say if you cry in a movie it must have been good, and this definitely was, also congratulations to the two little boys who played the part of Norman and Paul were just brilliant, kids often let out of the list praises I think, because the stars that play them all grow up as a great profile for the entire movie, but these acne kids And should they praise for what they have done, do not you think? The whole story was so beautiful because it was true and was a life after all that was shared with us all.
