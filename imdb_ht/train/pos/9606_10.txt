This was the best movie I've ever seen on Bulimia. It hit the exact spot in what Bulimia is really about and how it's not always about being thin and diets. It shows how people with Bulimia tend to think about things like their outlook on life, friends and themselves. The best line and the show shows really that the problem with Bulimia is, is when Animal says, "It's not about you!" This line really showed much about the character and others who had the same problem. It has shown that people with Bulimia do not have this problem because of anything that has to do with anyone else. It has to do with them and only. It shows that it's time to talk about the person and the problem instead of putting attention to all over themselves. She has shown that Beth needs to call for attention at this time and she needs her mother's attention at that time the most.
