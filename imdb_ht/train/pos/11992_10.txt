Ever since I remember, I liked aircraft and flying. I am currently in college with the private pilot license and become a commercial. I can never remember why I was so obsessed with the subject until I came across my old tap Tap Spin tape in my basement home and hit me, this was it. My parents bought all the single tapes and this was the only show I would look like a kid. I had the theme to memorize as I grew up and I can always re-quote it today. It's absolutely amazing and I plan to buy the DVD soon! It's really good for kids and adults and is absolutely timeless. I can not get enough of this show.
