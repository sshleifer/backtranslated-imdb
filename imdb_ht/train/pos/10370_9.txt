There are some movies that seem to be done before we're ready for them. As I watched this movie, did in 1988, in 1999, I thought I was watching O.J. Simpson debate (although I have very different views on innocent people in each situation). The Australian news agency, if this film should believe, devouring an infantid and possible truths could be left as a reflection. He was scared to see the scenes of invading media, swarming media, against ridiculous in half-truths and lies and debate on the basis assumed in the case by people at all levels of society. The media's deposition as indifferent and uncomprehending of the technical information in the case. I want more to do in the issue of religious prejudice in the case (the defendant is seven days Adventists). <br /> <br /> Today these circuses have become common, but that makes the lesson more important. /> <br /> Streep is excellent as usual, and this is the best I've ever seen Sam Neill. Aussie accents are found a bit thick at times, but not incomprehensible.
