Soylent Green is a classic. I was waiting for someone to do it. They seem to rename the classic Sci-Fi these days (that's why war in the worlds) and I hope some directors / producers will re-make Soylent Green. With computer animation today and technology, it would have the potential to be a great picture. Anti-Utopian films can not be far-fetched. The human race races like roaches that have no influence outside of it. We, as individuals, have the option to put the kibosh on the production of smaller species if they get out of hand, but there is nothing to control human breeding except for ourselves. Despite all the diseases, warfare, abortion, birth control, etc. human race is still multiplied as bacteria in a crushed dish. Classical Malthusian economy states that any species, including people, will multiply beyond the means of subsistence. 6 billion and growing .... that's obscene.
