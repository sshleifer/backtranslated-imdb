At first I was not sure that I wanted to watch this movie when it came to my guide so I watched it on IMDb and thought the cover looked cool cool so i thought i would give it a try Waiting for a movie like Elephant. <br /> <br /> Once I got the past the fact that I supposed to influencing the character Alicia was playing excellent by Okipe Phillips, I realized what a great job this movie was doing towards setting up the relationship between Alicia and Deanna . Alicia is so mean Deanna played by Erika Christensen almost throughout the movie but we eventually find that despite being opposed to the polar there is only one thing in common as being present in the shooting. They share loneliness and how much they reveal as the movie progresses. <br /> I've just got to say how much I loved this movie and was happy to see all the positive reviews about it. I could not even get across Elephant because it just seemed to be exploiting the Columbine Tragedy. This movie on the other hand was compelling and realistic. Busy Phillips Acting is OFF CHAIN ​​!!! That's a good thing and I would like to see her progress in some mature roles.
