I keep that movie late at night on cable, and I was pleasantly surprised. I can only imagine why this film was not best known, because the substance is very disturbing. But if you can handle the sexual abuse, it's a well-acting movie, movies and very interesting. Both Richard Gere and Claire Daines are very good at it. And although the subject is not for the faint of heart, the film does not go out of its way to be brutally either (like 8mm for example). <br /> I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys a series of assassins and movie types of suspense.
