Can anyone know where or where can I get a copy of this movie? !! I've been searching for too long a helping hand! Back in 1997 my girlfriends and I was extra on this Long Island based movie, and we actually never got to see it. :( <br /> I was hoping I could get a copy somehow I can finally check it out and share it with the girls! Is anyone outside who knows where to get a copy So, can I stop driving myself crazy? (Also, it does not matter if it's in VHS format, I'm still in the mirror age myself.) If you, or anyone you know, have a copy of this The Movie Please help, I want to pay for a good copy of it!
