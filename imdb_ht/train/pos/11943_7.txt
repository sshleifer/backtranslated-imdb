I'm a big fan of Woody Allen and so when I saw that this was played in the movie I could not help myself. I wanted to see how Allen would follow up with many beautiful Movie Matches and see how this is another one of his films shot at G.B. (which is unique among Allen's works) and what seems to be new muse scarlett Johanson. Scoop is lighter than MP and the humor is the most enjoyable scoop aspect. The plot turns into Johanson's character (a student journalist) who gets a tip on a warm story from the far grave. He fell in love with a suspected serial killer (Jackman) and he must decide if the truth is worth finding. Oh and all this is done with the help of a bumbling magician turning detective playing by Allen. <br /> I must say that I'm enjoying Johanson's performance but I'm a little bit bored, I could watch a three-hour movie and Johanson in all time frame and stay enchanted. She plays a ditsy, yappy, romantic bumbling that kind of a variation in a sense of the stereotypical neurosis Allen characters recorded. It adds proper body language for funny effects. Needless to say, almost anyone who sees this will find Johanson's character of lovely lust and that's a plus. <br /> <br /> Allen is Allen ... He always plays the same character as Chaplin and his Little Tramp character. Something that happened in this movie made me wonder if I will see the little neurotic hypocrisy yet however. He is not thrown into his next photo and spent more time just behind the camera as in late ... <br /> <br /> Jackman is also enjoyable as the suspect, thousands of millionaire murderers. I can not say that Jackman does nothing in particular to perform the role of it and it suits his character no less. <br /> In terms of the scheme I can not help but feel that this is cool ... In fact it feels the curse of the Jade scorpion. Johanson and Allen are more detective than anything. However I must applaud Allen on her end because she's a bit more than your typical typical Hollywood version of this movie. Instead of everything was black and white, things are painted in shades of gray. Being innocent whole innocence has nothing to do with it, nor guilty inevitable. Even though the plot seemed old woody still has a talent for a covered material. I found her alignments in her latest exciting movie ... Come to the mood, laugh and be happy. <br /> <br /> Needless to say if you enjoy Allen's work look at her. If not look something else ...
