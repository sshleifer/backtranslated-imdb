Why are the forecasts so blah for a movie that is so awesome !! Everyone should know what an excellent movie this is. It is engaging and funny from one moment, original, and well-acting. I wish the movie made itself as good as it deserves! <br /> For anyone who loves the princess bride, maze, and other really funny and original fantasy adventure, this is one of the great ones. Robert DeNiro is hysterical. Charlie Cox relay is an incredible leader. Claire Danes is fantastic as always. Michelle Pfiefer is doing well a splash with her recent show on the screen. There's also a lot of wonderful moments from minor characters ... even down to facial expressions.
