Bill and Tour Bogus travel are Bill's end with Ted's excellent adventure. Many travel passes are almost immediately after the first movie and make a similar work if it is not best to entertain the viewer. The draw is an evil person from the future trying to kill Bill and Ted using evil robots that look exactly like Bill and Ted. Once the robots kill Bill and Ted, they must compete with the dream of grimace (death) and return their lives to normal. Acting in the movie is toothache, and even thought it is a little weird at times, especially Bill and Ted's conversation, it's a great movie. The wannabe Rockets sure made another big movie. Choose this next time you in blockbuster!
