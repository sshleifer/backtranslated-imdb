I guess this movie will only work on those who were all turned off by the giant battalion of Lord of the Rings. Well, so I was. So I really love this movie. Especially I love all these superficial superheroes from LotR were so perfectly parodied hopeless. The most brilliant is the counterpart of Gandalf (the brave and wise wizard and completely humorless know-it-all): Almond, the coward and transvestite dead brain. The Sauron counterpart ("Sauraus" from East Germany, of course) is to put a bucket simply with eyes like a helmet. Aragorns change month is yet another trendy crash accident that attempts to fix his broken sword ("Ulrike" saga) and tape. And "Strunzdumm" (the countertop of Wormtong) indeed has some strong resemblance with Brad Dourif! And remember Grmpfli and Heidi ... huh-huh
