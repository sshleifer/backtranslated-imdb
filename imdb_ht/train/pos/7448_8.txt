I have not laughed a lot at a long time - although the movie has some sad moments too, especially when it changes from ultra-funny to honest and serious. Characters are very realistic most of the times, sometimes sometimes but quite credible. I'm not a fan of Jerry Springer's show - I feel sorry for the participant. This movie is rather a satire, and it's great. <br /> <br /> Too bad that all explanations have * bowed * out while this movie is revealed on public television, which takes a lot of fun out of it. I'll go to rent this movie to enjoy it all. <br /> <br />
