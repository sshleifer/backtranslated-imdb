I saw this film at a college movie festival back in the 70's - I was waiting for this movie out of video (finally it's out). Born in Brazil, so I assumed that it was why she had not made it to video anymore. I've been checking the video store for the past 15 years waiting for this exceptional movie out! It is one of my all-time favorites - but was warned, it is strange, like Werner Herzog weird - its uniqueness stems from its super-realism. The movie is based on a true incident back a few centuries ago, in pre-colonial times, when the Europeans first met the tribes of the Amazon. A white man is mistaken by a wild tribe of cannibals as their enemy, so they intend to kill him. Prior to sending him, though, they make him part of the tribes (customs). The entire movie is like watching a National Geographic documentary as it gets an accepted member of the tribes. That's it. Cosmic plotline? No. Great insight into the variety of human lives? Definitely .. <br /> Oh yeah ... be warned ... this movie has definite nudity - this is not some Hollywood flick key flake on noble savages ... this movie says she likes it (re -Read above: National Geographic, super-realism) <br /> <br />
