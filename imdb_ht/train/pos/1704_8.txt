"I moved from here to get away from this kind of stuff!" Sheriff in the small town regrets. <br /> <br /> "What happens in Chicago?" His deputy asked. <br /> Well, no, not really. The plot is that a Martian group mistakes a Halloween Rebroadcast at Orson Welles' War in their world as a counter to a real Martian invasion, and the findings they need to get in on the action! What follows is a bunch of evil that involves Martian azter attempt to conquer the city of "Big Bean, IL". Everyone concludes that the kids are really good suits, except for Sheriff's daughter and his friend, a kid in a duck suit. <br /> <br /> The martians themselves are funny, and you get the impression they have no threat to anyone but themselves very early on. It's a fun family movie.
