I always say people who "enchanted April" are an adult movie that has no cussing, no sex, and no violence. One might think about it as the "ultimate chick flick," but I bet there are one or two boys who have loved it too. Do not invite children, though. This movie is very low key. <br /> See "Enchanted April" is a very healing experience. Track the sound and gorgeous scenery, along with the gentle ladies' behavior, bring to mind the peace and beauty of a pre-Raphaelite paint. If someone thinks you really only watch a movie type, I'll slip a line I've heard once on "Live Night Saturday" and say that my two favorite movies are "Hope the Hunters" and "Anchanted April".
