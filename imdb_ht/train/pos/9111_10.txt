"Capitães de Abril" is good. The story is not a documentary about the 1974 revolution in Portugal. But he gave us an idea of ​​how he was. Fiction in the story is not of great interest, but it does not spoil the movie. The heroic actions of the Captain Salgueiro Maia are not exaggerated and the movie is also a tribute to his deeds. Captain Salgueiro Maia remains one of the greatest heroes of the 25th April Revolution. All actors are very good and even the youngest roles have played beautifully. Lisbon looks beautiful as ever. Do not miss it! I loved this movie very much.
