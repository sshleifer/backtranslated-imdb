Pushing Daisies is truly a landmark on television as an art form. All seem to pay homage to Amelie and Tim Burton, but so, in a world where fresh ideas are clearly scarce, this show will guarantee that you do not care about whether it's cool or not. It's just Brilliant. <br /> I was captivated from the start, writing in smart, direct to the backdrops and dialogs to make this show the most incredible masterpiece since the Shield and the Wire (ok not exactly good but the beauty of Pushing Daisies is that it does not have any comparison on television). <br /> <br /> Surely addictive and an absolute fun. Perhaps as one of the major tourists who are found in the tantalizing ways.
