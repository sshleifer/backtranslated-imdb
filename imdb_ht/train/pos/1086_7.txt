This movie is a little strange in that it has got a very thin plot and the movie itself is done at a very slow and leisurely speed. While this makes it very different from the average Grant movie, it's still very look and fun. It sort of like someone said "let's just follow Cary around and watch as it gets perturbed at all the little problems that come when you have a rehabilitation home." Considering what a fun actor she is in the movie with the great support she gets from Myrna Loy and Melvin Douglas, the movie works very well. While the film has very modest pretensions, it makes the most of the material. It's a great movie for fans of Cary Grant or for the whole family.
