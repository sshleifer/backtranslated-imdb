I turned this out to see the incredible waters Waters, whose autobiography I now read. I will admit my cheeks to fall when the pork chop with watermelon reference began to roll in, but people can not watch this movie as a stereotype or racist piece. It is very nice a short film made by black, for black at a time when the entertainment industry was well segregated with stereotypes to give the people involved they were jokes in their time, old age exaggerated for humor. We see modern black cinema doing the same, but with the new trends (stereotypes), the "ho" and the "hood" and so. I think if you look back in eight years, you would find today's movies watching racism. What viewers should appreciate on this movie is talent of Waters and painters-sized Sammy Davis Jr., who is from his contemporary pipe, Shirley Temple, and it looks remarkably even as he did as a adult. All those involved in this movie clearly had a lot of fun to do it. Why not enjoy it for what it is, instead of thinking it should have been?
