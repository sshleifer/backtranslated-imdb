The first hour or so of the movie was mostly boring to say at least. However it improves later as the Valentine Party begins. Starting from the twist as the identity of the killer at the very end, the hot scene of bathing killing was one of the relatively few memorable aspects of this movie. The scene in the field and Kate was well shot and so was the very latest scene (the 'twist'). At these scenes, there were some genuine specifications and emotions and the hot scene murdered was a nasty (way slashers would be) the edge of it. The earliest dead are frustratingly devoid of Gore.
