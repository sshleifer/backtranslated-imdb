This is one of the funniest movies I've seen. I watched it on DVD, and the disc has no special features, or even a menu, but this is not necessarily what I care about. I tend to judge movies on a case by case basis, depending on, among other things, whether it's a big studio production or a smaller movie. This is a smaller movie and I want to forgive minor things. That said, I believe he has one of the most imaginative and original sequences I've seen. <br /> I enjoyed acting all the major players. I especially enjoy Til Schweiger and Alan Arkin. Alan Arkin has most of the funniest lines. The character described by Claire Forlani might come across as unrealistic for some, but I was personally known to real people and emotional issues that are very easy to look at in life's decisions as her character. This helped me pick up the nuances where he could make it out of his mood mood. <br /> <br /> This is not a movie for kids, obviously, but not engaging in sex thanks to nudity. There are quite a bit of adult language, though, but it can sometimes be very funny. (In particular, Alan Arkin's character, who can not even swear.) Also look for the cameos from the character of the actor.
