If you are uninitiated in the Gundam world, this is a great place to start. If you're burning out on Star Wars or Star Trek, here is a compelling, realistic Sci-Fi set of sounds that you can become immersed in. It's not the simplistic little boy-save-world-of-giant robot you might expect, but rather a complex, emotionally compelling space war drama where the lines between the "good" and "bad" guys are decidedly less than different . <br /> <br /> Gundam 0080 focuses on the story of Al Izuruha, a young, living naive boy in a neutral space colony. He spends his daytime day on mobile suit and plays war with his friends. During this series, Al befriends an "enemy" soldier, Bernie Wiseman. In the end, Little learns some tough lessons about the reality of war and suffering of requiring and sacrifice. <br /> I liked this series of OAV, with its cool mechanical design, involving history, and simple characters. I recommend this series to anyone who likes realistic SF animated, or to those who think anime is just funny or sexy entertainment.
