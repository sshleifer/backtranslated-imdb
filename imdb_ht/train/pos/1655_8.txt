Mendez and Marichal gave us a serious, dangerous, and painful analysis of the 108-year-old colonial, political, economic, and political crisis that spawned in Puerto Rico. A lovely island with the most welcoming people I met and again because our nation refused to face its Imperial responsibility, Puerto Rican allowed them to fade and die. The spiritual crisis that Puerto Rico's colonial situation has created, if it destroys families, and the basic institutions that support any society. Corruption rampant to the extent that people do not pay taxes (who led a fiscal crisis to this nation) and a sense of cynicism and distrust of island culture. <br /> Fortunately, a grant allows this painful but powerful movie to be produced. <br /> A must see. . .
