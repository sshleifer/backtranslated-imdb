I gave this movie 10 not because it is a superbly consistent film, but for its best ability to evoke emotions in its audience. The one-woman-liter-against-all-lucky story is an old clich√© by now, but very few films have brought it off with much heat and sincerity as the Purple. showed another side of the African-American experience - showing that after slaves were granted many freedoms to fall in the ways of the 'white man' hatred and being abusive in their own people. I find this an important point as it goes against the show-white-on-black-violence-and-win-an-Oscar trend. Also their performance acts superb - especially Oprah which I now have a new respect for. <br /> Well worth seeing - but keep some tissue handy.
