This was soul-provoking! I'm an Iranian, and living in the 21st th century, I did not know that these great tribes lived in these conditions at my grandfather's time! <br /> You see that today, or even in 1925, on one side of the world a lady or a baby could be everything served for her or her own and on-demand, but here 80 years Those who ventured their lives to go to a place where there was more grass. It is really interesting that these pets carry these difficulties to find pasture for the sheep, but they lose many sheep on their way. <br /> I praise Americans who have accompanied this tribe, being as tough as Bakhtiari people.
