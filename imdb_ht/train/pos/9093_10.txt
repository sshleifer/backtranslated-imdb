I am the parent of a child need special and I enjoyed the movie very much! She loves, hot and fun. I learned a long time ago to see the humor of things. I especially thought it was sweet how all the other characters worried about Frankie and who would take care of her after her grandmother died. I went to a focused focus on the film and other parents and siblings in the special needs of the children before the movie was edited. Everyone liked the movie and actually inspired beautiful discussions. We talked about how our kids laughed and we also talked about how we were worried about them. The screenwriter spoke about how she works with autistic children and other special needs as a volunteer for many years. It was based on the character of a real person. Our family is blessed with a sense of humor that has come to us in many times stressful times. I'm giving movies of thumbs up !!!
