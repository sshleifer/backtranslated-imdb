Madhur Bhandarkar goes all out to touch on taboo issues and provides the most realistic photos of the modern society. One gets the impression of the same director from his earliest movies as Satta and Chandni Bar. The issues just discussed in the letter movie are explored and exposed to totality here. The casting is amazing and one can see the judgments on each stage of many angles. Mostly, the movie lets you ask about many facts around. As you begin to guess things, you end up at most being locked, but missing the mark in many a scene. It leaves a lasting impression at the end. <br /> <br /> The actors watch are Konkana Sen Sharma, Boman Irani & Kulkarni Atulas among others. Dialogues are well written and you have felt around some of these people. There are still some scenes that make you think of more depth. The songs are in the background of the background and voice of a very significant song "Kitne Ajeeb" let you feel you'll leave all alone in the modern society!
