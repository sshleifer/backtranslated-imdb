This film is about the easy friendship between a businessman and a man with Down syndrome. <br /> <br /> The character development of this movie is excellent. We find that Harry is a businessman neglecting his family, and Georges is an innocent man who craves the love and care of the "normal" society. Action is excellent, and the best Cannes award best deserves. Scenes of fantasy in the movie highlighted the fact that Georges misery toward abandonment by his family, and his desire to be treated as a normal person. The played song repeatedly also strengthens this message. The movie shows that people who are mentally handicapped are good natured. We have been treated with discrimination and negligence, a fact marked by the scene where Georges gives a gift to the waitress in the kitchen). If we find understanding and sharing these people worlds, both we and the mental disability can become very happy. I was so drawn to the film and emotional characters. It is a movie that touches the good soul soul.
