Gerard is a writer and a bit overactive imagination. It is also homosexual and Catholic Trinitarian Catholic guilt and something of a clairvoyant, or so it looks. On a trip to Flushing it is 'seduced' by Christine. When she discovered that Christine's new boyfriend was a bit of rough trading she was fond of far from her decides to stick around. After all, enforcing eyesight has its compensation. Then he realized that three Marians before all died violent deaths. Was Christine killed and is he or the companion, Herman, will be 'the fourth'? Verhoeven in overheated, melodrama on-egged is a delicious mix of Hitchcock and David Lynch, full of erotic OTT and religious imagery and a lot of terrible in the red color. A lot of time it seems and feels like a dream and we can never be sure what we see is real or a figure of Gerard's imagination. The fun is by figuring it out. Also the fact that Christine is an infinitely more characteristic character that either Gerard's priggish or Herman's optimistic mean we hardly love to roots for one of those who are on it. In fact, it's just saying comeuppance Gerard can not come soon enough. Super Performance, too, from Jeroen Krabbe and Renee Soutendijk and Verhoeven's easier movie up to her wonderful subtle pieces of sci-fi "Trumpet Trolleys".
