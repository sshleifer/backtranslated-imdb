I would like to comment on the love of the movie April. It is one of favorites ever since my father, Nelson Malone plays coaching. I remember clearly when Hollywood was coming to Lexington, KY, where we lived in the time of making love for April. My dad was playing a lot and was a talented man. I talked to him in going to try out for one of the little parties offered, and look, he saw it came home to the script. How exciting is that! Also, a number of my comrades were at the crowd scene - especially those shown in the amusement park. It's very nostalgic every April when I see the movie being shown once again, with the song April Love by Pat Boone is still playing on the radio. Timeless and reminiscent of a long time away when you see the movies they are doing today with the gender, language, and violence. It would be refreshing to see more movies like April Love back in focus.
