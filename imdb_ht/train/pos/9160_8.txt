In all the comments praising Dalton's dramatic or overwhelming performance, I thought it was excellent. He does not play Rochester as a very rich boy, but as a roguish, powerful man. I liked this version, although the injection on video aspects was sometimes distracted, and the scenes with Jane and St. John were never quite gelled. I give this an 8.
