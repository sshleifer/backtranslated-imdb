Agree. Yes, this was a very-tight-budget movie with continuity mistakes (such as one scene obviously filmed in sunshine and then in shadow and then mixed together), and as much as I love Nick Mancuso was often a bit too good in the burn-out part, and some of the minor support cast was really bad (more at least one actor used for two different but obvious roles). But come on. Richard Grieco was hysterical (her hair is worth the trip). Steven Ford was very likable. Mancuso had some great lines, while Nancy Allen, ironically, was completely bland and refreshing. Classic? No. Bad party? Yes. Interesting? Big yes. I would like to have been over-set the day to decide what kind of hairstyle Grieco would have. "Are you fast?" ... "Yin'in't sa rapide."
