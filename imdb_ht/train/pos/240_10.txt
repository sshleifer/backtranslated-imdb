Fantastic movie. One motivates all 5 senses. It is not a historical fact and not all information must be taken as real information. True Hollywood convention uses, such as playing a list of actors such as Naomi Watts (Julia Cook - Ned Kelly of lover), Heath Ledger (Ned) and Orlando Bloom (Joe Byrne - Ned but right hand) and unpleasant (sorry Geoffrey Rush) actors to play the drunken and corrupt police force Victorian. This also instills an unbelievable love story of the mix between Ned (Ledger) and Julia Cook (Watts) to lure all the romantic, brides are especially sensitive. Even at the first stage, when Ned rescued the fat youth from drowning with his father calling him "sun" and he had a "glint in his eyes as he looked down at me, but he 'on my shoulder,' it's very romanticized and compelling side viewer with Ned Kelly, the underdog. Moreover, does not every Aussies love an underdog?
