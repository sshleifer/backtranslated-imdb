Channel 4 is a channel that allows more rogue than any of the other channels, this show was certainly a rogue one. The presenter of cats show sometimes grown adult adults, BAFTA's career with the British Award winning award (both times nominated) Graham Norton was just the perfect gay host for a good show like this. He has one or more famous celebrities in the middle of it. They basically had an adult idea that would either be gross, outraged or humorous to the guests, but some are not for the faint-hearted. They had women playing the architect and parts, men used their dicks to play a cigar, weeing women equal in bathing, male and or without pants under their culture, and many more gross, but hilarious ideas. This is just for adults, but enjoy it! She had BAFTA twice for Best Entertainment (Program or Series), won the British Committee for Best Comedy Entertainment Program (also nominated), Best Comedy Talk, featuring an Emmy for Episode # 18 ( ?), And won the National Television Award twice for Most Popular Talk Show. It was the number 52 of the 100 best funny moments. Really good!
