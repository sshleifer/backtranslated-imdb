Performances by Om Puri, Smita Patil, and Sadashiv Amrapurkar and the whole chemistry come in nicely, along with the minimalist approach to telling stories and directions by Govind Nihlani. Dialogue by Vijay Tendulkar is also great. I do not see another film like this. It is one whole, each piece so nicely fit into the plot. You can not be impressed by this movie. <br /> <br /> Amrish Puri from as the bossy husband and 'baap' in Om Puri. Om Puri is the young man holding between his sense of duty and his inability to fight the system. Sadhashiv as Rama Shetty gives just about the touch of the movie right and smiles and speaks badly. The first meeting of Anand Velankar and Rama Shetty in place of Sadhashiv is stunningly silent. Smita Patil does not play a major role, but his party is also not distracted from the main draw. <br /> <br /> And to add to all Kafi Inamdar playing the role of a cop who came in terms with the system and its functioning. She said things right in the right places and know how to keep herself away from trouble. It is also 'Guru' in Om Puri and help him whenever he gets in trouble. <br /> <br /> The film not only brings in focus the difficulties faced by a police officer trying to perform his duties, but also the other side of the brutality of police guards. Om Puri captures the despair and desire to break free from this exceptional performance in Ardh Satya. <br /> A treat to all hungry fans of American cinema.
