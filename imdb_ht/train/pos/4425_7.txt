Another attempt by Japanese modern director to redefine the genre of chambara. Success, and not, at various degrees. <br /> <br /> Buddhist monks have a vision that it is to kill a demon (and bold) demon of the Gojoe bridge in order to attract Enlightenment. While not at the forefront, Buddhism thinking is in the heart of this movie, much like "Ran Ran" Kurosawa. It's probably what made the movie the most interesting of me although it's nowheres near the league "Ran". <br /> <br /> Chic visual direction and photography excellent keep the movie particularly exciting during the two hours and eighteen minutes length. Lead actors are excellent excellent. The music is really good. The weaknesses are the story and the battle scene. The shooter film in the middle could be fixed by some cautious corrections. And the fighting scene mostly filmed in blurry shut-ups. This works for most of the movie but the final feels like a scam. Another recent film like this is the "Swis Swords" Tsui Hark, great movie, but the battle scene promises to disappoint them. Asano really does not move like a swift handling demon acting it is great, but it should be an extra in a traditional battle scene chambara. <br /> <br /> Good movie, you'll probably find it interesting just do not expect traditional sword fighting.
