I saw this movie, and the play, and I must add that this was the most touching story I've ever seen. Until I saw this movie I was unaware of how terrible life was and probably still is for South Africans and adults who were and are living in that era. It brought tears to my eyes and sadly in my heart that anyone should have struggled like these just to stay alive, and bring the kids right out of this area and teach them to act with preform and The turn to release their own stories is simply amazing. This simply surpassed a five star, I miss it a ten. Thanks Mr. Mbongeni Ngema for an amazing story. Although it was 12 years since this story is said, it is still one that lays heavy in my heart. If there is a VHS, or DVD out there on the play, please let me know ASAP.Thank You. PS There was nothing wrong with the kids wanting to bear awareness about the issues and requirements of other countries' expectations that some people would have a heart and offer assistance.
