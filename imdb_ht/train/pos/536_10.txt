Some movies can be seen almost 60 years later, but it still remains as engrossan as this one. Technological advances do not have the love story of this classic. Special effects are used remarkably for a movie 1946. The act is superb. David Niven, Kim Hunter and especially Roger Livesey performed an outstanding job. The use of Black and White / Colors adds to the creative nature of the movie. It has not been seen on TV for 20 years so few people are even aware of its existence. It is my favorite movie of all time. Looking forward to the DVD release of this movie for many years is, in itself, "A Matter of Life and Death".
