I keep this movie on my local movie channel, and I enjoy watching the movie. She has all the elements of a good movie movie, and much more - this movie, aside from dealing with boy-girl relationships with sex and love, also deals with the problem of using steroids by young people. The movie has real life for her - there is no loud music, no special effects and no outrageous scenes - that, for this film, was good. It feels that it's easy to relate to the characters in the movie - some of us probably know from where we live. <br /> <br /> Overall, a good movie, fun to watch. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
