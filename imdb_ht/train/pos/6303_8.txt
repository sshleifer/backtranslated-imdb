Having heard positive reviews and having seen the trailer I've seen this movie. With William H. Macy, Luis Guzman, Michael Jeter and Sam Rockwell presented it to be good. And he is saved. In general, the movie does not crack-you-up comic, but there is one scene that really stands out and is, in my eye, a classic. SPOILER At the end, where they break into the wall to get to the safe and we see Rockwell and Washington staring at jeter is just fantastic. This is just as good as the scene in Big Lebowski where the dude is using a chair in his barricade door, but forgot the door turns out! END SPOILER Just go to this movie, you will not be disappointed.
