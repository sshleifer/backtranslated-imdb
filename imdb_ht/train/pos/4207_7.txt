Jumping McCoy (Richard Widmark) pick-pocket candy ticket (Jean Peters) with a significant microphysic that is intended for the cause of communism. It was followed by 2 federal agents who are waiting to ride it once but microfiche through its contacts. However, skip the thief on the train under the nose of everyone and so start a hunt for him by both the police and Joey (Richard Kiley) and Candy who want the microfiche to come back. Jumps can only be traced to Moe (Thelma Ritter) who sells information about criminals. It's clear to skip that it has been stolen and both sides want the movie, but it intends to hold out for a high price. This led to Joey hunting behind him and a conflict between Joey and Jean, who fell in love with jumping. Joey has a timetable to deliver the microfiche to her boss. <br /> It's a well-acting movie and has a good start that gets you involved right away. It's a bit unrealistic how Jean Peters immediately fell in love with Widmark, but this point is needed as otherwise why would he later hold out to Joey. It's a good movie.
