One night I stumbled on this on the satellite station Bravo.Initially from my curiosity I decided to watch it. To be perfectly honest I was not disappointed. The main character is beautiful and its body is shown in well. would think his talent would be wasted as an executioner but apparently not after watching the whole movie! My only real estate is the act of casting to particularly support the actor who plays Melnik. His bad christianity! Hank's prison guard is also sweet too.All he ever did is to get drunk and get sick tried to spend on Wanda's co-star, though fortunately for our viewer and for Hank he came down and dirty with Wanda near the end. The music used is very tense and creates the perfect atmosphere for their execution. This movie looks very nice for Jennifer, the beautiful, talented and sexy
