This should be my number one movie of the year for 1991, except being beat out of the brilliant JFK. This is like a wonderful movie! I loved it. I love stories where different characters' lives intersect with others and how to deal with their lives. Kevin Kline is good here, but is erupted by Danny Glover and, especially, Steve Martin. I'm never so much like Martin or his style, but here it is great. I loved every speech she gave to Kline near the end of the Grand Canyon. This writing was excellent. Larry Kasdan is IMO, a great dialogue writer, about how to Kevin Smith and Quentin Tarantino. Here, he has formed several three-dimensional characters and thinks out stories, and messages that give a positive feel to our lives. A really great movie. 4 out of 4 stars
