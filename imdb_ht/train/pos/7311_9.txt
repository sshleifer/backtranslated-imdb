Halloween is a movie I have to get out and watch every time it's that day of the year. I even watch it sometimes when it's not the holiday! This movie is SO great.Jamie Lee Curtis is an actress I can never stop love .This movie might be old, but the story line always gets me right there every time, and the act was absolutely fantastic !! ! Although I did not see the remake, I already feel that it's totally unnecessary. I think Rob Zombie would never pull like a classic. What kills me though, is knowing that some people come out which saw the remake without even hearing from the original. I got angry just thinking about it !!!!!! This movie was great, and it will always be remembered in history as a classic.
