Keeping in mind I'm a fan of the genre, but only recently saw this movie for the first time. How I've neglected it all this time is an awesome thing to me. For me this is a better movie then the lot is full of "High Midi" applause. It's a great west and excellent acting with a great story. The DVD is in beautiful black and white with exceptional cinematography. If you love western or James Stewart this movie should not be missed.
