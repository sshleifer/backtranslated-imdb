This is a movie that everyone should look. Some apart from increasing vital points (while South Africa is on the road to recovery there are still many countries in similar situations now), it is superbly directed while Denzel Washington provides, in my opinion, the best career performance it's so far. Kline also provides a good performance, although perhaps not as stunning as Washington. John Thaw also put in a good turn as the Chief of Police. <br /> There are many possible areas where a movie about apartheid can fall down, but all of them have been avoided. It would be easy to simply show white people as the bad guys and black people as the guys are good but Attenborough does not. Sure, there were some white characters that seemed naturally wrong, like the Captain of the Soweto uprising, but added extra dimensions to all the characters would make the film unbearably long. Some people complain about the length of the film as it is, but I think it needs every two and a half hours to tell the whole story, so it's really an incredible one. In the movie is that of Steve Biko's funeral. When the whole crowd starts singing African South African immigrants, it's probably one of them, if not the most moving scene I've seen. If you do not see this movie already: look it. It can not be comfortable watching, but it's certainly worth it.
