I watched FIDO on some movie channels and I must say that I became an instant fan. The movie feels like a comic book that perfectly captures the look and feel of the surreal 1950s, knowing the decade is good for them to dance at Elvis while driving nuclear bombs just to heal in it. People were so naive back then that it's scary and the idea that these cutters would find it normal to have zombies as pets actually work here. Kudos of this Canadian production, colorful circle and excellent cast casting, including Carrie Anne Moss, Billy Connolly, Henry Czerny and the kid. <br /> It's a shame this movie was not a big hit. It deserves more recognition. It's better than stuff from Tim Burton or SHAUN to the dead team. Oh well. It's an instant classic though.
