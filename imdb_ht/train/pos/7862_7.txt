Here is evidence why Mary Pickford was 'Ami America.' In this rather complex drama, Mary plays the young daughter of a skater who dare to dream of being in a relationship with the son of one of the 'mount-toppers.' The scenes of stolen a kiss and otherwise fall in love are simply succulent. He even wants to take a bath. Mary was able to pull this role at age 30 simply amazing with a bit and it diminished high (5 '). Tess must face many physical and emotional challenges. He does this with spunk by seeing at many heroines at the time. Tess packs a wallop and does not shy about fighting with anyone. Why he agrees to help the girl's daughter's head is beyond me, but he sacrificed his own happiness in order to keep a deep secrecy. Pickford's lock ups are wonderful. <br /> <br /> Danish-born Jean Hersholt is simply wonderful as the villain. The scene in which it manhandles a baby is enough to throw you vegetables (or whatever) of the movie screen. If Forrest Robinson (played Daddy Skinner) has torn a beard, it would be a match for the pattern used in these Major World Large Recruiting posters at Uncle Sam ?? Want You! Although the story is somewhat predictable and slow at the start, it is worth the investment in your time to see the piece or most 'Americana. The movie highlights the choices available to all of us who are involved in making someone happy and what it is to be a real Christian. Recommended.
