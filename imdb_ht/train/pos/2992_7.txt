She looks even the director does not like this movie, but for me to think it was a little harsh on her head. Make sure you are not perfect, but there are some atmospheric shots, and the story is good enough to keep you interested at all. <br /> It's injected into what seems to be quite a lovely village that adds to the atmosphere as well. <br /> If you like horror movie shot in England, give it a go. <br /> I've just seen a trailer for this movie director of the 'Devil' movie that looks quite amazing. <br /> There is not enough English movie horror for me, so any come together worthy of our attention, and this one is not as bad as you can think
