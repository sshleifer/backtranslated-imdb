With partial reconstruction and a direct direct shooting, the directors made a horrific documentary on a coup against President Chavez of Venezuela, organized by a foreign secret service and fully supported by the Venezuelan rich Minister, the political opposition, the Church (a cynical laughing cardinal) and the U.S. government. It was another chapter in the history of US foreign policy, which Steven Kinzer calls 'Overthrow' or 'American style of American democracy'. In fact, this foreign intervention was not just a coup against President Chavez, but also against the majority democratically elected. <br /> <br /> This is a brilliant documentary that is being confirmed by the violent reactions to and against online. As Saint Augustine said: 'Men love truth when it immerses them in its light; They hate it when it's proven wrong. '<br /> This movie is a must see for everyone who wants to understand the world we live in.
