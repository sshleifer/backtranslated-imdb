This is a really nice and sweet movie that the whole family can enjoy. It's about two dogs and a cat that they have taken away from living with someone for a while, but the animals do not understand and escape and go to get the family on their own. The cat is called Sassy and lives up to his name. Chances are the youngest dog who knows a lot about life inside the book. Shadow is the older dog and the wider sense of things. Put these three together on an adventure and do a fun and fun time. There is no special effect in the mouths to move so it does not cheese at all. It's the best animal talk that I've seen too far. It's a really good movie for families.
