"Hatred in One Minute" is arguing one of the best films from Michigan in recent years. Do not say it's a brilliant movie by any means, but it's definitely worth a look. <br /> <br /> "Hatred" The adventurous stories of Eric Seaver (played by director Kallio), a former child abuse now grow up, and begins listening to his bad side. <br /> <br /> "Hatred" is very beautifully visually. The shots are creative, and the lighting is appropriately moody and interesting look. This film actually has a component of its production value, unlike other recent Michigan releases like "Dark Tomorrow" and "Zombie Biker." Subtile dolly and stylized casting vaccine shows the good use of this film $ 350,000 film. However, "Hatred" stumbles in the same place that many other local films do, and that's the story and character of the department. Essentially, things just kind come up. Eric Seaver does not evolve at all. Basically, it's still crazy, it's just that people are starting to notice. The movie just wanders on its happy way with so many small developments. Also, the finish is very abrupt. However - since this is a horror movie, since we care about sketch? We just want to see people die, and "Hatred" certainly delivers. As the body counts up, people in the theater started cheering "Kill It! Kill It All!" When people shout back to the screen, it's always fun. <br /> This is the place where "Hatred" succeeds. It's fun. And in the end, all that is really important.
