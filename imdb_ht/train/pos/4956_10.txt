This film is really genuine and random. It's really hard to get movies like it's now films in Hollywood. I really enjoy watching this film, I bought her DVD this Tuesday this week and I watched it for 4 times. I love the spanglish accent in Paz, it's just really nice as it is. And it acts with the Morgan are so funny and natural. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />! <br /> <I've learned something more about life in this movie (well, or at least life USA) ... really random life ... Sometimes u meet someone, they spend in your life and they your friends should look like you, and u do not spend a lot of time with them, maybe just a little while, but u enjoy that '' while '' with them, and then auctioned and they will never meet each other, but u in time together is really unforgettable. Just keep these moments in mind as recognition and wonderful memory ... <br /> <br /> This movie could be cheap at the price, but its meaning is totally not cheap. I rarely learn anything about the movie, but this is an exception.
