Kubrick has proven his brilliance again, now in a thriller-based movie based on Stephen King's book titled the same. Jack Torrance is a man of his forties, married, with one child, and a past of alcoholism. The Overlook Hotel in Colorado stopped service during the winter because of its extreme weather, and has a well-paid job for those who care for their fixtures for the five months; and Torrance, who was looking for a writer, found it perfect. But the manager advises Torrance about the loneliness of this winter's winter, potentially dangerous, and tells him that some people in the past go crazy and murder his family. Even before his son Danny, who had some sort of imaginative friend who illuminated him in the future (shinning), knew the place was not good and did not want to go. Once installed themselves in the hotel, things started right, but within a month, Jack began to act strangely, irritated, and depressed. At this point, we know something that will happen but does not know when and how. The scary things happen as the appearance of two twin girls talking to Danny, and someone who attacks him violently. They are not alone in this place. Later, Jack began to see others and immediately felt good with them as if they were his family; among them the most famous occupying psychologist, Delbert Grady. Grady tells Torrance that he must kill his family because they are "intruders" at the hotel. Obeying this order, Jack has gone for the goal and many of the most awesome things I've ever seen happen here. The finish is spectacular and viewers will be interested and shocked until the last minute.
