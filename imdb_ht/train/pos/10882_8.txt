This is not a bad movie. She follows the new conventions of modern horror, that is the movie of a movie, the well-known actress runs for her life in the first stage. This movie takes the old convention into a psycho killer on its loose, and manages to do something new and interesting to it. It is also nice to see Molly Ringwald back for the attack. So this might be an example of what the genre gets. Cutting strikes all the brands, and it is actually scary in some parts. I love her I gave her an eight.
