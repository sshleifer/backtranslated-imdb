Let's go straight to the point: this is the movie I'd take with me on a desert island (and DVD player). It's just perfect. If a reason to see a movie is that you love actors, you enjoy seeing them free of charge in the space and feeling, this movie is for you. Watch the scene when Myrtle (Rowlands) comes on stage drunk and Maurice (Cassavetes) has to impress because he does not follow the script again. If you're sensitive to the camera's motion, you'll be captivated by the camera path to move on to the scene, the particular flow, which gives you the impression camera to follow the actors as if it was led by the theater principle of "private space". amazing. And the story is just a brilliant mix of history and realistic drama. Cassavetes is again discussing with Hollywood and the major politics, but this time he made it to Broadway, making one of the most exciting films on the theater. Well, this movie is a bliss.
