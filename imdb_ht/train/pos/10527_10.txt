This is one of the best films I've seen in years! I'm not a fan of Gwyneth Paltrow, but it's excellent as Emma Woodhouse. Alan Cumming is superb as Reverend Elton, and Emma Thompson's sister, Sophie, is hysterical as Miss Bates. And check out the gorgeous Jeremy Northam as Mr. Knightley; what a gentleman! Anyone who says you need sex and violence in a movie makes it good never to see Emma. I think that is what separates it from many others - it's stylish. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a movie that you can watch with the whole family, or looking for a romance for yourself, look no further. Emma is that movie. With a beautiful setting, wonderful costume, with an exceptional cast (I mention the gorgeous Jeremy Northam?), Emma is a perfect ten!
