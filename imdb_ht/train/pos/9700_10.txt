Somehow, this movie managed to invigorate, budgets, and heartwarming at the same time. Stars like Tony Shalhoub (from Providence) bring the story of life. The story itself is inspired. We see a desperate, up-down, and most innocent life imaginable: a bird. Paulie starts his life as a baby boy giving a girl (played by Hallie Eisenberg, also known as the Pepsi Girl) with a speech ban. While he learns to speak correctly, so Paulie. However, unlike most birds, he can talk and understand everything they have said. The military father does not like the bird, so he is sent to a pawn shop and bought by an aging artist, ivy. He teaches his behavior, etc., while traveling around the country to find the owner Paulie. The film continues with several twists of fate, until Paulie ends in a laboratory where he eventually hid away from a basement, and was found by a Russian guardian, who touched by the bird's story. The plot is in keeping with the simple, metaphorical term that language is a gift, and a curse. I would like to say that the band is surprised. A nice mix of flute, digital base, and cone enhances the film to the best ecstasy point. The rotating cameras rapid and enchanting scenery fit the story even more. And, as a final reminder, the puppet is entirely credible. (Unlike the star wars, where Yoda looks like a Muppet) This movie is one of my favorite movies, and the remark added that my wonderful parakeet in four years has died recently. In general, I give this **** movie from four stars, two thumbs up, and a hug.
