I saw Martin's first day when I was just 10 years old, at home, in the Channel Channel, and always remembered the impact he had on my life. She touched me as no other movie touched me, and I remember baling my eyes out. <br /> <br /> After the first time I saw it, I could not find it anywhere else. I would ask around and never heard of the movie! I guess it was one of the most rare films that few people knew about, because there was no one, and I mean no one, knew what I was talking about. I searched and searched all the years, checking video store shelves and optical cable television listings, but always came short. Finally, in 1996 I found out I could special order it, I did, and they probably looked at it at least 50 times since - and it still makes me cry, every time. Martin's Martin is on Martin Steckert, a man in prison (but really a good guy), who is eager to make it back to the special lake where he grew up as a boy. This was a special place, where he lived in nature, spend time with his dog, and remained alone enjoying life. Soon in the movie, she saves and starts her way back to the lake. It is not long before the cops get it, and Steckert tramples a child as a hostage to convince the police back off. Soon Steckert and her hostage (2nd Martin) become best friends, and have plenty of fun adventures together - from stealing a toy truck, to hi-jacking a train, all along the way to this special lake. /> Throughout the film, Steckert has great rbits in her in the lake as a boy. <br /> I will not ruin the finish for you, but I'll tell you, this movie is a must see. It's the best movie I've ever seen in my life! I, without a doubt, the biggest fan of this movie ever! I managed to find the song of Martin singing in the movie ("I'm going back, where I'm out ..."). I even planned a trip to Canada to see the lake and the cottage where Martin's Day was filmed -You crap, I know - but that movie just means very much for me.
