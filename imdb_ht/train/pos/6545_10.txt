I really enjoyed this movie. Most of the reviews were bad, but most critics thought a movie would be like a drama idea. This movie has a little bit of drama, but the rest is just own and very fun. Forget about Julia Roberts being a nicer wife, Emma Roberts is a pretty young lady and there is more than her just that. Emma was so pleased to look at the role of Nancy Drew. It's good to see a new face. I believe it will go away. Nancy Drew can not be based on the books, but the story is still good. There is also a good mix of other actors actors and actors supporting Pat Carroll, Barry Bostwick, Rachel Leigh Cook and Chris Kattan - not credited. I'm surprised Disney did not release this movie. Some people do not like this movie because it does not have sex, violence and curses. This is a good family movie that is rare in this day of time. So take your family, watch this movie and judge for yourself how good it is. I can not wait for the end.
