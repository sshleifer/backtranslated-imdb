I have 14 years and I love this drawing. Burt Reynolds and Deluise Dom make a great scary. This movie is really funny and I love the songs. My favorite song is "You can not keep a good dog down" and that song on sharing, I think he called "What's mine is for you". This was the latest film with Judith Barsi, who played the voice of Anne-Marie. My favorite charity is Charlie but I found Itchy's voice so fun to hear. Although some scenes I actually found scary, I still have a hard time watching the scene and Charlie's dream, and the spit tackles the crap out of me. Other characters like King Gator I found really funny. The finish was adorable and was actually sad, made me cry a little. I give this movie 7/10.
