This show contains all the typical characters of a comedy: the good guy, the idiot, the pervert, the rich girl ... but he's put on the 70's. This is the only difference that he has with other kedi tv. I do not know how you can love this show. His humor is sad! I mean, jokes are so direct ... A typical dialogue is this: "Fez: Oh, Jackie I want to have sex with you. (Hearing laughs) Jackie: Fez you are a pervert. (Hearing laughs) Fez: Oh yes I (audience cheers and applause) "This is not funny. I think if he did not have that laugh (I do not know how to call that in English, sorry) you would not laugh at all. This is not intelligent comedy, this is a public insult. I love most of American comedians, but that's not good at all. I would give it 4 out of 10. (Sorry for my poor again.)
