Generally I do not really like Emma Roberts much, but after watching Nancy Drew it kind of changed my mind. The actors in the movies made the whole thing fun and fun. Most of the time when you watch a mystery movie you can solve it before in the middle of the show, but in this movie is like you are actually there. Suggestions have to be all fit together until you can finally understand all the crime. I'm still amazed as he found it out. The movie all was really smart and the people who watched it with me liked the movie too. The clothes were my favorite part of the movie, it was so beautiful. I do not think there will be another movie like this until the end comes out. I give it a new one because the famous girls did not really seem to have the party just right, but they still make me laugh. It was a really great movie with a great mystery. I definitely recommend watching it.
