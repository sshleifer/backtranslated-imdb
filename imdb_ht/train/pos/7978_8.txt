This movie contains the ingredient in one that all revenge movies should have and that is true emotion. Sorrow, love, laughter, anger. There are many emotions thrown in this movie. From start to finish this movie is incredibly fascinating. The plot on sound papers like the garbage usually is mainly cast in the faces of the audience, but not for mistakes, this movie is powerful. Washington as always puts on a great performance. The plot of a Nutshell: man suffering from depression, a young girl brings life into her, the kid gets kidnapped, people want revenge. Do not sound like anything special, but it's far superior than any other movie that looks like out there. For instant, TAKEN is a similar film but when you compare them both, MAN on FIRE wins but down. Characters are engaged and everyone puts in a great performance and the LED is great. Mexico City feels alive, it looks like Mexico, it smells like Mexico City. Everything is described brilliantly. The style in the direction was something I was enjoying and carried out in the best of Mexico City <br /> <br /> This is one of those films you'll be carrying out once a year to watch again or a movie that you will ask your family and friends to watch. From start to finish you are rooting for the main protagonist, making it a roller-coaster journey. There are enough stocks keeping you happy, having enough character development please you and then there's Washington to bring a smile to your face. Watch this movie, you will not be disappointed
