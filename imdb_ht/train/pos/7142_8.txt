Hole, originally a novel by Louis Sachar, was successfully transformed into a fun and well-designed movie. Starting Sigourney Weaver as the Warden, Shia Labeouf as Stanley, and Khleo Thomas as zero, their role was very well cast, and the actors described the roles well. <br /> <br /> The movie has inter-reset storylines that all lead up to the end. The main scenario is about Stanley Yelnats and his punishment of spending a year and a half at Camp Greenlake. The second scenario is about Sam and Kate Barlow. This draw deals with racism and is the largest storyline in the movie. The third is on Elya Yelnats and Madame Zeroni, who explains the 100-year curse of the Yelnats family. In my opinion, these stories were weaved together very well. Unlike many people's beliefs, I think you do not need to read the book to understand the movie. The movie is reasonably easy to understand. Acting in the film was well done, especially Shia Labeouf (Stanley), Khleo Thomas (Zero), Sigourney Weaver (Warden), and Jon Voight (Mr Mas). Other members of the D-Tent, Jake Smith (Kalma), Max Kasch (Zig Zag), Miguel Castro (Magnet), Byron Cotton (Armpit), and Brenden Jefferson (X-Ray), reinforce comic relief in the film. However, the best parties were with Zero and Stanley, who made a great team together. Although the hole is a Disney movie, it deals with some serious issues such as racism, shooting, and violence. The movie premiered at some very well done. <br /> I would suggest this movie to people of all ages, if they have read the book or not. You should not miss it.
