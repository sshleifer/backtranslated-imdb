It's easy to forget, once later series has developed the scheme of foreign arc plot, that once over the time, the X-Files' wrote episodes such as "GenderBender" and "Symmetry Peach," where the aliens were not all small male gray or self-control goop, but it can actually surprise you. <br /> <br /> "Symmetry peach begins" with an "invisible elephant" - actually an elephant somehow dislocated in space and time, not a mile away from the "Walk" - and ends with a pregnant gorilla was kidnapped. And it's a lot of episodes in wonderful moments. The supreme is annoyingly worthwhile - yes, we find it, zombies are bad except when they are not - but the ideas in it are fascinating, visually powerful, and very memorable, and it covers an overwhelming abusive angle - Why would people * be the only things that foreigners are interested in? In the end, it was not an instant classic, but it looked enjoyable while it lasted, again, very memorable, and especially, it's something that you could not imagine many other performing shows.
