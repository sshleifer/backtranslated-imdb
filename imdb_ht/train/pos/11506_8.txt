"Kolchak" was a television series that really did not fit into any category. Horror party, comedy party, some social awareness thrown off, and what we have is something that I think people were not ready for. It's a shame really, as I started to watch these shows on the Chiller network, (I've never seen the original), I realized how different and interesting it really was. <br /> Start Darren McGavin as Kolchak a reporter for international news service, and Simon Oakland as his still angry boss, Tony Vincenzo, the show following the exploits of a Chicago news reporter that most often did not, came part of the story itself, as it searches the windy city for modern day creepies that go ball into the night. The hidden hack of Macgavin really sets the show apart. A guy a little jump, who always wears the same suit, you can not help but love her. His joke is great, with the return and idea between him and the uncertainty editor, Oakland, are downright hilarious. <br /> History are the most beautiful parts, and the act is very good. 70 were not a * great * period for special effects, and the show suffered for it, but if you stopped disbelief, what you have is a fun series that was before it in time.
