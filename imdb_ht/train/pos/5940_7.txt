this short film trailer is basically about Superman and Batman working together and forming a comfortable alliance. Obviously, the two characters have extensive different opinions on how to deal with crime and what constitutes the pinition.it a lot of fun to see these two iconic characters try to get along.I will not go to the storyline here. But I'm going to get into the act, which is terrific.veryone is well thrown.The actors of playing Superman and Batman are well suited to the characters.And even made Batman: Dead End and Grayson also made films This short one. I've probably loved this one younger, but I still thought it was well done. For me, the World's finest is a 7/10
