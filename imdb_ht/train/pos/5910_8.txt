OK, OK, do not get lowered from round. I was kidding. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> So Ralphie Boy. And he does one of his best jobs here. <br /> <br /> On the front of her crime shows the truth. They built it, defend it, then bored with most rivals cause them (perhaps) to lose it. Look for yourself to see what's going down. <br /> <br /> Racer? I do not know. With scatman (rip) and walrus of love (also rip) being black and the main point of view, I saw it as an attack on mostly racism. The fact that Richard Pryor liked saying so much as well. And the youngest (near "Miami Vice") Phil Mike Thomas had a nice surprise. <br /> It's an animated film "Blacksploitation". That's a good thing. Do good and well done. It will do some squirm (like the lynching scene) but unfortunately this is based on reality. <br /> But Ralphie REALLY should have re-thought of titles.
