This is obviously aimed at the same market as Monsters Inc. and Shrek, but it's different in its less cartoony (despite these cartoony spray characteristics of the lead animals). The story is not one that has a massive moral figure to the end (read more like its tugging in your sleeves), but it just tells a story about the relationship between the different "animals." You know the result, but you can not help being drawn in. The characters themselves are far more than their voices (the advantage of less popular folk performers), unlike most Disney movies. They are well rounded and completely credible, weird. Dynamic groups are brilliantly presented and the characters and curious revelations are subtle and enjoyable. You will find yourself rooting yourself far ahead than you would like to think. <br /> <br /> The animation is brilliant, as you would expect, and you will be praying for the opportunity to go on the ice slide in the movie. You will fall in love with the characters, especially the funny relief of the prehistoric squirrel and its desperate attempt to bury its black. I was out to want the required freight, especially the slug game, only to be disappointed the next day when I could not find anything vaguely related. Which, weird, make the movie all the most pure. <br /> Better than Monsters Inc. or Shrek.
