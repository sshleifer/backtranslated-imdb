Like many of you I'm a big fan of the real thing - the 1940s films - but the Red Rock West was a real treat for all of us longing for the past. The neo-noir theme was so commonly used in the past ten years that it had lost its meaning and its impact. Jan Dahl's movie on the other hand, really deserves to be described as such. The casting is perfect all around and would feel right at home with Tay Garnett or Jacques Tourneur. The plot is so tight that you're hooked in the first fifteen minutes. James M. Cain would appreciate it. Many contemporary films let me ask why they do not like them used, and I'm not that old. Movies such as Red Rock West give us hope for the future while paying tribute to the past.
