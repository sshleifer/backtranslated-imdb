Thirsty together .. I wish there was a follow up to this documentary to follow up with the lives of some and celebrate the lives of others lost ... should be a part of .. one real. It was great .. The film was not enough long ... I would like to know why the creator of the movie did not follow up! This is so important in the community's period. Well if you are reading this please consider making another documentary of this sort ... I'm really tired of listening to naive writers how AIDS and Men go together when they pa; actually it's the airport that we need to look at .. this movie did not even bother mentioning HIV or AIDS and I was so happy for that .. I really appreciate the Downs breaking down and definition too. Thank you very much for allowing this movie to exist.
