Things come true is a classic work of speculative fiction; both an essay on the destructive nature of war and their territories in progress. He makes some surprising dreams in the war that followed a few years later, but is awfully naive in his Utopian ideal. Raymond Massey, Cedric Hardwicke, and Ralph Richardson made a fine cast, although the drama has played more like a piece of stage, than a movie theater. There are breathtaking, if a bit rigorous speech, often save as if the actor tries to reach the back of the theater. However, there are some profound words. Is it the Savior's technology to mankind, or the instrument of its destruction? The film is a visual feast, if one can detach itself from the age of the effects. Sure, Hollywood is more sophisticated today, but rarely as invented. For the imaginary, the third act is a treat: a world with underground cities, massive DECO bombs, space cannons, copying gyro, and secret organizations of scientists saviors. She has all the supermarket in a sci-fi adventure, but instead uses the trappings for a philosophical exercise. <br /> <br /> Things coming up with Metropolis were the features of Hollywood science fiction genius. They are surgeries in dimension, and visually inspire. Technology has long left behind, but ideas are still out. There is an art there, one with more heart and emotion than the computer producing mass-produced movies of today. These films are the products of craftsmen, not industrialists.
