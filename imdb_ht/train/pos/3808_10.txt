I voted this a 10 out of 10 simply because it is the best animated story I could see in some time. The animation is stunning. The artwork behind each and every landscape was beautiful. From the colors of lighting in the price by standards of art. I was amazed. Move beyond the beauty on the screen, you are immersed in a scenario that is at once timeless and in the same cool turn. Character development is short yet these touchstone moments are exactly what is needed to show the viewer of what and why and how the character comes to where they stand. I am impressed with the whole affair and thinking this is a must see for the whole family.
