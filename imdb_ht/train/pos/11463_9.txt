I saw this movie at the Rhode Island International Film Festival and it was completely blown. The structure and execution of the movie was fantastic ... I know it will not be, but it really deserves a Oscar shake. Cal and Andrew were phenomenal as their classmates disturbed. Yes, the movie is very controversial and I can see a lot of people who have a lot of problems with it, as it deals with school shooting and specifically makes you identify with the killers. However, despite harsh topics and topics, Zero Day is SO worth seeing. I'm looking forward to coming out on videos so I can buy it - it's very, very good. Very powerful and intense ... The sequel to the tire shoots hurt because it's almost too realistic. The uncertainties, "recording", the foot and panic of students, totally indescribable. I really hope it gets attention he deserves. It does in the same format as the Blair Witch Project, portable camera, made them appear as a true video video documentary in film - but God is IT INFINITELY better. Very impressive, hats of all involved. If you were lucky you really should see it.
