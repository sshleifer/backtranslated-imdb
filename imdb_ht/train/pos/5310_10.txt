Pecker is another mainstream film by John Waters to perform on a lesser than Mother Serial. The title character of Pecker has a pleasure to take pictures of anything he sees. It does not matter if it's scary or shocking when it takes pictures. She soon uses the photos she takes and put on the display of her work. Pecker lives in a semi-normal middle family. His father is working in a bar to drink with a claw car, but he does not have enough money and a cash bar decision on the street. Her mother runs a thrift store and loves to dress up the poor. Her older sister, Tina, is working in a gay bar where her specialty is trading. Her younger, Little Chrissy, has a habit of sugar, sugar, and nothing but sugar. Her grandmother, Memama, has a small statue of the Virgin Mary and plays ventriloquist with her. He also has 2 friends. About to his friends, Matt is a chronicle shoplifter and his girlfriend, Shelley, running a laundry as if he were a dictator. Soon, a tourist from New York buys his photos and shows them in an art gallery. With the picture comes fame, but the pictures exhibit the unusual life style of his friends and family life. For a R-rated movie, Pecker is sure to anger than most of Waters before R-rated films and even Pink Flamingos. Another 10 out of 10!
