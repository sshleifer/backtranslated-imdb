This is a great end to the show. The fact that Adm Janeway could make a double switch on the Borg was great. The fact that it allowed herself to be infected, so infect the queen and a "poison" that, in essence, ended the Borg was great. The way they finished it also left some, not many, for a movie reunion. However, they brought them "home" and how they made it fantastic! She was sad to say goodbye to a part of my family. Finish it with Tom and B'Lanna who have the babies as they enter the Alpha squad. It was a great way to show a new start. It would be good to have a reunion movie of some kind - just to see where the characters would be today.
