Monstervision was a show I grew up with. From late night to hosting with Penn and Teller in the one, the sole, Joe Bob Briggs. The show holds my Friday night back to my high school years, and gives some of the best drive-in memories ever to come out of the drive. <br /> <br /> Without a doubt, better TV late night ever. If you did not stay up, you missed out. <br /> I know John Bloom and Joe Bob live on, but I want them back where they belong ... MONSTERVISION! Question ... did anyone else sit in all 4 hours of the "Swarm"? q :) <br /> <br /> Long Live Monstervision!
