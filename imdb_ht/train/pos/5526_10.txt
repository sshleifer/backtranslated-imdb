I like cinema so I'm confused to embarrass myself deeply. I gave a thumb down to "Che, part 1 and 2" without seeing the movie. Terrible I know. But I felt in a trap that ... not? I do not really know but there was a negative word in mouth that spread like wildfire, and, no matter how smart I think I, I fall into it. But fortunately, I was struck by an Argeninean film director, Martin Donovan, a man I love and admire. When I told her I was not going to see her because I knew the movie was a failure she looked at me as if she was ready to punch me right on the face and Donovan is a pacifist! She took me aside and told me how she loved the movie and why. I went to see both sides straight away, and, "Che, part 1 and 2" is the best movie I've seen in 2008. It is, in the purity that it will remind you of the work of some of the great masters pass. Consideration for its audience is something that we no longer use. I do not know if we ever. Riveting, moving, without concessions with Benicio del Toro is just extraordinary. We can see his soul, we can actually see it. Humanity in the man is overwhelming. So thank you Martin Donovan once again to educate me so honestly. Bravo Del Toro, Bravo Soderbergh and all those involved in this film landmark. Do not commit the mistake I was about to commit. Go see it, right now, on the big screen
