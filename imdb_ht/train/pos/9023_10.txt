A very bravest, portable gale of part of the history story 2 war history, which most of us in the US have had no idea ever born. I would like to have this on video. It was only shown on t.v. once as far as I know, go back to 89or 90. I asked around for this movie, and most video stores do not even know about it. Great actress all around, wish I could see her again. Top notch series.
