In Brooklyn a century ago, rivalry between Chuck Connors and Steve Brodie and the brigade volunteer competitors led to Brodie's famous bet that he can jump to the Brooklyn Bridge. This is a story that will be accustomed to a lot of people in a bug Bunny parody, "Bugsy Bugs" from 1949. This generally very enjoyable film would probably be more widely available if it was not for the notorious scene and anxiety involved Some residents of Chinese canteen - a time capsule in antidiluvian racial attitude, gives the film a great deal of historical interest, in my view.
