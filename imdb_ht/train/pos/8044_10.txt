Firstly, this is simply the movie I've ever seen. It incorporates perfectly-timed slapstick, sexual humor, and cleverly-thought-up stand-up. But it goes deeper than that. Opole Souler is an original love story (something we do not see often) that gave me the hope that there is love out there, that two people who love each other can work in their adversity; and that such a comedy take on life (something I believe we should all have) can be accepted by people who really have trouble. Chris Meloni gives a performance as convincing as Barry Singer that he should have an oscar. The film is brilliantly written and I hope we will see more films of everyone involved in the future.
