Psylla films in extreme emotional situations, usually with violent scenes. In La Gueule, she has been dealing with the devastating effects of a woman and her husband as her dying cancer. In an amusing nos, sexual teenage sexual practices lead to violent confrontation with her family. Here we have a rather spoiled young woman who abandons her husband to take up with a sexy old man. Its motivation is a bit cloudy, since Loulou is incapable of reading or discussing anything more difficult than television shows; On the other hand, he had a fabulous body (I wonder why Depardieu never made a sports movie to show off that physical - it would have been great as a rugby player). . Isabelle Huppert is not allowed to give a bold, inexpressive performance (he has given so much); Depardieu plays Loulou with all the dynamism and charm you might want to see - the scene in the bar, where he was stabbed in the gut, ran away and sought treatment, then soon restarts with Nelly. Guy Marchand, with brown-black eyes and look distressed, Nelly's handsome hands play; it is a fine repeat of the pairing of the pair of brushes.
