The early career of Abe Lincoln is very well presented by Ford. Not that anyone alive has seen Lincoln's real footage, but Fonda, wearing a fake fake, is uneasy as Lincoln, with voice, delivery, market, and other styling - exactly as one would imagine Lincoln being. Ford, in the first of three consecutive films he made with Fonda, is at the forefront of its form, perfectly evoked America's early 19th century. The story focuses on a pair of defendants from Lincoln's murder and the court scenes are quite well done. Thrust in support includes many of Ford's regulars. This was Alice Brady's latest film, as she died months after her release.
