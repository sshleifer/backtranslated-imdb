Wow, this movie has a huge impact on me, he moved me,. It's an amazing story about a girl in Cambodia who sells sex in sex. I can not stop thinking about the fate of the girl named Holly. The setting of the movie is realistic, the movie was an eye box, I can not imagine anyone walking away from it and out wants to help make a change to this terrible issue that exsists. The movie was very moving. It was one of the best films I've seen this year. <br /> <br /> Girl playing Holly performs a fantastic job with her character. Ron Livinston gives a fantastic performance. The movie moved me into tears, saying an important message that needs to be heard worldwide. Everyone should go see this movie. I think this movie will make a difference, I loved it!
