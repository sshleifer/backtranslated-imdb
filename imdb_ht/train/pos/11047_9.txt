I would wait for some years before this movie was finally released in England, but it was in many ways very happy when I finally saw it. There are a lot of great things in the movie, for a start to act. It's not something I have all that needs a lot of a horror picture but people in this movie are all set to work fine. This and the script are always inviting and interesting, and a beautiful Lovecraftian sorta feels it, giving the movie a real backbone. Add to this the dose of surmormal nightmares and occasional Gore celebrity imagery and the films a winner. It has my favorite kind of gore too, supernatural and splattery. Also, the characters of Marcus, the transsexual cosmetic fetalist and Daisy, his mentally retarded / plaything lover is really freakish and unnerving at times and giving a far out, anything goes to the morbid essence of digging that works well with the freudian obston often. This is one of the most impressive impressions, far more shocking or outdoors than anything Hollywood can produce. Only my grave was that I wanted the finish to be darker in tone, but it still works, so on the whole I would really recommend this severe horror teaser.
