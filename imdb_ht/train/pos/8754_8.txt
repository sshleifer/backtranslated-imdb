I watched this movie 11 years ago in company with my best friend. I had my trial teeth pulled out so I did not feel very good. <br /> I ended up liking it's great time. It's a tough look if you take into account that it deals with friendship, unwanted trades, powers, money, drug trafficking, and the extreme hard situation that deals with living in a foreign prison. on its first level. Two of the women I lust the most stars and that's a good thing. Claire Danes is as beautiful and spacious as always while Kate Beckinsale is very hot and delivers a fine performance. Bill Pullman is also great and demonstrates his histrionic qualities. <br /> There are many draw twists digging out and making it an interesting visual experience. Plus it shows the hard times in Thailand. <br /> <br /> This is a weird movie. There are not many films like this one came in recent history. It should make you reflex on many things ...
