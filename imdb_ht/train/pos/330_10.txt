I'm Italian and when I was recently watching this movie I was amazed for its beauty: the first time I was 10 years old and I love it, but today I can appreciate it with adult ideas and feelings. Now I can understand it was a masterpiece of a special season in the Italian cinema (Pasolini etc.), then gone. <br /> <br /> Hollywood epic film is good ... for fun. Perhaps this 'Odyssey' had no English version because it is not enough funny ... not suitable for pop-corn and coke audiences. However suitable for Homer Pathos and Existence Reflection. <br /> In Italy recently released a very good DVD version: INTEGRAL, with excellent color. You can find it in some file sharing, but it's only Italian, and without subtitles. Too bad: also the dialogues and the voices of this movie are remarkable.
