"I love delicious perfume, it's not a long time ..." - Ralph Meeker's condemned character (Lawson) says this character Barbara Stanwyck Helen, after she gets an even breath of the smell that she has chosen out her husband in Tijuana ...! This line split me up, and also seemed like a metaphor for this movie - that cheap is better than expensive, because a cheap perfume-like man with a style and a 2 x 4 is a man Best of them are around in the long run! I agree with some of the other comments posted on Helen's Lawson Attractions. Though he claims he wants to remove Lawson, he seems to attract his fire nature, and his passion has gotten up in it could not be washed away with the tide!
