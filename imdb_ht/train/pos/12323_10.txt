This is the best Chinese film I've ever seen and, in my opinion, a lot better than Heroes or Chrouching Tiger, hidden dragons. The film is a unique combination of several genres: It's a lovely love story, action movie, comedy and horror at the same time. And the most amazing thing is that it really succeeds in all of this! <br /> This movie definitely makes it to myself 5, and should be enjoyable in every movie lover. Sequence of action has the traditional unrealistic jumping and even flying, but its way through different injections of the many hero and flying style always looks great and usually even makes sense (ghostly flying) <br /> Look at this movie or not will regret it. 10/10
