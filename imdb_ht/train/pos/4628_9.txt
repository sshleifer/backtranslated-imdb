One of the best parties in Sundance is to see movies that you would otherwise certainly miss. Unless you are a real art-house artist, you probably do not get a lot of documentaries. Only a handful of any distinguished distribution. Fortunately, Sundance has increased her commitment to documentary in recent years. Shakespeare Behind Bars is a powerful documentary on a dramatic production group at Luther Luckett Correctional Complex in LaGrange, Kentucky. Every year a group of prisoners presents a Shakespearean play. Director Hank Rogerson and his crew follow the Troop as the chosen, interpreting, repeating and finally making roles. The movie is full of fascinating revelations for those of us who have not been exposed to jail environment. Although the labels we know are not (condemned, criminal, murderers, etc.) we soon began to appreciate and respect these men as thinking of human beings. Serendipitously, the chosen play for the year of filming was the storm, and focused its penetration on forgiveness and redemption. The actors all struggle with the importance of playing in their lives, finding patterns and parallel to the characters and the meaning of the drama. For a documentary film, such as a book, the best that can be expected is that we have experienced something that changes our lives. Shakespeare Behind Bars was a personal revelation for me. "O brave new world, whose creatures are in it."
