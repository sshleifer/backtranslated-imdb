So I'm in the house, flipping channel one night, and I come across this person wearing heels and makeup, standing in front of a colored background on HBO. Of course, I did a double-take and decided I would look for a while. I did not change the channel until it ended, it was so incredible hilarious. The next time she was over, I made sure to tape her so I could watch her over and over again, and she remained one of my favorite things to watch. During the first couple of minutes, you can say that the audience is not quite sure what to think, but it quickly wins them with his incredible humor and wit. While many standing comedy mesh along my brain, Eddie Izzard stands out as one of the best. His style is incredibly worthwhile, and it is nice to hear jokes about things like history and growth when most wild comedy at current events. Show her stay with me after that. I went to Italy during the summer, and all I could think about while I was having that "Italians are still on scooters going 'CIAO ...'" 10 out of 10. Look at it. You will not regret it.
