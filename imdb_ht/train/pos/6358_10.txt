I like this movie, but it can not find what's in this movie tht is not like. Those who do not like this movie must be Richard Roeper and Roger Ebert. But I can not believe that is Mr. Carrey behind all that makeup. And I'm sure most of the actors and actresses in the movie have made films before that. And there is a new face in the movie. Taylor Momsen plays Cindy Lou Who. As you open the grinch (Jim Carrey) out of hiding. And cause some fun means in Whoville. We know that Whos they love Christmas. While Grinch does not like Christmas. And even make fun of the tiny Cindy Lou (Taylor Momsen) who is the daughter of the postmaster of the city (Bill Irwin). The film was directed by Ron Howard. And the ethnic voice made by Anthony Hopkins. And Jeffrey Tambor (Muppets Out of Space) cast as the mayor of whoville. Who does not like to talk about Grinch's close to Christmas time.
