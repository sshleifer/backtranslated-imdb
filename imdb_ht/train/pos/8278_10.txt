If you want to call or something like the great-studio horror studio that we get forced on our days do not bother. This well-written movie kept me thinking of everything he said. The importance of myths in our lives makes it meaningful, how the children interprets the world (and the violence in it), ransacking our environment and ignorance of its history and legends .. all here, but not outright on the surface. You can technically call it a "movie movie" though Wendigo does not take physical shape until the end, and then it's even up to you and your beliefs as it happens with the legendary mind / beast spirit. Some standard triller elements for people looking just for the basics and the movie is never darkened, though in fact the less you see in the animal, the better. Fessenden successfully continues the George Romero's tradition of using the genre as a parable and as a discussion forum while still keeping us recreated.
