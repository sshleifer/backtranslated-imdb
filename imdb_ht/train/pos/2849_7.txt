I can not say this movie is a disappointment because I read some reviews before watching and did not do as well as I thought it would have. The bar was not set so high, so the fact that my expectations have met is not very much. <br /> <br /> The Good: The City of New York. If you live in the city like me, you will recognize certain places and understand that the city is supposed to be more than just an environment, rather one of the main characters. There are very sensitive moments, funny conversations, and sad traits left and right that all keep things interesting. <br /> <br /> The Bad: The first thing I thought after leaving the theater was that I wanted more, but not in positive "let's want more" fashionable. Certainly the good skits / scenes surpass the bad, but there are a lot of skits that fall into the "in-between" category, too much of reality, which is what ultimately brings the movie down. Also, New York City's diversity, even though the announcement of even though the city's numerous boiler and mentioned in the film's conversation, never really realized or analyzed at the point of making the city's justice. For example, many of the sketches involve well to make middle-aged white. I mean I know the city is home to many of the demographics, but coming up, Paris Je'taime's scheme and character diversity make New York City look like Lancaster, PA, or someplace white ones. It is just disappointing to see the city shortchanged on its heritage like that. Still, even after saying this, I'd recommend giving New York, I love you a view. Who knows, maybe you will agree with my opinion and maybe you will not. You will never know until you see it for yourself. This review does not mean to discourage anyone from watching this movie, as everyone's opinion on different art. I just give you a wavy head up on what you can expect.
