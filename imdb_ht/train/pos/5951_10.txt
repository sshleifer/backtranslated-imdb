Elegantly directed, painted pictures and brilliant acting ?? Crosby's interpretation looks exactly right, Hardwicke has her best role ever, while Bendix is ​​a treat too? This Yankee appeal is universal and irresistible. One of the principals' joys in the movie, of course, is the song. As they might expect, Bing is in voice voices. And although Hardwicke's solo was cut, we can always hear him singing happy as he dances merrily with Crosby and Bendix at the famous numbers, "Busy doing nothing." He is also a hearing off Rhonda Fleming, who, although he has enjoyed a lot of scenes and concert sessions as a singer, has rarely given a chance to be heard in the cinema. She has a nice voice that over matches matches her looks like she looks very real at her costume costume Mari Dodson costumes. <br /> <br /> Director Tay Garnett gets out of most of his prodigious budgets, using all the resources in his order to present each fabulous scene as effectively as possible. (Perhaps the eclipse looks like a trifle too intelligent, but who's complaining?) <br /> In short, as the trailer actually describes, a fun entertainment from start to finish.
