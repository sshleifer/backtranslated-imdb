There was a spate in recent surfing cinemas that I seem to be hurried to run through without advance warning. I keep this treasure on digital cables this week and what a wonderful surprise it was! The focus is on the pioneers of great browsing surveys from the Greg Greg's 60 at our current Laird Hamilton, from Waimea Bay to Mavericks to Jaws. Hell, I could watch a movie just about Laird Hamilton - one of this great generation athlete - so the rest is just sauce. There are loads of good browsing browsing through and past interviews with present browsing stars, in beautiful, relaxed and fashionable fashion. In all the browsing movies I saw this story tells the big wave of the best, and I think it's my favorite. Enjoy!
