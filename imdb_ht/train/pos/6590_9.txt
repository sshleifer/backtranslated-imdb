Intelligent, wry, and thrilling, the "Invisible Man" stood out from 2000 among the Sci-Fi's usual programmers, balancing out fantasy "Farscape" toward artistic and sometimes melodramatic script and fearless, cynical cemetery and modern noir dialogue. The show was located between "Law and Order" and "Who's Who" about master of credibility, but there was no denying the fact that the "I-Man" character went beyond caricature. The same characteristic of predictability such as the keeper, the Official, and the Eberts were given repression of the formula. Paul Ben-Victor and Vincent Ventresca had a chemo that evolved and moved chic, made even more remarkable in the door-to-door team of writers and directors. The effects are never allowed to warm the sketch, and the only science sometimes narrows over the totally incredible. Points that show the show are always fun, and I have never seen these pilgrims episodes. Matt Greenberg and Sci-Fi should be congratulated, and fans are entitled to a full DVD edition of the show. Whenever I come across a marathon of "Hercules: The Legend Journeys" on Sci-Fi, I roll my eyes and sighs, mourning the excitement and possibilities of television science fiction that "Invisible Man" and its ilk represented.
