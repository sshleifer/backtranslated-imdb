Before you look, please be sure to see the night of the living dead ... This might well be the best 7 parody of the minute I've ever seen! Absurd, special effects "crappy" (the code, the code !!!), and slices slices of bread ... what more do you need ??? <br /> <br /> (do not watch this movie while eating bread ... you might get scared!)
