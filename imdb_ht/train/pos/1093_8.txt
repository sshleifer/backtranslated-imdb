I still enjoy this movie when it shows up on TV. <br /> <br /> The one scene that still stands out, for me that is, is the one with Myrna Loy and the blindman's counterintelligence, where he gives him explicit instructions on the colors and as soon as possible that he goes away and turns his man and says "Do you get that, this yellow, blue, green and white"
