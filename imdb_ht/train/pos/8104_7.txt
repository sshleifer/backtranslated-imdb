This is an amazing movie from 1936. Although the first hour is not very interesting (for the modern viewer), the stylish vision of the year 2036 that comes afterword make up for it. However, do not plan on being able to understand all of the dialogue - the sound quality and accent (it's American - but "1930s" American) makes it difficult. <br /> <br /> Basically, the story is a 100-year-old ballet looking at a US fictional city called "Everytown". It spans from 1936, when a war is on the horizon, 2036, when technology leaps forward and creates its own problems. <br /> <br /> The first one hour is a bit slowing - although it's hard to say what audience back then would have thought. The events, suspensions and visuals are very low-key in today's terms. However, when it comes to the future, it's just plain fun to look. The great and retro sci-fi groups look at everything is hard to beat. <br /> <br /> Unless you have great listening skills, this movie is hard to listen to. I think I understand only 80% of the dialogue. It might use lock-captioning. <br /> <br /> If you're a sci-fi fan, this is one of the classic genre and is a must see (well, at least after the first hour). For the average viewer, wait until there is a caption version locked and then watch it if you're comfortable with movies in that time period.
