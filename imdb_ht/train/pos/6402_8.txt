I thought this move was very good. There was a few things that were less than perfect, but in general, I was quite surprised. The court scene at the end seemed a little unrealistic, but it was real enough to be fun. I found that the movie communicates the difficulties of going even though military training and sacrifices that go along with it. When you were a military pilot I could deal with many of these parts.
