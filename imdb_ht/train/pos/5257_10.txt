I must say, this movie gives me a double personality. I said again and again to SHUT UP and start speaking as a normal person. But it is very difficult ... no by the Wang. Have you found that disgusting and disrespectful? Well, get into the mood for a lot more. This movie is just roomy! It's not a movie to show your grand parents, but you should show it to a teenager or some illegal guy at work. Anyway, go back to the voices. Fortunately this site has some ladies ladies (did anyone in the studio notice that there's supposed to be an apostrophe (?) Between ea and s?) So you can still have a little bit something to tell boss at work or cops. I have a leaflet in my wallet.
