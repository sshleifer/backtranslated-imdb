A new way to enjoy Goldsworthy's work, rivers and tides allows fans to see their work in motion. Watching Goldsworthy build his piece, one develops an appreciation for each stone, leaf, and thorns that it uses. Goldsworthy describes how flow into life, rivers, and tides are inspiring and affecting his work. Although, I was pleased to film the majority of Goldsworthy's pieces (no snowballs), I felt it was a little bit longer. The movie makers did a wonderful thing to bring Goldsworthy's work into life, and created a beautiful movie that was a joy to watch.
