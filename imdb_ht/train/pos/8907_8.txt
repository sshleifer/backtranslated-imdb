I saw this movie at night on The Night Night at Night, they do not know what to expect. I've heard of this movie, but never really any opinion about it. <br /> I must say, I was impressed with what I saw. I was really freaked out in some parts and I definitely remember jumping up in my room a few times. <br /> <br /> The goddess feared looking. Now I look at a frozen jar and wonder if he'll get himself on my hands. Steve McQueen was really good as Steve Andrews, the protagonist of the movie. I also loved the old man in the beginning. <br /> For a movie movie of 50, this was very well done even today by today's standards.
