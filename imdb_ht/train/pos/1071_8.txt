definitely need a little work in season 2. Like the virus between Max and Logan, and Ames White along with his ex, super culinary. During the two seasons, however, the only thing that caught me looked was to see if Max and Logan would ever get rid of the nasty virus infected by Max. Very good drama in season. But of course, as all TV shows, if there is something a little wrong with it, the company broadcasts take it in the air. I was seriously hoping for a third and final season. Season 2 leaves you hanging, unless you read the books by Max Allan Collins, then you'll know what's going on. <br /> <br /> Black Angel should be put back on the air for a longer season even if it might cost a lot just to get all the original actors again. Since Jessica Alba's assistant company has been escorted after the show. If that was the case, then there should be a movie completed it. just like the firefly show, which is also fake.
