The delivery of some very robust lines is by Pierce Brosnan is alone worth the price of admission. He plays a kind of "James Bond's twin brother", separate from birth, no doubt. As an intense hit-man, her character is very sexual but even better, very funny. Adding kind-hearted, uber-likable American "guy next door", Greg Kinnear, to set up contrast. The myriad places, vivid colors, and quick-witted humor give great entertainment.Hope Davis is well cast as "gem of a wife." But the concentration of the movie is on two friends, a new "Odd couple", and that is the party that works very well. There is a large (probably R-rated) laugh, and look for places where history goes a little deeper.
