I have no big fan of martial arts movie, but the video shop was almost empty and Jet It was in Lethal Weapon 4 and I got it free when the other films I'd rent, either way I rent it. I absolutely loved it, my museum and myself (22 year old Biochemistry and accounting students) spent hours in half after the movie made strange kung fu noises and sent shurikens beurat to each other. I can not explain it (well maybe a little tequila). I never enjoy Bruce Lee, slim mocking kicking off his big cock, beating him, kicking bigger cocks and then finishing movies. Think Jackie Chan and a little less comedy and more action.
