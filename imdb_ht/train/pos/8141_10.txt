I picked up the movie with no blankets and did not even know what it was, but when I watched it I laughed so hard. It is now one of my favorite movies of all time. Rusty and the guys created a masterpiece I would recommend this movie to any one with a sense of humor. Thanks to Rusty for giving us something to laugh at.
