This movie is great! Brad Pitt will never be able to act out the performance he gave to this film. Duchovny was headache, as was Forbes and Lewis. The 4 main characters embark on a scenic road tour of historic historic sites, in one of the fastest ever made cars, 1960 model Lincoln Continental. Early is a simpleton and a taste for toothbrush and carnage. She loves her women by curse or smoke, and puts PWT dresses. Duchovny and Forbes are a pair of artists from the city, while the horrors and Lewis are trailer packages from the rural neighborhoods. Though the tone of the majority of the film is black, there are plenty of funny scenes to be. Writing, directing, and acting is brilliant. If you like road movies, murders, humor, and narratives, watch this movie. Everyone delivers and you will want more when the credit is rolling. One of my favorites ever. "Hey ... hatch that dog n teaches it to hunt!"
