An American in Paris is a beautiful music on an American painter living in Paris for inspiration. She meets a rich woman who admired her painting on the street and she believes she can find her job to be even more popular to the public, e.g. in a museum. Golden Globe nominated Gene Kelly as Jerry Mulligan's artist is just perfect in both singing and specially dancing. She also meets the main girl Lycee Bouvier (Leslie Caron) who is engaged in her best friend. She can not help her feelings for this girl, even after finding out who she is engaged. Full and beautiful romance with beautiful and dance songs, this is a very good movie music. He can drag a little and his dance dancing sequence is the American at Ballet Paris, but there is a good happy ending.
