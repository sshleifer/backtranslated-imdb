I love this anime! I laughed myself off with all of the jokes and the violence (especially in hesitating Ranma in hesitating, but shortened to "fiance") so slapstick however Ranma does so worth it but tries its best to make compensation ... unfortunately . The main character Ranma goes to China to train only in the fall of the Jusenkkyo Spring curse and gets into a girl when splashed by cold water. From then on it's pure consecutive chaos. Amongst the stands are the deranged brother and sister duo of Kuno and Kodachi, the sexy shampoo, the Hervosai distort all that causes trouble for our hero / heroine. However it is Egma's father Genma Dadma's father that wind up being the culprit for the most chaos of the time. If someone wants an anime that's funny, this is the one. It's cutie and best with the Japanese dub.
