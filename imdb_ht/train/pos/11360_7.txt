Chris Gerolmo took care not only to give us a kind of Jack-the-stripper in the murdered list: he delved into the psychological characterization and convincing results. Perhaps mainly due to Stephen Rea's excellent performance playing against Donald Sutherland and good liking by both. He played in these two parts ?? above all? which made the movie something more than just a morbid account in the history of the butcher in Rostov. Supporting actors, especially Max von Sydow, carried out the parties really well. Good Direct. The photography was also good. Needless to say, the fact that the film shot in Hungary was bound to produce a couple of aberrations, but, frankly, to give the depth of the story-telling and interpretation, we can completely forget those little trivialia. <br /> <For a while, a made for TV movie from HBO came to the trumpet. Recommended, especially if you like to analyze character and forget some of the morbid scenes ?? which, I hastened to add, never exaggerated.
