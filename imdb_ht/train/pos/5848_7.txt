And I gave it a great 7 ..... <br /> <br /> Why? Because it does not quite well launch. At the time when there were so many OTHER shows about what was tied to games / this show game was unique in that it had overlapping stories. As others said here it was ahead of its time. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately this is why the show ended. They released 4 DVDs and 16 episodes of the series so far. I hope more out. <br /> How to compare it watching it now 20 years after it was first out .. I do not know I still love it despite the sometimes clunky animation, and that IMHO is the only flaw. The writing was almost in the head and in front of the competition ........ <br /> I hope for more DVDs or even a series of all episodes in proper order ... The DVDs are good, but I'm not Think about the stories in proper order, but despite this show launch.
