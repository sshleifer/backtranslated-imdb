I saw her & I love her Melissa plays her part well. It was actually credible. Brothers in law saw it with my sister & I and when I mentioned to my sister that I forgot she was based on a true story (I saw her a few years ago.) She said just because she's about all life you think its true & my two sisters & I was like it was so anyway I was wondering if someone knew what killing he was or like who was really involved was because i want to prove read it. I love live cinema especially those that are true, or just those that teach a good lesson. I thought I saw something about it a week ago, but I can not remember where any help would be appreciated.
