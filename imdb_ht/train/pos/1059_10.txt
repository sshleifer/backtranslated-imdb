I like to show this, it's sure you're a winner. Jessica Alba does a good job, it's about time we have a kick-ass girl who is not the kind of cutesy. All the cast is wonderful and all the episodes have good conspiracy. Everything is set out well, and thinking about. To put it together must be taken shortly, because it was not a person in a hurry that just slotted something together. It's a GREAT show all along.
