My favorite movie "Imperialism" and one of the best action-adventure cops in all time. Grant, McLaglen and Fairbanks dominate the screen and crap-and-crap crap to please all but the most "PC" in movie actors. Memorable scenes abound - the 3 and 20 sepiers seagulls were fighting over hundreds of thugs; MacChesney & Cutter gives Bobby Coote the spiked punch ("save some for the elephant"); Knife for MacChesney - "I'm an expedition"; Dinner breaks Knife out of prison, with a fork ("what do you think I'm trying to break out of? A bleedin 'pudding?!) And the incredible temple scene with cutie sing and then annoucing, bold like brass -" All right, you are all under arrest! "<br /> I could go on but suffice saying I try to catch this movie every time it's over. For adventurers and general, it's hard to imagine a better 2 hours.
