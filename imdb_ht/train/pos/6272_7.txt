<br /> I see once there is no man in the country (1987) - IMDB link http://us.imdb.com/Title?0093638 - and found it ok. The film is about a guy who steals only Porsches. Gone in Seventy Seconds comes 13 years later and adds anything to it. In fact, he has a lot of worthless scenes. And the finish is very, very bad. <br /> <br /> The Sphinx has a magnetic screen presence that should have been best used ...
