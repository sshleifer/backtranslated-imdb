I rent dominoes on a whim, not even knowing it was inspired by a true story, and even though it's the least likely and true biopic you'll probably see. I find it to be rather awesome. <br /> With Richard Kelly writes it bash along a mass of cemetery and narration of 2 hours of pure entertainment. And once you've seen it more than once you get it and appreciate it. <br /> <br /> Domino is a model bounty hunter who leaves Hollywood's perfect life to pursue a career by subtle or perfect. It has a style travel style style by Tony Scott. With fast music and editing, it provides the visual rocket to keep your attention, with slick performance and unexpected comedy, the movie is well-done and enjoyable and should reach a wider audience. <br /> I suggest it to anyone who wants to think and be entertained at the same time for 2 hours.
