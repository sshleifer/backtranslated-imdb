In all honesty, this series is as much a classic (as television goes) as the original poem is in the world's literature. Far from criticizing exploitation, it is a beautiful rendering and respect of one of the cultures defined by the western culture. <br /> <br /> I moved to the combat in Odysseus with his followers; touched by the drama of the fall of Troy (felt, but is not seen); intrigued by the way the gods are played and the fate of mortal. (It should be mentioned that the gods appear here are not ridiculous CGI beings that flitting around on their ankle wings, or modest patterns that are not thrown into bikini. As Homer works, they act in mortal agents or, rarely, represent by classic status). <br /> It's a pity it's not available in DVD, especially the inferior and cheesy adaptations of the Odyssey that one can find in video store.
