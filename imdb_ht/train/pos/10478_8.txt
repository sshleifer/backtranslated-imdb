This is definitely a 'must see' for those who occasionally smoke a reefer in the secret-out secret, trying to avoid being held by parents, teachers, police, etc. ... The protagonist is a lady of her quarantine, living in her castle, breeding orchids, and absolutely unaware of the fact that her husband so-called rich and truthful actually breaks and cheats on her. When it all suddenly dies, it confronted the truth. The governor comes by telling him that he is in a big debt. He does not know what to do, until his garden tells him about the recent success of marijuana in Britain. She decides after some long thoughts to get rid of her flowers and start breeding skin instead ... The story is quite original, the outstanding performances! I can only think of a few movies that made me laugh more than this one. Still, the melodramatic touch is present. The movie is typical of British: jokes are not vulgar, there is no violence involved. It should not be mentioned that it recommended to have taken a few drafts before watching 'saving favors'. It will be more fun! Especially the scene with the 2 old ladies in store was they are hilarious. I thought my jawbones would burst. 9/10
