This film is like an alienation of the gospel. It has such direct and innocent honesty that you can not possibly believe it did after the world war when Italy was devastated and devastated, and it was filled with a large, homeless population. It is a monument of the best qualities of the human spirit, as well as the endless creative resources of this country of inspiration. Toto is a character like the Doestoevisky Idiot, a modern Christ to find his way to a great city. It is goodness and purity strengthened by love, and its acts change the people it encounters, as many as the miracle works pigeons. The story is said in a natural way with simple style, yet imbued with a magic that is almost a priority of Fellini's smile fantasy. It is one of the most inspiring movies ever made.
