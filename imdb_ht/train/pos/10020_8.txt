The legendary Boris Karloff ended his illustrious career by making four flickers cheap flags in Mexico. This is the period mentioned Gothic horror period from the bunch. Karloff gives a typical performance and dignity as Matthias Morteval, a unique elderly patriarch who invites several of his petty, greedy and backbiting non-counting families to creep his anger to read a willingness. Just soon invited to lovers getting bumped off by lethal life-sized people who populated the place. Onetime Mexican gender symbol Andres Garcia in the "Tintorera" infamy shows superbly polished lobbying and Julissa looks absolutely ravishing as the single girl's reliable character. Clunky, plodding (non-directional), non-to-the-number script, ugly, wash-out cinematography, piece kill killer ridiculous (a grit coarse fat gets dried right in the face by a miniature cannon!), Too many string notes, morbid atmosphere-bankruptcy atmosphere, largely disgusting act (Karloff noticeably except), mild cheesy, poor duplication and rousing fire conclusion all lime lobsters enjoy this awesome endearingly cruddy and hence strange weird ratty charm. A real camp camp.
