It's not easy to make a movie with 18 different stories in it. Although 18 different international directors have taken the challenge, not everyone is good, some of them even boring. But in his entity, "Paris, je t'aime" is breathtaking, showing that, as "Actually Love" puts it, 'love is all around', especially in the city of love. Here is a resume (I will try to make in as a shaver-free as possible) of the 18 different stories. <br /> <br /> MONTMARTRE - kind of a dull opening sequence, nothing really special about it. A man finds a parking spot and sees a lot of odd couples walking in, asking why he can not find a girl. And then, suddenly, a woman discourages next to her car ... <br /> <br /> QUAIS OF SEINE - another enough sequence, about three young boys who are looking for some 'pieces of ass', when suddenly a Muslim girl tour right ahead, receiving help from one of the boys. Really basic, but with a sweet heart of it. <br /> <br /> WHEN MARRIAGE - this was a great disappointment! Although a love story between two boys and an artsy background could be interesting by the great Sant Center. Eventually, everything that comes after the monologue by Ulliel is good, everything before it's just annoying. <br /> TUILERIES - a fun sequel by the Coen brothers. Buscemi - without even saying a word - is mesmerizing and the entire sequence is just hilarious. This one keeps me hooked until the very end, and this one also gets you really tuned in the movie. <br /> <br /> LOIN DU 16IEME - a nice story too, though the execution is poor, the heart has. It is the story of a Spanish woman who drops her child early in the morning, caring for another suburban baby. Beautiful. <br /> <br /> Porte de choi - this segment has to be the weird and weird of the whole movie. Some types of shampoo salesman come to a Chinatown-lookalike location in Paris. If I understand it correctly, the story is about interior beauty, but I think I'm wrong. <br /> <br /> BASTILLE - a really wonderful sequel. A man encountered his wife in a restaurant, breaking up with him, so that he can run with his mistress. But the wife has some devastating news. Pretty basic, but really sad and beautiful! PLACE OF VICTOIRES - a sad sequence as well. Juliette Binoche plays a miserable mom. One night she woke up to hear her dead child. When she came to the place, a cowboy told her that she could give her a last bath for her baby. One of the best segments! TOUR EIFFEL - Two fall of love could be great, but even if it has some nice cinemas tricks, the story is not intriguing and not funny at all. <br /> <br /> PARC MONCEAU - a truly original and great sequel, the best one in the movie! A young girl and an older man discuss their future and fear someone ... Cuaron does a great job, and the actors are amazing! QUESTION OF THE ROUGE INFORMATION - an American actress (Gyllenhaal) has fallen in love with his drug dealer. a beautiful segment again, with a very sad sad place pleasing - a woman comes to a homeless man and starts talking her boyfriend ... because he's the love of his life. Beautiful, sad, shocking, romantic, ... Place des FÃªtes will make everyone cry. <br /> <br /> PIGALLE - a boring sequence between Ardant and Hoskins, who are looking for new emotions in their relationships ... very pigalle is a let-down. "The quartier of the Madeleine - bring some diversity into the movie, QdlM is a relief. A young guy (Wood) finds a vampire killing a victim ... The tourist and the vampire ... fall In love, Black, scary and unfriendly romantic, Madeleine is superb. <br /> <br /> PERE-LACHAISE - another kite-down segment. Reyinated by Wes Craven and star as Mortimer and Sewell, she could have been great, but FOUR-Lachaise is just ordinary, not original at all. <br /> <br /> FAUBOURG SAINT-DENIS - The rumors are true, the Short Film Twicker is beautiful, stunning and well done. in, and heard from his girlfriend (Portman - really stunning) that he broke up with him and reflected on their relationship. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> and has stars like Rowlands, Gazzara and Depardieu, this segment is a let-down too. There is nothing happening, lack of chemistry between actors. <br /> <br /> 14th ARRONDISSEMENT - The recent sequences and is hilarious a Sad at the same time, an American said in his French class on his trip to Paris. Her Frenchman is really horrible, but at the end of the segment, she realizes that Paris is so much more than satisfying the eye. <br /> <br /> With Feist on the background, "Paris, Eyes" ends in a sweet tone, do not let me down at all, though some segments bored the hell out of me, the entity The movie is great! A true cinematic experience for young and old. Paris, je t'aime vraiment!
