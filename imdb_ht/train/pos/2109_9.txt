I spent several times watching this since I figured it was some mute, vampire, dated comedy romance. Well, it's a romantic comedy, and maybe a little dated. However, it's not too sentimental, touching as it does on term of office policy, adultery, and loneliness. You think you know exactly where things are headed, but there is an element of unpredictability that keeps your interests, and not everything turns out well as you expected. But there is enough understanding and charm that earns cynic most late. If you encounter someone who does not like this movie, seriously consider how you want to know them.
