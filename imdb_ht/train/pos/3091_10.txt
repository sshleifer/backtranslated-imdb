This show is totally worth watching. It has the best cast of talent I've seen in a very long time. The situation in the show is unique and fresh (I guess the executives of ABC are not used too, as it was not another reality show). However this show was credible with charming characters and wonderful story lines. I probably do not belong to the age group to expect the show, as I am in my 40's, but a lot of my friends also loved it (late 30's - in the mid-40's) and are dying for show quality and talent cast members. I do not think this show was enough time to get a hearing. I believe that more time this show would do very well. Again ABC does not provide a real-show and real-time real chance. With many shows giving chance after luck and not nearly worth it! They need to provide quality to show a real chance and time to really click and get an audience. I really love the characters and look forward to watching each episode. I watched the episodes on ABC video and the show kept getting better and better. Although I think to be our one more episode (Issue 13?). We want to see what we can! ABC drumming with emails and letters and see if it is possible to save this show from extinction. He certainly worked for Jerico. There are some things just worth saving and this show is definitely one of them. SIGN PETIT ONLINE FOR ABC: http://www.PetitionOnline.com/gh1215/petition.html
