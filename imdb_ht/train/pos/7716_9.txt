There is a good reason Walter Pidgeon warns Leslie Nielson and his crew to rescue ship, something he does not dream about. <br /> As Dr. Edward Morbius, Pidgeon is the ultimate survivor of an expedition that came to this planet 20 years earlier. From that time he married another member of the expedition and had a daughter, Anne Francis. They are the only people left on this planet who once was the home world of an ancient civilization known as Krell. <br /> <br /> The records as deciphered by Pidgeon indicate the Krell reaches a Kazaklism finish of unknown origin. The cars left behind still operate. Maybe operate too well as members of the relief party begin to die and in a particular horrible manner. I see all kinds of speculation about a rumor and this one movie is noticed because it's as cool as it was in 1956. The terms would change, we would now say speed chain instead of third-party courtesy of the popularity of durable in Star Trek. <br /> <br /> We can not see the men in the rescue expedition of a flying saucer like space ship. It might look a lot more like the Vessel Enterprise or the ship from 2001 Space Odyssey. It is interesting to watch science fiction films from different generations and see how the concept of the future is changed. The Story Behind Banned Planet is a timeless one, about deadly beings trying to play God. /> <br /> You can not write on planet forbidden without commenting on the Robby Robot. This mechanical mechanics, joined by Pidgeon and the knowledge it came from studying Krell was quite back in hit the day. He has a new lease of life in the sixties and the Robo character lost in space. Its scene with Earl Holliman who plays the cooking on the space ship and adheres to Earl's request for some home smiles very funny. Robby and other special effects were nominated for an Oscar, but lost the Ten Commandments and split into the Red Sea. Bad weather banned the planet running against a Hollywood founder like Cecil B. DeMille. <br /> <br /> Classicists amongst you will recognize banned planets as a futuristic rhythm of the storm when you think it might have been one Shakespeare's venture into science fiction. <br /> <br /> My favorite among the cast is Warren Stevens that sacrifice allows Leslie Nielsen to learn exactly what he has to deal with. <br /> Never miss this one every time it's broadcast.
