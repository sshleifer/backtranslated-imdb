Soap Opera on a small town of married woman (Kay Francis) who works in the local locker, performs as the leading lady in her local playhouse, but dreams become a star on Broadway. When a famous actor who is a ham, a van, and a womanizer of boots, came to town and visited him in his room and dreamed of giving him advice to him - he pretended to swallow his "manager" 'tricking him into believing he has all taken hands "experience" to become a great star. Her husband finds out with the punch guy who can cause unexpected death of the actor - leading to a murderous and even more unexpected judgment: a life imprisonment for snowman. Next thing you know she's joined by a Burrlesque show's show hoping that in one day she does it at Broadway and makes enough money to get her man's freedom - all the while the baby is sleeping in a trunk! There is a very interesting plot, well, a bit far-fetched maybe, but very melodramatic (with tons of melodramatic music sure to get it) - all * many * strengthened by the strong, emotional emotion given by Francis - she just made this movie. Also helping here the act is well done by Minna Gombell in her role as a "getting near forty" older lady who works Burlesque and Home befriends. Worth to see, especially for Francis Francis fans.
