Running from the rented films, I picked up Freebird. I pleaded in the first third of the film to ask if the rest would be a waste to see. Fortunately, he really warmed up, and I loved the movie quite a bit. The second half of the film made me grinning and laughing the whole time. Fortunately, although the included CGI bits have not been overdone or prevalent. <br /> I should say, though - the actors all have heavy European accents, so they have been warned if you have trouble understanding these voices or cultural humor. <br /> I really love this movie, and will have to order myself a copy for my own collection.
