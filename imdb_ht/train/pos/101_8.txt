IMDb this list as 1972 for some reason, but the other sources I've seen including the excellent notes score it as '68. Not really having trouble, except that it's very interesting to watch the abstract collage of films and videos (one of the first artwork of the merger of the apparently) in the context of the Star Gate sequence in 2001, released the same year. Abstraction is not really my thing, but I can take it in small doses with the super-saturated optical scanning colors and psychedelic feel in this series of flowers, Rohrschach blots, birds, etc. is very compelling and quite nice. Certainly helped to pave the way for many other video artists inherent in the 70s, and deserve to be best known.
