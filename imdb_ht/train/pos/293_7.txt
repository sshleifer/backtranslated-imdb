What could be more schlocky than the idea of ​​вЂ <вЂ <private detective involved and the women are supposed to spy on? And most of the dialogue as writing is parental banal. But the actors turn the dialog into something that makes sense. You can see real people behind the real lines. And the LED is wonderful. Every scene does what is just and ends without dragging too long. I showed this to many friends in the mid 80s because I was embarrassed by how these bad materials can be done in such a good movie. Friends liked it too.
