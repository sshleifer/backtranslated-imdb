Back to Cabin by the Lake is Maybe One of the few Sequels that can live up to the Original. She has Black Humor, Good Suspension, Looking Looking Girls, and of course, a Psycho Assassin. What do you lack? I do not think anything. Except we're leaving with a small amount of gore and nudity because he did for TV. In addition to being the best one, it is one of the best scissors to look like a family. Recommended for everyone.
