Here, on IMDb.com I read an opinion, that Gray Owl is the best character in Pierce Brosnan ever made. I do not know if she had better or worse roles, I'm not her fan, but this one was really exceptional. <br /> <br /> The other thing - but impressive to the film director. I give my respect. Tranquility, beauty and spirit in deserts were really exlusively illustrated, I never encountered such proximity to any previous film. Another thing left in my mind after the movie - this is the movie, the closest to the original book, and atmosphere of it. <br /> <br /> And bit more. I pay my respect to the original Gray Owl.
