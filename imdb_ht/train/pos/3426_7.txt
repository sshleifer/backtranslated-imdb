This is no criticism of the movie, but rather a comment on how our blindness is past. I just saw the Winter Soldier, and the Ground truth was like watching a rumor or end - except it was on Iraq rather than Vietnam. Like Winter Soldier because it is one-sided message, both illustrated film how gleefully we rush to engage in conflict-based fraudulent conflicts, and allow our youth and brave (and often naive) to suppress this profiteering vicious war. Both films effectively show that the mentality was forced into young minds and wanted them to be effective killers, but the training fell to the courage to teach diplomatic skills and policemen needed to effectively win the hearts and minds of people they supposedly fight for . This is ultimately what lost the war in Vietnam, and will likely lose the war in Iraq as well. <br /> <br /> I only negative comment is that the movie is so one-sided it might easily be in as propaganda left. Not me, your idea, but not those who aim to discredit the movie and message. A more balanced point of view could talk to a great audience.
