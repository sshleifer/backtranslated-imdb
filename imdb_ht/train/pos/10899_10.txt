I laugh so hard during this movie my face hurt. Ben Affleck was hilarious and reminded me of a pretty Jack Black boy in this role. Gandolfini gives his typical performance. The entire cast is funny, the very good story and the awesome comic moments. I went to this movie by waiting a lot so maybe that's why I was amazed to be surprised from the film quite happy and exhausted. I would recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys comedy, can be identified with loneliness during the holidays and / or set up with families. The best part of this film (to me anyway) was the subtle bits of humor that kept me completely off guard and I was laughing long after the rest of the hearing was stopped. Namely, the scene involves the lighting of the Christmas tree. Go see it and you have a good laugh!
