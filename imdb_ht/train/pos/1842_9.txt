Series 2 was taken at a great start! I do not think you need to watch the series 1 to find a hand in what's happening, but like any of its beautiful series feel some sense of the characters and care about what's going on. And this show makes you think like that! These 4 30-something women seem to lead celebrity and exciting life again the quotation is credible and realistic. So the twists and turns that happen thanks to their love and sex life are interesting look, but also you know that these are issues that happen to real women too. It's about our decisions as women and how sometimes we are leading down certain paths in our lives rather than awareness of these choices!
