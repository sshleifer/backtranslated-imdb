His brightness is uncontrollable, but his mania and failure have hurried to his growth in all aspects of his life. Natalia (Emily Watson) is a lovely heiress that came to the same resort with her mother, Vera (Geraldine James) in scope out possible marriage partners. Vera leaned toward a beautiful but amazing count, Natalia is much more fascinated by Sascha, whom she met in a walk. Sascha, too, is taken with Natalia and proposes marriage in second meetings. But with the concentration that Sascha must give the matches to failure and, with other captivals in the past, it still causes the problem, will it win the heart of Natalia? Oh, and it can become champion of ladies, too? This is a beautiful movie, based on a novel by Nabokov. The act is amazing, and Watson is very good as the beautiful girl rich girl and Turturro perfection uttered as the shy, awesome chess enthusiast. James gives quite a nice turn as the mother overbearing and the other cast members are wonderful as well. As for the movie look, it might not be best. The scenery is in the set-your-eye-out variety, the gorgeous vintage costumes and the cinematography are worthy of great applause. Yes, the story is strange and said with the use of flashbacks, at times, making it a movie not everyone will appreciate. Then, too, the end is bitter. However, if you love romance, piece periods, great acting, scenery scenery, or the fine art of motion picture creation, do not miss this one. You will be the defense to resist the mob of charms.
