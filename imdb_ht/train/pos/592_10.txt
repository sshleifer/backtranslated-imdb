At Arlington Heights, IL we never had a cafeteria at any of the elementary schools (1961) so I went home my bike at school for lunch and always watch this game. True, I was 11, but I thought it was the biggest thing about! I would draw pictures hidden on my board and see if my family or friends can find it. I also note there are wonderful cars (Pontiac or Oldsmobile) if the competitor got the final picture hidden game. I even had the home version! <br /> I wonder why this game lasted for a while. I liked the music and the hidden pictures - the only one I could ever find was the lemon hidden as part of a bridge on a field stream. <br /> <br /> These good memories are connected with camouflage.
