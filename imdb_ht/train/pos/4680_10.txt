Terfic movie and a walk start slow - give it a chance to start cooking. History builds in interest and complexity. Character and surveillance scenarios are expected and clich√© throughout the right moments. New York City's Superb - fearless, real - is a fantastic antidote of commercial imbalances of "Sex in the City" - in fact, the movie is an antidote to the HBO / Hollywood notion in New York City, sex and relationships. It's an unusual movie that treats its characters honestly and compassionately. Love it! Great cast and remarkable performances by Steve Buscemi, Rosario Dawson, and his favorite interest (forget her name!).
