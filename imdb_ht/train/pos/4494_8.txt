As a native of Bolton, this film has obvious appeal to me. Where vaccines are fascinating and show a lot of transplant Bolton - there are a number of scenes of apparent appearance, but this shows the city being rebuilt - with the idea that the old man must make way for the new is right at the heart of this movie. A little miscast James Mason drives an enjoyable ensemble in a story about a fuss about a spiral herring in a full-blown generation, then a smaltly smmaltzy resolution. Though I'm a bit too young to remember it completely, the minutiae in Lancashire lives in the 60s are all here: cashing up on a Friday, piano round singer, Sunday constitutional, good adjoining, overlapping of massacred, massive The importance of respect for yourself, and I was pleased to see Naughton's drunken line from the play left intact. There is no doubt that this movie should be made available on DVD - it is well-crafted and most perform well.
