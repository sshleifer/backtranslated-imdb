Unfortunately, this film has long been available (as the other posters were noted), but this is one of the essential drama of the Great Depression, a lyrical drama and touch of love set in a shanty town. It features performance by Spencer Tracy and Loretta Young who are just about the finest of their careers, and it's an exemplary example of how Director Borzage, Frank Borzage, could create an almost fairy-tale Aura around the elements of poverty, crime, and inequality. Horrendous social, which just proves how genuinely romantic and spiritual talent was. This movie shows how love survives among critical and desperate needs, and is totally life-affirming. This is a real masterpiece of the period, and it is a movie that deserves to be more widely known.
