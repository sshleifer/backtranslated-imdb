Reading some of the comments on the message frame here I was expecting this movie to be a complete getaway - but when I was watching it I could not stop laughing! It has officially become my new favorite movie. <br /> I do not know what all the hate here is over, maybe it's because a movie of this kind has never been around before. I am at a loss in the name of another completely comedy female comedy. Many comedies will have one or two actors in the lead, but there will be a lot of support to male characters. This one was almost every woman - with the exception of Seth Meyers, Justin Hartley and the brief appearance of Will Arnett - and she worked. All actresses deliver very funny performance (especially Missi Pyle) from an original and lovable script. The charm of this film, in my mind, seems to be in her subtle feminist message: accepting who you are, successful female in the public sphere, female friend and sex roles. Light-hearted though it is, each of the lead characters faces a challenge as their attempts to be more 'fun' conflicts with their feminist values ​​and who they themselves know to be. <br /> <br /> Missi Pyle proposes that this movie lacks a theater release because of its all-female cast and lack of a great actor actor to get the studio behind him, and I have to agree. Everyone I recommended this movie liked it and I think it's a shame that a comedy celebrated female dorkiness was not widely accepted and successful. <br /> I highly recommend this movie to anyone who has an open mind or a love of women-centered comedy.
