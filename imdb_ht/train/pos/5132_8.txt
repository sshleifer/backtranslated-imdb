African jazz will be this classic short treasure that shows some of the best guys in jazz just doing things. It's like watching a music band today. But the guys give us an additional treaty of people in Marie Bryant who sings a classic version of Sunny Side on the street. I never heard her song before, Bryant sounded considerably like Billie Holliday. This is a compliment to folks. The instrumental tasks are top as well. With the black cinema in its time feeding a lot of white stereotypes, this film is to look and treasure. No great production value, just a lot of good music.
