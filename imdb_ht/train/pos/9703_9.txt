One of the best comedy series ever from Great Britain. Mark Gatiss, Reece Shearsmith and Steve Pemberton are terrific actors and similar performers at home and drama as well as with comedians. Ably was supported by Jeremy Dyson written writers, having peopled the series with the most memorable characters in recent years. Little Britain Britain's palace of insignificance as a poor imitation of their ideas. My original and inaugural consistency is sure that as many people hate such series as their love but I am equally sure no one could have no opinion on LOG. I have yet to see the film length feature but I have heard good things and bad things so I'll reserve judgment. The original radio series from which LOG came was as innovative as the TV series came. I do not know if the TV series did it in the U.S., but I should be captured to see how American audiences have found the weird hegemony of the humor
