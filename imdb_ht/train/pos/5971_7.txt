Skippy from family relationships goes from clean-cut metal kid in this cheesy movie movie. The film looks like he did in response to all those angry parents who claimed metal music turned their children wrong or killed themselves - except in this one a dying star satan metal trying to return out in the tomb (using Skippy help). And while the draw is corny and clich√©, the corniness (for example, a bad green fog takes on a girl's dress) and the soundtrack are what makes the movie for hilarious (and great). And of course, nothing like Ozzy Osbourne plays a preacher in wondering what happened to love :). Definitely a movie to have a few friends on for a good laugh. And while you're in it, make it a dual feature and Slumber Party Massacre 2 - there's an "evil rocker" (as indicated on the video box) bloodthirsty slasher in black leather w / fringe. A must see for cheesy cheesy fans.
