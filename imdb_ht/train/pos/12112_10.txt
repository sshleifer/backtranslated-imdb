This animated series is on bread, in everything to base a draw on! I'm really laughing. The main character has a special loaf of power that he has designed with, and goes to school baking bread. I wish it was available on DVD, and it does not matter whether it's subtitled or armed - it's good. Even the theme song alone is funny. At one point in the theme song, there is an African-Japanese man with a horse Afro, touching a French baguette as if it were a samurai sword. These images will not make sense unless you see the animation. You will laugh until your side is hurt. It is definitely the most unique animated I've seen so far.
