Rated E (Violence). <br /> I had the original Spiderman game for the PC for a couple of years now. I still have not beat it because on Windows XP have a glitch on a level that I cant beat because of it. warns if you have XP. But for those who do not have XP give this game a try.Its a fun own family game with its big action for any spiderman fan.In the game you play Spiderman and you take on various criminals type of crime. Spiderman is a fun little game and I recommend it to any Spiderman fan or a parent wants a fun, own game for kids. <br /> <br /> 8/10
