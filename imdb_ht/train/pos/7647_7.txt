Ok, so he borrowed a little bit of "It's a wonderful life", but that was 44 years before this film, so why not a new attempt. Belushi has a 35th rotten anniversary. He did not find his wheaties, his coffee, he lost his job. The hood is when its own describes "big blue pieces of sh **" crushing machine at the end of the day. She headed in an empty bar to call for a tow. While waiting, he was recognized by the bartender (Caine) as the kid who lost the game baseball championship game 20 years earlier. This gets him to think how life would have been if he won the game. He finds out when he does not know, Caine serves a Petion movement in a glass that gives him a castle, the bullet queen (Russo) as his wife and make him president of the sporting goods company he was in the box. Caine later reveals himself as one of those responsible for this change, but Belushi is not entirely on board. He never completely adjusts, and in a non-slain scheme development but is still odd, he tries to court his wife (Hamilton) from his real life, who is now married to another person. The good move is that they do not spend too much time on it, as basically are the "Ghost" RIP, and Belushi is still saying Hamilton the only thing he could know. He also brought in a dramatic hokey element, as two of his lovers in the shadow of the shadows, new Russo wives, and his unlucky Cox lover. But the keys to the movie are the beginning a bit long, with the best end. Also good work from the big cast and recognition, as Belushi is very likable, very attractive ladies choose, and Caine is perfectly easy to go like the title guy. Strangely this was Belushi's second film in 1990 dealing with receiving an alternative life of wealth, which was found in "taking care of business". Though the same, both films are on the same level of laughter. So, check out this for a fun exploration of "what if?"
