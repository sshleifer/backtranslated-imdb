And I thought the main opponent looked really menacing!, But the duplication was simply awful !. The character development is the highest average for this sort of thing!, And the main battle is simply fantastic!, Some of the Jackie climbs to take in this one are harsh! There are a lot of really funny and humorous jumps in this, but it amazed me, and the finish is hilarious!, The more all the characters are quite likable. It's very good looking but generally very well done, and while it does not have the amount of battles you would expect from a Jackie Chan flicker, it does enough to keep you watching, more one of my favorite moments in this movie The is when Jackie (Dragon) and Wai-Man Chan (Tiger), are playing around with a rifle and go on !.

Jackie Chan is amazing as always, and amazing here, it is very enjoyable, hilarious, as usual to perform some crazy stunts, there was fantastic chemistry with Wai-Man Chan, chasing that ass, and playing this cute cock character singing, it was amazing! , I just wanted to stop lining it!
