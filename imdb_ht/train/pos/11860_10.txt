This movie has it all. It is a classic tradition of events that surround the migration of thousands of Cuban refugees. Antonio Montana (played by Al Pacino), is just one of the thousands finding a chance to choose his destiny in America. Cinematic presentation is still very accurate at the Miami Drug Empire is amazing. Brian DePalma does an amazing job that's leading this picture, so the viewer gets involved with both the storyline, as well as every character of the cast. With Tony's character's presence being credible and strong, Brian DePalma broke out the raw talent exhibited by Steven Bauer (Manny, Best Friend Tony), Mary Elizabeth Mastantonio (Tony's Gina,), Robert Loggia (Frank , Tony's Boss) and Michelle Pfeiffer (Elvira, wife Frank). I enjoyed every minute watching this movie, and always watch it on a weekly basis. In this year, the 20th anniversary of this classic crime movie, I for one is a true believer in another 20 years people will still refer this movie to amazing numbers. With other movie cinemas being so dramatic I get, this film is a hit in the system.
