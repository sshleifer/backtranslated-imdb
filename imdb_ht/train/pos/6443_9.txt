Yesterday I watched this movie for the third time. He recommended me not a fry several weeks ago. I never looked or even noticed it before, because it fell (so typically) in the category "Swedish movie" and those who rose (like me) and Hollywood productions tend to be uncertain of any foreign movies. Hell is a paradigm shift! The film touched me, because he just kept up my hope, that humanity could change in a better way. The Swedish village is just a template for all areas of the world where people live together - controlled by religion, misunderstandings, lack of courage, prediction, disguised brutality but also the ability to have fun, to meet, sing ... It takes a trigger from the outside ripen to the masks of everyone (which holds one) and let them feel that we are all just human beings and the desire to live our own lives. I can never stop seeing such stories, because, which keeps my hope as described above. The five minutes of the story of Gabriella's song including his performance is one of my movie-ever movies! Thanks to Pollak's house just for 5 minutes, which made me happy!
