WWV last year's PPV in 2006, proved a hit with the fans, but for a reason only, the ladder match was only scheduled to be Paul London and Brian Kendrick against William Regal and Dave Taylor. But with the recent PPV PPV December Dismember, WWE knew he did something to get the fans talking again, this proved helpful when it introduced the MNM and Boyz to the Hardy mixed and announced that The match was going to be a match ladder. <br /> <br /> The match was brutal with one of the best ladder ladders I've ever seen, but Joey's face was a total mess. Johnny Nitro did not even check on his partner, they just carried on like nothing happened, and Taylor and Regal did nothing during the match except to hit those with some shots ladder. At the end of London and Kendrick duplicate titles. <br /> <br /> Elsewhere on Kane's show MVP beat in a decent inference match when it put MVP's stupid costume on fire. Chris Benoit fell to Chavo Guerrero in a decent match, Gregory Helms defeated Jimmy Wang Yang to hold the WWE cruiserweight title in a solid effort. <br /> <br /> But the main event was a total mess, King Booker partnered with Finlay taking John Cena and Batista. This action was keen and nobody cared for Batista who was chosen for his partner. The overall result: Kane defeated MVP in an inferno match. Paul London and Brian Kendrick kept WWE team teams against the Hardy Boyz, MNM and David Taylor and William Regal in a ladder match. Chris Benoit defeated Chavo Guerrero holding the U.S. title in a decent match. Gregory Helms defeated Jimmy Wang Yang to hold the Cruiserweight Championship. <br /> <br /> Boogeyman has beat Miz in a terrible match. <br /> <br /> The Undertaker defeated Mr Kennedy in a last ride match. John Cena and Batista defeated Booker and Finlay in an abusive match. <br /> <br /> Overall Grade - B
