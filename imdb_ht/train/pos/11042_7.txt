In a penitentiary, four prisoners occupying a cell: Carrier (Gérald Laroche), who used his company to commit a fraud and betrayed by his wife; Lassalle's split (Philippe Laudenbach) and his Protector, late Purchase (Dimitri Rataud), who ate his six-month siblings; and the intellectual Marcus (Clovis Cornillac), who killed his wife. One night, Carrere finds an ancient newspaper hidden in a hole in the cell wall. They realized that the book was written by Danvers (Geoffrey Carey) at the beginning of the last century and is about black magic. They decided to read and use their content to escape from the prison, when they found the truth about Danvers's fate. "Maléfique" is an original, intriguing and claustrophobic French low-budget horror movie. The story is practically in the same place, there are no cliches and hook the attention of the viewer until the last stage. I'm a big fan of French movies, usually romance, drama and police history, but I've noticed that recently I've seen some good French horror films, such as "Un Jeu d 'enfants", "Belphegor" and "Dead End". My vote is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Sense of sin" ("The bad sign")
