This is a great movie! Most of us saw Jurassic Park, where The Chaos Theory summarized by saying on the wings of a butterfly, causing a tornado on the other side of the planet. Well, Bug is all about that (or at least something, do not worry this is no spoiler) I'm definitely not a kind of religious and does not believe in pre-destiny stuff, fate, etc., but this movie surely makes you wonder if coincidence really exists ... <br /> <br /> The more, the acting and the cameras are excellent too, another proves that it's still possible to make a good movie without a zillion bucks
