To be honest, I went to see this film back, did not expect that much, but hey, I was not deceived myself, I had a good time. <br /> I'd say this movie is a cool breeze, despite some fact that they tried to upgrade Nancy Drew, but this made me remember these young films in the 60-70s from Europe and Quebec, where they manage to have children getting interact with adults. In this case, a 16 year old teenager trying to do justice does not try to solve a mystery about the death of an actress who died 25 years ago. Anyway, just as his father had business in Hollywood, why not rent a home with a mystery behind the doors? Well, at least Emma Roberts does a great job here. Kinda like the chubby kid, who first was naively brought to support his sister tour of Nancy, but in the end, they found Nancy quite cool to stick with him, even with his affair ... The rest of the support was great, he was pleased to see Rachael Leigh Cook in a different role this time: a single mother (he did it to Family Relief, but this time she plays a mature woman. .) Anyway, donâ € ™ t not this dump, it's fun!
