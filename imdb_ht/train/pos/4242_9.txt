I read the book and see the movie. Both excellent. The film is diamond among charcoal during this era. Liebman and Selby dominate the screen and communicate the intensity of the characters without flaws. This movie should make the stars. Shame on the studio not to put everything behind this film. It could easily be a franchise. Release on DVD is a must and a worthy reminder would revive this movie. Look for it in your TV guide and if you see it listed, no matter how late, watch it. You will not be disappointed. Make yourself another favor - read the book (same title). It will blow you away. The Times have changed dramatically since these days, or at least we like their thoughts.
