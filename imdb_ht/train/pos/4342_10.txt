This movie did not really surprise me, as such, it just got better and better. I thought: "Paul Rieser wrote this, hh ... well ... we'll see how he does ..." Then I saw Peter Falk in it. I appreciate Colombo. Even though I was never a big fan of the show, I still loved watching Peter Falk. <br /> <br /> Performances Peter and Paul were so natural that I felt like a flying on the wall. They played off at each other so well that I practically felt giddy and fun! ... And I did not even drink! <br /> This movie was so well done that I wanted to get right on Paul's phone and let him know how much I loved it! but I could not find his number. Must have a name or something. <br /> This was one of those movies that I had no idea what he was going to do about or who was in it or anything. She just came up and I thought: "Eh, why not? Let's see if I do not like it - I do not have to look it ..." ... and I just finished it!
