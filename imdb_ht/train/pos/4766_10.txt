It is strange to see a film where the performance of a single actor is so good that one can feel that the movie should be of little interest, if any, without his presence. - In fact, there are many scenes that seem to be shot too fast and neglected - a seemingly low budget, a strange plot on a man who wants to take the place of a tireless priest and another week point, the presence of Pierre Fresnay is so impressively that one gets shocked from the very start of the terrible end. <br /> I have never seen or seen the future of a better performance, Paul Paul Scofield acts in "A Man for All Seasons" .. Actually they might consider the end though ridiculous if Fresnay was playing the priest who returned to church when he committed a crime. <br /> "I am Maurice Morand, Catholic priest" ("I am Maurice Morand, a Catholic priest") said with a brilliant one that can forget the crazy ness done at the end. This impressive movie has a single scene in Morand - which despite being one slit is a priestly style - devoted to a cabaret a huge amount of vines turning it into without Christ. <br /> <br /> GÃ©rard - the man who wants to return Morand to the church or replace him by himself - has to drink it if he does not want to leave it in the cabaret. It does so among cheers and apples from people who think it is simply drinking three to four litters of vine. In the next stage, the dialogue between Morand and a garbage collector is also remarkable. "Do you carry away people too?" asked Morand, who hated himself for what he did just. "That would be too much work" is the smart answer. <br /> <br /> The rest of the movie is not worth commenting but it is certainly worth seeing due to the very strong and weird emotive atmosphere created all the time. I think the "frustrated" is a very strange movie, but it has to be seen by all viewers - if they are good catholic it is mandatory - because it is a very rare jewel in movie history. <br /> <br />
