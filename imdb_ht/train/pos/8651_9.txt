California came out in 1993, as 3 of the 4 lead characters were up and coming to their level of fame now owned in 2006. This is a nice psycho-thriller that should appeal to all David fans Duchovny because of his circle and clever narratives that find the ways of his work, like and most of his episodes in the X-Files, God's play, and Red Shoes journeys. <br /> <br /> Those who have been shot by the heavy heavy accent from Brad Pitt and Juliette Lewis' characters have obviously never spent much time in the south. For each "Brian and Carrie" in the south, there is an "Adele and Happiness" and in 2006, this is the real horror of this movie flick. Aside from that, I think the film was written with a cult film - like Carrie's photography, is not suitable for mass consumption. But if you have a copy of this in your personal library, I think it's something positive about your taste for freaky movies.
