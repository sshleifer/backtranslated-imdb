Super Speedway makes a great demo of your new DVD / big screen / 5.1 sound system sound. The IMAX camera puts you right in the race car, where you cruise around various tracks at high speed, reminiscent of the drive sequences of Grand Prix (if only that appears on DVD!). I love watching him again and again. <br /> <br /> The only less, and why I did not give it a 10, some of the driving sequences looked suspicious as the movie was up. The soundtrack also requires a little suspension of disbelief - all that you can hear in a real machine is the engine. You will not hear swooshes as you go under the bridge.
