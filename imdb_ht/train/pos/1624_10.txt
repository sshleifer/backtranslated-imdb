The Old Mill Pond is more of a tribute to the African-American artisans of the '30s than any denigration of the entire race (Stepin Fetchit caricature additionally). In addition to that I just mentioned, there are also frogs or fish versions of Cab Calloway, Fats Waller, Joesphine Baker, Bill "Bojangles" Robinson, and Louis Armstrong. This harmonious cartoon from Hugh Harmon and Rudolf Ising is a very fun musical and perfect characterization around. They all sound very much like the real thing that half of my thoughts can be possible. If not, they are certainly very flatter impersonations. Even lazy, characterized the change of kidney becomes an interesting workout here when it gets kicked by a tiger as "Keep Tiger" playing on the note. Very recommended for fans of '30s animation and jazz music.
