I do not understand why other comments are focused on McConaughey. He has never been a very interesting film actor. <br /> <br /> The best part of this movie is the writing and the understanding. Alfred Molina and Patrick McGaw make a strange comic duo, definitely not stock type. Although one can not say the characters are well developed that do not make them any less funny. <br /> The version I saw was on HDNET and there was subtitle for the Spanish dialogue, so this was certainly not a problem. The use of Spanish gives it more authenticity. <br /> A very filmmeter, judging by the very low IMDb notes given. I thought it was fun and exciting and worth a 7 at least. A lot of slick movies with higher scores and making big money at office in the boxes is less less interesting.
