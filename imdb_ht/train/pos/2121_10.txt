This is a beautiful movie that is miraculously acting by all players. It will make you laugh and it will make you cry. The very end of the film gets me in the steam up every time. If you want to see a big movie, this is it. Jimmy Stewert supplies a wonderful witty performance with Frank Morgan as Mr. Matuschek is spellbinding. Morgan's difference in character is nothing short of amazing. William Tracy as Pepi is terrible comic rescue and deliver some of the most important lines of performance and performance of movies. Felix Bressart delivers a fantastic performance as Perovitch, a worker barrier bumbling worker in life's ambition is to please those he works with. It is a simple story of how close co-workers can come and how people with great animosity towards each other fall in love even though normal circumstances.
