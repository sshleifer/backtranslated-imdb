This movie is a very funny and happy story about an orphanage of financial issues. When the principal goes on vacation, his father agrees to start temporarily to finish these things. This is positively better work Leslie Nielson has ever done. His idea of ​​вЂ <вЂ <the movie leasing out child is immediately innovative, and his sales technique will definitely make you laugh. <br /> <br /> The little girl in this movie is so sweet and good that I know I will never forget her. Just make sure you do not miss the first five minutes of the movie! <br /> <br /> These great family entertainment is so rare these days. If you go for a little snapshot and happy ending, go for this one! I could watch this over and over, and I often do! My only complaint about this movie is that it is so hard to find a copy.
