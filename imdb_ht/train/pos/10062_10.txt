Wow. What a wonderful movie. The script is almost perfect it appears this movie is only written by Minglun Wei, I hope it has more history in it. <br /> <br /> The act is sublime. Rene Zhou as Doggie was amazing - very natural talent, and Xu Zhu was a fun - very credible as the old jazz traditionalist. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack was very effective, guiding without overwhelming. <br /> If only more movies like this have been done in Hollywood or Hong Kong - a friendly family, well-acting, well-written, well-directed, near perfect gem.
