This movie has a powerful philosophical end. But that ends up having meaning only if you watch the movie in the beginning. <br /> <br /> Young people alienation in the late 1960s, from the opinion of a young man and a young woman, is the obvious term of "Zabriskie Point". Neither Mark Frechette nor Daria Halprin has many experience to act, a reality that actually improves the movie's message. There are no trained actors to transmit a sense of realism, as well as players seem to get emotionally detached from the turmoil around them. This is not a script-driven movie. Except for the first ten minutes, it is especially visual, and stunning cinematography. Beautiful natural images look like other-worlds, and perfectly synchronized with emotional detachment in Mark and Daria. <br /> I would have replaced the thermally weak Pink Floyd music with the music more cogent in the doors. Many scenes call for "rider on the storm". Even so, I love this movie. It's different; it is unique; It is artistic and imaginative. And the desert desert are beautiful. <br /> <br /> As the years go by, "Zabriskie Point" looks more and more attractive. It translates the mood in the late 1960s in America. It is amazingly artistic, in a reckless sort of way. And the last eight movie mines are philosophically fascinating.
