Can not believe in a movie that can be good in 1987 and is virtually unknown in the west. Do not repeat other reviews here. The note is very good and moving. Literally it means "Dawn does not come soon" - when it comes to, the beautiful ghost and the lover will be holy forever. After 24 years, Joel and Leslie still look great. I enjoyed Joel at God in Gamblers and many movies by Leslie including Best Tomorrow.
