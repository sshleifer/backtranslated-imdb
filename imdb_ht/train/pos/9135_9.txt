I do not care how bad news red color gets, this rock film! Excellent film, it was all, great music (Prince of Coarse!), Romans, and drama. This is really a very sad movie, very moving. I do not mean much more; I'm not in giving away the scheme, but I'll say this-the movie is very realistic, there are many romantic relationships that go through these issues, so many familys seem to be one of the movie shows. I see this as being very realistic and so real, making the movie more moving. The generation I enjoyed this movie is growing, many of us love Prince and have a lot to relate to for any teenager who went to simulating problems. This is said, it's definitely not just a movie for adolescents, Id recommends it to all age groups. And it's not all so dark, the movie has some great music, band performance performances, and sexy fun scenes between Prince and Appelonia.
