Gundam Wing is a fun show. I appreciate it for getting me to Gundam and anime in general. However, after watching the predecessors, such as Mobile Suit Gundam, Zeta Gundam, and even G Gundam, I found the wings to be Gundam Lite. <br /> <br /> Character: A time aspect made by Gundam is to have the characters push into difficulties and grow at maturity. This does not happen. Heero is the dog's head at the start, and she's head dog to the end. Personality does not change, growth is never achieved. The best character is Zechs, who for all intention and purpose a hero of all most of the series. But suddenly the series betrays him and turns it into a villain for no apparent reason. <br /> <br /> Mecha: wings have great costume designs. Gundams are super cool, and the Swirls were my favorite. I even consider a few of the OZ costume designs to be on par with some of the classic Zeon costumes. But sweet costume designs do not properly save the series from boring characters. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: In the end, wings have cool fighting scenes, though riddled with recycle animation, but plotting plot and character development. Agree, but do not move like Gundam before.
