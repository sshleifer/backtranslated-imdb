"Inspirational" stories about "triumphs of the human spirit" are usually great-compromise for me. The most surprising thing about HELL in honor is how much I enjoyed it in spite of myself. The film is as predictable and as it comes, but it works. Many credit goes to the exhilarating performances by both driving. It's a perfect role for Cuba Gooding, Jr., who's kindly stopping here. We have come to expect much of De Niro, and it does not disappoint. It creates a funny comic portrait. Director George Tillman, Jr set out to make an old-style reproach and come up with a winner.
