The ancient deputy cities, cagey Vietnamese veteran Aaron (a wonderful performance and engaging performance by Kris Kristofferson) and several of his fellow friendships to clear the place.

It's up to Ben-silver's precious brother (well-liked by John-Michael Vincent) to put a stop to him for things that get too out of hand. Writer / director George ("Miami Blues," "Pointe Pointe Blank") Armitage whips up an amour, cynical and cruel subway redneck drive-in contemporary exploit Western winner: he expertly creates a fearless tomb, no-story, holding The speed is inflated and unflagging at all, and stage stage of plentiful and aplombable muscular action (the explosive climax is especially strong and vibrant).
