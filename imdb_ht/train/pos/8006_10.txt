This is a great game! Well maybe he did not have some of these features he meant to have but Digital Ambulance has always come up with a good game. There is a certain similarity of elites (you can trade, pick up weapons and cargo to destroy pirate, go to missions) however this game features a heavily scripted mission. It's a great mission. The control system is different it uses the mouse! You basically fly your spaceship around a system and work your way up! The game features some pretty good graphics even in 2003. It should run well on a specified modem PC. The story features some great voice acting at John Rhys Davies, George Takei, Jennifer Hale (it appears in every computer game). Wood and the story it gets better and better as it goes on. There is even a race section, where you and an opponent have your spaceship race around a course (it involves you go to the ring). This section took me a while to beat. It adds variety to the game. Some sections are a little bit here and there are in general you can beat this game. The game has an active modest scene on the Net. Pick up some mods to extend the game. I have not played any of the mods anymore. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, an end to this was canceled, a shame!
