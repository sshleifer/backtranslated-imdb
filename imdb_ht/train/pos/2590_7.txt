Those are the bad-mouthing movies that people do not understand the movie begins with. These are those who love movie and negative blockbusters in any non-star Leonardo DiCaprio movie. Wilder Napalm is a neat little movie that may seem original and maybe even stupid at first, but it's missing in plot, and more than make up for substance. One particular thing about the movie that impressed me was it is the use of music, which plays a big part. These students in movie music will notice how important the music is in the movie, both in Vida and Wilder life, and in the background. Wilder's theme, Vida's theme, and Wallace's terms are all heard in the opening sequence, and it's funny how some of the lyrics play out. For example, at the scene where the men sing "Duke of Earl", Vida is with Wilder when the men sing something like "It's my Girl", and then he goes to Wallace to give him a things when the men sing Lyric "It will be my girl" cleverly showing the tension between the two brothers There are all sorts of little appliances like this inside the movie, and while it can look like a flop on the outside, The real student in film will notice how good this film really is.
