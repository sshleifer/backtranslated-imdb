"Jag your young yellow" is a lot of fun. Like at least another review, I was, on many occasions, laughing loudly. Yellow is energetic, playful, self-aware, exploratory. Do not expect Bergman here. This film is about a gene in the early-mid-60s in Sweden and on issues, it * contradicts * that the nation and the world have faced. At times Yellow appears for a social-political success document, and Lena, the main character, and others interview both common people and politicians (like Olaf Palme at home). In other times, Yellow looks like parody of this kind of documentary. Throughout the years, the yellow act as a personal documentary explores Lena's life - his home life, his love, his political views, his view of himself. It's a complete person ?? complex, flawed, contradictory, cheerful, sad, curious. And putting on all of this is the wonders of the scope of the director, Sjöman, and his crew documenting themselves documenting Lena. It is that, for me, really give yellow wings. Not only are they suddenly appear in some very funny times and in some funny ways, recalling the viewer that this is fiction and artifacts, but their presence itself is another film layer; They film themselves movie themselves. Do you remember a Bjork music video with this same type? a music video on making in a music video, independent ad, and each iteration gets weirder and more cartoonish. I think Sjöman might have something similar in mind. While "Jag is your yellow" can not be the cup of tea, it is certainly smart, witty, refreshing, ebullient, and authentic.
