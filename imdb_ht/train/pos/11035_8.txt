Four detainees share one cell: dominant transvestites, Marcus (Clovis Cornillac); Marcus's wizard friend, Paquerette (Dimitri Rataud), who will eat anything in sight like pocket watches, cockroaches, and his little ones; Lassalle (Philippe Laudenbach), a smart library who murdered his wife; and Carrere (Gérald Laroche), the new guy who was caught in corporate fraud and is now focusing on escape. After a brick dropped out of the wall of the cell, the guys discovered the hidden newspaper written by a 'Fountain of Youth' - obsessed serial killer who occupied the cell in the 1920s. Is this the secret secret to the survivors? Or is there something more disaster behind it? I was a little tired of getting into this movie because only the other experience I had with Eric Valette was great one Call of Miss (2008), which I considered to be the worst teatrical release movie I've ever seen. However, much of what was wrong with One Missed Call can probably be attributed to Clavier's terrible script, because (as I note) Valette's direction was not the worst part of the movie (unless it chose to include the baby ). Anyway, Maléfique was a great way to respect my respect. . . It's a French movie (obviously something I like) and it takes place in prison (which is my second favorite horror setting after asylum). So, this two points for her before the movie even begins. Luckily, Valette made me once the movie ended up too. Maléfique is a rather deep, rather complex, rather compelling story of obsession and despair. . . the desire and need to bring imagination to reality. While it's not a foolish movie in the traditional sense, the square of power makes it very damn awesome. The period between climax and conclusions were some of the best movie I've seen in some time and I would all recommend this to anyone who is looking for a decent funny psychological and some very cool gurus. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Final verdict: 8.5 / 10. Although a bit of respect touches by Valette. <br /> <br /> Note: Paramount gathers the right to make an American rumor (surprise surprise). It's due out in 2009. I do not know why, to be honest, as this does not seem something that could be a great cash here in the states. But I was surprised before. <br /> Stunning La France! <br /> <br /> -AP3-
