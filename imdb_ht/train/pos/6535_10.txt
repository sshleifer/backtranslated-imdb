This was a great movie! Though there were only about 15 people including myself I was great! My friend and I laugh very much. My mom liked it. There were two middle-aged women and a mid-20 year old there and they seemed to enjoy it. I love the party where Corky and Ned are like both Nancy sympathy and her lovely lol. But when it comes to its roadster and Ned is there. Yeah This was a great movie even thought people overestimate it lol. Go see it I bet you will enjoy it !! I really enjoyed it and so did my friends. <br /> <br /> People were so difficult about this movie and did not even see it. I bet the next time they will give the movie and actress a chance. They all did a great job in my opinion. But if you have young children it is always appropriate. I will probably take my 7 year old niece to watch it too.
