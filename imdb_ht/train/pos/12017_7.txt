"The Last Hard People" is a typical western for 70 years. Most of them seem to be inspired by Sam Peckinpah. Also this one, but Director Andrew McLaglan is a John Ford student and this can obviously be shown in many scenes. IMO start is very good. In a way McLaglan wanted to show the audience a journey of civilization in the desert. The third part has some logical flaws and I complained about Charlton Heston. He plays an old ex-law named Sam Burgade but he's in a fantastic physical form. I never felt that he really had trouble riding on a horse or on a rock. For me it did not seem very motivated as it usually does in most of his epic movies. Even going to the beautiful Barbara Hershey playing sheriff's daughter. Perhaps both had problems with the director or were happy with their role. Hershey and Coburn do not show their best, but still good. If the scriptwriter had John Wayne in mind as Sam Burgade? Also Michael Parks as modern sheriff is somewhat underused in his role. On the other hand there is James Coburn as bandits Zach Provo. Coburn is a really huge cruel in this one. It is portrayed by the bad guy between hatred and intelligence. His role and acting is best in the movie. <br /> <br /> Landscapes and Shootouts are terrific. Scene scenes are bloody and the violence seems realistic. Zach Provo and his gang had some lustful and violent scenes. What I miss is the typical western action among the movie. I would appreciate a bank robbery or something similar. In general it is a fun cops west. Not a big movie but above average because of a great Coburn, a very good start with some bloody and violent scenes.
