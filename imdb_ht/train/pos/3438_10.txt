The movie was pretty much apart from the NC-17 score and disturbing scenes. In such facts as this happens and therefore this movie shows a lot of it. It all starts with Maya (Rosario Dawson in superb performance) that has recently started college has everything going well for her. He meets Jared (Chad Faust in a terrific performance) in a frat party that turns out to be a real and sweet man. She invited her to dinner. They looked at the stars from a bridge and ended up going to his apartment. They talk and take it to the basement they have become flirtatious with each other. She tries to put an end to her, but she raped her. This incident marks it. He goes to a club to meet a bartender / DJ Adrian (fianc√©e played by Marcus Patrick) who sees that he is getting to drink and helps before he goes away. They hit a friendship. It also makes drugs and maya start using too. In other words introduce it to a different world. She starts going to school and works as TA (Teacher Assistance) and Journey Job as one of the students. While students are taking a Midterm, it captures Jared copying. Jared tries to list Maya talk, but he still has the upper hand to decide to invite him to his place. Does history repeat itself? Or Does Maya Have a Joke Surprise? You watch the movie. Excellent A. Rosario Dawson shows the role and concentration and endurance. Chad Faust does not like it can be a rapist, but it does a terrific job like Jared. Marcus Patrick is very brilliant this Mayan survivor and coaching him in a new world. This film deserves a prize.
