I lived in Tokyo for 7 months. Knowing the reality of long train tracks, bikes riding from the train station, standing soup, and other typical scenes represent well, certainly added to my own appreciation for this movie that I really, really liked. There are aspects of Japanese life in this film painted with vivid colors but you do not need to speak Japanese to enjoy this movie. Suo's director of the tricks was subtle for the most part; I found it highlighting characters called Tamako Tamura with a soft filter, making it sublime, a little bit staggering but most of the tricks directors were so gentle that I was completely pulled in with just dancing and characters li. Or call. Or laughing loudly. Wonderful thing. A +.
