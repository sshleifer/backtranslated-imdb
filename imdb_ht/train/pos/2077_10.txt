This timeless proverb reverberates in this movie and in my heart. So many years I have been waiting to see this eternal story! I was not ready, maybe. It is possible for sensibility that I would not appreciate. So I'm now gratefully welcome her to my soul with joy. <br /> I respect and admiration for PAUL MUNI have been long. It is now a legendary luminescence. But now, I've finally discovered the priceless gifts of LUISE RAINER's super talent. Oh, how many figures can you talk like he did? Some have said that he was forced out of his silent year, and this might well have been his speech but is easy to say when giving a chance. It is enough to deserve her Oscar. <br /> <br /> This movie is in a season of the most classic. All parts are equal, necessary and perfect. The Naysayers can walk away if they want, but they might shunning a storytelling that remains with one of all life. <br /> <br /> GOOD EARTH enriches one of the ways that one does not expect. But everyone will not come out of it with joy that I did. But I can only hope that this movie will be remembered for many years. <br /> Do not prod me and only techniques regarding the race of the principal players. These are expectations of modern times when we are obsessed with utter perfection. But I donated a million dollars in the new films telling PEARL BUCK's story and power as well, power, conviction and favor. <br /> If any modern artist would dare to re-movie this masterpiece, I warn them will never come close to the aromatic fragrance that still mimics from the core of this hard. Time will not lessen the effort or progress to improve its scope.
