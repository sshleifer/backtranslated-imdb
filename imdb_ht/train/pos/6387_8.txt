I thought this film was very well put together. Voice-overs were also great. I liked how they all saved their conflicts and reached their goals. I would recommend this movie to anyone. It was definitely worth the time and money to watch it. Atlantis has some funny scenes that make me laugh. Other scenes make me sad. And others made me happy. It is a movie any age can enjoy. From the moment Milo is the crazy "teacher" or until he picked up the crew up for the fantastic trip under the sea. After watching the movie, I read the book. It was good as well, but the movie puts best pictures in mind. It is just like the book. But go ahead and watch this movie!
