Life and time of Little Richard, as told by Little Richard, as produced and directed by Little Richard, was about as one side as one of his songs. This is not a biography or even a docudrama, but there is good writing, great energy and an outstanding leading leader playing Richard. All the music is not Little Richard, so it's a tight lipsync rock on each song. The movie covers her childhood, brings throughout the years the music form, the wild success and Richard thrown it all away to praise the Lord. All it binds together well with the obvious comeback in 1962 managed to stay away from the idea that Little Richard discovers the Beatles, who open for him. My main objection is that his outrageous behavior, cultural controversy is welding and you do not get any feel for how his audience experienced him at that time. Some of its energy, which it still has, does not come across strongly. It looked tame, compared to what I remember at him at the time. <br /> <br /> The best scenes to Richard are getting jilted by Lucille and writing a song on it with the bikini shorts strip while doing, making points on no decent place to change. <br /> <br /> If they got into the "Bronze Liberace" as Richard used to refer to himself in interview, then there's a story. Believe me just see her make a couple of months ago and still flirt with the cute white boys, giving one the dancer particularly good at the audience, his ashes. Almost 68 and still strong I recommend this movie with any concert or T.V. the appearance you can find. Little Richard is still over
