I teach Japanese for a high school online and I include cultural activities for students to learn about the country as well as the language. And watching "Gung Ho" is one of the requirements. Students may either buy or rent the movie. Stereotypes or not helps the students see that others view the world and their lives differently than we do. Many of my students told me they enjoyed the movie very much, they will get a copy for themselves. It is really interesting to see what we value in this culture and values ​​of their culture. I just wish I could get a neat TV version. I'm not really in the language gross auto workers used all the time.
