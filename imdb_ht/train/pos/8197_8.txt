**** Excellent <br /> <br /> *** Good <br /> <br /> ** Fair <br /> <br /> Poor <br /> <br /> `Go ahead , make my day! <br /> <br /> The fourth photo of the series is directed by Eastwood himself (Who was rumored to direct most of Magnum Force) and brought back the violent society from the first two films . However, the movie still lacks impact and credibility. This film was released in the early 80's, the time of Regan and the young republicans. Similar to a woman violated taking revenge on violent he does not appeal to this time frame. This scheme would be best for the Enforcer, which actually would make it a good movie. What Impact Sudden need was a draw as in Wall Street, but with Harry's room in the middle. <br /> RATING: 3 STARS
