Elmer Fudd is laughing while lounging in his easy chair and reading his comic book, his dog comfortably near the front of the fireplace. Everything is peaceful until a shovel comes bounced by. (The flea is dressed in a farmer-type outfit and a big sombrero and carries a bag with the name "A. Flea" on it.) It gets out its telescope and spotted the dog. (We see a big shot in the dog's buttocks and whistles in the excitement of pea, screaming "did bone!" He then sings, "There's eating around the corner; there's eating around the corner!") > <br />> That sets the storyline of this little-but-obnoxious bug to tease the poor dog. The mutt is hilarious as it reacts to the bug. <br /> <br /> The drawings in her big teeth chomping right next to the clever escape fleas and the dog dialogue make me laugh aloud a few times. This would be the funniest cater I've ever seen in a cartoon! Poor poor, under a threat that has taken a bath, does not react when the bug stupid causes pain. It's almost painful to look like the bug uses pickaxes, jackhammers and the like about the dog. He puts the gun on the rear. It's brutal!
