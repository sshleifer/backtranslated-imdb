"They're all laughing" is one of these movies I always recommend to friends looking for something out of the ordinary. It is firmly rooted in the Romanesque vices tradition in the past, but looks more contemporary. Even the early 80s atmosphere does not date too much. Bogdanovich wisely kept the whole enterprise for light on its feet, that reality never brought it down to earth. But that said, this sort of sweet little movie absolutely relies on the actors to keep it going, and "TAL" is blessed with a dream cast that understands the requirements of this sort of story. It is a movie that would not last long in the memory if it was not for the moment given in the excellent cast: The Colleen Camp at the same time shouting command of John Ritter and his dog; Blaine Novak released all her hair under her hat; and especially Dorothy Stratten's moments dropped to John Ritter and said, "How ... strange." It is like a piece of tomorrow one does not want to lie too much on it for fear of breaking it, but it is certainly left with a light heart and a smile on one's face.
