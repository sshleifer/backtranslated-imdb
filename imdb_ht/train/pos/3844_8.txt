When you read this movie, you can think that this is something of an odd movie and in some ways, for the main character of this movie, Gerard Reve (Jeroen Krabbé) haunted by visions and hallucinations. Gerard's vision sees them all (more or less) subtle suggestions in what will happen to him as the story continues and it is great fun for the viewer to try and figure out the symbols used in the movie. Despite using symbols and a couple of suggestions at the end of the movie, the movie holds a very high level of excitement at all and does not get boring for a minute. This is mainly due to the great performances of Jeroen Krabbé and Renée Soutendijk (Christine) and the great direction of Paul Verhoeven. Its direct style is clearly visible and one can say, look at it at different angles, that 'De Vierde Man' is a typical Verhoeven movie. It will not only look typical for people familiar with his American film because of the stripping and violent graphic scene, but it will seem typical for those familiar with his Dutch film, because of the same things and his talent 'they tell a great story. When people who watch Verhoevens American movie, those who are short to say, he does not have the talent to tell a good story and only focus on blood and sex. That's what some people think, while I think it's a very talented director who tries to transmit a deeper message to each and every movie. Although not a good movie, Hollow Man (her latest American film) is an example that Verhoeven can do more than science fiction movies and maybe companies should trust him more and offer him more films of various helmets. He needs it. Just watch his Dutch movie. Not only do they show that they need a certain amount of freedom, but also show that they have remarkable talent. 'Fourth Man' has brought him one step closer to Hollywood and is certainly one of her best. <br /> <br /> 8 out of 10
