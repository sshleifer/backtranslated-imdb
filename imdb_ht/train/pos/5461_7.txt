The life scandal being pimped by his father (with waitress Speakeasy) who died in an explosion, Lily Powers (Barbara Stanwyck, who is simply ravishing) slips his way through the branches inside a bank business Gotham city big. When a posh lover fucking was supposed to be his next waterfront (and the new lover lover), the sky at the limit for Lily as she wrote down her various relationships in a newspaper and subtlety to tell her papers getting it if certain Do not pay by hand. President appointed to the bank, Courtland Trenholm (George Brent), sent Lily to Paris instead of forking on many dough, but quickly found himself frustrated in love after his diverse encounters in the City of Love. This makes Lily's mouth water as now it will reach the pedestal of success to seduce a man of wealth and prestige to carry wealth to his way. Even though, the circumstances will be accomplished that will bring her a decision that threatens her success in achieving such wealth .. Trenholm, now her husband, was accused of certain jails and she lost the bank. She needs money Lily now has in her possession or she will have absolutely nothing. Stanwyck is the movie all but usual Warner Brothers Polish. Were placed in the pre-coded era to the filmmakers the chance to elaborate on taboo subjects such as a woman using gender to achieve success and how that can lead to tragedy. Good direction from Alfred E Green shows in subtlety suggestions of different styling and speech in good acting from the seductive performance of Stanwyck how to step something without actually displaying the clear act. Obviously, the movie shows that money is not everything and all that jokes as love comes to the heart of Lily's dead heart. Ending that Lily has achieved the miracle metamorphosis of someone in love was not really true to me. He spent all this time to get to this platform only to fall for a man who was essentially different than others he used before him.
