I do not watch a lot of television, except for the office, weed, entourage and soup! I think I keep this show of good company. <br /> I like the excused review of pop culture that shows this giving. Soup also helps me stay on top of what the office manager is referring to when talking about a Sanjaya or Heidi Montag (sp?). The best part is that Soup shows the clips of these highlights, which are usually the funniest or most controversial moments (c'mon, most people get hooked in American Idol watch because they show off their auditions freak), which is why most people claim their claims. And that is to say, I should not suffer from 98% of others in those self show conversation talk or "reality" shows, for one nugget of "funny" or "shock." The only reason why soups do not get a 10 in my opinion at any time the designs are not funny, and on an even rarer occasion, the next is not always up to par. But they can not all run home either, if so, soup would not be on E! <br /> <br /> The quick Joel and the Soup's written team (including McHale) make for a great show. I came to enjoy the laugh and comment of the crew that is off-camera. Even when they are being flagrant obvious by giving occasional laughing courtesy, it's hilarious because it is forced. They're obviously ironic. And this is part of what makes this funny show.
