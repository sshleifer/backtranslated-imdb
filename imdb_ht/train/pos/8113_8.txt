This sci-fi masterpiece has too many flaws after the editors have tired it after its opening in 1936. Apparently it is a wonder to see, but the script allows too much intelligence talks about war and progress. This becomes extremely corny when the actors is to recite a lot of high minded messages in all times.Raymond Massey and Cedric Hardwicke, both big actors, from as well a fan of fans. Ralph Richardson is very good as the "Boss" a warlord megaloman. The Second World War predictions were very uncommon considering that the world was on the brink of the most devastating conflicts in human history at the time. I'm sure war did not turn out as he did in the movie. There are some sequence sequences visually sensing bridging the leaps in time between different film episodes. Although it's not as fun as I was hoping it would be, this movie stick to yourself long after you saw it.
