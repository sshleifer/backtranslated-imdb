"Hollywood Hotel" is a fast-moving, exuberant, comedy entertaining comedy comedy from Warners who is sadly neglected. It should be remembered if only giving the official official theme of Tinseltown - "Hooray for Hollywood." Richard Witing notes and Johnny Mercer have a number of other gems, however, including good "i like fish from water," and "silhouettes of the moon." The best musical number is "Let's Make a Lesson for You", where Dick Powell and the company's miserable details of those who find themselves "behind the eight-ball," a fate that literally falls on Edgar burns Kennedy at the end number. The photo celebrates Hollywood glitter and punk it all at once, as it gets a lot of funny mileage from firefighter and ego-maniacal actors and duplicitous studio executives. The cast includes a gaggle of great character comedy - Allyn Joslyn as a hack presser, Ted Healy as Dick Powell would be manager, Fritz Field as an exciting restaurant partner, Glenda Farrell as sarcastic Gal Friday Mona Marshall, Edgar Kennedy as a put-on drive-in manager, Mabel Todd as Mona's goofy sister, and Hugh Herbert as her father goofier. The "Elis" racism mentioned in another review here is a ten-second bit where Herbert appears in black-faced during a pseudo-Gone With the Wind sequence. It's doubtful taste, but it should not prevent you from seeing other fun in this film, noting the Benny Goodman Quartet (including Teddy Wilson and Lionel Hampton!) Of what I believe is the only footage available on this Combo jazz incredible. The "Eyes Dark" sequence goes on a bit too long and comes in too late, but otherwise "Hollywood Hotel" is a gem, well worth your time and certainly a movie that should be considered for DVD release.
