It's not Braveheart (Fortunately), but it's fine entertainment with characters engaging and good acting around. I enjoyed this movie when she was released and looked at her again last week, finding she kept up well on time. Not a classic movie, but a beautiful and montable movie to enjoy as great entertainment.
