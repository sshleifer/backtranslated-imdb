Bell, Book and Candle was one of the great culture phenomena in the middle of the twentieth century, much like the phenomena we see today (back in 70 years - more than ten years later - there was still endless references to this film) . He made Novak a great star, putting a beautiful article on Jack Lemon's resume, throwing new lights on Jimmy Stewart, and giving Lancaster and Gingold new avenues to explore their careers (both went on to keep playing witches and other curious "old rod", in film and television). Along with the 40s movie I married a Witch (who helped make Veronica Lake an icon), Bell, Book and Candle inspired the Grand Movie and TV passion and all that witchy things started and shrugged and continued in Magic Magic, Worst Witch and Harry Potter. <br /> <br /> What I rarely see noted is that the movie is also a rather interesting alternative movie xmas. The story takes place on the Christmas holidays and, despite the fact that it is superfluous about magic, actually defines a great deal of mind in the spirit of (xmas, love, family, self sacrifice, etc.). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br/> I'll always watch this movie (have seen it several times since my first look at the early 90's) especially if it shows around or just after the holiday season. It has style, substance, a great cast, and terrific production value. Like Adam's Rib, he relaxed expressing ideas that were rather radical for his time, even radical now (in both movies the female character is guileless and powerful), and so always looks ahead to the times.
