Budget limits, time restrictions, shoot a script and then cut it, cut it, cut it ... This team is a good group, young filmmaker; Think of this script - yes, allegory - smart in zero-dollar effect when time and knowledge are all you have, relying on actors and friends and others kind of time, devotion, location; and get a first feature of the case, something 1-in-1000. These guys make movies. Good people. Check out the collection "Horrors Heartland" and see the development. And I can pay, work with them is about the most fun thing you will do in the business. I leaned by criticisms that are difficult, insulted for this movie, if one review even heard a word of dialogue, meddle on one thought or concept, or if all that was desired in this work was the visual gore of bashing and Abatto meets some sense of what horrors should mean in a hearing. Let the "empty ax" bring yourself to you. By prejudice what you expect it should be just because it gets put in the genre / genre genre due to its supernatural primary. It's a drama and depth beyond how you can stick a blade to someone who has a reverence for a message that does not attack your brain's visual center, but rather, drawing on one's imagination one's experience experiencing the other suffering in spirit and spirit. mark ridgway, Curtis, the "Acre vid"
