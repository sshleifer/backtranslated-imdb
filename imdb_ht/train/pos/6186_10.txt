Published just before the Production Code Crackdown in July, 1934, Paramount Mitch Leisen's All-Stars Paramount Paramount Music is leeringly suggestive-like misogynistic and very fun claims. The two killed at midnight at the opening of the "Vanities Earl Carroll" (one step-by-step!), But that does not stop the manager (Jack Oakie) from putting on a show as a lascivious police detective (Victor McLaglen) investigate. Everyone is hiding something and Gypsy Rose Lee must have seen this slumber backstreet before he punched the "G-string Murders" as the denier is the same (although more satisfied here). Gertrude Michael, as a vicious diva, stopped the show (in more ways than one) and his exotic "Sweet Marijuana" number and Duke Ellington finished with truncheon "Rape in the Rhapsody". The hit song, "Cocktails for Two", came from this movie. A rare and busty classroom classic is highly recommended! Here's Louella O. Parsons of the "Los Angeles Examiner" on May 17, 1934 <br /> <br / > <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br / > <br />! But September Morn herself has never had a better figure than those drivers, who are made to please the eye, especially the eye of the tired businessman. But not for a moment think Mr Carroll's girl, naturally, is the only attraction. Believe it or not, MURDER's vanities are a comedy musical comedy, if you know what I mean - a murderous mortar incorporated into a musical show. It's all about night at the opening of the playing time is in progress and a search is about for a bandit. Just by way of suspension, a cop threatens to stop showing in every few minutes. Victor McLaglen is something new in cops. All the time he tries to track down the murderer and keep his eye attached to the beautiful chorus. The murderous mystery is good with the exception of the denial, which is very flat. Probably distorting directions. Dorothy Stickney, who plays the maid, is as melodramatic as the heroine of a ten, twenty, and thirty show. For good reason, it's a never-ending percentage of the dramatic scene. Together the girls are good, and it is a positive relief to get away from the inevitable vaccines. The beautiful costumes; In fact, this is a music that Paramount can feel is really in the credits. As for Carl Brisson -well, it would be an addition to any shows. Good-looking with a delightful singing voice and an easy way, assured, he is all the press agent he claims for him. I also love Kitty Carlisle, who plays the leading lady in the show. Gertrude Michael, as the deep-eyed villianess, gives an interesting picture rather fictional. Jack Oakie, as the stage manager, is the same old jack wisecracking, but we would not change it. Jessie Ralph is excellent as the seamstress. Others at the cast are Charles Middleton, Gail Patrick, Donald Meek, Barbara Fritchie, Toby Welle and Andrew Lona. The screen game is by Carey Wilson and Rufus King, with direction by Mitchell Leisen. The music is by Arthur Johnstone and the lyrics by Sam Coslow. In addition to the MURDER in the vanities, there is a cartoon Mickey Mouse, a Paramount Newsreel, with a two-regler, WRITER DIRECTION. <br /> I do not agree with Lolly on the denouement, and it is satisfied if over-the-top. Why would he blame the director? Was he angry and finished the story - in the way he was performing? And what's a "ten, twenty, or thirty show"? Note the slide taken by Busby Berkeley and his "self-shots". As hard as it may be today, the public was tiring at Buzz 'schtick by May, 1934. Mitch Leisen said, "If you show a scene show that's supposed to be in a theater, you should stay within the boundaries of the expanse The proscenium, and do not make a Berkeley Buzz routine with a series of steps that are big acres. "Q: Do you think Berkeley's spectacular effects justify taking this freedom? ML: Apparently they did because they are recruiting all of her photos, not one of my, but personally I do not like it.
