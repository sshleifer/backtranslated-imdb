I have not seen this movie, but I must. Having read all three of Thor Heyerdahl's books (Kon Tiki, Ra and Aku Aku) I'm actively looking for a copy of this movie. The thesis that the Peruvian emigrants in Polynesia are alive and well. Considering that this crew had no GPS, and only an old radio alarm (modern tube) with a 6-watt output, the trips were heroic to say the least. <br /> <br /> Please respond to this message if you can tell me where a copy of this video is. <br /> I would be interested in buying it.
