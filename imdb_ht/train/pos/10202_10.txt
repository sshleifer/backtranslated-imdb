I personally liked this movie and I was frightened by some of those who gave them. It's a movie based on a comic book and it's animated, now if you do not like comic books or animations then of course you will not like this movie so why you look and disturb it is beyond me '. Though, if you're a fan of interesting, strong and heroic characters (sexy) women kicking off and saving the world (Hell) you will love this movie. I thought the story really pulled me in and it was a very cool film. Well-animated or more like some of the American cinemas this new trend in adult animation. Like Titan A.E. meet the live action version of Punisher. In the end I highly recommend this movie to funny comics and super hero fans or anyone with an open mind looking for a fun movie.
