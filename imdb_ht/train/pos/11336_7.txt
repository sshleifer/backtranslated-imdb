Answer: Despite the fact that this film was written and directed by a woman, your ex is creepier, nastier, and more irrational than any zombie who ever lurched the ground. <br /> <br /> Acting in this independent movie is actually quite good, despite the less-than-wonderful script. He takes a very good actor to deliver a substitute, luminous line and make it sound vaguely credible. Young Anthony de Marco, like Jake, put in a particularly good performance. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, the plot of this movie is a lot better than the dialogue. Try it, especially if you are not a monster fan. This is NOT a horror movie. Even though all adult women are very mammoth, and although all the adult males act as if the brains have eaten in some earlier zombie films, the "Closet Jake" is suitable for adult mature ones. <br /> <br /> The whole, this time is better than the sum of its parts.
