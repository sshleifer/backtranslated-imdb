Thank God ABC chose this instead of Fox. The best description (for those who are in the know) is really Wonderfalls to meet dead like me in the best possible way. <br /> I'm not sure an experience of death and destiny in life makes me a fan of Brian Fuller but I certainly enjoy his production. I also enjoy chic floors, pies, talk games, gravel and other mischievous items :) While somewhat "Burtonesque", I certainly think this is to enjoy its own nest that does not require J Depp or HB Carter to be a beautiful imaginative playground. Here we can find the joys and sorrows of childhood and adult collision in each and actually make sense and make us want to live the whole life!
