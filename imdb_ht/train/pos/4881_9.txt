"Kaabee" depicts the difficulty of a woman in close range and during WWII, raising her children alone after her husband in prison for "crime thought". This film was directed by Yamada Youji, and as expected the atmosphere of this movie is truly wonderful. Although historic settlement in some scenes, most of the beach scenes, is a suspicion. Acting in this movie is absolutely incredible. I am distorted in how to manage to pick up this all-star cast for a 2008 film. Yoshinaga Sayuri, possibly the most decorated actress actress in Japan, will undoubtedly have more individual awards for her performance in this film. Tsurube Shoufukutei in a supporting role was really nice as well. It was Asano Tadanobu though, who delivers the most impressive performance, perfectly showing wittiness of his character and the difficult situation he was in. .. Films and pre-war settings are not my stuff, but thanks to the beautiful direction and act, I totally absorbed the story. Also, it was not a distant story as "Yuunagi has no Machi, Sakura no Kuni", and examining the controversial and sensitive issue of government asthma and poisoning occurred in Japan. Excellent film, highly recommended for all viewers.
