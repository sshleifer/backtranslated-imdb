Writer / Director / Co-Star Adam Jones has been directed to many things. That is the thought I had after seeing his feature film "Cross Eyed". Rarely making an independent movie let me feel as she did. Malian writing and masterfully directed, "Cross Eyed" keep you involved in the beginning of the end. Adam Jones can not be a well-known name yet, but it will be. If this movie had one or two "called actors" it would be a Box office sensation. I think he still has a chance to get by a main stream audience if just one movie distributor takes the time to work this movie. Wherever it ends, if you find a chance to see it you will not be disappointed.
