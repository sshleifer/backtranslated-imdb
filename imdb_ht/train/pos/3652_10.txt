I started watching a replay of this TV movie about a Sunday afternoon, thinking it was just another movie movie dumb plane. I was wrong. <br /> The "Pandora Clock" is a clever political thriller that is far beyond the quality of most movie cinema. It could just as easily did its first on the big screen. The cast is excellent, including veteran actors Richard Dean Anderson, Edward Herrmann, Robert Guillaume, and Robert Loggia. Daphne Zuniga turns to one of her best performances as a medical specialist working for the CIA, and Jane Leeves Frasier's is also a good thing. <br /> <br /> The dialogue is well written and the story is compelling at all. In fact, when the final is so full of twisting draws and suspense that you can not leave your seat for the second time. If you get a chance to see this movie, invest the time - almost four hours. You will be rich reward!
