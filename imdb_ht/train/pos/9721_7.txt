How to lose friends and alien people is commercially decent and a bit of romantic approach. <br /> It's actually a story of Sidney Young (Simon Pegg) breaking in of journalism and writing business magazines which is interpreted in a funny way. Simon Pegg did an OK look, a little bit worse than usual. Movie is not hilarious or funny all the way or something like that but it has its moments, and these moments are really hilarious. <br /> I recommend this fun and worth watching American and English comedy creams of everyone who just wants to sit, relax and enjoy film for what it is. If you are about to watch this movie with critical approaches then you should pass unless you want to be disappointed and start trashing it.
