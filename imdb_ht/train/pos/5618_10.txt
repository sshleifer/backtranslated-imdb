This is one creepy film. Creepier than anything David Lynch, and shows what a great director Polanski is since this is not his usual kind of work, and it is brilliant .. It all starts with Trelkovski moving to a rental block in Paris. She soon learned that the previous tenant, a young woman, committed suicide and she believed the rest of the inhabitants drove her to her. He also believes they are trying to do the same to him. Which results are an amazing and frightening look of paranoia. The whole production has classic horror written all over it: from imagery to music the viewer can feel the poor Trelkovski build fear. <br /> Are they all out to kill him? Or maybe just drive him mad? Is there a difference? Find out yourself. 10/10
