California is the story of a writer and photographic photographer who is looking for someone to pay for fuel money and take turns in the steering wheel for a clear sightseeing tour of the famous sights. Ironically a serial killer and his girlfriend responded to post. California is a diamond in the rough and a very intriguing journey with a serial killer. Great performances all around do not lead to the particular Pitt being outstanding. Watch it !!
