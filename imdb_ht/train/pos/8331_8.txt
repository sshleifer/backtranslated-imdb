This movie is a very relaxed, romantic-comedian, which is quite enjoyable. Meg Ryan does a very good job as a genius of Albert Einstein, though he believes in his own skills. Tim Robbins performed an equally good job as the mechanic who fell in love with her when she came to her shop and fianc√© after her car up. I loved Walter Matthau as one of Albert Einstein's soloists. This movie just has a very relaxing feeling, while still maintaining some sort of gravity (if that's actually possible, it's happening here). <br /> I personally found this movie very fun, especially old scientists - I thought they were fab and hilarious! This film seems to have underestimated beyond understanding. If you have a rogue sense of humor, this is the movie for you!
