Soldiers can not have academies acting or Lucas special effects but it definitely does so for me. I will not tell you what it is, I'm sure you already read the summary. This is a great movie action film / science fiction film. Kurt Russell does not say so much, he usually has an unusual or scrambled look on his face, but he fits the character. There are great action and battle scenes; Some of the scenes are unrealistic, but Hollywood believes that we should have to save our normal lives. I have not seen Soldier 2 but this one read one of my favorites. I'm lucky enough to have a wife digging guy movies; we both love this movie and recommend it to anyone who loves hard guy / sci-fi movies.
