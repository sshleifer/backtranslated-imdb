This is a powerful documentary on domestic abuse in Cameroon. The "Sisters" in law are lawyer and judge lawyer in 2004 whose husbands successfully prosecuted abusive treatment of their spouses and won a woman a divorce she desperately wanted in a Muslim council. It is rather long - over two hours - but fascinating in terms of both individual plaintiffs and defendants and lawyers who are successfully represented in courtroom chaired by female judges. It will leave you, as it leaves me, and many questions about exactly how this change occurred. How and when did women come to occupy authority in Cameroon? Did several cases appear in this film had an important effect on the treatment of women generally not their wives? Was given to a divorce by a Muslim court, against the wishes expressed by the husband, a single event once? I do not suggest that the movie makers could answer these questions. They made the film two years ago, not yesterday. And the movie was to deserve a wide audience.
