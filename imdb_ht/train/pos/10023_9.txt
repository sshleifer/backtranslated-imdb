After seeing several movies in Villaronga, I had a very clear opinion about it - it focuses too much on the personal aspect of the characters, forgetting about a rhythm of the movie. Therefore, even if there is good criticism, movies have never caught attention to broad audiences. In its shear followed the same line, but really improved on the rhythm, especially at the end of the movie. Frankly speaking, I leak in the first part, cause if the first part provides the necessary information, it is really slow. But the second part is absolutely wonderful and make the film all the best movie ever done by Villaronga.
