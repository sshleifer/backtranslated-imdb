Yes ... I'm going with the 1-0 on this and here's why. Over the past few years, I've watched a few comedies and only left with a few mild laughs and a couple of video rental fees late because the movies were that easy to forget. Then I stumble over "Nothing". Look interesting, did not expect much though. I was guilty. This was probably one of the funniest movies I've ever had the chance to watch. Dave and Andrew make a great pair of comedy and humor was enticing enough to remember, but not about complex in the point of missing the joke. I do not want to comment on any of the real scenes, because I feel this movie is worth seeing for once. With more meaningful concepts coming to cinema (you know, like military aircraft and "cool" remake damaged classic old age), this film will make you happy to say in OK laughing at "Nothing".
