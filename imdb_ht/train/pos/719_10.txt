Even if this movie is cheesiness at its best, it is pulled perfectly. This movie, without a doubt, must be considered a modern classic. There are basically two types of movies I love - movies and in-depth (chick flicks, if you owe - I blame my wife for this) and mindless comedies where I can sit back and relax. This movie is a perfect example of the letter. <br /> A friend of mine turned me on this movie shortly after her release. Considered me in a little bit, he told me, "You've seen this film. It's just your kind of movie." Before talking, I started watching. I know to mention the Ramones a million times, but when you actually see them, I said, "Hey, it's the Ramones." My friend replied, "I do not know they were a real band." I had my moments of glory. This movie, though now a bit dated, is a must see for fans of Ramones - or anyone else for that matter.
