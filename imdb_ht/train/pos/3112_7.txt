I watched both Bourne Identite and Bourne Supremacy on DVD before seeing in the theater. I would have been waiting for this before they started filming. I was not disappointed. <br /> <br /> Overall it was good, but it also lacked the continuity of the first two. Identity and supremacy of both graceful flow between action of adrenaline rush intrusive drama. This film felt convertible at times. Draw-building times-times were a little too drawn. That caused this action to feel too frenetic. <br /> <br /> Camera: Speaking of the frenetic, trademark The Greengrass unknown cam was present and very annoying for me. I know he has spoken / whined about in nauseating on the message board, but does not mean it does not matter. All of the art martial arts training attracted was totally wasted. Camera camera ridicules and wiggling cameras ruin most of the battle in the movie. It's a cheap, director of the students to make the movie feel unstable. I would expect these techniques to be used in some horror cops made for high school kids, but not in this stylish, adult, action series. Excessive extreme is also close-up. Is some framed. Get some interesting shots. Constant closing-up feels like lazy direct me. <br /> History: The story was very confusing at first. They are pushing new names and faces on you from going to go. It gave me the feeling that you get when you enter a late film and know you missed some important information. Feel running or compressing for time reasons. After you catch up however the story is quite good. It's nice to bring these along with Bourne. However, I did not care for all the latest scenes of Sipremacy (Landy / Bourne on the phone) being in the midst of ultimatum things. It basically makes the film a half prequel. I thought that was awkward. <br /> <br /> Place / character: The movie star is the action. Obviously there are only two original quotes. Bourne and Nicky Parsons. They are chatting up was odd for me. I think they just wanted to give Bourne a protective and confessed person. If I completely miss something, they do not even tell you why they are up. The other killers in the movie were very quiet. This felt like Gilroy / Greengrass / people who do not want to end the end. Understand disappointing hands. Seriously, Damon and Clive Owen of Identity and Marton Csocas of Supremacy .. These scenes were phenomenal. These killers are as refreshing as Castel (the first fella Bourne fighting in identity). The overall cast was degraded as the series went on. Clive Owen was practically a reflection. This is a measure of strength for that first cast. The second, they basically trade Chris Cooper for Joan Allen .... Not exactly equal. That's one exchange Brian Cox and Franka Potente for 3 actors to be called later. There is nothing against David Strathairn, Scott Glenn, or Albert Finney, but not the first names that come to mind for this kind of series. Aside from a couple pauses that seemed long, the act was good on. <br /> As a whole, it was successful. Felt like they wanted to get the set on and though. If they were ready or rearranged the slower parts, eliminating Scott Glenn's part entirely, zooming out and taking the camera away from the seizure victim, it would have been perfect. <br /> <br /> ENDING SPOILER <br /> <br /> I do not see why left Bourne alive at the end. He understood that this was the conclusion. They were clearly referenced to the very beginning of the series and his silos floating disappointing. I thought they were going to do it. A full circle of finished. I did like Nicky reacted in the news report though. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> what to do you give. "Quoting the first killer, I loved it, the final scene was great." Except that it was Vosen {Strathairn} shot in bourne. Why would he do that? Just come out for revenge? angry enough to kill, why not shoot Pamela Landy after it's faxing herself secretly? makes sense.)
