Rich psychiatrist Lindsay Crouse has just published his first novel, feels down on his profession feeling that he's hopelessly helping his patients. A teenage junkie client game asks her to help her repay her debt if she really wants to help her get better. Here she gets involved with Joe Mantegna. To reveal any more of the plot would spoil one hell of a fun movie and 'House of Games' can pretty well be the best movie I've seen. David Mamet has written and directed this gem in all snappy dialogues, great one-materio, and torsion enough to keep you guessing until the end. Crouse is perfect as the uptight psychiatrist who needs a change with Mantegna himself as devilishly sly to anyone. With the exception of a coincidence in the last quarter of the film, the film is in absolute control of its audience; and we love the hay. <br /> <br /> *** from ****
