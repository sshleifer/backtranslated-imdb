I saw the recent 2 DVD Region in this movie appearing in the "horror" section of a Oxford Street store and also published as a "classic comedy". In fact it is almost only a car for Arthur Askey, one of the most famous names in comedy comedy and light entertainment for more than four decades. <br /> <br /> Perhaps its anxiety, stranger and essentially good-natured humor comes as a bit of a culture of culture accustomed to the tame and cynical flavor of many British comedy in the past five years. However, there are still people who appreciate their lively and loving personality and avoid total pathos. There was an idol of the great Tommy Cooper who often borrowed the "head-strangulation" gag that Arthur tried to entertain passengers to block. There is a striking, rare appearance by Linden's under-rated travers, who makes an impact as the mysterious Julie.
