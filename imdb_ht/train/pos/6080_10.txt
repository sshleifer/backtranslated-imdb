Othello, the classic Shakespearen story of love, betrayal, lies, and tragedy. I remember studying this story in high school, actually I found Othello to be probably my favorite Shakespeare story because of the fact of how fascinating it was, the fact that Shakespeare captured the feeling of friendship, love, and racism perfectly. I mean, when you really do study this story, you can go through many philosophy on why Othello has gone crazy and jealous of the blink of an eye. But later on my report I looked at this version of Othello and I must say it was absolutely brilliant. Laverance and Kenneth just capture the story well and understand it is obscure. Othello is the great-time soldier in his city, he loves not everyone, including the king. But when the king finds that Othello snuck off with his daughter, Desdemona, the king is freezing, but it except it. Othello is welcomed in the city and makes her best friend, Cassio, his side man instead of Iago, who was standing by Othello. Because of his crazy envy, he is out for revenge. Still pretending to be Othello's best friend, it's simply the suggestion of Othello that Desdemona is cheating on him and Cassio, never telling them that just do Othello think he's happening. Othello is crazy driving and does not have bandwidth plans for Desdemona or Cassio and Iago is more than happy to help her out. Othello is an incredible story, I highly recommend that you read it. It's an incredible story that keeps you thinking after reading it. The Othello movie is also great and once again I recommend it, it captures the story perfectly and has a great type of tearjerker feel, or you might just be in complete shock to what's happening between Othello and Desdemona as soon as he believes his true love would betray him. This is a terrific movie, great act, good lying, and good direction, this is what Shakespeare means when writing the story. <br /> <br /> 10/10
