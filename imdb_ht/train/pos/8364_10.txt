Robo Jox does not suffer from history or bad effects. I mean, this was 1990 if you know what I'm talking about. RoboCop 2 is still used to stop the animation as most of the movies made throughout the '80s. If you look at your biggest blockbusters during this period, many of them have been able to do with the special effects vaccines that were available at them at the time. It was not until Terminator 2: Judgment Day was released the following year that a tool of technology was achieved, and commercial commissioners started using this motive. But you will have fond memories of Transformers, Gundam Wings, even Power Rangers, if you watch this movie. The enemy robot is very ominous. It makes you do not want to face the man without a really good back-up plan. And there are some great moments in this movie. A betrayer / spy works in the middle. Who do you think is on your side, backing you all the way, could the person you did not expect him / he to be. And that's pretty embarrassing to think so, do not you agree?
