Jim Belushi is terrific as the "Joe Joe" who gets her 15 minutes in the "Twilight Zone". Michael Cane is sensitive to the mysterious bar that does not just listen to Belushi's story, but has a "healing" for all Belushi issues: A magic potion brings about an avalanche of changes in Belushi's life. <br /> <Flashbacks show a 15 year old overly shameful to the cause of his High School Baseball Championship. Belushi continues with his "pitiful life", which is very happy, but always asks "what if ..." For what seems to be several days, Belushi experiences a "different" life, one of the enormous successes, admire and hatred by others in equal terms. <br /> This is not quite "It's a nice life", but some elements seem, and very endearing. The "Finish" is predictable, but still satisfied. Watch a small Cortney Cox very young at a bit part as "fatal attractions" - like other women. A very pleasant movie!
