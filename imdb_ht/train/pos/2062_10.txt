The first I'll be the first to admit that the scarecrow itself is quite a bit over-the-top. A tone down perhaps less scarecrow epicenter would have made this movie much less cheesecake. But in general I think it's one of the best B movies. Tiffany Shepis is absolutely wonderful, not to mention incredibly beautiful. Though this movie lacks all-important nude factors, there are several other movies in which it is viewed. But here it gets all wrong-hot, especially towards the end as it walked away from the swallow swamp. Also Richard Elfman does a good job as sheriff and as a companion to drink. Yes it is a low budget B-movie. But from all of them I have seen, this is definitely one of many favorites in my mind.
