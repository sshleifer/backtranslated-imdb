British comedy tends to fall into one of two main types: quiet, introspective, usually romanticize the study and the social social coziela. Settings, characters, and concepts vary but certain features set the vast majority of shows in one of the two categories. Butterfly is perhaps the emergence of the first type. The very verbal scripts, including long interior monologue by Ria in main character, a housewife basically happy but curiously unstable about what he might have missed out on when he engaged in a quite conventional life. When it meets a successful, but unpleasant and emotionally accessible businessman (which makes his interest in clearly it), it's game with the idea to find out what else the path might offer. <br /> <br /> Acting and scripts are always on the money, which makes one reaction to the almost entirely personal show: I have not been hauling it either. My mother, on the other hand, worship this show. I think the degree of one identified with Ria's dilation is the most important factor in determining one's reaction to butterflies.
