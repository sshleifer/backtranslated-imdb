Now, my friends, films like "The Best" (aka "The Beast" or "Oh Monsters") can only be done in the old continent :), in this movie we see all: gay sex, nymphomaniac Type of Gorilla, non-meaning dialogue, etc., etc. In serious terms now, it is a allegory, that men sometimes may be better, brittle and brutal, Walerian Borowczyk (the director) shows us the loss of innocence, violence sexual, rape and brutality. It's an amazing cinematic experience, rare and full of grotesque scenes. For all fans of European shocking exploitation, I recommend this movie. If you like this one I recommend: "Orloff Against The Invisible Man" and "Altered States".
