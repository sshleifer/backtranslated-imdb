The 60 is a great movie (I've seen it completely in one night) about the hippie movement in late 60's. Although the title would suggest otherwise the first years of the 60 are not really important in this movie. <br /> <br /> The main character in the film is Michael, a political activist who goes on the road to the US against the Vietnam War. There he met his girlfriend, Sarah, Michelle's brother, Brian, going to Vietnam to fight (what a surprise!) He returned from the war and changes made to a "Tom Cruise on the Fourth July" love and then in a Hippy.His father is a kind of pro-Vietnam guy in guy (what a surprise !!) Michael's sister Kate is conceived of a Rock & Roll artist and runs away from home and goes to San Francisco's Summer of Love. The very poor finish (dad gets a liberal and everyone is happy), but I let that slip away from my vote (the rest of the movie is very good!). <br /> <br /> Performance by the very good actors and the soundtrack of the film is absolutely brilliant. All the main events of the sixties are in the movie, such as murder on JFK and Martin Luther King and the great hippie manifestations, the summer of love and Woodstock! Look carefully for the Grast Woodstock Speaker (what we have in mind is bedding for 400,000!) As a first-aid staff at the Woodstock Festival! <br /> In the end, the 60 is a wonderful movie about a beautiful decade! 10/10
