I liked this movie. It is rare to get a glimpse into Vietnam post-partum, with the scenes of the movie fighters and interesting bombs and bullets. I had no idea I should be so affected by it. What an amazing look at how foreign vets feel. It was hard to look, quite frankly. We all understand the battle with the Apocalypse Now the kind of drama, but this is so different. What happens when they return and try to live a life? They can not. It made me very aware of a large group of people who are fighting around losing in America. Can not be related, sleeping, can not have love affairs, can not deal with "normal society". They feel totally separate. This is a great tragedy, and one that does not address enough. Yeah, we've changed our attitude to Vietnamese vet, we like them now, but so what? It does not seem to have made any difference in them. It's too late? So it was a great movie, but I cried a lot. I have no other criticism.
