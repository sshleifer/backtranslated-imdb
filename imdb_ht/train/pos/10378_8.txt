This film is an hour or so of good entertainment, and there are really really funny moments. I loved the character of Matt, and also small. They seemed the most engaging and humorous characters, and certainly the most interesting. Matt is very good (as there is no good cousin), and the women's police and women in blonde biker give some eye-catching cakes. I must say I saw similarity hit between Matt and another Aussie, Eric Bana actor. My favorite personality was the brothel scene, liked it. In general, I liked the movie and it will get on a rating 8. The penalty however, I was disappointed. It was a side kick, rather than the proper shootout explosion. <br /> I'm off kidding. :)
