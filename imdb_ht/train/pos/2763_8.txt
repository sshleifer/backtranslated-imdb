People tend to complain about the number of films made on people with disabilities. I do not see this as a valid critic, no more than complaints from too many films about any sort of person. Jaco van Dormael does a great job with the script and direction. Daniel Auteuil and Pascal Duquenne work perfectly together, and Duquenne basically plays herself. The movie covers an amazing huge ground in events, and it's not simply content to go about what was seen in "Rain Man". The finish is rather depressing, but it does not ruin the wonderful story that came before. <br /> 7.8 out of 10
