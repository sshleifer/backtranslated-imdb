I love the movie, it was a very interesting fantasy movie b / c in the real meaning of family in it, the story of our country, the fun-filled action appeared in the movie. I watch the @ time @ head over 4 x a week and i just love it! I wish that a sequel was made to see more of Susan's father in the past and watch how Susan delt and her new baby sister and no phone, computer, gameboys or anything in the 21st century. I hope everyone else enjoyed the film as much as I guess you might say I'm a long time at heart and I do not mind. The lil's boy in the film Robert Lincoln Walker was simply adorable I wonder who he is and how old he is today. Does anyone know if he plays in more than movies or TV shows?
