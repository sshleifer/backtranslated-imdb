In what must be one of the most unblocked movies ever, a deadly transvestite in New York, and the answer to everything can not be what people suspect. One can see how Brian DePalma takes some influence from Hitchcock with camera angles and other things. Michael Caine plays a most thought-provoking character, while Angie Dickinson is basically a wealthy woman rich with a bad hairstyle. Keith Gordon (who later starred in "Christine") is probably the most interesting character in the movie. But you can not really understand this movie without seeing it. After you see it, you never know who you can trust. Also begins Nancy Allen and Dennis Franz.
