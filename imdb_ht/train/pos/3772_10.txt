Bill and Ted's bogus travel is possible the most excellent movie I've ever watched. Even if the current and landscape are poor, who cares. The story line is brilliant and the jokes and the words come with the most excellent, the ideas are great as well. I recommend that someone see this classical. The best part is obviously when 'death melvin', I was cracked up for 10 minutes and missed the next part of the movie. This is so much better then the first one, which was great as well. It is possible to film the horror of all time !!!!! I think the best part of the movie however, when Bill and Ted call well and play guitar solo, it was hilarious. Rock on Bill, Ted and Eddie Van Halen, carrying out a 3rd film !!
