A little potboiler lace that has 65-minute length does not seem a second too short, my name is Julia Ross harks back in an English tradition of things not what they look like - The Hitchcock Lady Vanishes is an example. Out-of-work Julia Ross (Nina Foch) finds a dream job at a new job agency in London, whose simple representative looks very worried to ascertain whether he has family or companion living. After he was reported in duty, he woke up (having Drugged) in a vast Manderley-like Cornish coast, supposedly as the barmy-in-the-crumpet wife of George Macready, showing an alarming interest in knives and ice peak. His doping, allowing Maman to be the irrepressible Dame can Whitty (this time a bustling efficiency model on the other side of the good-vs-evil than she was busy in the Vanishes Lady). The nightmare vision of this story unfolds claustrophobic; We know what's going on hand without power to say poor Julia. This film, curious, is regularly awarded a place of honor as one of the earliest (and many British) films. I think it's closer to the Gothic old-dark-home tradition than the American one of wet cobblestones and urban corruption; It does, however, to guess a more modern, psychoanalytic cast in mind. Whatever you call it, it remains a common thrill of satisfaction.
