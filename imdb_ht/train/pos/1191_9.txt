Robert Taylor as the Crazy Buffalo Hunter Charlie Gilson is the main character in this movie. At the beginning I thought that Charlie would end up surrendering himself to John Wayne in their quest or James Stewart in the Nail Spur. But as the film goes along, Gilson keeps doing more atrocities until you realize there is no hope for it. Stewart Granger is Sandy McKenzie, who wants to stop hunting because he realizes that the buffaloes will soon go and it is disguised by the act of killing. Gilson is a natural killer that makes no difference between animal or human beings. Debra Paget as the Indian girl is a surprising character considering the self to impose censorship at that time. He lies with Gilson in total resignation though he hated it. The latest scene of Gilson jelly is unforgettable.
