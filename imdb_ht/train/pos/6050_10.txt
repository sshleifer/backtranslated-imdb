At last! A decent British comedy that does not spin around some mockney bank robbers or cuts off a TV set. John Ivay's film is a psychoactive story of discovery, dressing in biker gear. The three protagonists are foolish gentlemen with a prone to failure and each of them has a turning point in life, giving a tender, emotional trio of sub-cemetery to the comedy elaborate together. The chemistry between the three amigos is palpable and makes for a touching community with hilarious dialogues and some funny comic moments. She feels a part of Mitnail and I, American werewolf party in London, and Quadraphenia parts (but only because of the bicycle gangs, and Phil Daniels). In fact, Phil Daniels' nasty adorable reminds you of the dealer Danny in Withnail and I, with her academic approach and scientific commitment to drugs. This is a great movie, especially for those who have dabbled in psychoactive substances in the past, who will deal with many moments in the movie. A personal favorite is the brilliant scene at the Welsh Corner Store, buying munchies while tripping on 'shrooms. This gentle comedy is warming the blows in your heart and laughing loudly. And you do not have to ride bicycles or even enjoy to enjoy it. But it will add to it if you do. Brilliant.
