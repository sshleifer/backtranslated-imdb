Another review compares this Troupe to a cross between Monty Python and Twin Peaks, also aptly. But another review explains the difference between the comedy we love non-critical and black comedy, also quite consideration. <br /> <br /> Look at everything, all three series. In the end, all the characters are bound and the puzzle pieces fall into place as well as a Douglas Adams novel. Details and subtleties are staggering. Well post-modern. Wickedly funny, and sneaky tragic. Not for the kids. It is not for people who have skin or thin objectivity. Thought-provoking. Once literally, figuratively, and surreal in disturbing ways. The Blackjack comedy I can remember. <br /> And many possibly the most beautiful things I'll ever see.
