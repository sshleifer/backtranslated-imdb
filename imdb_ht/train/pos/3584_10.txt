My name is Heather and I'm the girl who has this movie-based story. I want to thank everyone who saw this film and enjoy it. as bit and harsh as some of the things that were shown in this film were, it did not really even come close to describing the bad things actually were. Not to mention the affect everything was about my mother and younger sister. Thanks again for the great comments that everyone was, I really appreciate them <br /> <br /> Hi everyone! <br /> This is Heather's Mom. It's hard to believe that many years have gone by since this movie has made. Harder still believe that people have been watching it a year ago. For any of you outside who went to the same same or similar situation, please know that people from here in cyberspace who understand completely how you feel. Think of us and pray with each of us.
