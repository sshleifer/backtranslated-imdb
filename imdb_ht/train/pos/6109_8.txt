My Tutor Friend is a well-scripted comedy script that has something similar to my Sassy girl. There is no kiss / sex scene. Hollywood should learn more about Korean production. Sex is not always asked in a good romantic movie. <br /> <br /> The film is in the heart of the light scene and the animated cartoon scene CG blended in the movie. I love the party when Ji-Hoon nearly kisses Su-Wan. The foul moment is when Ji-Hoon's first-likes Su-Wan's love is because he threw Su-Wan to another girl and he'll be a dad soon. How it became a father revealed at the next stage, which brings smiles to the audience. <br /> <br /> Mao point: 8/10
