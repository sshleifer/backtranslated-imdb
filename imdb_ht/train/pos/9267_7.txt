Not a bad movie. Somehow I actually made it to the Iranians to win the game played in the movie even though I do not know anything about football and I'm not a fan. The finish on the bus was exhilarating. The film itself deals with the issue of women in Iran, and how they are not allowed to enter arenas among men because swearing is appropriate for women to hear. Despite this law, some women are trying to sneak, but many of them find and hold. It's really amazing that any society can still have the antique notion of sex. In an interview, Panahi says his film is a documentary of history and injustice, and that one day in the future we can watch these movies and see how Iran once lived. One hopes that future will come sooner rather than later.
