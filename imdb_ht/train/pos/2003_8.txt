The main problem of the first movie "Vampires" is that none of the characters was sympathetic. Carpenter learned from her mistakes, and this time used a vampire fancy hunter and a charismatic vampire. The Vampire Girl Una certainly is the coolest vampire since the Deacon Frost Blade. Unfortunately while there are some good concepts such as a cool movement restaurant scene (why did not Captain used more of this ??) This movie is nowhere near as good as it could. I hope to see strong vampires in action and at least a long lasting nicely choreographed battle sequence (for instance inside a city) and left a bit disappointed. While "Los Muertos" rises to a speed faster than its predecessor, it always drags a little bit into some parts (though nowhere near as bad as "vampires"). Much like "vampire" however this bigger movie point near the end is not very intense. Most of the above may sound like "Los Muertos" is a bad movie but it definitely is not. It is generally enjoyable and hangs among the best entrances to the genre. It's neither a remake Dracula first (like almost any other vampire movie out there) nor is it an unintelligent action spectacle like Blade II. It simply could use a bit more excitement. <br /> I would really like to see a third installment made by the carpenter but it's probably not going to happen. <br /> <br /> ending was way too predictable. Una should be far away - that would make the movie quite strange.
