Family Tree Dan Burns (Steve Carell) writes the "Real Life Teens" that provides guidance for families in the New Jersey Creole and raises its three daughters alone. Jane (Allison Pill), the older, had just received driver license but Dan did not allow her to drive; Cara (Brittany Robertson) has a crush on Marty's high-school Marty; and the young Lily (Marlene Lawston) miss her mother. When Dan and his daughter traveled to Rhode Island for a family meeting, he met Marie (Juliette Binoche) in a bookstore and spend hours talking to each other. They feel attracted to each other, but Marie receives a phone call and leaves Dan, giving her first phone number. Then immediately fell in love for Marie, but when she returned to her parents' home, she found that Marie is the girlfriend of her brother Wolf Mitch Burns (Dane Cook), who also loves her. By the end of the week, the attraction between clumsy Dan and Marie increases and they have to make a decision. <br /> <br /> "Dan in real life" is a great surprise with a delightful movie, and comedy, romance and drama. The chemistry of the gorgeous Juliette Binoche and Steve Carell are awesome and it's very easy to know why everyone loves Marie. Allison Pill's trials, Brittany Robertson and Marlene Lawston are fantastic and the characters are responsible for some of the best moments in this story. The movie is wonderful and the performances of the talented actors and the stunning actresses, and a realistic behavior at a family gathering. Follow the advice in Dan's column and plan to be surprised with the reunion of Burns' family. My vote is eight. <br /> Title (Brazil): "Eu, Meu Irm√£o and Nossa Namorada" ("Me, Our Brothers and Your Girlfriends")
