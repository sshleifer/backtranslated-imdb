I purchased the DVD set on a recommendation from Amazon.com based on my other interest. They hit the nail on the head with this one. I remember watching the show when she was on TV, but always wondering what happened to her. Ten years later, it's like watching it all again for the first time. Lucas Black as the Caleb and Gary Cole temples as Sheriff Lucas Buck are great together, though they are a bit rivals. Almost represents good (Caleb) and evil (Sherriff Lucas Buck). I never really understood exactly what Lucas was supposed to say, but to say so, it has some special powers that I do not believe were granted by the Holy Spirit. It can make ring phone, write displayed, or even cause someone's emotion to change. No less there, there are a few episodes where it actually gets the good guy in spite of it all. All in all, this is an excellent example of how many others I can think of (I.E. Point Pleasant, Threshold, None of Man, and SeaQuest DSV just to name a few) have been canceled before time. Steven King's Dead Zone (Network USA Sunday) seems to be the only thing in this genre that seems to be doing it. There is just nothing to look at on TV again. This is because anything related to Christianity and Satan is considered offensive and must be instantly pulled out of television. So, in the meantime, I'll just keep buying DVDs and watching shows that should always be on TV, but the TV boot is not religious wing so we could watch "quality" shows like Family Guy and American Dad and The Simpsons (this is a bunch of crap that is).
