I did not feel that this movie was quite as smart as it seemed to think it was but enjoyed it anyway. <br /> It's original, although reminded me a little from two other French films, Vidocq and the Children's Town, especially for the coloring, but also for the good orgy of the ups close to the characters. /> <br /> Put in a prison cell, but do not let this put you off, this movie seemingly goes beyond much a multiple blockbuster located. <br /> <br /> Still interesting, with the 'Black Art' endless well in the forefront and very good character making some only too credible! <br /> <br /> Scary and some gorts are well worth a look.
