The Sarah Silverman program is ... better than that other show. No street tracks, no hurt jokes, just a program. Sara Silverman program. If you are like me, and you love comedy, this is probably a show for you. Sarah Silverman brings out-there-funny, and right-here-funny to the table with ease. A mixture of different styles, made for its own. This program is not something you want to start a war compared to, seeing how it has absolutely nothing to do with them (other shows). This show is its own entity, and I think that most comedy head will love it just fine. <br /> <br /> Go look and see.
