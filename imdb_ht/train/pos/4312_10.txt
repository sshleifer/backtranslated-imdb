If you have not seen this movie excellent about life in the 90s (in L.A.) then you missed a special treat. This is one of the most amazing and most powerful movies ever made on life for Americans in the 90s and even brings about in today's world in which we live in. It covers everything from raising a child, prejudice (plus than one way), love, adultery, blank nest syndrome, selfishness, etc. and the list goes on. This story builds up to a final point and then when nothing else it always goes back to love with friends and family and love in life. It helps us dig deep into our heads and make us search for what we want out of life. Let's ask ourselves about ourselves. Are we doing enough for others, do we love that, etc. ??? Sit back and enjoy a beautiful and emotional movie that I am sure others will enjoy for a lifetime. <br /> Take notes of Mary McDonnell, Kevin Kline and Danny Glover's beautiful performance in this entire movie. These actors are amazing and really show the true glowing and the meaning of what messages are sent to all of us. These are 3 of my favorite actors for life after seeing this movie over 10 years ago now. I still enjoy it again and again. Also enjoy the wonderful band with it and remember how many times you see flying to helicopters by and try to figure out her symbols for the movie hmmm ... I almost forget this is probably Steve Martin's very first serious acting role in any His movie has never been done. He is also an excellent work of this film. This can come as a surprise to most of you. Sit back, relax and enjoy really movie making .....
