What can be said about the compelling performance of Tara Fitzgerald? It is utterly credible as Mrs. Graham's injury, stubborn, sharp and strong-enriching, but not immune to the passionate attention of Mr Markham. Through every mischievous look and each rocket of temperament, each flicker of discernment in his eyes, says facial expressions, Toby Stephens is a master of his character. It is the strength of passion and hope that will restore Helen's injured spirit. China 'Huntingdon is a perfect performance in the unreformable rogue. But despite all that he has done, there is a dignity that can not be denied in his refusal to play the hypocrisy in the end; He is at least aware of his own weakness and how he made his ruin. Helen's attempt to save his soul - after leaving it, taking their children at a time when it was strange - is a triumph of hope, hope and faith in the value of every human life and soul, however misguided , but sin that man can. Markham's constancy can then be seen as a reward for his faith and unmatched moral character. Though the ideas of morals are strongly presented to tenants alike obsolete by today's standards, the story is the impenetrable and integrity, passion, and conviction that always makes an impact. The tenant is far more credible than Wuthering Heights or even Jane Eyre; here is an adaptation of the novel justice. I highly recommend watching it!
