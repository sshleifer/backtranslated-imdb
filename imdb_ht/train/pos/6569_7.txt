"Jake Speed" is a fine film and a wonderful message. It had its flaws of course. At times it's a bit slow. It introduces its villains so far in the story. Its action is rhythm at a snail's rate. He had a Z-class throw (although I still admired the work of Karen Kopins, who has right-laced looks good at Sandra Bullock). But with all that goes against it, "Jake Speed" is truly inspired, thanks to a good script by Wayne Crawford (who plays the title role) and Andrew Lane. Why did I find it so inspiring? Because he tells me "Hey, why not try to be a good person." The story is essentially an "alien to a strange country", which is good-e-heroic Jake Speed ​​is placed in the real world where bad things happen to good people. Jake is more than a Boy Scout. It is more than a knight of shining armor. Jake Speed ​​is the patron saint of optimism in a dirty world, mean and wrong. Because of this "Jake speed" really needs to be a hit. It has a great message that should come from Hollywood and then to the rest of the world. <br /> Imagine a movie industry that really pushes itself to show good and decent people. I do not say that we should watch the Waltons in every theater in the cineplex, but it would be nice if more movies like "Jake Speed" would get a chance. ("Due to South," a television show on a Canadian mountain, is a good comparison of what can be done to illuminate American entertainment.) Be sure, "Jake Speed" has violence, blood and gun, but the overall message is that if you try hard enough to be a good man, you will beat the forces of evil every time. 10/14/99
