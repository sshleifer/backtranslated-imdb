Jafar Panahi's comedy-drama "Offside" shows some women trying to enter Tehran sports ground from which women are banned. The official reason: many bad language, and football players have their feet showing. But of course, it's really a case of sexism. So most of the movie consists of comic easing as women try to ask the serious question questions about why women are banished from the stadium, and a woman even comes up with her own plot to challenge the guys. <br /> <As I understand, all Jafar Panahi's movies (this included) are prohibited in Iran. The real tragedy is that the CIA 1953 overturned by the prime minister and subsequent retreat to the brutal carriage gave Ayatollah Khomeini an excuse to use his narrow interpretation of the Koran to establish a chauvinistic society, and current political George W. Bush's towards Iran gives Mahmoud Ahmadinejad an excuse to act the cowboy and tighten censorship. <br /> <br /> Above all, this is a neat look at those who come up with the way to challenge the system. Not a big movie, but worth seeing. Considering that all Jafar Panahi movies are forbidden, I wonder how he could even make them.
