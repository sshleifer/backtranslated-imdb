Complete, worried and implausible, Grim Fault is difficult to sit in Parker Posey's really the only actress who can take this story and run with it. It's once touched, funny, cunning. The actors are supporting her commits too .. <br /> I do not even try to tell you the draw .. It involves characters from Hartley Henry crazy and tries a story of international spying. The movie works well if you continue along with it-understand it is. in a sense, completely ridiculous. It becomes more and more ridiculous as you plod along. (I resists the temptation to close the DVD twice). <br /> <br /> Faulty grim requires a movie-goer adventur wanting to attack something that is not cookie-knife. In the end, it offers something challenging description.
