I like this movie! The animation is great (for a Pokemon movie), the cgi looks so awesome. I love the music of the movie. So big they kept the Japanese music. <br /> As for the story: its great. He had a great feeling of friendship. Celebi is a very beautiful and powerful Pokemon. Ash is really great in this movie, and I love her friends with Sam. The only thing I did not like was Suicune's appearance, it just suddenly pops up, helping Ash & Co a bit with leaves. They could be part of the movie a little bigger. <br /> But in general, awesome movie! Can not wait to own the USA version on DVD!
