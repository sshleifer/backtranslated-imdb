I love Ashley Judd and think all his films are great. Ruby <br /> <br /> in Paradise is one of her best. It's a very understatement movie that you really have to look close to appreciate it. A story of a woman trying to do it on her own and refusing to give in to temptation would make her life easy. Some of her movies like Girls Kiss and Time to Kill probably did better in box office and video rental. They were pretty good movies <br /> <br /> too, but take the time to really look at Ruby and I think you'll agree he's one of Ashley's best. <br /> <br />
