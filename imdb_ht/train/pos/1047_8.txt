It may (or may not) be considered interesting that the only reason I really checked out this movie in the first place is because I wanted to see the performance of those who beat out Humphrey Bogart in his CASABLANCA (10/10 The role of Best Actress Oscar. (I always give Oscar the Bogie, but Paul Lukas did a great job and deserved the nomination, at least.) Well, I'm glad I checked this movie out because I enjoyed it extreme I think the film was preached a little, but not only I did not mind, I enjoyed the speeches and never bored with them. <br /> <br /> The act was outstanding in this movie. Lucile Watson (precisely nominated for an Oscar), Bette Davis (poorly nominated), George Coulouris and, strange, Eric Roberts, who plays midnight. I really enjoyed his character: an odd-looking boy some sort of philosopher It just crazy me. Even the character names (Bodo) are funny. g, in which character Lukas was forced to do something he considered me Even if he did it for all the right reasons, worked for me too. I agreed to why he felt he did what he was doing, and I understand why he could not explain it well. This film making is a good and noble, the landscape (meaning the house) is beautiful, and the act is the excellent. Watch this movie if you ever get a chance. <br /> 9/10
