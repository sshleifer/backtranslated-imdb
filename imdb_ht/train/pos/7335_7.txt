With Ralph Bakshi most of his films appear like two swords. You will find something awesome out of it, but only if you put the comic and the cheesy unnecessarily. The Lord of the Rings was a great adaptation of the story that maybe not always bright in the animation department. <br /> <br /> Fire and Ice is a great success from Bakshi from an animation point. The Rotoscoping is a lot more detailed and the animation has a vibrant look at it. You still find some of the still-cell cells and paint a little deep background but the over-all look definitely became much better since the latest Bakshi fantasy season. The animation is almost a realistic-natural style, and unlike in LOTR this style was often at odds with the current content, here it improves the unique atmosphere of the movie. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately the movie fails to create a meaningful story from its simple surroundings and in reality most of the characters' motives are very cloudy. Lorn and Tigra are easy but even the main villain Necron was hard to follow by not mentioning that Guy and Finger Face Mask (also called 'That Guy'). Though most of the voice actors were inappropriate, some odd curious ones in the audio and tape department especially sound really awful whenever it's screaming. <br /> However, I believe that the inherent entertainment value exceeds it unnecessarily funny execution of the draw-line. Understanding the character of the characters is something you will never get on but it helps you remind yourself that maybe this movie is not even intended to be taken too seriously. It's always a cool hello and really funny.
