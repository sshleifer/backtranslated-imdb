This movie is one of those nostalgia stuff with me and I never really expect anyone else to "get it", but I'm happy when I recommend it to someone to enjoy it. My late father was Arthur Askey but this movie was one he really enjoyed with his consistent enthusiasm for "Ghost Train" and "Old Ted" Olmes "transferred to me as a kid. Years later, I watch it every now and again, enjoy the familiar. I always wonder if it will not be well but I'm not ashamed of it. There are many enjoyments. The subway on the train is truly inspiring when Askey and Murdoch continue to harass the rogue male riders. Then the whole section of the station is amazing and so much going on you have to keep up. Yes, it is dated and full of British during the accent and draw war (based on the original play by Arnold Ridley in the fame of Father's Army!) But full of wonderful character performance - including Kathleen Harrison as a dotty spinster. The atmosphere is really as near disaster as a car Askey car could get. This is available cheaply as boat in the UK on DVD for treating yourself. It's a perfect Saturday / Sunday morning or any day of lazy days that lightweight play in entertainment. I thank you ... <br /> <br /> old pics can be good movie!
