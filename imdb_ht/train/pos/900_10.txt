This is one of Bollywood's best movies I've seen up to now. Family and friends feel the same way about it. This movie is really romantic and dramatic at the same time. In my opinion we need more films or movies as this keeps South Asian culture alive. Shahid Kapoor and Amrita Rao have acted very well in this, too, couples are attracted to many of these films. This is a must see movie, it's a family movie and romantic. This film also comes from the makers of Hum Saath Saath Hain and Hum Apke Hain Kon. This film is much better now ... the environment of the movie was beautiful that is also a great attraction. This movie must see ... recommend everyone!
