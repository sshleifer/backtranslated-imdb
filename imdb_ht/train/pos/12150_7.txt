This movie is one of the many "Kung Fu" films that were made in late 1980s 'early' 80s, full of sound sound effects, armed with lightning fast martial art artwork. But unlike most films in this genre it also has a decent draw and great comedy. When workers in an ink factory are forced out of work by Manchu bullies, they hire a con-artist (Gordon Liu) to try to scare them off. When his attempt failed miserably, he wanted to make his way to a Shaolin Temple to learn to fight for real. But instead of doing a student Kung-Fu, the Master rather ordered him to build a scaffold to cover the roofs of all 36 rooms. Well, it turns out that while doing these menial tasks (stacking and tying bamboo poles) that he learned to be an expert Kung-Fu expert! It's sort of like in Karate Kid when Mr. Miagi teaches the Daniel Basics of Karate does not have to do the housework routine - "Wax over, wax cut" and tight. There are many great comedians from the beginning to end, with lots of action at the end when Gordon Liu once again faces his Manchu torcho. "This time is not just tricks - is the real thing!" Liu stated, proudly tracing his chest. If you like classic kung fu movie you do not want to miss this one!
