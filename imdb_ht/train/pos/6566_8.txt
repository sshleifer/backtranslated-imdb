Ever wonder where the ideas for romance novels and other papers back out? According to 'Jake Speed' are based on real people, living out the writing and publishing adventures. This movie is family entertainment quality, moderate amount of violence, and chic clothing in the worst. The language is also not a problem, and the jokes are funny at all levels. This is an 'Austin Powers' look at 'American Jones', without the over-the-top deposits of Michael Myers. I highly recommend this movie for kids in the range 10 to 15.
