Despite its low-key disclosure in this country, with its apparent negligence in other countries ('R' rating in the United States can not help - honestly, just because HBC uses the C-word!), This is actually a fine piece of work. The sentimentality periodically threatens to curb it, but it's overcome by playing in the conduct. It's easy to win plaudits just because you're playing a physical or mental crisis (Daniel Day-Lewis, Geoffrey Rush, Dustin Hoffman, etc.), and Helena Bonham-Carter can not properly take the physical degradation of MND, but its vocal stretching and without emotional drive to compensate entirely. In fact, almost all its performance will be in his eyes (with that eye!). This is an intelligent turn from an actress who quickly snatches his English reputation to Rose, and emerges as a figure in some highs. Price will surely follow, but not, alas, for this fine performance. Branagh, one feels, never properly gives his best on film (except possibly 'Hamlet', and has played it diluted by the great cast). Here, though, she herself its other appearance, plays in Hilt's a self-stylish, unstable, ultimate lovable guy and a subtle it has not always appeared, and shows both intelligence and depth. In short, we believe it, as much as we could not believe it as Frankenstein, as the priest of the 'Proposal', as the lawyer of the 'Gingerbread Man', as Andrew in 'Peter's Friend a '. This is probably her finest performance again - so why it can not produce the earlier goods? <br /> As a movie, it looks more like a television offering, and without stars it probably would not be much amount. But it was a pleasure to see this scary socks off like this, and I'm gonna wait more at them (even if it's not Love Love Labor ...). 8 out of 10, but Branagh and HBC get 10 out of 10.
