Wow, how can I even discuss this movie without tears coming in my eyes? It was surely the highlight of my year - no - my life. As if the Raptor graphics were not amazing enough, the award-winning editors continued to use the exact same shot of the entire movie, even when the background did not actually match up the setting of the scene. Wow, that genius. And while the film is full of hole-hole (for example, a few clips of a kind of T-Rex type where a raptor should be with one key time where Pappy finds a torture room, shouting "Colin a Girl!" run out) I will never forget the brightness of Raptor Planet. Thank you Sci-Fi for another classic.
