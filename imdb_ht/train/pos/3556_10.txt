Oh, this is like a glorious music. There is a bit of miscasting - Frank Sinatra is sorely miscast as the Nathan Detroit Jew, though it only becomes evident on "My Sue", which is a shiny joint song. Unfortunately, the filmmakers decided to cut out from one of the best songs in the show, "Marry the Man Today", and replace it with an incredible Sinatra show. With these flaws in mind, the movie is otherwise magnificent. Jean Simmons shines as Sara Brown. Marlon Brando can not sing weight well, but pull it on anyway. Stubby Kaye beautifully reprimanded her Broadway role (she wrote for her). The Langon Damon Runyon with rhythms and humor comes in well. This is about I see-it-every-chance-I-get list.
