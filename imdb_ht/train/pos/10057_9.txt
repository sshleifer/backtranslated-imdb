I went to bed with my gf last night, and while she brushed her teeth, I fluttered channels until I came across this Chinese movie called the King of Mask. At first I thought he was going to make a movie kung fu, so I started looking at him and then he immediately captured me, and I finished it. The little girl in the movie was absolutely adorable. It was such a great actor for being so little. Maybe the fact it was in Chinese, so the armed English made it harder to say ... but it really seemed to be of character perfectly. I felt so bad for the girl as she kept trying to please "boss" but everything just turned out rotten. lol. Even when he brings another son, just so he can spend on his art ... it turns out that the kid was kidnapped, so he was arrested and has 5 days to live. lol ... whatever it touches in an effort to be beautiful to his father, just backwards. <br /> <br /> In the end, she sees how much love is in her and teaches her the art of mask ... which is just for heartwarming after all those who are lost in the movie. <br /> <br /> Definitely a gem, and totally original.
