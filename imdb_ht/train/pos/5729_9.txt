This is a bit of a puzzle for a lot of the artsy Lynch mobs. They tend to try to write this as some kind of nonsense, bit, side project at Lynch. Like this Lynch passes gas between his real piece of film art. Well it can be a fart, but its one of these intriguing farts that you catch in a respirator and they embarrassed to admit you enjoy. <br /> <br /> Dumbland distilled down beyond this art. What you can do with aspects of modern life, but laugh at it. If you have taken it seriously you would go black. You hook in it, smell it, taste it, feel its agony, stupid without its purpose, and then express it in any way you choose. This is called art, and art is not mute. But it is Dumbland.
