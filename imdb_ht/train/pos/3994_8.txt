I went to this movie only because I was dragging there and I would have left again immediately because the audience was mostly born in elderly people and I felt out of place. However, the film was completely fascinating and far from being aimed towards old people. The characters were all very real and credible and I found myself discussing the movie, the characters and the storyline for hours later. There are quite a few aggressive scenes in hand but are necessary and help you understand the situation better. All in all, this is a great and valuable movie - a little bit of mainstream but that does not mean that this film can not be enjoyed by people who are mainstream. It is a thrilling and exciting movie experience.
