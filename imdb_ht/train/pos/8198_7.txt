Harry's room has been stolen under a victim of rape extracting revenge by shooting his attackers in the goolies before they are killed. Probably a fairer punishment should be left to live after the first shot and let them suffer forever as he and his sister have ... Anyway ..... a story of action packed again in San Francisco and Santa Cruz. Grab the masterpiece, played by Andy Drake is vulnerable and gets his punishment at the end (of course!). Not a classic movie but better than the others except for Harry's original room.
