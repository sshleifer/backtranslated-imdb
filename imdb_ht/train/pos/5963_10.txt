This movie is awful, but you have to see it because of that. I'm not here to discuss the entire movie, just the greatest performer ever pursued. When Eddie dumbs letters on Tim, she gets kicked down the hallway. Eddie puts obstacles in how jocks and hilarious consequences (such as a cymbal blink of a trumpet player; buy the DVD and watch it slow). The best obstacle is a hit on mop buckets that one jock jumps over the sliding slopes on the ground from a door. But when it slips it chooses to speed up so challenging physics (mostly friction); Again lies lies behind the door is supreme. The most steepest staircase in any school ever, which jock continues in CLEAR in the air. In fact it probably would die in a broken neck. Not only does he challenge all concepts of reality, he makes the hollow noise ever made in this situation. Go and buy this one. Believe this scene is worth 6 bucks.
