I owned this movie and watched it several times throughout the years since it was released. Prince does not skip us with her phenomenal style or anything, she is a musician and I feel like that is what she looks here, it's just the best one to tell this story of influence. Most of this movie is simple and fast, but this is the director / writer fault, still it is a great movie and even better music. The principals and moral convictions in the pillar of rugs are so loud and if more movies would depend on the basics that teach us as young children we would have a better environment environment to see that art reflects life-reflecting art.
