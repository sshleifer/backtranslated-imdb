This is a story about Shin-Ae, who moved to Milyang from Seoul and his young Jun to start on after the accident death of her husband. Her husband was born here, and she opened a piano school, but she also has ambitions in her own country and the insurance she received from the death. If that is the movie was over, it would probably be such a Hollywood movie, and it fell for some local guys and happy with her son in their new home. But this is not Hollywood. Her son gets kidnapped and murdered, officially because she is known to have cash in the settlement. Grief, attempts to move on, trying to clear his awareness of guilt, they all admire, and the lead actress is superb. The only opposition, and it must be stated, is that this is a depressive film. You must know what will be in. You want Shin and go to grief and get some happiness measure. Again, this is not Hollywood, it is Korean and Korean cinema, especially drama, to pull no punches. Life is what's happening to you. Great act, but sometimes a hard movie to look, due to go on. If you stay, you will be rewarded. Do this.
