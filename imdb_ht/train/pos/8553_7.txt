I just watch the movie I was afraid of it to disappoint me. I was rather surprised at the end though. The American pie franchise is still in my favorite franchise movies ever. Yes, it will not be true if I say that I liked it as boiling as I enjoyed the original. Beta home with the previous two most definitely loses something that the first two te.it will not become a classic as the first two have already done. but the hell is still funny with a lot of good times and I think it should be the first movie to choose if you want to have fun and relax after a hard day at work or at school. Home beta deserved 6/10 but I gave it 7/10 just to be another tranche of PIE.
