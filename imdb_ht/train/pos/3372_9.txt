Its time to pay tribute to Heston's big chart at his recent past, but this movie is not the one. His other films in a recent generation were BEN HUR, KENDAN, OMG MAN and PLANET in APES were his best work. The movie was made in 1973 to try to predict a future earth, in 2022, which is so overpopulated that the human race was manipulated by the authorities to eat a product of universal food called "Soylent Green" is manufactured with human body. This rare and implausible film was as ridiculous at the time of its release as it is now and assuming the population of India that could be about 2 billion at that stage would then eat meat eaters without knowing it . <br /> <br /> Charlton Heston's character supers secrets international scheme that global powers have been compelled to meet the nutritional demands of overpopulation using cannibalism. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately for the producers of this film the Green message is delivered by the Greens Party in today's ethos thanks to God. Cannibalism was practiced by the indigenous peoples of New Zealand, Fiji and Borneo up to 40 years before this film was made but was long abandoned by human civilization. Another funny prediction of the movie is that women become slave slaves sex turned the tide of radical feminist on which the rise in 1972 when this film was made. The movie was stupid then and it is as funny now but it has a very unmemorable last movie performance by Edward G. Robinson late and big but still does not have a valid reason to review the movie other than for academic purposes. This is a dude in a movie and I would not even recommend it to baby boomers or Charlton Heston fans. All other review of this movie I read all sounds referring to a future dystopian society in which the centralized theme only seems to involve the USA in which an ecological disaster occurred. Only the merit of the movie is that the world faces overpopulation.
