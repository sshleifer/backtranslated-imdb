My father, Dr. Gordon Warner (Major Retreat, US Marine Corps), was in Guadalcanal and lost his leg in the Japanese, and also received the Cross Navy. I was pleasantly surprised to learn that my father was advised of the technique of this film and I hope he had an impact on the film in making it look like it really was back then as I read in various comments written by the viewers of this film that he looks like real life. My dad is a fan of reality and face, and always wanted things to see how they were so I would like to believe he had something to do with that. <br /> It is currently living in Okinawa, Japan, married to my mother for more than 40 years (ironically, it is Japanese), and a few years ago was awarded one of the major orders of the Emperor of Japan for contributions He and the activities brought back to Kendo and Iaido in Japan since McArthur was banned after WWII. <br /> <br /> My father was once a sailor but I know that once you're a navy, you're still a sailor. And it's exactly what it is and I love and respect it very much. <br /> I would like to be able to watch this movie if someone will have a copy of it. And I would like to give it to my father for her 94th birthday this year!
