As a dead-hard baseball, this movie goes contrary to what I hope in a sports movie: authentic-looking sports, credible characters, and an original story line. While the "Angels of the Outfield" failed miserably in the first category, it succeeded very well in the two letters. "Angels" twisted the story of Roger and J.P., Anaheim foster children in love with baseball but searching for a family, and those of the high frug Angels Franchise, the drawbacks to draw fans and win games. Prompted by the promise of his father's father that they should be a family only when the Angels have the winning, Roger asks for some help in the sky, and gets it in the form of diamond-staying spirit on reversing the spiral under the spiral . And when short-fusion manager George Knox (posted by Danny Glover) begins to believe in what Roger sees, the team suddenly hopes to turn the seasons around - and Roger and JP find something to believe in Glover in particular to give a nice performance, and Tony Danza, play a wash-up jar, also perform well, although clearly have ZEWO ideas on how to start from the windup!
