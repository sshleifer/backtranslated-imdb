I've always been a fan of the show so I'll admit that I'm partial. When running the show ended, I felt like too many questions left unanswered. This movie I felt like closing. To see everyone I would follow over the past few years the last one was most rewarding. I've heard that this is probably the only homicide film that we can expect. If so, this is the appropriate way to go out. This film is sometimes poignant, sometimes troubling, but still satisfied. If you are or ever been a fan of the show, watch this movie.
