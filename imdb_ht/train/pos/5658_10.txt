This was one of the best shows ever made for TV. Full of mysteries and intrigue with twists and turns. Controlled look. I was lucky I saw in the UK. They might have received the wrong episode order, I can not remember, but it at least was over at a regular time every week. My girlfriend and I were hooked out of the trailer, and neither of us is a great fan of American series normally. After the pilot, we knew this was something special. We missed a couple of episodes, and it made you sad and angry for a week missing those lol. <br /> <br /> Great casting, superb acting. Gary Cole was absolutely brilliant, better than her role as Custer. Lucas Black turned into an amazing performance for a kid, and Paige Turco was at her best too since Part of Five. With Nick Searcy of course, as the Sheriff's long suffering sidekick. <br /> Yes, there were some confusing and complex bits, which I supposed to explain later, and no doubt would have been in a series later. Those who were facing weak, and you might say they would kill him. Did you go WHERE? Why did this with one of the best shows ever? Shoot the executive.
