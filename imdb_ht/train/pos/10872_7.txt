Election marks the movie judge's 2nd Judge Society's trial led by Johnnie Pou. But Simon Yan and Tony Leung Kar Fai as Lok and Big D, as two members of the trial were selected as candidates for the position of chairman for Ho Sing Society, a 100 year old trial of society. <br /> While Lok is a man who keeps her cool at all times, Big D is not only impatient, but also thinks he is on top of everything. Lok was chosen as the next president for 2 years. To control the gang's total, the newly elected chairman must go down with a dragon stick, representing power and authority. Big D was very pleased with the results that he had not chosen to be the next chairman after paying a pretty face of bribery board members. He ordered his man to get the Baton before falling on the hands of Lok. <br /> While Big D is getting the stick, Lok has other plans for him. one of the societal social society societies where there is not much blood flow needed. Johnnie To place the evangelist in the human beings of the movie, where bloodshed often used in other societal judgment sessions show how evaris of human beings can cause the death or fall into one. However, no single bullet is used, hardly any gangfights to participate in Elections. It is the bloody battle that makes Elections mean from the rest. <br /> <br /> Apart from Maggie Shiu, the only actress in Elections with less than 5 lines is spoken in the whole movie, masculinity movie regulation at all. Louis Koo and Nick Cheung, who were seen in the previous movie, were cast as a civilian cop and a gangster who sold his life to the gang respectively. Together with some of the veteran actors who make their appearance in the film and the excellent script, it only makes the HK film represent Cannes Wire Festival 2005. Elections have hardly failed any criticism that wants a different trial movie theme society.
