One of the best "Amitabh reaparic" movies I liked. This was the phase when Govinda went strong with Dhawan. The songs were frightening and totally as we call it "masti" kind. An Evergreen craftsman and the likes of Anupam Kher's multiplayer chipping in. The storyline has a lot of hilarious twists and turns as it is known for David Dhawan's potboilers. With a proper appearance by Mrs.Madhuri "Nene" Dixit, it was a total riot towards the end. It was great to see Amit do with strength like and humor after a long exile. Although some may consider it a typical "Bollywood Masala movie" movie, I would watch it any day. I give it an easy 8 out of 10 just for being Bollywood.
