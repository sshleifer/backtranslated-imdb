First of all, do not go to revolver looking for another Snatch or Lock Stock, this is a different sort of movie gangster. <br /> I saw gala at night in the other and this movie definitely split the audience. It's the kind of movie where half the audience leaves thinking what was? That was terrible, and the other half left thinking what was? That was cool. Personally I love films that I do not understand, i.e.Mullholland Drive, and often annually, so I enjoyed revolver. <br /> It definitely was not perfect though. I saw the big twist coming a mile away, at least a part of it, and if sometimes some ending left unreasonably good, Revolver left a lot of questions unreasonably for any reason it seemed. Also some scenes, such as the animation, and the scenes where stereos go on a killing spree (actually one of my favorites), although, the awesome scenes look, seemed to have just because they were scared to look, not because they fit in and the movie. <br /> However there were so many good things too. I thought the act was superb to all the main actors, Jason Stratham, Ray Liotta, Vincent Pastore, and even Andrew Benjamin (which was a nice surprise). This movie definitely keeps my interests, with one big, thrilling, action packed, scene after another. When Ray Liotta was caught under the Wow table .... well you have to see it. The script was beautifully done, and the soundtrack, like most Guy Ritchie movie, was great. Even though a step below these films such as Fight Club, Mullholland Drive, and suspicion in general, it has always been an awesome fast paced, psychological, action movie, with many twists and turns and tonal tonals you will remember long after movie in is over.
