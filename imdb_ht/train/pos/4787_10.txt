David Lynch usually makes films similar to puzzles put together wrongly. They are interesting to look at and think about their hands really not gall in mind. Maybe art will always mean more of its creator. <br /> <br /> The right story is not a typical film by David Lynch. Not that there's something typical about them anyway. It is an odyssey in the rural America. A real life trip to Alvin Straight took over a lawn mower to get to his brother's house. It was up 300 miles from Laurens, Iowa at Mt. Siyon, Wisconsin makes compensation for his sick brother for past offenses. At the heart of this movie is sweet Voice Richard Farnsworth. It brings Alvin right right in a simple and honest manner. The fact that the movie is around Alvin's pace travel slows toward realization. <br /> <br /> Alvin's way to meet a confused and frightening girl. She was pregnant and decided to run away from her situation. After Alvin heard about his family reconsidering them. <br /> <br /> And Alvin witnesses a woman in war to kill a deer and his car. He complained that he had killed several and herbs. Alvin feels bad but is smart enough to cook up some meat my dear night. <br /> <br /> Later Mower Lawn Alvin loses his brakes and almost kills him. A lovely man and his wife left him in the yard while he got it fixed. They even let her call her sweet daughter but she slowly, nicely played by Sissy Spacek, which is haunted by a terrible tragedy in his past. Alvin insists on paying for the call. The same man offered Alvin driving to his brothers and pleasures. Alvin refuses and thanks. <br /> While Alvin awaits it also goes to a bar with an old old man as they discuss the stiffness of war and the price it takes on their souls. Alvin even confessed a fatal mistake he had made as a professional shooter who has hated her forever. Alvin also met two brutal fees that repaired his lawn mower. He speaks down in price wisely calls them on their hard work and repair costs. It even helps them appreciate each other learning from his own mistakes and his brothers. The night before Alvin left the man's yard and took his hat to go to him. The man said he was an honor that had left him and asked Alvin to write him. This scene is perfect in its simplicity. It's heartbreaking because it's so straightforward, so real. <br /> <br /> The journey continues and we can not help to get more and more involved with it. We want Alvin to get to his brothers. We want him to make compensation. We want to know this world full of forgiveness. <br /> This was Richard Farnsworth at her best. It was her latest film and her performance was amazing. You can not help but to understand his pride, listen to his wisdom, and finally feel his pain. One gets as if to take with him as the man who offers his backyard to stay in. If there is justice in the afterlife then Alvin Straight, his brother, and Richard Farnsworth are sitting in a bar. I can picture them discuss life, regret, hope, and happiness. As Alvin says in the movie, "Brothers and I used to look at the stars." Well, I know them all and look at the best of the house.
