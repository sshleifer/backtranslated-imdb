I had this movie on tapes for years and started watching it again this morning (while waiting for my laundry - how ironic!) Mainly because I wanted to hear the Benjamin Frankel title titled again . I ended up sitting in about half the first half hour, entertained by how nice to ensure the direction, writing, and performance. The film is like a person who is in person of 50 British character stars: Cecil Parker, Michael Gough, Miles Malleson, Duncan Lamont, and particularly Ernest Thesiger, as great as old giant design of the fabric mills. Not to mention Alec Guinness and Joan Greenwood, by character players as such driving but charming, charisma. This is science fiction in its purest form and foliage comedy as well. A classic ever, and I hope no one ever tries to notice it!
