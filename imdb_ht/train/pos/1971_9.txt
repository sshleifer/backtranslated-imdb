I have no idea what people are complaining about. I saw this movie yesterday and I really love it. Stone once again delivers a great character. It was just as good as it was in the first basic instinct. He always has smart, but difficult answers. Although Sharon can be 48 years old ... it looks amazing! I do not care if it's as fake as a Barbie. It looks good and that's that. Basic Instinct 2 gives you everything you want from the first. Sex, violence, and a great ending that will let you think and talk about it for hours! Half the people commenting on this movie did not even see it. So do not listen to them.
