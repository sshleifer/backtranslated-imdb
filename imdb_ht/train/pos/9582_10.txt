After growing up in the bravest streets of Detroit, MI, and having friends who traveled to New York balls, I fell into the form of being a member of the House. I went to House of Theieves. We adapt the rules as most houses, but we were professional Crooks who would strengthen and commit credit card fraud to find the fabulous jewelry and clothes we want. I even learned how to make checks and drivers with cash in more than seventy states, until a Queen of Hearts call me the Secret Service on me and I went to Federal Prison. But I've learned a lot of these queens in this movie and I highly recommend you watch it yourself. You can even read about how I grew up in the homes here in Detroit and our criminal activity resumes in my book, Idemite Schemes available on sale at Amazon dot com or in Identite Schemes dot com. But trust me, It's a lot better than Paris is burning, because it's a 2005 make.
