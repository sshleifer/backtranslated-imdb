I would even say some shades of Hitchcock ... this is clearly better than MMM, which is seen as a pleasure of guilt by some if not most fancy Woody. By the way, did you know that Annie Hall was conceived as a murderous mystery? Anyway, Woody claims some of the importance of this movie comedy. The plot turns them beautiful and tight. I'll say that in the first 20 minutes or so, some of the actors are a bit too skip in delivering the lines, but sticking around. Scarlett Johansson proves well cast in the role of Diane Keaton-type, and in no time has any uncomfortable moments between him and Woody at much older. No one can imagine a perfect actor for the role of Peter Lyman than Jackman.
