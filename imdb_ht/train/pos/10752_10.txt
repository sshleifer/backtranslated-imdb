This was the most visually stunning, moving, amazing and incredible story I've ever experienced. Quite frankly, even these adjectives just can not describe it. I can not just pick a scene that stands for me. I suppose if I had to list a few it would be the reaction of the firefighter to the crashing scramble to jump victims; The reaction of those who blocked the elevator, which was unaware of what was going on, as they finally emerged from the terrible scene; the trauma and disbelief of the onlookers; and finally the silence. <br /> <br /> In that day, and even now, I remember in Star Wars (1977). Obi-Wan says, "I felt a big disruption to the force, as if millions of voices suddenly cried out in fear and were suddenly silenced." It's amazing how it is so accurate in its description. There was really a disorder in the force. <br /> <br /> This documentary clearly reveals this disorder. Their feelings are so incredibly visual. The anger, frustration, trauma, fear, fatigue, and the realization of its many magnitude. It all has. It's not something missing. <br /> This is a powerful and most moving documentary and worthy documentary of the Emmy. Not only because it documents 9/11 but because it is simply everything it should be. <br /> <br /> If you plan to look, make sure you grab a tissue box. You will need them. I know I did.
