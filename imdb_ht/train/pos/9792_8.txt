Once a year "comes" a movie like that and make things easy for you. You do not have an effort to think it is good, it just is. You enjoy it while watching it, and you take it home with you. I can not say it is totally impeccable, but it's close. Acting - great, story-interesting and elemental in suspense. It's a small family story, pretty much predictable, but it's no secret in itself that matter. It is the way it takes the blind girl to reach her. I was impressed by the way the director described the deep relationships (the blind girl and her cousin). The only thing I did not like is that much is the actress who played the mother, it was too hard and unnecessary. Keren
