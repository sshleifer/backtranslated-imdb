Is the script more appropriate for a Sitcom 30 minute? Yes, but still do it work! I thought the actors did a fantastic job with an otherwise bold script, especially Jack Black and Christopher Walken. Most people on the board seem to really hate this movie. I personally can not see how this might be, but Envy is just one of those films that you either love or hate it. Many like Napoleon Dynamite and every Leslie Neilsen movie ever made. You either think it is one of the worst movies ever made or one of the funniest. Do not avoid this movie because of the reviews. Watch it and see if you are one of those who really love it! If you do, I guarantee it's worth your money. If you do not like it ... well, now you know.
