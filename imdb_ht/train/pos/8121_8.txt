The message of a world on the brink of war is despised by the masses; The mythical city of Everytown in 1940 represented England in general, but it could just as well stand for any nation in the world. When the war finally came, it's ravage continued for another five years, but until 1966 in that time Everytown is completely destroyed. Adding to desolation and toll on humanity is the "losing disease", a disease that continues for another four years. <br /> <br /> "Things come" balance both a fatalist and futuristic world, where science holds out a hope for a revived civilization. "The Wings of the World" concept plays a laugh, though it's Cabal's spokesman (Raymond Massey) is unwavering in his mission and dedicated to his cause. If it fails, others will follow. This message is still strengthened throughout the movie, brought home compelling at the end of the Massey in films. The insatiable Man needs to test the boundaries of knowledge and success require a "whole universe or anything" attitude. The film's films of automation and the second half machine is reminiscent of the film "Silent Metropolis" silent. As Chaktown was rebuilt and transformed by the year 2036, the spectacle of Reben City struck a resonant rope, as the modern city architecture of today suggests the profoundly prophetic vision of coming to fruition. Where the film gets hurt by sixty seven years even though it is the first man's mission in the moon, but in 1936, a seven-year-old year probably seemed more legitimate than 1969. <br /> "things happen "is one of those rarities in film, a picture that makes you think. Which side will you go down on, the forces for the advance in the face of uncertainty or keep the situation? It's not a comfortable question, as well as choices that offer inherent dangers and subconscious results. Those who choose to be inspectors risk being swept away by force beyond their control.
