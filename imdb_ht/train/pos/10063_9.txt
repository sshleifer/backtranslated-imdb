The film is beautiful and the environment is really realistic. I liked that he boldly regressed the concept of many difficult Mori Morals and Social in the Chinese mainland Chinese as well as more basic human questions - I felt I could get a real sense at times, recreating the same Splendid shots of Chinese traditional theater and purist rhythms in living streets. It seemed refreshing to experiment. The role of interwoven Buddhist play is probably the most true-to-form - both in its menu and its philosophical aspect, perhaps the most effective I've seen in Chinese films. Distribution is great. Images are memorable. Acting solid enough. Some theatricals, but are still rich enough to compliment the vehicle in its expression.
