I liked this movie. When the guy who was in an overnight bank of $ 40 million in the death of gold, his cell cell was used as "Bait" to lead them to the high tech partner of crazy killer (no surveillance device implanted in his jaw without blood they do not know him). It's an action, movie type spy and enough funny scene to keep it light. He reminds me of the state's enemies. Well and good enough to draw.
