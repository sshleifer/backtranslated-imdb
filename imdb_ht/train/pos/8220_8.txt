The fourth in the series "Harry Hall", this film features one of the most despicable, ugliest, incredible, unpleasant, disgusting women I've ever seen on film: "Ray Perkins," played by Audrie Neenan. It is modern nasty low-life version of the character's "1945 Destor" 1945, "Ann Savage." <br /> Her bad brain and mood moods turn me so much I never looked this movie again until I had acquired a profundity filter that closed her ... and younger few of her! Then I could enjoy the rest of the movie. <br /> <br /> Everywhere "Harry Callahan" (Clint Eastwood) goes, violence immediately follows ..... in minutes! This often happens in almost unreasonable but it does for a fast-moving movie, fun and a complete finish as all the Scumbag villains eliminate one-by-one. This is a very sophomoric movie that appeals to our base instinct ..... and connects, sad to say. Most of us like to see these dirtballs get to the end and make it much better than Harry's room?
