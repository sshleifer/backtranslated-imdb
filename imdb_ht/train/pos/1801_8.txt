I saw this movie when it was originally released in 1989. I enjoyed it then, and I still do now. But what I realize now is that this is quite "adult" for a movie with a G rating, especially the notion of death and going to heaven. Burt Reynolds and Dom DeLuise work closely together, with Reynolds' singing voice suitable for a junkyard dog. Some good songs come from optimism ("Let's Make Music Together") in outright emotional ("Home in My Heart"). I found the plot good, although it goes on a tangent once or twice. The final scene of the movie with Charlie and Anne-Marie is one of the infamous I've ever seen in anime. A movie worth experiencing.
