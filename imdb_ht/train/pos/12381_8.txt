A young woman who is a successful model, and is also engaged to be married, and was twice attempt suicide in the past, is chosen by a secret association and far from Catholic priests to be the next "sentinel" at the gate in hell, apparently attending an old climbing, but well-preserved Brooklyn apartment apartment. Its tenants take the stairs up and can reincarnate themselves, but apparently can not escape as long as a sentinel has to block the road. One before (John Carradine) is about to die, so it's not fate or whatever, gets the next one, and the drive must get it to kill himself in order for them to be free. Many interesting details lie down under the surface, his relationship with his father, the stories of the finish, his fiance, so one can pass this off as cheap exploitation horror, but given the sets thrown in great , with the overall level of bizarreness, this is definitely worth seeing.
