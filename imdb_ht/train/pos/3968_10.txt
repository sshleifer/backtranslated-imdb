The first time I saw this movie as a boy and recently bought it on DVD. James Stewart brings high emphasis to the role of Hardesty Chip, an FBI hardworking and dedicated worker. His life in the Office is interrupted with his family life, which is not all rosy. His wife (an excellent painted by Vera Miles) is living in fear of the dangerous nature of his work, and they are even separated for a while; Chip's best friend and fellow agent Sam Crandall (Murray Hamilton) killed in a gunfight; Son, Chip, Mike, influenced by the Marines during the Second World War. Through it all, the family carries with courage and dignity. The action sections are quite interesting and the semi-documentary style of the film works effectively. And the music by Max Steiner says it all; Fidelity, courage and integrity. This country must be a great debtor for both men and women in the FBI, and yes to J. Edgar Hoover. If Mr Hoover was alerted, we could have killed 9/11, the wave of crime against children and many of the politicians we've had to set up and since it happened.
