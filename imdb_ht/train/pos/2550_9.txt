This is truly one of the "Golden Age" in Hollywood, the type is not done yet. It's a unique, fun movie that keeps you guessing what will happen next. <br /> <br /> All actors are perfectly cast and they are all great actors supported. This is the first movie I've seen with Ronald Colman in it and I've been a fan of all the time since. Reginald Gardiner has always been a favorite actor supporting me and adding a certain quality to each movie she is in. While playing a different kind of character here, she always adds something to the movie that another actor Dispose of this character would not have added.
