Right from the beginning you see that "Anchors Aweigh" is a great comedy. Gene Kelly and Frank Sinatra make such a funny team! The singing songs together are more entertainment. Kathryn Grayson is gorgeous and really sweet. Dean Stockwell is the cutiest child actor I never saw. If you are fond of piano, you will be amazed by Jos√© Iturbi. This movie was the first one to combine animation with real actors and he did so beautifully in an unforgettable dance count. Undoubtedly one of Kelly's movies.
