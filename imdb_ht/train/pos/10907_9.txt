Flipping around the TV and HBO has shown a double whammy of horrendous medical condition, so I turned to my twin sister and said, "Hey looks fun," - Surely I like documentary - so , we started to look at it. At first I thought Jonni Kennedy was a young man, but then he explained that due to his condition, he never went to growth, so the high voice and lower body. He was on a fundraising crusade for his cause. It has the most beautiful sense of humor combined with a wonderful sense of spirituality ... I shouted, watched some more, laughed, got up to get another Kleenex, then called a few more. Once John Kennedy was "time up" he was flying in the sky to be with the angels. It was more than ready; He learned his lesson from this life and was free. I highly recommend this. If you do not fall in love with this guy, you have no heart.
