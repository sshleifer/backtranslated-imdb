The film is the split side from the start, Eddie just seems to bring the uniqueness of the stage and make the most basic thing from having a creamy ice cream as a child of the old tradition of the family get together. The movie is very rare in this country, but it was certain of the availability of other countries I've searched through a lot of web sites and it still does not have a luck, phone calls that search for rare videos and waiting lists list for it. So they are very happy. If someone likes Eddie Murphy as a comedy and sees in the video to get it, it's worth the money and can not go far wrong.
