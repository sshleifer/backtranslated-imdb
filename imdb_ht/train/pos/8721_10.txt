Disney (and folks in the course PIXAR) offer a wonderful, human story combined with the best of computer animation. I admit that maybe 'faces' of bugs were a little more static than in 'Antz' and they only had four feet (in 'Antz' six ...). But the origin was superb and animated was breathtaking. But let this be a lesson: it was not the computer that made it such a success: it was the man behind the car, which added the cute little twists, which I missed in 'Antz'. Some browsers were 'blown away' by the end (so keep watching at the end, it's worth it!), Which was very fun and original. It was 'entirely filmed aside' designed for the more attentive viewer.
