Object is not the greatest television show in history, but it's not far off. It does not have the plot or characterization of the West Wing or possibly even Early Earlier, however, it is arguably the show continuously holding outrageous I have all come across. I love the way I can not guess what will happen. I love re-telling in the characters' back stories that often give rise to new dimensions to see them in. In some ways I want to show up at last forever, but I think they can get 6-7 seasons from it before they are required end it on a great power. The combination of characters and nationalities coupled with the fluidity of the show for moving backwards and forwards so extended dead "life spell" characters add to the overwhelming sense that this show is something very different from what we are used to . It's fascinating, surprising and (here's a little suggestion for all of your scholarly scheme) more than a little interactive- keeping these web-based discussions will only be added to the scheme.
