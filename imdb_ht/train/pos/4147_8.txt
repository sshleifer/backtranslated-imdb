I do not think this movie is for everyone. But I saw it this weekend in Seattle and I thought it was so funny. I have not been laughing so hard during a long film. I thought to throw at all did a great job. You will find yourself laughing at the first moment in the last few scenes. I suspect some movies (especially those who persuade WAY too badly) will be turned off by this mark of humor. Not me. The movie was a real surprise. And the whole theater was rolling and laughing at all the show I went through that made me think a lot of people loved themselves and were happy to have a good time in the movies for a change. I can not wait to see him again! If you are in the LOL attitude then this is for you. Funny Funny Funny Funny!
