Shannon Lee, daughter of Bruce Lee, delivers great martial arts action on the beads of this film to Hong Kong film and proves that as Brandon is late it is a real chip of the old block. There are great stuntwork techies for this fast paced flick and the musicians in the Bond movies would give it a look if they want to spice up quotes in action in the next 007 adventure as there are so many innovative things here with some cool and original The second unit works to reinforce the content already great action in "AND NOW, You're Dead". When you look at such a rhythmic and entertaining movie like this you start wondering how movies itself could survive before the martial art genre has been created. I really believe that the overall cinemas and movies in particular have been just marking until the first Koun Fu movies made their first. Bruce Lee has been the father of modern action movies and her surviving surviving children Shannon by leaving the family name down here. Although there are several fun performances in this movie (Michel Wong for one) she is Shannon Lee whom you will remember a truly spectacular performance as Mandy Superman of Hitgirl.Hell; you can far beat his battlefield!
