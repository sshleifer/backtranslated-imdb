I watched this movie many years ago and was searched for it ever since my opinion although very raw it is very educative as what in the future can keep i enjoyed the movie and this day rates It's very much sorry to give everyone who agrees but a movie should always judge each having owned and in my great opinion it's giving it a go with the baby's cloning tubes and tests that are happening today that we deem this movie This may be a dramatized event in what they are getting but there you go. All the horrors of today are so far sought even I laugh but this one gets me thinking and she scared me like a mom that if I was desperate, after watching this movie i would think of times sorry but I like the movie to make your own mind up by watching the movie to do - just accomplish the story and ask yourself this how far would you go for a child?
