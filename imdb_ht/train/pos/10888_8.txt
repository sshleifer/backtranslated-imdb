This is one of these little movies for everyone. Our scrooge is Ben Affleck, who decides that money is not enough, so it's family rent rents where he thought his family was doing. OK? This is a great high school soap pg-13, but the small sex references are comedy, so if your kid can not handle them, they can not live in the real world, either. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />! . But it's OK, because even this old Oracle keeps hoping that if Ben is well proportional to all over, well, there's hope for our lady again. Luckily, the rest of the ensemble - Catharine O'Hara, James Gandolfini, Christina Applegate, Udo Kier and Josh Zuckerman - fill in and keep this shady-side-Ozzie-and-Harriet Christmas alternate hilarious, comfortable and warm. <br /> This movie is the type you can jump up and get popcorn, and when you get back, everyone wants to back it up to show you what you miss. Happy movie, after all, and leaves you feeling good about life, love, family, Christmas and Chanel. There is really something for everyone.
