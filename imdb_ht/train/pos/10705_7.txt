The trailer for this movie did not make the movie justice. And while the movie did not know what it really wanted to get through, the first half of the movie was a light, romance comedy and the second has a more serious, romantic drama, overall impact was better than I was think it would be. This movie was more of a movie date, but the trailer made it to more of a thrilling suspense that it never really turned out. Kidman, being one of my favorites, of course I'm partial, but this movie proves to be a light, sensitive, if a bit original movie deserves better. Three out of four stars. 9/5/02.
