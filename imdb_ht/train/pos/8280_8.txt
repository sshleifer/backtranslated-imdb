George and Kim are traveling with their young Miles in a remote cabin in downstate New York when the cars hit a deer and swerves in a hole. But what seems to be an incident of misconceptions marked at the beginning of a trip Difficulty, where myths become reality with a meat of meat, half animals and half Wendigo, making a small town ... "Wendigo" by Larry Fessenden is a thought-provoking horror movie that is often broadcast in a dramatic family drama. It's great, the characters are well developed and there are some chilly bones. The subtle spirits of Wendigo are busy and never clear what real and imagine, or even if the story is taking place entirely in the head of Miles.Overall, "Wendigo" is my first contact with Larry Fessenden and his work will not be the last. Where this movie is a chance, if you do not mind watching something original.8 out of 10.
