Since Siskel had died and Ebert's absence had been shown to have remained in the hands of Richard Roeper. Roeper is not a movie critic he just criticizes anything he does not like personally film and country music to hang because "I do not like country music!" and children's movies find a standard "do not see it now, wait until it comes out on DVD and rent it for your kids!" Roeper can be quite an idiot soap, but in some other fields. Guests' weekly 'sit-in' for Ebert fare better, but who wants to pick a Daisy in the middle of a cow? All that has been said, it shows only in town and that alone makes it worth watching. As for Roger Ebert, if Stephen Hawking can talk, so you can! It's your idea and think you time for. Do everything you need to get that surgeon on his throne declared.
