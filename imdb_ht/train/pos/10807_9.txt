I just saw this movie, and fell in love with it. There is a bit of something for everyone, and its a free particular for all when it comes to the romance between Lachlan and Lil. When they are on the beach, I was almost called ... the unspoken realization this time is the most precious commodity and most obvious when they are together. This idea takes in several angles, from marriage to sibblings to get the conventional love of love in places. The film almost makes you long for that kind of despair when you know that tomorrow can very well be your last. Crowe was particularly beautiful in his role in Lachlan. I always had a soft spot for the accent, but I almost melted and painted him in his character. This movie was also shot beautiful, with the music, the series of open and superb gardens. All along, this is a wonderful movie that tug in all human emotions.
