This is the kind of movie for a Sunday afternoon as the rest of the world can go ahead with its own business as you go down to a large arm-chair and gentle for a couple of hours. Wonderful performances from Cher and Nicolas Cage (as always) slowly fix the plot together. There is no touching cross, there is no dangerous water, just a warm and witty paddle in New York's life at its best. A family movie in every sense and one that deserves the praise it receives.
