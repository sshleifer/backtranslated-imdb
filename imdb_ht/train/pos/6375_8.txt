While I have a great respect for Disney's animated film, as in the end have not really been what I would call "must-see". Atlantis looked intriguing from the first movie poster and trailer, and fortunately lived up to my expectations. Atlantis is a more "mature" Disney movie in the sense that it lacks songs (a very unusual movie for a real movie Disney), and focuses more on action and discovery than any other recent Disney offerings. The world of Atlantis, hidden under the earth's core, is fantastic, featuring as deep deserts and ruins, and then slowly developing into current ecosystems, which, while usually with some recap of harshness, more and more intriguing until the tropical paradise itself is over. Presenting simply Atlantis' landscape and environment, without some exuberant songs, gave the kingdom a more beautiful and intriguing appearance. The inclusion of an Atlantean language, as well as attempting to connect it to the mythology of ancient life civilization, adds to this, and works fairly well. Also, with the exception of some scenes involving the practice joke mol, there has not seemed to be a lot of a "element" element that I usually associate with Disney films. Instead, the main elements were fighting for Atlantis, with the constant discovery of Atlantis, as Milo outsider was able to learn all he needed to know about where he did not help the Atlanteans discover parts of their own stories that they did not know about. Part of this involves the Atlantean "weapon", which is used in a major action-packed that is, for lack of a better, quite interesting word. It is not all in the story to make full sense, and the film does not present any amazing new computer-generated visual effects, but, aside from movie theater games, this is the most fun movie Disney I saw in those years.
