This is one of the best Fred Astaire-Ginger Rogers films, or at least one of my favorites. Most A-R movies feature great dancing but romantic romance stories. This still has the custom corniness, but not as pronounced as the other films. <br /> <br /> This movie features not only great dance but characterable characters and a bunch of good songs. The music is the central theme here and what is good is the addition of a solo typed by Rogers. She was not only a super dancer but a very beautiful woman with one tremendous figure. He also dances with Fred, of course, and is always a pleasure to look at the dance floor. <br /> <br /> Growing in the 1950s is watching "Ozzie & Harriet" on TV, it was a real kick first time I saw this to be seen as a young Harriet Hilliard. No surprise than Ozzie falls for this beauty. Although she had that early 30's hairstyle, I recognized her voice right away. Also in this film are quick appearances by Betty Grable and Lucille Ball, but I must admit that I have yet out ball. I can not find it, but I know it's here. <br /> <br /> Astaire, except for some cop-gum mopeds in the first part of the movie, were fun to watch with Randolph Scott - although the best of Westerns - is likable, too. This is simply a nice, feel-good movie and a good if you want to enjoy the great talent in Astaire and Rogers.
