This amazing-looking movie and everything is done in just six or seven colors. When it came out about 15 years ago, he stunned men with his color scheme, they were so different from anything else that had ever been put on film. Those colors, for me at least, make this an absolutely fascinating movie to watch. There are literally thousands of scenes I wish could freeze and somehow convert them to a painting they studied for their artwork. The characters and the story do not match up to the greatness of the photography, but they are all over-the-top, especially bandits. The famous actors who played here must have a lot of fun on the play "Flatop," "Pruneface," "Mouth," "Mumbles," etc. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Warren Beatty and Gleanne Hedley are good as Dick Tracey and Tessehart Tessehart girlfriend, and it's as sweet and soft as her name. Another good addition is Charlie Korsmo as the boy's offenders and Tess get under their wings. Other colorful characters are played by Al Pacino, Dustin Hoffman, William Forysthe, Paul Sorvino, Mandy Patinkin, Madona and other names you know, but are too numerous to list here. Check out the full credits on the main page and you will be surprised. The only negative I found was Pacino's voice that scratched you after some time, Madonna's off-key song and the fact that the movie would have been best trampled over 10 minutes. Those "faults" are all miners because in general, this is a fun movie .... a cartoon cartoon comes to life in an incredibly-colorful mode ... like nothing you have never see.
