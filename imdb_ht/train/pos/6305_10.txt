Welcome to Collinwood is one of the most delightful films I have ever seen. A superb cast cast, tight correction and wonderful direction. A movie that does not get bogged down to the standard tricks. <br /> <br /> Not much can be said about this movie without damaging it. Tag tag says it all - 5 guys. 1 safe. No brain. William H Macy and Sam Rockwell lead an amazing cast. George Clooney should be congratulated for this product. <br /> <br />
