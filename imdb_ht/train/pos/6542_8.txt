Although well past the target audience, I still had a soft spot for YA Fiction, so I was naturally intrigued by returning to the Nancy Drew screen. <br /> This is not a bad movie. The central mystery is involving an actress who has long been featured in simple simple terms and shooter in danger for the young sleuth. Nancy and his friends never took the threats seriously, so members of the young audience would not be upset. <br /> What I really appreciated in the story was the final results were rather serious and meaningful and Nancy seemed to understand and grow out of the experience. Emma Roberts is great as Nancy Drew and hopefully we'll see her again in another mystery.
