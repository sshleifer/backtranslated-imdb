This movie has everything. Emotion, power, affection, Stephane Rideau's adorable dance naked beaches ... It exposes the need for real interior communion and external communication in any relationship. Just because Cedric and Mathieu are a couple who happen to be gay does not mean there is not quite helpful insight for anybody in it. I would probably classify it as a gay movie, but one that can be appreciated and loved by heterosexual individuals as well as homosexual and bisexual people. Mathieu's inequality cares about his emotions to divulge the way our society does not urge us to act any different, and that's what disconcerties are between him and Cedric. This is definitely a must-see !!!!
