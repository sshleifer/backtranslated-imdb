Carol, the girl in the center of the story, is transplanted in a foreign country, Spain, at the height of Civil War conflict in the late 30s. For this girl, everything is new, in it's alien. The war with his father is his constant concern, while he has immersed himself in a provincial culture that is years behind what he has in New York. <br /> <br /> Imanol Uribe directed this movie by numbers. Carol's family is obviously divided, while the mother Carol married a person who is an air force pilot and the faction left, the rest of the family's sympathy with the Franco and the fascists who had the conflict. The story adds nothing to what has already been said, better, but it's an easy movie to watch. Spain's beautiful scenery is shown. Do not expect a lot of action since most of that happen to revolve around Carol and the young boys he befriends. Clara Lago plays Carol with sincerity and innocence. Maria Barranco is Carol Aurora mother, one who went to America. Rosa Maria Sarda is Maruja, the teacher who befriends Carol. Carmelo Gomez, playing Alfonso, the Aurora man left behind when he left for America. This actor, who usually has lead roles in most Spanish films, has nothing to do, as he remains an enigmatic of the movie.
