I love playing football and I thought this movie was great because it contained a lot of football in it. This was a good Hollywood / Bollywood movie and I was glad it won 17 awards. Parminder Nagra and Kiera Knightley were good and that was Archie Punjabi. Jonathon Rheyes Meyers was great at playing the coach. Jazz (Parminder Nagra) loves to play football but her parents want it to learn how to cook a desire to get married. When Jazz starts playing for a soccer team he meets Juliet (Kiera Knightlety) and Joe (Jonathon Rhyes Meyers) who is his coach. When his parents get hit hit but his father allows him to play the big match on her sister Pinky (Archie Punjabi) wedding. At the end of the parents realize how much he loves football and let it go abroad to play.
