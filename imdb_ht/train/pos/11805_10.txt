Fragglerock is excellent in the way Schindler's list was excellent. A Great Look for Kids and Adults of All Sex. Narrows can be seen as used in the direction of fake symbols, in the same way that H.R. Puff N Stuff was hinted towards marijuana smoking. Your kids will love this movie. I loved it as a child. My father showed me this movie as a child. He enjoyed it as well and pointed out that the exaggerated noses were phallic symbols. Although at this time I had no signs of that. The movie is comedy and adventure. The scenario is wacky and cheerful. I and you will enjoy this together.
