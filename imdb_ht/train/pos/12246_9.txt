The minute I started watching this I realized that I was watching a quality production so I was not surprised to find out that the scenario was written by Andrew Davis and was produced by Sue Birtwhistle both of what made us excellent 1995 production of pride and prejudice! So my only monument here is that Emma did not run in 3 or 4 or maybe even six episodes such as pride and prejudice. The act was superb and I think Prunella's excellent balance as Miss Bates but I loved Kate Beckinsale and Mark Strong as much. The language is a pleasure to listen, can you imagine that day and age with a right to go to someone without actually uttering an oath? Samantha Morton was excellent as Miss Smith in fact the casting was spot on as much as she was proud of and prejudiced. I loved it so much that I watched it twice in two days !! So, once again thank you BBC for another quality TV piece. I saw the Paltrow version and it's okay but I think the BBC version is far superior. An excellent output that I am very pleased to own on DVD !!!
