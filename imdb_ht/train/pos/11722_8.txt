To be honest I watch this movie only because they need my pubert. I mean, I was not able to find women at my age (I was 9 or 10) so I thought watching Elvira's fence was the sex closet thing. <br /> I ended up having a great time with this classic cult of horror comedy, Halloween party, sassy humor, and some of the bad things that Elvira appeared. <br /> They just do not make movies like this anymore ... It had the feeling of an amateur effort mixed with a late night couch show host style. <br /> <br /> The truth is that it produces many fans because of its humor and the ability to do by Cassandra. <br /> <br /> This is classic that reminds me of the good days in USA all night.
