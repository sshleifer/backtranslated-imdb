This is a good movie feel, about one person's dreams and the drive or pushing to achieve them. It's a beautiful movie and inspiration. Why have some people tried and found fault with each film that came out, especially those good. Dennis Quaid provides a solid performance in this true story of Jim Morris, a science teacher and school baseball coach who is pushed by his team to take one more shot into a professional baseball career. With excellent support throw, including Brian Cox, as old crusty senior officer who left much of his son's achievements away without his support. It was good to see her as something other than a villain in a movie. If I have one complaint with this movie, this is: Never let Royce Applegate sign national national again. <br /> Seriously, this movie belongs to the handful of baseball films such as "Field of Dreams" and "The Natural." It's rate of thumb and a big "well done."
