Cuban is one of the movies that has many things to say about life in a very traditional way. I'm currently watching it while surfing around Cuba on a Western Caribbean cruise. It details the life of a 11 year old boy in a small town in Cuba in 1958 and 1959 during the revolution. There is not much time left on the revolution until the very end, when the social regime came and took the property of the boy's father. The majority of the movie is the boy coming to age and the relationships that come in a small town where everyone knows everyone else. There are some powerful scenes that everyone can relate to. A Class A movie with good action and leadership. This is a film that tells a story that has no special effects or grand or real torsion. It's a movie about people and their lives, their mistakes, and their triumphs. A good movie worth seeing several times a year.
