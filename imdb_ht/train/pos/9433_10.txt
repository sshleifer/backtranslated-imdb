Impact films of four city slickers in crisis in Appalachia have become synonymous with rural corruption. Each of four businessmen faces deeper fears when they attack a charging trip, on a river over to be replaced by a dam. When the locals decide to "make their way" and the interlocutors it leads to several deaths and loads of trauma for the survivors. Each of the travelers is exceptional, although Voight gives performance to lead and stronger. The rural landscape and culture are well captured, including the breathtaking banjos sequence. I've seen this on a date when it comes out, not exactly the perfect date movie (although we both loved it). I sort of remember this as a dramatic-out performance for Burt, Voight has already been established. By the movie you can watch every week, but it has a strong punch and it is very well filmed.
