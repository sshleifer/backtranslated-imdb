I had the pleasure to watch the short movie "Cure", not the first time director Ryan Jafri. What really impressed me is the camera and music work. <br /> I think so many young filmmakers (as I am one of them) would experience hard time and cinematography when just starting to do in an indie. We see the output by exactly what we are outlining or below our ambitions. But this movie, first directors from a young director, handle very well on screen. The camera's motion, color, lighting, composition all contributed to the story and emotions of the movie. <br /> <br /> And music, as a key element in films, helps a great deal too. <br /> <It's hard to show the heart of a woman, her desire, her fear, especially in a short time. But still, I must admit to myself by a v / o fan (narration), especially when the movie moves forward by narration, instead of shots and cuts. My personal feeling of some of the narrative part is, I guess the narrator has tried a bit too hard. So the energy pushed audiences back from the emotion of the movie. <br /> <br /> In general, it's a nicely short film to make, I could see the opinion from a director. Ways to go, Ryan! Hello from China, looking forward to your next. <br /> <br /> Tim
