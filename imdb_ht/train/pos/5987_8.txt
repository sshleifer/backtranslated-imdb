Gabe Ryan (Frankie Thomas) gets out of school reform and goes back to the slums. Her sister (Ann Sheridan) does it best to keep her out of trouble, but she just seems to follow her. Aside from its association with the Termite gang, Gabe is followed by real life gangsters who have a plot to fire in random buildings to collect the insurance. They need someone to blame for the fire, and Gabe is it. It is up to the termites to work the law in favor of them and give their ginger dessert gang. The scene that introduces dead dying children is really good. The boys wander on the new furniture on the street, and continue to make it their own. They talk to each other in chic shower accent and talk about being drunk together; Bernard Punsley takes a nap in a chair. The boys then proceed to starting a fight with the new boy, but after he proved himself a good fighter, they asked him to join the clubs. The initiation scene is also good, full of evil that looks harmful at first, but it's really rather smart and innocent. <br /> <br /> And when Billy Halop studies become the mayor of the boy, she has a dream about school work. This is beautiful scene, with small holograms of kids walking on his face and shooting questions of him. <br /> <br /> Angels washing faces are a great title because it plays in the success of Angels With dirty face, and really tells what the kids are doing. Notorious for bad behavior over and over the series, these boys are beautiful in this movie. But rather than looks flat, it makes for some big laughs. This is a preview of what many of the boys would become in the series Bowery Boys. We even get a few words out of Leo Gorcey.
