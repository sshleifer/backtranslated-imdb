There is not a whole lot going on in this story - just two men hired very different ways to handle memories of Vietnam. But what it lacks in citing, it's more than make up for acting and realism. It's a quiet movie about the bonds of friendship and sharing experiences. We even get romance (not free - just another very real piece in this story). It is well worth seeing.
