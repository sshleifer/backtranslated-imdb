The woman in Black is fantastic in every aspect. It's awesome, thrilling and so realistic that you can actually see it happens in real life. The first time I saw it on the TV back in 1989, and all the lights off and the volume was back, it was probably the most creepy experience in my life. I managed to get caught in a copy, and now I'm sure you bring it out every Halloween and show it too unsuspecting family members, who have no idea what they're in for, and all I can do is laugh and glee. As for the movie: <br /> It starts out with a young lawyer named Arthur Kipps, who is assigned by her firm to go to the market town of Crythin Gifford to resolve the papers of a recently deceased client - Mrs Alice Drablow. <br /> <br /> This movie starts off as a reasonable and exciting ghost story. But then Arthur goes to the funeral, and at that stage, we do not feel safe. We're always on the corner and biting our nails and going on for the next hour or so, until the final final, thrilling. A warning to all new viewers though: do not look this alone. .. ..
