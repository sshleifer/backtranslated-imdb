I liked this movie. Was not a swooning Ed Wood Jr fan, I prefer to appreciate his "unlimited enthusiasm" and acknowledge his shortcomings. Her films are fun, but her personal story is one of prey and pain. I was hoping, and was happy to find that, this movie would be about understanding his agitated life, rather than simply his growth and posthumous praise. From the start of the end, this film evolves from a documentary in a mythology, leaving the cast and the viewer unexpectedly interconnected with Ed Wood Jr. <br /> <br /> What we find are those who knew Ed Wood better talk about it from all positive, negative and negative perspectives, and show us the characters as much as the Ed. We get the insight into Ed's personal life and profession: from its romance, drinking it, in its sexuality, of his friends, his enemies, and even his films. <br /> The film itself is shot in a low-budget manner that looks like out of respect for Ed, as if using the techniques of most teemally released films from 1996 should respect (sort of like wearing a costumes prettier than the President). The designer puts a sense of humor and also a great deal of insight when matching each member thaws with their background. <br /> <br /> Fans will be excited to hear personal testimony about Ed Wood, and new corners will be surprised that this man was real. The DVD is all impossible to find Wonderland ("Crossroads of Lorado" and photo galleries), but the real treasure of this movie is the amazing story of engaging and connecting. <br /> <br /> Ed Wood has a habit of defining people in association with her (for better or worse), to the point where a woman is going down in history as "Pool Owners" for once left He and his friends are baptized in his pool. This ability defines a person's legacy of coming universal, as the most amazing effect of the film is not just to give a well rounded idea to the man Ed Ed Jr., but also to provide a comprehensive view of the community it creates. Somehow, without ever having one cast member being interviewed on screen at a time, the connection that Ed Wood creates among the various people in his life becomes clear, and the viewer leaves with great sense of participation. <br /> <The same title hints at the genre B-list genre genre, but in the end, we see that this is a good thing. What begins as story related by random people ends with the conclusion that all the cast will be forever weaved in an unpredictable fabric that will history bring to the haunting and legendary unity of the Wood. <br /> <br /> In many ways a living contradiction, Ed Wood Jr. could not be condensed in a single opinion. This collaborative effort is closer to knowing that we can ever find. Being yourself a juxtaposed in terms, it is at once respective, provocative, thoughtful, attractive, fun, sad, kind, and filling.
