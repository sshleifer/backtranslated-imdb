And actors like Ralph Richardson, Raymond Massey, Cedrick Hardwicke, and Margaretta Scott, how can you go wrong. Very unusual scenics, especially those modern. The actualization of the modern machine is very effective. Here you have rail-gun blast from building cars that help clear the area, so new structures can be done. Although it's much smaller in this movie, It's not very difficult to figure out what Madam Pumphrey's future comes from the BBC series, All Great and Little Creatures are going to be! Really effective "comeback" at both Raymond Massey and Ralph Richardson. The music note is not the renowned Swiss composer, Artur Honegger and is also unusual. For the time (1936) it seems to have been used really, great sets or effects to make it seem that way. Lastly, it's a really good story.
