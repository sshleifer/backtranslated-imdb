FLAVIA ESSEC is an unusual entity in the genre of nunsploit - equal parts, sleazy, feminist trips, and "stories" as we follow Flavia on her unusual journey. <br /> We start off with Flavia in a convent .. It's not too happy because he does not believe in all the male "rules" dominate and macho-ism in the world around him and escapes from the convent and his Jew, Abraham. They both eventually took them and Flavia were brought back to the convent where he entered another "who does not believe" a man in a hurry to a Muslim invasion. Flavia hangs out with the Muslims who take over the convent and get "busy" with the nuns in a strange set of scenes. Eventually the Muslims roll-out and Flavia are punished as a traitor for Christianity in an individual brutal scene ... <br /> This one has pretty much the whole thing that I love to see in the era of 70's erupted - some good gore, including nip-off, with a beautiful foot-scrolling scene, some decent nudity - including the full-air avalanche, and a decent storyline as well. I'll say he sorta drag to a few points, but not enough to get really bored with it. I would definitely recommend this one to nunsploit / 70's fans exploited ... 8/10
