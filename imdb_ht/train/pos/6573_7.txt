The movie boasts the feeling of a play right from the start - I think it would make a better play than a movie because the series and dramatization make a movie version seem somewhat too artificial. But still, it carried out fairly well, with the story & especially the interesting dialogue. The dialogue was very nice exactly as it came from the current play. Maybe it's a good introduction to Shaw's play. The main character Raina has himself in the clouds and a flair for the dramatic, and Helena Bonham Carter's act has done a great job here. Her fianc√©, serge, is a bit too cartoonish when it is really supposed to be a very cute face superbly. Her parents are amusing enough.
