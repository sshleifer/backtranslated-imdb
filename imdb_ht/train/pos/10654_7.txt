Haunting is a movie that boasts a really crazy house, good work and sound work, a cast that seems to believe everything around them is real with this house. There are scenes that make you jump, and the disaster aspects of what went to Hill House in the past, I found interesting. There are really creepy moments in the movie and I loved the way the ghosts manifest themselves in the blanket, curtains and the house itself. Jerry Goldsmith's score gave him the right atmosphere and the sound design had to blow up around you. What I would like to happen is for something a little more intense. John Bont had a rating PG-13 to beg and I think he kept a little too much. Poltergeist scared me funny when I saw her many years ago, and she still keeps up. The haunt could have used a few more puppet scenes. The finish was for me, a little antiviral. In general, I loved it. Acting is good and there are times when you jump. I just wish it scared me more.
