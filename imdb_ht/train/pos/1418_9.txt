I almost did not go to see this movie because I remember the march in the penguin was not the most interesting. I went mostly because Disney promised to plant a tree if I went to see it on the opening weekend, but after I went to see it, it was simply amazing; The fact that photographers can take their image impossible are simply worth your money. You also get to see different habitats, different vegetation, animals, and natural phenomena that will not only shock you - simply because you would never expect nature to be so magical and dynamic - but also touching your soul and raising the question of humanity against world, in how our lives have deviated from the nature as a degree that we take for granted in the natural beauty and miracles of excellence in our biosphere. You do not have to have a lover on earth or a tree-hugging environment to appreciate the awesomeness of this documentary. You simply have to be a curious soul that questions the value and the miracle of living. Enjoy!
