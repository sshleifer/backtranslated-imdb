The only reason I give this movie to 8/10 stars, and not 10 is because 1) Sinatra is terrible and 2) the love interest of Kelly's character leaves much to be desired, (IMHO). Do you like Dean Stockwell, Quantum Leap - Al, is the little boy. The dance sequence and Jerry Mouse is one of the most fun and amazing dance sequences I've ever seen. Tom and Jerry are always a personal favorite of me and my daughter. I'm 28 and it's 4, so while the character is less iconic than Mickey, he is still a favorite of many children and adults today. Kelly is as always fascinating, her eyes full of fun and excitement. In each movie I've ever seen it in, it's still stealing the show. One of the best dancers in the 20th century. It is not surprising Paula Abdul "samples" move Kelly. I would also list Gene Kelly as one of the most beautiful people in the 20th century. If you've watched only one party, do not miss Kelly's dance with Jerry mouse. You will not be disappointed.
