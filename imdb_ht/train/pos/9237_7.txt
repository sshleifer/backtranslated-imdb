This movie is very good. Half a year ago, I bought it on DVD. But before I thought it was the original movie. I saw the series and it is a good movie, but here, put "the legendary living, part1 and 2", and "fire in space" together. Just as they did with the movie first, but with other episodes. But still, it is a very good movie. Only the finish is strange (you do not see what's happening with the Pegasus). But I still think it is very good. The actors and their special effects were good. If you have not seen it, go see it. Start: Richard Hatch, Dirk Benedict, Lorne Greene, Herb. Jefferson Jr, Tony Swartz, Terry Carter, Lloyd Pon, Jack Stauffer.
