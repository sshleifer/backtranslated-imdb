He takes the patience to find in David Lynch's unique, but - for a change - life that affirms the chronicle of Alvin's right, but stick with it. Even though it moves as slowly as Deuter Straight, when it meets foreigners along its Pilgrimage we learn a lot about isolation from aging, the painful and secret regrets, and finally the power of family and reconciliation. Richard Farnsworth flipped his career with the most authentic year's performance, sad and poetic, flinty and caring. With Sissy Spacek matches him as he "slows down" Rose's daughter who pears on his own private loss while taking care of Dad. Rarely has a modern film so positive about the family.
