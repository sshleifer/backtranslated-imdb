Despite the lack of logic present in the scenario, Kill Shot is a very enjoyable movie. Through a casper performance Kasper Van Dien sparkly shows the emotional rift between a hard working father wealthy and miserable. Each member of the tone cast is supported by a solid performance, marked by the act of staying alive by a young man assigned to the name I can not remember. A traumatic tragic ending may be unnerve some smaller viewers, but as a Shot shot shot really delivers a blow to death.
