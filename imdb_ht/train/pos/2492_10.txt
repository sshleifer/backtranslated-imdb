This is one of the funniest shows I have ever seen. It is really worthwhile to look and I've been at points many times. I guess there is a social awareness factor that also makes it very interesting. if so were the white girls the same reaction? Maybe they would, maybe they would not? The characters know no limit (check my lyrics) and do not exclude anyone from their tight sense of fun! There are many funny designs. My favorites are Bob's one of builders. It is so funny his genius. if you like twisting black comedy then this is for you. If you like to keep her appearances probably isn't.3 not the blonde is yet another hilarious British BBC comedy show on TV! It is such a funny show and the characters unleashed on the unsuspecting public laugh at loud funny! It would be impossible to keep a right figure watching the crazy characters and their reaction to the public! This series is easy to add in the excellent comedies being produced!
