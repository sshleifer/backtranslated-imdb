At the end of this 1989-comedy classic K-9, detective Dooley [James Belushi] and her dog Jerry Lee returned to fight crime, but this time associated with another detective [Christine Tucci] and her partner, a Meanwhile, Doberman called Zues who did not get along with Jerry Lee very well. Dooley does not get along with her new partner much either. That all changes like the movie go along. The film is intense as they are a guy who really wants to kill Dooley for the way she has treated her in the past. There are some dramatic scenes related to the death of Dooley's wife who do not really seem to have with the movie's tone because the rest of the movie is sectional action, dog poop jokes, fart jokes, and jokes about dog biting bad guys in a zone certain. I know that looks like very low humor, but some of it is actually very funny. I did not see this movie for jokes, I saw it for two reasons. The first reason is because I'm a big fan of Belushi James and the second is for the sequence of actions. James Belushi is funnier than he was at K-9 and the action sequences of them are also best. It would be good to see more characters from K-9 return, but it's still a fun movie. If you're a fan of Belushi James, you'll love this movie.
