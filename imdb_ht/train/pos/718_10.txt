Rock 'n' Roll High School was one of the best movies ever to do! I think the only reason he was so scared was because of the Ramones! You could not have made the same movie and put something like the Sex Pistols, or the Clash in place of the Ramones, it just would not have been the same. Young children, Clint Howard, Vincent Van Patten, Mary Woronov, Paul Bartel, and their monsters, just added to the movie. The whole movie is on the Ramones ... especially Joey! So everyone showed Rock 'n' Roll High School if you're a big fan of real PUNK. No sissy in new crap ... but the loud, and fast type. The only type Ramones could do. R.I.P (rest of peace) Joey Ramone 1951-2001. Dee Dee Ramone 1952-2002!
