I used to love Sabrina Witch and saw each single episode. I remember when I used to sit at 6pm every night and wait to come on Nickelodeon, but when Sabrina left the high school show began to go down. The best series to be when he was friends with Valerie (I'm not sure which one is). From the next series (friends and Dreama) was still really good, but when she left high school she just did not seem right. All the main characters seemed to have left, which meant that he did not have as much of the "old shine" old, however the first set where Sabrina is in college is still relatively good and watch, however time His aunt's closet and Sabrina move in their homes are just not good. She is not a teenager anymore, therefore, the name shows is not straight and blood Hilda and Zelda and Josh show just do not seem right, especially when Sabrina is almost married to a non-Harvey. Thanks to his kindness came in within the last five minutes of the last episode to take him away. All in all I still like to watch the old episodes of Sabrina Witch's adolescent, but I think the writers have taken it too far and should leave it with Sabrina leaving high school. Because after that the show definitely loses some of it's magic
