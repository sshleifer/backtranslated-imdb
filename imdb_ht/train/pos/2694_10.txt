Guided tour of Vue had to see a number of times in order to understand the sub-cemetery it has. If you are not using movie films french, based on conversation and fighting in blood rather than on action, do not even try to watch it. You will only get bored of death, and reassure the views that French films are not for you. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Why is Martineau (Serrault) Mister Martineau instead to be unusually accused of being a murderer of children rather than telling the truth? Because of the time of the murder he had a 18-year-old girl and he has a 8-year sexual relationship. Her wife knows she is jealous of her and prefers to be executed (in 1980 in France, there was still death penalty) rather than groundbreaking single "pure and innocent" aspect of his sleep life.
