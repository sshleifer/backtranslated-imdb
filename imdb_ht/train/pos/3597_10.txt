(deflector) <br /> I have been blown away in this movie. I was renting on movielink for a bit, and decided to check out this movie. Many boxing movies seem to cover the blood. In this movie, it shows it at amatur level. Even though I wish that perhaps more attention would lead to perhaps improving her grades. The movie points out some issues dealing with sex. <br /> I was a bit concerned with the finish. But the finish was not a disappointment either. <br /> I think it was very clear by the title that he would have. What was unexpected was that the two were back together sort of in the end. <br /> <br /> Love the score for some of the scenes. Very recommended. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < 10
