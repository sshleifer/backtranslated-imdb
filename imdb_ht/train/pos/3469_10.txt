This is one of the few movies released on a "so" kind of situation that made me think. It was amazing to talk to one another, and reminisce about all the wonderful things (and not so wonderful) things that happened between them. I actually think there is a very good possibility that has occurred as the movie implies, and they actually made peace with each other. These people are good memories for every fan they hang on, and wonder what actually happens between them selfish. What an AMAZING movie was. The comics of the movie were wonderful. To think that they were together to patch the things between them in such a way is to encourage people who want to have a clear chance when the air did not get them. To see John as such a caring, wearing back character was refreshing to hear all the garbage that spoke about it.
