White fire was recommended to me not a guy who owns it on two diverse DVDs and VHS releases. He stated that he is one of the funniest and coolest budget shareholders ever made. I generally do not watch movies knowing that they will be bad, but I made an exception for this one ... and I was very happy that I did. <br /> It's full of the mouth and action (much of it amazing, graphically gor), sleaze (isolated in naked and a key character, but there's plenty of it in one scene that it gets hilarious) and devilish left dialogue, all of which add to the laugh-induced film tone. Ginty, strange stars looking at the EXTERMINATOR (and many other low budget action tactics) are fun in the lead, which gives the best performance it could be moderate. Williamson is better than usual, clearly hamming it up with Glee unparalleled (and does not come in the middle). The rest of the cast is also fun to watch, particularly the bandits, one of whom is a sadic sexpot who speaks with an accent that seems to be a mish-mach of Spanish and Italian. It's priceless. <br /> Again, I can not stress enough how gory it was. It's not so without that it's nauseating, but it's extraordinary violent part and some meaty cribs will cut off their shootouts and have a serious tide sequence that no one will soon forget about. Also, when Ginty is swarmed by a pack of bad guys, it easily gets a hold of a chainsaw and the Splatter moments that follow will have any and all action fans cheering and reverse the beers. <br /> 'Do not miss white fire. It's a roll - if mind-numbingly stupid - classic action.
