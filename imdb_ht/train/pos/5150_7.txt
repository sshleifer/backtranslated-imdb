Though Ian Kershaw distanced himself from this project due to inaccounts in Hitler's consideration of life and yes, this is dramatized, but essential. Robert Carlyle plays Hitler during his later years, during the documentary that deals only with Hitler in childhood until he became Chancellor of Germany, including overnight at the Long Knives. This TV-movie (also a two-part mini-series) shows how a series of factors allow Hitler to come to power, e.g. The financial disaster of 1930. <br /> <br /> The series followed Hitler with little other, apart from the lives of Fritz Gerlich and Ernst Hanfstaengl. All in all, valuable and full of interesting actors, yet I feel I should have more tight controls and most cinematography; Most actors are described in the half-body shots (for me) made for a theater position, not cinemas. The storm is at times drowsy, and the film suffers from it, being about 2.5 hours long.
