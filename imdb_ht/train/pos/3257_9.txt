I've just seen this movie for the second time on television. It's nice, warm, sentimental, very very romantic. I have rarely seen actors best able to reveal by the movements and gestures of love for another Shepherd Bulletin, Ryan O'Neal, Robert Downey, Jr. and especially Mary Stuart Masterson simply by themselves. Masterson probably has the most difficult role and is just adorable. This film is in both romantic movies as you dreamed, when Harry put Sally, seamlessly in Seattle and the "high" type of movie like Big, Back in the Future, Peggy Sue was married. I hate saying this, because this cast was superb and I never changed any of them - but I think it did not succeed as well as the above mentioned films because calls to box office at the disposal were just by such as great Meg Ryan, Tom Hanks, Michael J. Fox, and Kathleen Turner at the time of the film. <br /> It does not write well - like, character lines are not particularly memorable. But it's executed in perfection. romantic love is truly palpable, the "feeling" of those who fall in love is exquisitely communicating, the love of the timelessness and all-encompassing sweep, the feeling of loss and desire to recapture that connection, thus touching salvation. Again and again, you will find yourself moving. Actually, a comparable film is made in Heaven - even romantic desires. <br /> <br /> Do you see that - it's nice.
