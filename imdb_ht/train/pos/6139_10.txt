A great movie. Lansbury and Tomlinson are perfect, the wonderful songs, dances, and a particular mention for the "Ballet Portobello" are gorgeous. As for the animated section, the match between animals became an instant classic; The bigger point and the attack of weapons are chilling and fascinating. I recommend seeing the restored 134 minutes version or at least 112 minutes of video. Here in Italy we have only version of 98 minutes, although the movie was presented in its original release in the run of 117 minutes. If possible, also see the German videocassette: it was produced in 98 minutes running, but it's missing at every look at World War II and throughout the scenes between English people and the Nazis!
