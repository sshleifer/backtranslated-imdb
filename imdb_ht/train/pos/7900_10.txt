I admit, the first time I watched the same Cowgirls Find Blues, I did not think it was very memorable in any consideration. But now, after watching it the 7th time, I admit that he has a lot of growth on me. The characters of Sissy, Ms. Jellybean, and the Countess have become very attractive. And the romance between Sissy and Jellybean looks very sweet. Even though the plot is very weak, I think the satirical humor is more than done for it. Then there's soundtrack kick-donkey that features many talent kills. Language (which reminds me a little of Patsy Cline) at her best. I can not think of any movie that has "grown on me" after a first impression, as much as Cowgirls have.
