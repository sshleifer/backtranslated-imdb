This is a strange film about an archaeologist studying the culture of ancient Indian Hohokam. He took a (really fake looking) mummy out of a burial cave and brought him home to his study. Well, very soon it starts to act out and talk to this mummy. And shortly afterwards her son became possessed by the spirit of the mummy. Even foreign events take place as the spirit then tries to destroy women's family. This is actually really jam, in general, and it will make you fall asleep first couple of times you try to watch it. But if you keep in it, you can just make it to the end. <br /> <br /> Ahah! What is the secret of the mummy? Did the mummy spirit upset that he was removed from the cave? You may not be able to realize that motivating the spirit, but if you love spooky shenanigans on a low budget (with 70 hairstyles!) This will be a comforting call. To describe the story is clearer than the jumbled, boring style movie lays the story out. Is a boring film really be fascinating? Well ... somehow this one realizes that. Perhaps this is a good movie in hand but executed in a rather awkward way. I do not know. What I know is that I enjoyed it quite a bit, despite its durness. <br /> <br /> Fans of "spider babies" will be interested knowing that a couple of music signals from that movie are being used in this one (including an instrumental version of the theme song) . <br /> Presenting a fairly well-fairly well-done sequence showing boulders and rolling stones around their heads and eventually attacking some people in a campaign. Other film scenes are simply spooky or original; but this scene is actually very scary. <br /> <br /> Look at this! It is strange and it's worth your time. You can even want one on your shelf.
