I gave it a rating of 8 stars. This story fell short of 3/4 of the way in the picture, but the performance remained strong at all "Honor Men" changed from "Marine Diver" to such an extent. Anyone who has served in any branch of the armed forces will probably feel that "Honor" is a proper word used in the title.
