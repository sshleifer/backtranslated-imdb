Be sure, 65 years have passed since the last Thalberg production was filmed. But fellow IMDB members, coming on, this movie is surely one of the leaders of the 30! It was a 10th film this was the first movie I saw in the New York Museum of Modern Art, around 1970 (I was a teenager). Expensive looking again with scenes of poverty such as, masterfully photographing, often thrilling, and always engaging, in mine it was MGM movie-made at its best. What made the audiences feel when they glimpsed an attack cricket, the person by the destruction of a castle, the terrible poverty and then the splendor of wealth. <br /> <br /> Last week, those watching the Academy Awards had a glimpse of the "Senior" Oscar winner in attendance, Luise Rainer. How grand sees an actress arguably delivering one of the most masterful performances, haunting in stories chosen to return for a celebration. Ok, so it should not win the previous year (Great Ziegfeld) but do not blame Luise. The talkies were only an old decade when it was released, and its dialogue was limited. But as Olan, his use of visual and vocal is memorable. <br /> <br /> Large scale and touching, what more could be a desired movie lover!
