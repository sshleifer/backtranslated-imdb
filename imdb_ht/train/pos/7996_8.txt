Medium-dynamic, ugly, nasty retro-action thriller, on a bodyguard who determined to get (and destroyed!), The assassins of the girl he was supposed to protect. This film is almost an anachronism of today's political atmosphere. Scott's director has no desire to apologize for immorality in the background behind the dramatic structure. Scott is either not aware or does not care for 30 years of social advances. I really do not think we'll see a more violent movie anytime soon, so you better go and see this one while you can. Despite my relentless grimness, I think the film is a powerful example of the movie's most disaster, exploitation, and efficiency. Scott has something difficult to sell, but I think I'm a buyer. The extraordinary aspects of this film technique are just too effective for me to ignore. Scott's direct choice is simply amazing, and pulls a great performance from Denzel Washington. Sensitive senses need to stay away from this one, but I recommend it to those viewers looking for a great, full-action movie.
