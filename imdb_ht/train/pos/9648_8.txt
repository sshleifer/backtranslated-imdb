I loved this movie very much. The story jumps back, they come out quite a bit and it's not easy to follow. There is no resolution in the story whatsoever, and you're leaving wonder what's really happening. Since I love this sort of movie I liked this. I especially like the "dating" scenes between the boys and I drew in their lives. And of course any movie with a nude Staphane Rideau will get a couple of extra points. ;-)
