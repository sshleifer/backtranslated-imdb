While the film feels temporary at times, it is well worth it. Gordon heads in a style that reminds you of writing Vonneguts. We are not patience, thoughtful, ironic, original, and dark, this is a movie that will stay with you for quite a while, begging to answer the impossible questions. Nolte, Goodman, and Arkin are all incredible. Sheryl Lee is wonderful as well, in a role that will remind us fans of Lynch on her Laura / Maddy day. Do not miss this one!
