I remembered this as one of my favorite books as a kid and I wanted to read it in my 5 year old daughter for a while now. I knew the movie came out so quickly we went to the library to get the book and gave us preview for the next day! We ran home and spent the afternoon reading the book so we could compare. Not needed. The only thing common to the book and the movie is the main characters' names, the fact that there is a bet, and a whole lot of worm eat. Oh yes, I almost forgot the kid who cooks most of the glass wigs to present her prince and a French accent. How do children know each other, how many children are involved, how the bet has come about, how much worms must eat, the time frames in which it has to eat the worms, how to cook, the progression of friends, Scenes, etc., NO is the same. But somehow, he did not ruin the movie for me. The characters are all enjoyable, and the movie did not let me shame. Speaking precautions for parents, there was a moment when you could hear the adults in the room collectively plotting their breath and what was when Billy's little brother referred to his penis as a "dilly dick". The nasty part came when my daughter started asking those sitting next to us, "Does anyone know what a dick dick is?" lol. That with an occasional "lock" is as bad mouth as this movie gets. My daughter thought she might get sick around worms 3 and 4 (and kept the vacant nod vessel just in case) but was fine by worm 6. She and I too two really enjoyed the movie and had a wonderful time sharing the experience.
