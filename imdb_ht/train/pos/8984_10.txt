I saw this first movie when I was flipping through the movie channels on my Parent DirecTV. He was on the Sundance Canal and was just starting. I love music, especially late 60s and this is what the BJM sounded like (the Dandys are alright). Everything about the Brian Jonestown Massacre has intrigued me in the music, Anton and Joel's personality, in the use of illegal drugs. It was funny because I watched the first party scene when everyone made the line my parents walked and decided to look (look at the face value). Anyways this is definitely one of my favorite movies because it presents me to the Brian Jonestown massacre which is now my favorite group ever. <br /> <br /> just watch it ... seriously
