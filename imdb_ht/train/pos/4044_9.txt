I found this movie to be very well rhythm. The first is quite imaginative, and as a viewer I pulled together as the characters developed. The gathering will do very well for those who like to think - enough to keep hidden from the early viewer, and keep track of what happens later, producing a well-thought-out and very satisfying movie, both cerebral and a winning action . <br /> It seems some people have been looking for a ride-roller ride-coaster ride with this movie - one of those coming out of the gate. This should be more analogy to one of these coasters that first take you slowly up the hill - creating a wonderful sense of anticipation - and is finally, in my mind, more fulfilling for the foundation initially laid. /> Excellent movie.
