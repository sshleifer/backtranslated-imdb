This one was standing for her in originality. I'm seriously tired of seeing the Hindi movie which is a poch-potl in a whole bunch of Hollywood and British film. Some flaws were inevitable, however, this movie is a must-see. Surya's presentation of the game is clean, cut, conscious (as opposed to the bone-bellied, the money-hunger that we normally see) was awesome. He has come a long way from his work at Nerukku Neren. I loved the movie so much that I owned. I'm not usually in the kind of violence in the movie idea, somehow I actually felt for each character and therefore can not really bring myself to call it 'intact violence.' I do not appreciate the melodram too much with sentimental scenes that go hand in hand with most Hindi and Tamil movies. I absolutely love this movie for her in the lack of the same. ACP Anbuselvan's reaction to releasing his wife, not too late, is heart-wrenching and making me wanting to gaze out my eyes. There are times when I watch a movie when I want to hit the FF button. Often I wanted to do this in a movie theater. Never wanted to do this when watching this movie. I really hope Ghajini is releasing soon.
