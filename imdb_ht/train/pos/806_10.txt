Star Wars: Episode 4. <br /> <br /> Star Wars Best Ever Ahead. It's the first movie ever Sean to have the bad guys and its a very good finish. he really made me wait hing for the next star war because so match things come along in this movie that you just got to get to the last one. Bliss Almost in my movies I still get the feeling that it could donder but not this one. and I will never forget the party Wader tels Luke is his father. roads too cool. Bob's likes featuring a hurry make a ground player back. If you have never seen a movie star movie you go to read this one one's best. <br /> <br /> Thanks Lucas
