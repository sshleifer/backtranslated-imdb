Scott Henderson (Alan Curtis) meets a mystery woman (Fay Helm) in a bar and invites her to see a show with her. It agrees on the requirements that they do not swap any information about each other - not the same name. Sometimes these are the best types of dates. However, when he returned to his apartment, Inspector Burgess (Thomas Gomez) and his team are waiting for him. Mrs. Scott was murdered. Alibi she is the mystery woman but no one can remember her, and, as a consequence, Scott is sentenced to death for the murder of his wife. Secretary Kansas (Ella Raines) is not convinced of his guiltyness, and sets out to find the woman who can save her from the death penalty. This is a good movie and the viewer is 100% behind attempts at Kansas to get to the truth. We follow him in some memorable scenes, for example, his pursuit of the Bar Bartender (Andrew Tomb) at night with the claustrophobic venue where the Cliff Drummer (Elisha Cook Jr) takes him to hang, drink and dance while he jams and friends l '. This is such a blatant illustration of sexual desires that it is a party stand-out of the film as everyone is leaning intensely and rhythmically for the duration of the stage. Ella Raines is good at the role of lead female and Thomas Gomez makes a polite beckon. Alan Curtis began well as the man was confused, innocent, but once he was arrested his performance took a left turn as it became quite unpleasant to Kansas for no reason. God knows why he is stuck by him. The film does not keep you guessing as to who the bandit is as we know from about half of the film, but that's no problem. In fact, it adds to the dramatic and dramatic development of the story as we will Kansas to discover what is going on and then to get the hell out! It's a good movie and some great scenes but although Elisha Cook Jr has a memorable role, I just never love it at anything that I see him in .... someone but my tie-like tie. ....
