I got a free pass to a preview of this movie last night and did not know what to expect. The first seemed unusual and I supposed it would be a lot of fun-fun-of-the-virgin maiden. What a great surprise. I laughed so hard I was shouting at some of the jokes. This movie is a must see for anyone who has an open mind and a little twisted sense of humor. OK ..... this is not a movie to go with your grandmother (Jack Palance?) Or toddler. The language is dirty, the jokes are (very) bit, and talk about sex is over as graphic as you'll find anywhere. What's amazing, however, is that the movie is always a sweet love story. My girlfriend and I both loved her. Steve Carell is terrific, but (like the desk) thrown to support really doing the movie work. All of the characters have the flaws, but they also have depth and likelihood. Everyone pulls the weights and chemistry is perfect. I can not wait to find the DVD. I'm sure it will be up and space RPG Parking with quotable lines.
