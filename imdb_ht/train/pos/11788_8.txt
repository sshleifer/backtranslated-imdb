I really think that people are taking the wrong approach to this one. First of all, I found this short-movie very fun and interesting. I just take it for what it is. I think the suspension and the ingenious mysteries of the insinuations on the overseer. Another thing that keeps my fancy was that it immediately gets the viewer involved though there is no clear story, just hints and pauses and emotions played from the characters that kind gives you the impression that there is a story of all that goes on . No other person could do that better than Lynch. This is the essence of lynchianism at its best. Sure, I will agree with anyone who begins to watch this and the desire to be entertained without any really imaginative work from the viewer's side, they will find themselves disappointed. And rightly. Lynch is not about that. At least this side of Lynch is not. The one who helped make Highway / Mulholland Dr is in full tilt here and people just expect to be entertained as they would look any other thing, they'll just not find this is all about. My opinion is that Darkened Room is all about pity and your creature-core, self-instinct, does not give us the meanings (images, sounds, situations) where you instinctively react. It's not about the pleasure of any kind, it's about to catch the desired reaction out of you. And that, my friend is most art.
