The ScareCrow was over of the funniest shooters I've ever seen in the act! Plus it really bouncy most of the time it flies around, which was awesome! Also he had an excellent voice I meant he was just perfect for him. The story line was also excellent. I love how the souls of the children were transferred to the Fresh ScareCrow! Plus she had a reason for all that kills me to say after what those people did to her ..... I should be upset too! ScareCrows watch was really good! Look at this person an "OMG!" Reactions when they see it! The big stars it was funny! These people were stupid, who would set for that long! They should look and run for their lives ... though that would not have made a difference!
