Did not see this movie 1958 in a very long time and many enjoyed Kim Novak playing the role as Gil Holroyd who is a current witch and has a aunt named Queenie Holroyd who is also a witch and Gillian also has a brother warlock named Nick played by Jack Lemmon. When Gillian stares at Shep Henderson, James Stewart is engaged in a girl he will marry; Gillian performs some magic spells and a cat and changes his mind about his intent bride, and then becomes very lustful and fall in love with Gillian. The story says that a real witch can not fall in love, blush or cry and this begins to prove a big problem between Shep and Gillian, so Nick and Aunt Queenie decided to be doing something about this situation. The big movie is seen over and over again with a classic movie from 1958.
