This amazing movie and I would recommend that kids and adults alike. The animation is beautiful, the characters are rich and interesting, and the story is fascinating; far better than anything American studios have produced at the moment. However, there are a couple of opposition. It's a shame that Disney bought the Ghibli Studio back-catalog and then proceeded to clog it. My main point was, Disney re-dubbed the movie, despite the original version of the version being very impressive. Throw in the new with Van Der Beek and go through it and it has taken much of the attractiveness of the characters, e.g. Pazu and Sheeta from teenage teen boyfriend companion. The music music notes are far better than Disney's remixes. He begs the question why Disney made these changes? It seems to me that no Van der Beek et al was cast then Disney can draw in more money, which is just enough, but in the process they attach to film. It is still a beautiful movie and I would always recommend it to anyone. My main cow is that Disney lost a movie in my childhood I loved and always loved. I'm lucky enough to have an imported Japanese imported and original English dub that I now will be guarantor to my life!
