Has anyone been able to buy this movie? My uncle "Hutch" was a real pilot (not coil) who saw them throwing his wings in the air and then snapping them with his point as he had accused his pilot's wings. <br /> It's just about screens a few seconds but my family would like to have the movie. She died in a dogfight on Italy, it was only 24 at the time. Do we know the film studio has made it? Or have anyone seen it in a video store, like blockbuster? I wish they would make all the cinemas of these old movies available as it is so cheap to make DVDs in those days. <br /> <br /> Please email me at nfny40@yahoo.com if you know where I can buy a copy. Thanks.
