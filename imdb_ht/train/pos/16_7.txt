I found this to be a so-romantic / drama that has a nice end with a generally feel it in it. It's not a hallmark hall of Fame-type family movie and sleep-before-marriage considered "normal" behavior, but considering it star Jane Fonda and Robert De Niro, I would expect a very rude movie, at least wise language. <br /> <br /> The most memorable part of the movie is the painter in how difficult it must be to learn how to read and write when you are an adult. That's the theme of the big movie and it involves handling some hand scenes, to be honest, the movie is not memorable. It is still a mild justice, wonderful story that I would be pleased to recommend.
