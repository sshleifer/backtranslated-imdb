I watched late last night and the words that come to mind are "original". It is a word that does not use much of television as they tend to copy whatever other network is doing and you end up with seven nights in crime shows, unexplored comedies, and crap reality. <br /> <br /> The first thing that struck me as a brick was the presence of Jim Dale. Those who are not familiar with the British "carry on ..." series or those who do not listen to a Harry Potter book, can not be familiar with Dale. I'm not sure if his presence as narrator adds or distracts. I will have to tune in more, but it gives the show a "Harry Potter" atmosphere. Maybe that's a good thing. Lee Pace (infamous, the White County) has a gift. He never explained where he got it, but he could bring someone back to death for a minute. He teamed with Chi McBride ("Boston Public," Roll Bounce) to solve the crime of using this talent. Everything is fine and funny until it comes across a loving child, Anna Friel (the goal! Dream begins, Timeline) and things really get complicated. He can not return it and never touch it. Boy, would make a tough relationship. <br /> I will tuning to see where this series goes in the expectation that it will continue to entertain.
