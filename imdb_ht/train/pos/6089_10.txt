OK, I covered it just a bit offset at least one of these grumpy reviews. But I enjoyed it. I did not laugh loudly but kept my interest and pulled me together without dropping me at any point. The story was built. Yeah, you knew he would have a happy end - this genre always does. Inside, it was original and gag before you can miss, so pay attention when you look. Stiller and Black deliver expertly. Good team. They should work together more. Not knowing that it will be a classic cult, but it certainly was a fun ride. Not as good as what to BOB, or DIRTY ROTTEN SCOUNDRELS but what? It's always worth going out of your way a little to get and watch this movie.
