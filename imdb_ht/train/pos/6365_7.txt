This film is very fun for many people who have not seen some of the animated films more obscure. I enjoyed most of it, especially after the opening minutes rather flat in the museum (although the pre-title sequence is very fun and includes some of the best bits of animation). James Garner as the Commander and Leonard Nimoy as the King gives impressive performance.
