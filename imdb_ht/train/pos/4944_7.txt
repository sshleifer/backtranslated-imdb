Not that many things happen in this movie, but many meanings. The woman thought she had everything she could in life, but that was not true, and she found out herself when she met that person who did some research for her next job. There really should be more types of movies like this, im not old ones as considered as "mature" (Im 13 by the way) and I still have the idea and point in the movie. The main point is in my opinion: Do not think you can not have a better life, just accept you now this one. Though I got admitted I thought of watching another movie, but after reading all the reviews and seeing the trailer I decided on this one even though I did not know that many actions would appear in the movie . I recommend anyone watching this movie as it has very good points in the movie, and it's a really good finish.
