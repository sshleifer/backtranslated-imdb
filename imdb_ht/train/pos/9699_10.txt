Something about "Paulie" touches my heart as some movies do. It's a witty, funny emotional movie again. I'm a couple of late in becoming a fan of this movie. I did not see "Paulie" until May 2004, and have since ordered the Widescreen DVD from a seller of eBay. <br /> <br /> The special effects in which Paulie's talk is superb. My son asked me how the bird knew many phrases. Probably my favorite part of the film is when Paulie is in the Gena Rowlands (Ivy) company followed by Cheyenne Marin (Ignacio). Tony Shalhoub (Misha) plays an excellent part of the heart. You are rooted in it all the way to the movie. <br /> You can not go to rent bad or buy this movie !!
