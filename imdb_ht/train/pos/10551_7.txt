Sitting, thrilling ?? There is nothing new "what if?" Festivals offered by Vincenzio Natali, and starring David Hewlitt and Andrew Miller as two losers. One who has relationship problems, found in boxes of his work (because of relationship problems) and the police out to get him (because of his work and his relationship problems). The other guy is an agorafob who refuses to go out of his home, and was met by an inviting girl guide calling her mother to claim she was molested when she did not buy cookies from her. Oh yeah, the police after him too, after the mother of the girl scout called them to arrest him. <br /> <br /> Man, what a day. do all these things disappear? That is the whole quote behind 'Nothing'. The defects are realized, the cops, the girl scout, the cars, the lawn, the road, everything ?? disappear. There is nothing but white space! This is an interesting concept I thought. I also looked at that, 30 minutes went to the movie, and I still had an hour left in the movie. Could the actors 2 do this job and keep us entertained for 60 minutes? Although the actors try 60 minutes is a long time and there is clearly when killed in places of this movie. But the two actors, who are life-long friends with each other and the director, have such great repertoire, that it was fun to look for the dialogue and improve the goofing around them. There are many supernatural elements, but it's more of the answers to the elements that ultimately make this movie worth seeing.
