First of all, I think the comment below is worthy of a site like this. Obviously you have no taste and you do not respect the taste of others. Do not give you a story lesson but I think it needs to be done. Black actors out there, are just, if not more, successful like others. If you are not part of the "Black" race you can not understand the quality, creativity, and vibrantness of old films such as "Sparkle" and "Mahogany" and "Cooley High." Since unfortunately you do not have Black, you do not have the pleasure of feeling that when you look at those classic, that's why you need to keep your freaking mouth off and just stick to your non-dancing races. Thanks.
