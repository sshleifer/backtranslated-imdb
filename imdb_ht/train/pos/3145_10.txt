This 70s show is the best ever TV show, period. He's here and the Andy Griffen show, Saturday Night Live, and the Simpsons in my book. This 70s Show continues over for 8 seasons, all of them focusing around a group of adolescent / young adult-related relationships, separated from parents, and their overall venues. <br /> <br /> The two main characters, Eric and Donna, are two adolescents living next door to each other. They lived next door to each other for most of their lives, and just started to feel more emotional for each other at the beginning of the first quarter. A large number of shows in turn around how their relationship works. Two other characters, Red and Kitty, are Eric's parents. Red was in the service, so she really pushed Eric around. Kitty is just the opposite. Even if he drinks heavily, he treats Eric and his friends with great care. Bob, their neighbor, is obviously Donna's father. Bob giggles around with several different women throughout the coarse of the show's history. Bob also annoys Red to his full extent. <br /> <br /> The remaining characters, Hyde, Kelso, Fez, and Jackie are Eric's friends. They also play a major role in the show's history. <br /> Well, the first season is great. This is when the characters are starting to feel new to each other. The first season is original, funny, and enjoyable. The second season is good, although it is not as good as the first. It is a basic continuation of the First. Eric and Donna are together, and everything works great out. <br /> <br /> The third episode is my favorite. He goes back, he captures the first season feeling and humor. I also think that the character's chemistry improves a bunch of people, making the show all the more fun to look. The fourth season is not as good as it is. Eric and Donna Arne't joined in this one, making the show a little less fun. It's still funny, although I did not enjoy it as much as the seasons before. <br /> <br /> The fifth season is the last season I enjoyed all the way through. It is the Senior Year Gang, so that really helps with the story. The Fifth Season also had better finish in all seasons. The Sixth Season is a good thing for the most part. It's very funny, although it does not feel like other seasons. The gang is from High School, so I believe he did not hit the kid feeling that the previous seasons were done. I also did not like the last three or four episodes to consider having a great drama feel. The Seventh Seasons captured even felt that the 5th season was in a way, although it didn not do it all the way. I enjoyed the Seventh Seasons as I did all the others, and the finish was great. The last season flat out sucked. Eric was not in it, which ruined it. Kelso was not in it for the most part, which did not help. I hate the eighth season up to the last episode. I thought that the last episode was really good, with a tight finish in the series. <br /> <br /> So, in general, if you enjoy comedy, give this 70s a try. They stop making new episodes, but it's still a bunch of TVs. I also recommend buying season 1-7. It is up to you if you want to buy Season 8.
