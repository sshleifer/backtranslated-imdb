This is the best movie I've come across a long time. Not only this film of its best (school shooting) way Ben Coccio (the director) decided his movie was magnificent. She was filming her when she used teen actors who were still going to high school. He was filmed in the actor's own room and used the real actors as their parents in the movie. Also actors have been filming also using cameras to make it seem more like a video journal. It's almost craftsman (if it's a word) Some slip ups however, for example when Cal called Brads (?) Country rover a row rover (or vice versa, It's been a while since I've seen it)
