Was Al Pacino ever in a bad movie? Its name seems to be a top cinema printer. This is as a good performance as it has ever been provided. Pacino is an American Olivier. And this is a political thriller as good as they get. There are no good guys and no bad guys. But the system has its inexorable effect on people who think they're running it. Not only is Pacino's persuasive performance - the eulogy of funeral death of the dead is awesomely powerful --- the film has a fast paced, bravest realism in it that improves the fine performance without resorting to demographic. This exceptional portrait of large urban politics also manages to provide two hours of superb film watching without undue violence, dry overcrowding or kindergarten language. There is a murder. There are bad people. But they come across effectively without crossing the line. A movie like this restored my jaded faith in Hollywood. I do not give much tens. This one deserves to deserve it!
