Man on the house is a true comedy situation in every sense of the word. The comedy worries a character named Robin Tripp (played by the great Richard O 'Sullivan) who finds himself after a wild party, which ends in the home of two ladies called Jo and Chrissy. Ironically the party was told to say goodbye to their old platmate. The obvious ends up as it moves around. <br /> <br /> Man on the house was a pre-cursor of Cooke and Mortimer in turn showing George and Mildred featuring the 2 characters that were owned by Jo, Chrissy and Robin. These two characters would actually turn out from the linchpins of people on the home and Mildred (Yout late and many are missing) in particular getting some of the best lines in the series. A semi-regular character was a futile person who was always on the scrounge and only ever came round when he wanted to lend something (and never returned it). a version called the three companies but it does not stand a chance when compared to this original far funnier. Thames took a risk of producing a comedy about a man sharing a flat with 2 women at a very conservative time but should be worried as their evaluation at the moment suggests that around 20 million people just wanted to look a nice old t fashionable comedy and inspiring files with a sharp script. What a modern comedy comedy can not reach that high standard. <br /> <br /> This program is available on DVD network
