If you want to look something for 'it' and 'it' so to say then this is the movie to choose. I'm a piston for coms as my husband is not always so keen (what a press guy). Anyway I managed to get her to watch her because I told her she was about sports, and you know what she liked to read. <br /> <br /> Drew Barrymore is very funny with man Her leader (sorry but may not remember his name) is equally as good. When I watched the movie she called the 'Perfect Match' but I think the title has changed for the UK as it is based on the book Fever book and there was already a movie made on football with that title (movie the same but UK version!), <br /> <br /> Anyway the reviews on here will tell you more details if you need to buy girls, take it from me, get your snowman / companion in front of the TV on a Saturday night and you'll both laugh and cry together. A real gem.
