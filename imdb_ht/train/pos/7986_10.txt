This is an excellent, movie cinema. It is by far the best I've seen painted the actual reality of Latin America ... kidnapping, corruption, gracious and greedy officials of police and destruction of beliefs towards innocent victims. Denzel Washinton provides the most moving performance in his career, in my opinion. Dakota Fanning is an amazing teen actress. The relationship between Washington and Fanning is nice to write and describe, I believe every minute. Throw is brilliant, Christopher Walken, Mickey Rourke are great as always. Walken lights up the screen for me as there is no other actor. I would like to see more of both of them. Location locations are remarkable. The camera work is interesting and different. There are many Latin actors in the cast, making it all the more interesting for those who are familiar with the Latin American cinema. I highly recommend this movie.
