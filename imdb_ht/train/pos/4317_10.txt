I really liked this movie when it was released, and I still do, because the storyline makes you feel hopeful about life in general, and people too ... one of the things I love about the films of Lawrence Kasdan. In addition to the positive vibes of the movie, there are other reasons like Grand Canyon. For one thing, it has an outstanding cast ... Kevin Kline and Danny Glover, for example. In my opinion, the accident, the acclaimed movie that won the Oscar for best photos, was very similar to that movie. The difference is that Grand Canyon leaves you feeling positive. Accident had the opposite effect with me; It was very dark. I would choose Grand Canyon on any crash day.
