I've always enjoyed crazy more than any movie I've seen in years. A lot of success from the 70's decided to give it another try. They begin by playing some gigs in some European unprecedented avenues, with hilarious outcomes. The music is fantastic, the script and act are terrific. Characters are stained on, especially the lead singer and the high voice voice voice, makeup and personality problems. The concert at the end was real. Go and see it, preferably in a movie with a good sound system :)
