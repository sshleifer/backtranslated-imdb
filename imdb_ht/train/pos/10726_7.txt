To surprise me I enjoy 'Spacecamp', I remember seeing it over 13 years ago, and lately I hired it again. I was quite impressed. Obviously the special effects of today's space films like Armageddon and the impact of funds are far beyond that of SpaceCamp. However, this movie has a history - a very census story where you could almost recite the next line of dialogue before it heard it. But what I like about it does not make movies like this again, so it was a refreshing change. It was interesting to see Kelly Preston, Leaf Phoenix and Lea Thomson in the early role, and Tom Skerrit and Kate Capshaw add substance to the light & fluffy draw. Absolutely liked the robot named Jinx, she was very nice, but she unfortunately had more emotions than some of the main characters. The movie was almost inspirational in its own way, and it was interesting to note that it was filmed at the NASA Spacecamp in Alabama (I think).
