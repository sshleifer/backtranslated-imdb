A common feature of film consists of the main characters to let the hustle and bustle of the city behind, and find themselves in tranquility of nature. In power in Kangwon Province, we are showing the history of people doing just that, trying to find themselves on a trip to the popular Korean parks in the hills of Kangwon Province. However, rather than epiphani moments, we have two characters whose journey of nature was just another form of escape. <br /> <br /> The mash in this movie is slow, contemplative. We learn at the end of what really brought each of Kangwon Province and we learned how to connect. For those who want Hollywood glam and for a movie to give them a definite answer, this movie will not be satisfied. But for those who want a movie that leaves them thinking, ask, that affect them next year, this movie will be much more than satiate who is eager to see.
