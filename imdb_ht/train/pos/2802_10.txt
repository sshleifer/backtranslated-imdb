As someone who has never been in sport, it seems like it would be difficult for me to get into the football (or as our inexplicable American call it, football) -hemhemed "Bend Like Beckham". But I have to say, this was one cool film! Anglo-American Jesminder Bhamra (Parminder Nagra) and Friends WASP Juliette Paxton (Keira Knightley) loves to play football (yes, I'll tell him the British - and international - way) and just adore football player David Beckham. But Sikh traditional Sikh parents are not approved (her mother offers a really whacked-out description of early football in the movie). Well, so maybe it was sort of a clich√© in this regard, but you have to love this movie! And if like me, you go to this movie by knowing the definition of "bend" in football ... do not worry, the movie explains it (I'd never heard of David Beckham before this movie). And we all know Keira Knightley hit it big: a few months after "BILB" from the United States, he starred in equally cool "Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl".
