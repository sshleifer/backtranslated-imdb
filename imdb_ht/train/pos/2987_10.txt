This is the joke that beach has never been. As many as I wanted to love beach, she always seemed too hurry for me to "feel" for her (her band is one of my favorite albums though). Stella, on the other hand, moves in a slower (and occasionally too slow) rhythm and even though it's a bit manipulative in her tale stories to induce a self-sacrificing mother, she works because Bette and the rest of the turn cast into great performance. 10/10
