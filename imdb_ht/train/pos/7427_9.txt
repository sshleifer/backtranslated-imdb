I saw the trailer for this movie in the 70's when I was barely 16 while watching another movie. Oh !!!! how excited me and my best friend was. we could not wait for the month or so until it would come over. I saw this film 17 times this year in the theater. I love, love, love it. Christ is so perfect for the movie. It's brash and garbage type but also shy and uncertain and babs and it's so touching to look it over again. When they sing Evergreen in the studio and it chimes in with his raspy voice are very different from the perfect scores coming out of it but I still think this was one of the best scenes in the movie. The way it looks at it and it's so proud. I could watch this movie every day. We tried to dress like her-I even had the long sweater and cap that was so like the one she was wearing. This came on TV over time and I got my daughter to watch her being the youth and they loved it in. Maybe it's just that I was so up to it at an age when everything was extreme does not know. The last one still has me in tears today.
