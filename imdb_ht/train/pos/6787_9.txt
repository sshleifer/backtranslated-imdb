I was stumbled on this night TCM night .. <br /> <br /> Did not see it since it originally came from, but never forgot it. <br /> I completely forgot how gorgeous and talented Signe Hasso was when she was still young, ditto for Shelly Winters before she balooned out. Ronald Coleman, though, was the state actress of excellence in his time - I had read Othello in high school English - and he was. After seeing "A Double Life" I read it again and finally understand what the play was about. <br /> <br /> The Gordon / Canine Team wrote in his peak then this script made - <br /> <br /> A movie well worth remembering and retrieving,
