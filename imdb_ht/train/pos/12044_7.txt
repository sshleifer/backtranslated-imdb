A young mayor sent to a remote area wrapped up in the estate of a recently deceased customer. When it came to her find that she was doing less than welcome by the local villages and that her client died did not like. For these speeds he decides to move from the local altar and take home residence, a home that is usually fogbound and approaching only by a road that is blocked by the sea most of the day. Once she sees a woman's vision of black, is it real or imaginary, she is also subjected to the mourning cries of a grandfather and child apparently drowning in the swamps, these events take the tolls on her and she soon becomes very frightening. Atmospheric television adaptation of a famous play by Susan Hill, which spends its first third building up its character, before moving into the creepy country house, its poor color contrast gives away its TV roots immediately, this really they would be in black & white, but still such a ghost story he had a couple of disturbing moments, still though after waiting long to see it I must say I was sadly just a little underwhelmed.
