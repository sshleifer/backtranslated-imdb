Now here is a movie right from my childhood, my family used to stuck; but its kind of hit on it was lost over the years. Now I was fortunate to watch the entire movie on youtube.com; I loved this wonderful movie when I watched it as kid, and after watching (online), I still do today. My favorite song in the movie is "Candy Hearts and Flowers Flowers" (I always remember singing songs forever). I was surprised when I watched the open credit (on that host) that some of the host dates back to 1930s (WOW! It's like 47 years).
