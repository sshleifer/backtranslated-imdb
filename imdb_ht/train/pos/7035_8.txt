Cusack does his best David Niven in this one, although I do not know if someone besides me noticed it. <br /> <br /> When viewed with this in mind, it's a saturated delightful 'want to be more serious than Austin's power but still pretty d * mn funny' reversing of a classic under-appreciated comedy. <br /> <br /> Hillary Duff makes a brunette about Britney Spears version of dance version of Mata Bond. Writers have built a small twist Oedipus twist of the plot - interesting choices. <br /> I never knew how calm Montel's voice was until this movie ... I think he's got a new call to voice voice system!
