One said, regarding Nathaniel Hawthorne, that his failure was more interesting than his success. I believe that the same remark might cost McDonald-Eddy's photos. And especially this one. <br /> It apparently owns many features of a movie failed: it's kitsch, the script because of censorship, consistency sound ?? But this movie also gets some good points: good music Rodgers-Hart ("I'm an angel," "Tira Tira Tira"), good acting with E.E.Horton and Reginald Owen. <br /> <br /> Anyway, if you can dislike it, you can not forget it. This strange movie actually leaves a very strong, dream, impression, and you are very fortunate to keep it in mind for days, perhaps for weeks. Why? In the thirties and at the beginning of the forties, cinemas did not mean even today: it aims, as a dream, to divert the public in order to make it forget a tough reality. Of all these cinematic dreams, this time, this one stands as particularly powerful. In short, let's say that the best way to appreciate this movie is to look at it without asking whether it's good or bad. To watch it, like you would watch a dream.
