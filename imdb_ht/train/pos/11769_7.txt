I bought this movie a few days ago, and thought it would be a very shitty movie. But when I popped it into the DVD player, it surprised me in a very good way. James Belushi plays well as the Bill "Mouth" Manuccie. But especially Timothy Dalton plays a very good roller coaster. The 'End' stage, in the house of Bill is very excellent, good camera-work, nice dialogue and very good acting. Bill "Mouth" Manuccie stole 12 million from the Mafia. Together with his wife, he lives in South Carolina in a witness protection program. But the Mafia tracks him down, and wants 12 million dollars. Bill can only trust the only person he knows inside out, himself.
