This film is excellent rhythm, you never have to wait for a stomach laugh come for more than a minute and there's more to go than the first in the movie. While it has mockeries in the traditional smalty local-boy-making-good-overcome-genre genre of that parody. Do not let anyone tell you that they are trying to get cheap laughs just using obscenities; - sure, there's a lot of hand but it's in every context, not free. I loved this movie and it only cost me Â£ 2.99 on DVD, so in terms of entertainment value for money, it was the best movie I've seen this year.
