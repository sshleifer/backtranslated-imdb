This can not be a classic memorable, but it is a touch romance with an important theme that emphasizes the importance of literacy in modern societies and devastating the career and life consequences for any unfortunate person lacking this vital skill. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />! Iris discovers that Stanley can not read, and after losing her job, she gives her lessons from home in his kitchen. Of course, as you can predict, of the, although initially wary of participation, develops feelings for each other ... <br /> <br /> Jane Fonda fully plays Iris, a woman with problems of her own coping with a job lacking candidates, two teenagers (a pregnant), a sister working with her abusive husband. However, Robert DeNiro is of course brilliant in his undesirable unwantedness of the intelligent and resourceful, but illiterate, Stanley, carries a dignity in the role that commands respect. They are not typical of young young yuppie couples, as generally show off on screen romance, but an ordinary working class, scared amongst having beautiful down world struggle. <br /> I will not give away away, but it is a beautiful, romantic romance with a personal look at the troubling problem of adult literacy, albeit from the perspective of a fictional character.
