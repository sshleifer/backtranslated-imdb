Takashi Miike is one of my favorite directors and I was worried about her making a movie because I'd hate to see her leaving her movie I gained love: Q visitors, Gozu, Izo, Ichi killer and Black Socioty Trilogy. Recently it seems to explore new territories and I think it succeeds. Still this was the first in his movie I would see him take that direction, so I was nervous. In coarse I bought it without seeing it and was happy I did. <br /> <br /> Great Yokai War is a perfect movie and adult children should love it too. The whole movie reminds me of many of the movies I liked as a child: Neverending story, maze, Oz return, etc. I enjoyed those films because they did not treat kids as they're stupid and this one is not either. Darkness is hidden, but it is also as funny as any movie should be. I personally was not bothered by the CGI and prosthetics. I feel like they fit well and do not think kids will notice. <br /> If you are a hard guy Takashi Miike fan, you may not like this one. But I suggest giving it a shot. It proves that Miike is as diverse and talented as I suspect is it. He continues to film his signature signature out of those, which is very reassuring. <br /> <br /> For those new ones in Takashi Miike and want something light or crazy as such one, I suggest these other Miike films: 'Zebras' Early in Catacombs '' Sabu the 'and' The Bird People of China. ' <br /> Good job Takashi Miike! 8/10 stars.
