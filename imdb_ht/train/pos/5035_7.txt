McConaughey in a horror / thriller? I had to see it. I was pleasantly surprised. <br /> <br /> The plot said in flashback mode, and it worries a normal family and the three joy goes into a very rare situation. I can not say much more without spoil the entire movie, sorry. Just know that if you decide to look it, you will, at least in many, amazed. <br /> <br /> All the main players are very good. Bill Paxton has done a good job that directs these children, and his acting is awesome. Acting McConaughey is solid at all and fits the bill perfectly. <br /> This challenging movie you think. Is Dad Crazy? Is There a God? Demons exist? How far would you go in good one wrong. And what's "right" anyway? I always think. <br /> So I recommend "challenge". 7/10 and this is one of those movies that deserve and a second reward, or even looking at third.
