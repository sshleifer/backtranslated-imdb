This was a typical movie movie B in the Hollywood 1940s and yet it has succeeded beyond its expectations. Why? She has a wonderful draw and backed up by Nina Foch, George MacReady and Lady Witty, as a cruel woman, to all. <br /> <br /> When a young lady responds an advertisement to a secretary, she certainly gets more than she was negotiating for. The only talented employers are people who will lead to breaking it. Looks like that and MacReady wants to spend it as daughter-in-law and wife, respectively. MacReady has killed his real wife and wants to make the Foch as well so that a body can claim. The film deals with how Foch tries to get people to believe her and how she is calling in practically all she does. Why not believe it?
