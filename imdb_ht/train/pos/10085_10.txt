I've just seen this movie today with my children (son, 10 and daughter, 4.5) at the 3rd Annual Roger Ebert neglecting the Film Festival. After the movie the children at the hearing were allowed to ask the Principal, Tian-Ming Wu. She (through a translator) told several stories about her life and make of the movie. <br /> <br /> All tangent aside, both of my children really enjoyed this movie. Of course, I had to recover much of the subtitles for my daughter, but many of the movie is visually self-explanatory. <br /> I will not give anything away, but the bottom line is that this movie is so much better than 95% of the Hollywood frog (especially the kids movie) out there. <br /> <br /> There is a "real" / original king of masks that can / could be 12 masks at once. The actor in the film is trained and learns to make up to 4 masks at a time (then they would cut and change to 4 new masks).
