I saw this movie in the worst possible circumstances. I'd already missed 15 minutes when I got up on it on an international flight between Sydney and Seoul. I did not know what I was looking at, I thought maybe it was a movie of the week, but soon became riveted by the performance of the lead actress playing a young woman in the kidnapped children. The first one started to twist and turn I did not see coming up with the credit ends I was scrambling in the guide of flight-figure out what I was just watching. It turns out I was decontrolled to discover Do-Yeon Jeon who would have the best comedy in Cannes for the role. I do not know if Sunshine secrets are typical of Korean movies but I'm going to the DVD store to discover more.
