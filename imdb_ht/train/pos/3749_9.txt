I laugh very much while watching it. It's a fun and fun act of fun and a lot of wackiness. The characters are simple but simplicity are added to the humor stylization. The dialogue is funny and often unexpected, and from the first line to the last everything just seems to shed nice. There's Max, who apparently led a terrible life. And there is Edward, who is not sure what life he wants to lead. My favorite character was Tom, Edward's madman. Tom has a short but a memorable role. Highly recommended for anyone who loves humorous humor. And you can find it online now, which is a bonus! I'm a fan of all the drawings of Jason and can not wait to see what he's coming out with next.
