If you like Star Wars / Trek, come to see where they got all the ideas and cinemas. It's my head 2 favorite movies ever, the other-world-futuristic and psycho-thriller. The intensity of the root material (Shakespeare's "Storm") is not covered by whizbang gimick (a later Lucas). And just because it did in 1956, do not suppose you can 'see the strings' holding the flying saucer. This was the first movie where you could not. His miracle of scale "A-film", economy and flavors of the time piling up against him. And director of the 'Wilcox' director was "Lassie coming home". Until I watch her up, I suppose 'Fred Wilcox' was a pseudonym for a director who was already or later became famous, but at the time did not want to be associated with sci-fi, which was strictly a " B "genre back then. This was either a very very visionary production, or a very shock 'mistaken' on the part of the Bankroll Hollywood. <br /> There are massive mass-scale massage and live action almost microscopic elements that utilize many Lucas. There are smart cars that oversteer the user's stereo 'stereo; "computers", as they have come to describe much less futuristically to work later. The Trek Star Trek 'contains, visually, almost unaltered by Roddenberry 10 years later. But if the technobabble war machine turns you off, FP's scientific reference is not too much and it's all right, even today. The "Boat" set is full, brilliant realistic, as good as anything you've ever seen, and more compelling than anything 'trek' made for television or movie. We did not find them spend much time there as I would like. <br /> If you've ever wondered how movies got in such space completely, watching FP will explain it all. It's definitely not 'Wagontrain in the Stars'.
