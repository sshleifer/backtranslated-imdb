She praised herself as a great actor to support "Glory", she proved she had no Malcolm in Middle 'mediocre actor at' Malcolm X ', she showed her brother's love for the act 'Philadelphia', pulling a slam dunk into "It's Toy," has pulled no punches and launched us as a hurricane in the "Hurricane," providing us with effective training thespian on Training Day, and now , he demonstrated that he might also be direct! Denzel Washington's first debutant 'Celebrating Fisher' is the most moving movie of the year. This tearjerker `fish'er story is in no relation to the debacle that reached Miami Dolphins in the 4th quarter against the New England Patriots in the latest game in the 2002 season. Unlike Dolphin tragedy, 'Fewer Fisher' owns an emotional sense of joy. The movie is based on a true story of a young sailor officer who has a problem management anger because of the abominable he suffered as a foster child. Denzel plays the naval psychologist who helps solemnly overcome his rage and convince him to find his natural mother. Derek Luke's first performance as Admonished is the most admirable act I've seen by a novice actor in some time now. I actually saw some of the eccentricities expressed in Luke's act as I saw in Washington's past performance. It was as if Washington told Luke - that's my Luke is your acting dad. Ok! I will lie in the Star Wars jokes before my readers send me to a distant galaxy. Speaking of the great Denzel, his work as the psychologist was mastery. But what can you expect from acting 'master D' himself. 'Fisher Fisher' was written by no other than Fisher Himself. Her emotional patient was put into her storylife scenario was in the 'main king' material. I hail to the 'Mr. Washington' masterpiece to catch the right bait of `Fisherman Fisher '. ***** Excellent
