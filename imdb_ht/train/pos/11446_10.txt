Right at this time I watched this movie for the second time (on TV) and the second time I dropped to it when it ran for an hour already (I think I've seen 2 minutes more this time) This movie is really impressive, Goldsworthy's way to look into nature, nature changes in a way that you yourself would never think, really is amazing. This whole movie gives you a warm feeling, seeing him play with the world around him and love these. Or only see his hands, covered in dirt and broken nails, it just touches you.
