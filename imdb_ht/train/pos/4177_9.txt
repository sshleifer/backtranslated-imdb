A delightful piece of movie history in a simple but effective way. Cinema after all is a visual media and Igor uses all its potential. A restless youth framed a train with no destination in mind. In one of the compartments he meets with a girl. Words are not exchanged but washing their laundry and from us we take on a ride with other specific characters and situations. Driving two are perfectly cast as unique features tell you a story that does not need words.
