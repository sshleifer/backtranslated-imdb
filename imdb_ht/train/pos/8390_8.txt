My first Fassbinder was a wonderful experience. Movie and alternative movies (small rooms, and comfortable chairs, the public had to wait while they were switching movierolls) were perfect matching. There were many cliches used in the movie, but Fassbinder presented them so cleverly that I found them really fun. Sound was also brilliant (sometimes back being stronger than dialogue). Everything seemed to be in right place. And I loved the way how post-war-time was introduced. Real fun! <br /> <br />
