The title title shows the credits written on a dripping rainwater ditch; The music is given to Alfred Newman whistling at "Street Scene." Then we meet Det. Sgt. Mark Dixon (Dana Andrews), who always wants something his old man was not: a guy on the right side of the law. But it is very vicious for a good guy. After several complaints about people stir up her boss, Ensp. Nicholas Foley (Robert F. Simon), demonstrates. Foley tells him he's a good man, but needs to find himself on their right and be more like Det. Lt. Thomas (Karl Malden), who just got a promotion. Meanwhile, Tommy Scalise (Gary Merrill, in a slim surprise performance) has an illegal dirt game going and is looking for a sucker from Ted Morrison's rich (Harry Von Zell), whom which was brought in by Ken Paine (Craig Stevens) and his beautiful Morgan wife (Gene Tierney). She looks out too late in her husband using her as a deck, and Paine hits him when she refuses to play together. Morrison joined Chivalr but Paine knocks him out of cold. Which seems to be the worst of it, but later it turns out the guy is dead; and Paine looks guilty. <br /> But this will not be Paine's story. Soon Dixon fell in love with Morgan? But not before he loses his time again and commits a terrible deed that he tries to cover. Papa Morgan, a taksi-taxi driver (Tom Tully), can take the rap to her. It's up to Dixon to try to blame the blame on scaling. <br /> <br /> Otto Preminger led a script credited to Ben Hecht and three others from the novel "Night Cream" by William L. Stuart. This is a film film full of excellent performance and all the shadows of photography and our moral nourishment are expected from this genre. It holds up to the brightly lit finish, which looks like something the studio has filmed it deliberately. Of course, the classic noir led by Preminger and begins Andrews and Tierney is "Laura." You will enjoy this, but you can not miss that.
