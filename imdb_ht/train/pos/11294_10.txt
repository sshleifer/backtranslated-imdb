This movie gets it right. As a former USAF Cadet Aviation, I can tell you that this film has it all. Tedyom in the application process. Waiting for words. Joy of Acceptance. Worry about doing it in the neck. Grief to watch one's entertainment (maybe the best of them) wash out. The fee to pay the ultimate cost - the death of slingshot student aircraft. Glory at graduation. Always fly, fly, fly. Many people call their hands to choose some. We have been paying for what we would have to pay for.
