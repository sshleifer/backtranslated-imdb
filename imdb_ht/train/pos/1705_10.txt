"Spaced Invaders" is one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. I do not understand, why this movie has not found the best criticism, it's funny, harmless and sweet. I first looked at her, when I was 11, and I really fell in love with ... 2 days later, I got it on VHS :-P Until today I showed her to many friends, and they all loved it, but nobody knew the movie before. I think, that's the problem, almost nobody knows it, so almost nobody likes it ... This movie never has a real chance, this sad, "IF" has really the potential of a comedy like "Monsters Inc "or" Spaceballs ". Ok, enough displeasure - What I really mean, that is, if you ever want to laugh yourself off, look it! Even if you do not get angry with it, it's worth watching! -> Prepare laughs, earth scum!
