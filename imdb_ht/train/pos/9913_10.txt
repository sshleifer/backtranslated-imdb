In addition to a very fun movie, I can add that the costumes and scenery were wonderful. This kind of fun love woman has a great deal of money. Unfortunately, he also had two vicious daughters who were worried to get their hands on his money. This woman was lonely since her husband's death. He proposed him to a theater that was going to break down. To prevent that, he bought it. Her daughter was afraid she sent "money" and decided to take action. The characters actors in this movie were a big plus too. I would give almost anything to have a copy of this movie in my video library, but as of yet, it has never been released. Tris.
