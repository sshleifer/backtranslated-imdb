Whenever this movie is on BBC someone in the Radio Times says how it is a satire against the post war world in rationing and the welfare state. I do not think this is point in the movie at all. The parody films are the spivs (the small criminal case that runs the blackmarket) and the Menager League who are against government restrictions but they are really an organization before the council. <br /> Yes of course the movie throws up the political / social situation but at the end people realize that they need all the controls to ensure a fair society, they want to be British and shuffling in rather than aliens. <br /> But I do not think they are back in being exactly the same as they were before.
