Chances are, you will think that this movie is incredibly stupid the first time you watch it. And if, by chance, you watch it a second and third and fourth and fifth time (I'm well in the hundreds now), you'll find yourself spitting a line out of it here and there and split yourself up ! My friends and I have actually drowned in a part of Hat blacks to find out more of our friends, "as they say, down with the riots".
