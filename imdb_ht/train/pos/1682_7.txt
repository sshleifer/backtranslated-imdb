After soaking his toes in the giallo pool and film of the mastery "The Strange Vice of Mrs. Wardh" (1971), director Sergio Martino followed up that same year and that turned out to another thriller suspension thriller, "The Case of The Tail Scorpion. "Like his earlier efforts, this one star star Macho dude George Hilton, who would go to the star of the martini's hybrid hybrid hybrid" all the colors in the dark "the following year. The "Scorpion Scale" also features the actor Luigi Pistilli and Anita Strindberg, who would attend show a happy couple (to put it mildly!) In Martino's "Vice is a locked room and only I have the key" (1972). (I just love this title!) I suppose Edwige Fenech occupied the month of shooting this! Anyway, this film has many stylish directions that fans Martino would expect, as well as a twisty plot, some pieces of kill kill tissue, and beautiful Athenian shooting places. The story of this is an anxiety investigator (Hilton) and a journalist (Strindberg, here looking like Farrah Fawcett, the smartest sister) who gets embraced in a series of grisly murder after a plane crash and the inheritance in $ 1 million by a beautiful widow. I really thought I was photographing this half, but I was dying wrong. Although the draw makes perfect sense of this giallo, I may have to watch the movie again to fully appreciate all its intricacies. Important points in the picture, for me, Anita's cat-and-mouse battle and the killer in the end, a particularly suspense house, and a nifty battle over a tile roof; many of the good action bursts of this movie! As they are fine in No shame they must thank for always another great-looking DVD, with nice subtitling and extra exciting expenses. Whotta's great outfit turned out to be, in its ongoing quest to bring those lost gems to Italy back from oblivion.
