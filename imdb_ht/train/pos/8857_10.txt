Director Sidney Lumet has made some heads, such as Networks, Dogs afternoon or Serpico. But he did not have too much luck on his most recent work. Gloria (1999) was sad and finding me guilty was an interesting but failed experience. Now, Lumet brings her best movie in decades, and, not my point of view, a true masterpiece: Before the Devil knows you're dying. I think this movie is like a rebirth for Lumet. This film has an excellent story that, deeply, has many layers. Also, I think the end of the movie is perfect. The performances are brilliant. Pillip Seymour Hoffman brings, as usual, a magnificent performance and he's no doubt , one of the best actors of our day. Ethan Hawke is also an excellent actor but has been underrated by my point of view. His presence in here is great.The rest of the cast is also excellent (especially, great Albert The Finney) but these two actors carry monumental performance that they were sadly ignored by the pathetic Oscars.The film has a good level of intensity, in the tha part of the performance, and, partly, thanks to the brilliant storyline. The Devil Knows You're Dead is a real masterpiece with perfect direction, a great sympathy and excellent performance. We need more movies like this.
