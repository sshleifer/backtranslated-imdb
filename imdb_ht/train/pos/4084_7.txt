I guess this means to be a sort of remittance or upgrade to "Beauty and the Beast," but I can not say I've ever watched a movie that started with several minutes of graphic horse sex. Wow. Anyway, it looks like a young woman with her .. Traveled to this castle in France where the woman is married to the castle owner's son, who is the person who takes care of making sure that the horses get the stones off. It seems that there are legends in this area of ​​an animal that preferred, uh, frisky, I guess you might say, with the ladies, or at least, one particular. There are all kinds of references attached to that regard but every time the bride's-to-be-blushing young becomes curious but little on one groom's father removes it from his eyes. Anyway, the young bride-to-go goes upstairs while the family is waiting for a Cardinal to show up to the wedding (a family member, I guess) and as he dreams he dreams of an animal in the woods way with it. These effects leave a little to be desired, and any attempts at eroticism (not that I know so much about) is kind of ridiculous, especially when certain Appendices charge appears as realistic as a post office or baseball bat. This has a rather unusual and abrupt, yet twisted finish, and not really any indication or much built up to it, but it was kind of fitting and definitely not what I expected. I do not know, this kind of one is hard to get from it has its moments and is definitely strange. 7 out of 10.
