In 1983, Director Brian De Palma set out to make a movie about the rise and fall of an American criminal, and that he did - with the help of a simple simple by Oliver Stone and some imperfectly performed by an outstanding cast. The result was `Scarface, 'starring Al Pacino in one of his most memorable roles. The story begins in May 1980, when Castro opened the port of Mariel, Cuba, to allow Cuban citizens to join their families in the United States. 125,000 left Cuba at that time, for the gracious enclosures of freedom in America, and most were honest, many people working, grateful for the opportunity they were awarded. But not all. Among the 'Marielitos' who were floating in Florida, about 25,000 had criminal records and had nothing less than their imprisonment in Cuba prison - criminals consider beyond redemption, which Castro simply wanted to get rid of . And they also saw America as an opportunity country, as Al Capone considered Chicago some fifty years earlier. And among the most ambitious was a man named Tony Montana (Pacino), known to associate it as `Caracortada. 'Scarface. Now that he was free from the yoke of communism under which he grew up, Montana wanted what he felt he was coming to, and he wanted it now; and at that time he stepped into the boat in Florida, he was determined to read it all. Wealth and power - that was Montana's dream, and it would get it by doing what she did best, starting with a favor for a man living in Miami by the name of Frank Lopez (Robert Loggia). Lopez, apparently, had a brother in Cuba who had met a premature end at the hands of one of Castro's goon, a man who survived his utility in Castro, was resolved to eliminate and have now been Keeping in "Little Havana," along with Montana and all the Cubans just about the ships, where the papers are out of the government would effect their transition to their new life. And in short order, Montana sees it that Lopez's brother shooting, and laying the scene for his own entrance to the wild in America. <br /> <br /> Lopez, a wealthy businessman with the right connection, in return for the favor of Montana and her friends ', Manny (Steven Bauer), released to the camp holding, and put them to work. In his days, Capone may have been bootlegging as a means of which in his coffin line with illegal benefits, but Lopez has The modern day equals, and it's even more lucrative: Cocaine. Lopez takes Montana under his wing and indoctrinates him into life, but once he has a taste in it, Montana is not satisfied with All that Lopez crumbles saw fit throw his way, and lay a course that will take him to where he wants to be: At the top. With a cold-blooded, do will, Montana decides it will do whatever it takes to get there, no matter what the price. but before it's over, it will realize the price for her dream, and she'll pay it; but for a moment, maybe he will know what he likes to be the Man. And it will also know whether or not it was worth it. <br /> In stage with De Palma's vision, Pacino plays Montana bigger-than-life, and it does it very well. From the emphasis it affects (which he researched well to ensure that he got it right - and he did), in the body language and the mood, he got it all and made Montana convincing and very real. What it brings in the role is nuances and style, in a way that some actors (De Niro should be one) can. This is definitely not a sympathetic character in any way, nor having anything about Montana that you can easily relate to on a personal level; but the presence of the Pacino screen is so strong that it makes it a quite aggressive character, though it's hard to become emotionally involved with it. It's very simply a dynamic, memorable performance. Michelle Pfeiffer provides a solid performance, as well, in the role that puts him on the path to the limelight. As Elvira, the woman who becomes an integral part of Montana's dream, Pfeiffer is subtle and understated, giving that sense something going on under, while affecting an exterior face rather than cold and distant. He, like Pacino, definitely makes his presence felt as it's fairly inflated across the screen with a stoic, enigmatic and mild attitude. The cast in support includes Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio (Gina), Miriam Colon (Mama Montana), F. Murray Abraham (Omar), Paul Shenar (Sosa) and Harris Yulin (Bernstein). An excellent predecessor of the latest and highly acclaimed 'Traffic,' and 'Corps', and as well as having a climatic scene reminiscent of Peckinpah's' wildlife batch,' De Palma's `Scarface, 'originally hanged by critics, has since been citing not so much as was the definitive American criminal legend. Many of the violence is implicit rather than graphics, but this film still has a corner of realism in it that many can find a bit disturbing. But if you stay with it, there is a lesson to be learned in the end. Like many lessons in life, the most important are often the hardest to take in the moment. But the reward is still worth it, and that is the way it is with this movie. I miss this one 8/10. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
