A unique film ... one of the best of all time. Acting, script, Quincy Jones notes, movies, editing, etc. - just fantastic. As most viewers know, this movie is based on Truman Capote's book on the famous murder of a Kansas family (the Clutters) by a couple of young guys during a bad flight. I have never seen a movie that is so brilliant to turn a true story into a fixed movie. <br /> <br /> The actors are solid across the board, but the focus is on the killers, Dick and Perry, and the law enforcement team pursues them. Scott Wilson, as Dick Hickock is amazing. Cocky, twitchy, and devoid of compassion he comes across is so good, oil and compelling. Robert Blake as Perry Smith is extraordinary as well - lonely, and at once sympathetic and cold-blooded. Who can fold these features into one person and make us buy it? It's done, and it's brilliant! A key point in the book is how it took the intersection of these two different social societies to create the critique mass committed as a stupid crime and crime, and the two actors make it work very well. Both were moments in the subsequent careers, but these performances are high water markings, which means to act periodically. <br /> <br /> The cops are wonderful too. The investigating leader is John Forsythe, but the other three detectives are great as well. Unlike contemporary movies where producers feel the need to provide police with good or bad habits, these are just platfeet, working case and resilience and skill. They seem so real. I never see cops on the screen for the powerful of their authenticity; and I saw most of the classic crimes going way back. Really one of the kind in this respect. <br /> <br /> PARTICIPATOR COMING SPEAKER (this unique movie in which you already know what happened, but I'm warning the file). <br /> Of course, the best scenes of the best crime show and the interrogation movies - the intellectual fence matches between the cops and the Crooks, Mano a Mano. This movie has but down the best of the interrogation scenes you'll ever see on the movie. Watch Dick and Perry try to bluff their way through and slowly unravel, ignoring the cops to have the goods on them. But the cops needed to deftly suspect their susceptible fracture fractures and hopefully confusion. This is some of the best act you'll ever see. Think Glengarry Glen Ross without the showboating. <br /> <br /> To help translate the sad and terrible angles of this true story, the ICB was filmed at the current Clutter House, and I heard the Clutters played by the movie films to give them a genuine feel . It works. These seem like decent, simple folk. It makes the crime so obvious and sad. <br /> I'll stop here. It's not a movie-feeling good, but it's one of the best movies ever to do, and so unique, it's compulsive look for every movie movie.
