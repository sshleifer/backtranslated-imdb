Written by the writer who recorded the excellent Murder Chamber series that chronicled the ACD's adventures with Dr. Joseph Bell, I was looking forward to this and I was not disappointed. It was slowly moving, and a lot of emphasis on Doyle's frustration at Sherlock Holmes was very accurate and excellent to describe. It was an interesting and beautifully-shot character (on digital video, unusual for a piece of period). The act was excellent all round, particularly Tim McInnery and Brian Cox although the actress describes ACD, whose name can not remember to impress me no end. An excellent character study of the same amount of twists as any normal Sherlock Holmes can be. Watch this if you get the chance
