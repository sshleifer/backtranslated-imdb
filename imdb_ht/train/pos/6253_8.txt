This movie is great. As often as it is, it is indeed very realistic and sometimes brutal, but unlike some others I clearly do not think that it is depressing, negativist or dismantling Austria as a prototype-fascist society. On the contrary: While there are indeed very few scenes in HUNDSTAGE and some characters are to be called very bad people, at the same time you look at love, beauty and humor in the film Ulrich Seidls. And that's exactly distinguished REQUEST for me from other films that try to show their lives in the 'ordinary people' in an intense, realistic way; Hustle them, their wishes, their dark places: Seidl clearly will never try to prove, that the lives of those working-class people are garbage! In my opinion, viewers who come to this conclusion seem terrified by admitting that almost nobody is living as 'clean' and 'normal' as we would like others to believe. And each living has its dark and often depressing places. The most beautiful scene: the old man vying, watching his old dance dancing 'the Oriental Way', as he calls it. I think that all those who find this ugly sex lack a sense of beauty and should ask themselves what it is, that's proto-fascist: the characters of HUNDSTAGE or viewers, who are canceled in The body of a 70 + year-old woman, dancing with all her charms for her lover.
