Rated PG-13 for violence, short sexual humor and drug content. Quebec Rating: 13+ (Can G) Canadian Home Video Rating: 14A <br /> I've seen Police History a couple of times right now. In my opinion Police History is the best film film from the 80's. Originally did it because he did not like the other cop movie he had the star of the Protector. I have not seen the protector so I cant compare. The action is not too bad and the plot is very good. I do not remember the draw well because I saw this movie shortly but what I remember this movie has lots of great action, cascades and comedians just that a good film movie needs. If you can find police history, and you are fond of Chan then buy this movie! <br /> <br /> Runtim: 106min <br /> 9/10
