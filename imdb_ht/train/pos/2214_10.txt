My family went to New Orleans early 1700 and 1700 and watched the movie I knew it was a story my parents-parent never talked about, but we knew it existed. I have cousins ​​obviously black African African Americans and others who can "pass" as white and chose not. It's a tough story to look when you realize that it's your family talking about and that Cane River is all part of this story. It makes me want to cry and it makes me want to kick the 'ass' of my great grandfather who owns these plantations and wonders of awe in how my great grandmother of African heritage has lived under oppressive and yet aristocratic existence. .. And at the same time I did not come out of this story, I probably would not have succeeded in my business today today living successfully in a truly integrated world. The act was both excellent and just depends on the actor, but it is a movie that needs to be done. Anne Rice is incredible and I ask myself, why it's 'symbolic' to write about my family and not. I recommend this movie to everyone. Leza
