I have not yet read this Kurt Vonnegut book, but I'm familiar with some of his other work and was interested to see how he would translate the screen. In general, I think this is a very successful adaptation of one of Vonnegut's novels. He worries the story of an American living in Germany who recruits as a spy for the US. His work is ingratiate himself with the high ranked Nazi and sends secret messages to the American through his weekly radio show. But when the war ended, he was denounced as a criminal but night war in New York, where various odd traits are waiting. <br /> <br /> If night mom has a problem it's that it tends to get a little too sensitive at times. But for most of the film the schmaltz is kept at a minimum and the very weird draw brought in with skill and aplon. And there are some fabulous moments in black comedy involving three fundamental rights fundamentalists and a very pretty Nazi in a prison cell. Many are recommended.
