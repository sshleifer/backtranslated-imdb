I am not a parent, nor am I a man. But I could identify with the pain of all the characters and pain. <br /> This is a movie adolescent should look. Perhaps this way will begin to appreciate the value of the family again. I'm sorry for those who do not understand the value of love, family and friendship. <br /> It was very interesting to watch Patrick Duffy in a different role than that of Bobby Ewing. And it is great to see a 19 year old Ben Affleck giving his best to a moving and sincere performance. It was shown at an early age, that it is able to dramatically dramatize. It should offer the most serious roles. Note Hollywoodland ... his first serious role in year and he came out, he was the Best Actress at the Venice Festival in 2006. This movie can be appreciated by people of all ages. Maybe should not look at children under 10 because they might find fear that the same can happen to their families, but I recommend it to the whole family. <br /> I bought this movie on DVD and watched it with friends many times. Because it shows the valuable values ​​in life.
