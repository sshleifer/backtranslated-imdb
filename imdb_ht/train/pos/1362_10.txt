My head and groovadelik I 20-something pale just can not get enough of that awesome Parker Posey CLASSIC! I tried to rent this on DVD, but it may not seem to get it - too bad, as I'm sure the features might be "extra special" !! :) We all highly recommend this Flickerino Uber-Cool comedy for a date, or even just a cozy night alone! This might also be the kind of purr-fect of the movie watching with your cat, or even cast a party based, as part of "Party Girl", just like the one in the movie that is lovable, huggable, squeezable Parker Posey goes to the end. Oh, and be on the lookout for a surprise and hurried surprise to finish ... move sideways, the Sixth Sense, you've just been outdone by a movie way filder! Sorry, there is no offense, just call it like it is! Take her out of an old lover guy, comedians just do not get better than "Girl Party" and Parker P! Feel it!
