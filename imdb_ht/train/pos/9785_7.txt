Let me be the first non-Australian to comment on this :) I got the movie for Hugo Weaving and I look at the end. He is one of the films "The Life Drama", as my mother used to call a movie that depicts a real life story with no extraordinary events and is mostly descriptive. <br /> I love the light and the girls. The rest was without excessive blame, but without too much merit either. I'm craving for something such as the Interview, or at least some matrix elements here and there, but nothing out of the ordinary. The story teaches one about the face of one's own destiny and breaks free of the environment other people built for you, but this happens when the life of the factory's factory peach is about to close, so not much of a change effort the requested information. <br /> <br /> The "smart" American Beauty sound-like song in the background could be part of a bigger band, but just that one play on and over again became annoying after 100 minutes of film . > <br /> In the end, I guess he did his job at presenting part of Australian life, but I did not look especially Australian (he could have been wearing anywhere) and did not look like attractive as a story. <br /> I guess one must be in a certain mood like the movie.
