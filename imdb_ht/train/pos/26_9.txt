When I was a kid I watched this many times over, and I recall the chanting "Cat Cat" quite often. All the songs are great, and are actually memorable, unlike many children's music, where songs are just stuck in for no real reason. The scenes and costumes are true, and the very well-done act, which is not surprising, consider the cast. Christopher Walken is very catlike, and does not need stupid make-up, or a cat costume for the viewer to believe that it is a cat transformed into a human. And Jason Connery is so beautiful, like Shy's son and the left Miller, Corin, who falls in love with the beautiful and bold princess Vera. This is a really fun, enjoyable, feature-length film, where unlike most fairies, the characters are given personalities. Some of my favorite parts when choosing to make Corin assume he drowned; at the ball when everyone begins to dance a land dance, as it's "all the rage abroad"; when Walken is in the kitchen, dancing on the table (she's a nice dancer, too!); and when Vera tells Corin everything he did when he was young, as he claimed he was a daughter of Miller. I would recommend this movie to the kids and parents alike, who likes magic and fairies. And it's actually a movie you can watch together, as it will not drive up the wall.
