Comparing with the Fight Club, the Matrix, A.I., Sixth Sense, among others. This film approaches the psyche in a never-made way. The first 30 minutes to build an interesting love story between Diaz-Cruise-Cruz. The rest of the movie is, quite, confusing, you'll choose more every time you watch it (I went to the movies to see it 3 times right now)
