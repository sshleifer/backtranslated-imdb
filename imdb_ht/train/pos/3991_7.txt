"If I sit, I will never get up again," that's the mother (one of the titles) telling her son when she says she finds some rest (she's just a few). It means that resting is a woman in her age and in her situation: rest in peace, neglecting herself. But it's not in the mood for "resting", not yet. She also had a daughter who insulted her for every disaster in her life ... Immediately, the revelation came: sex and passion in the face of a muscular clannor 30 years smaller than her (Daniel Craig, James Bond's new brand) when he "never thought anyone ever touched him". It's a story that reminds you of many things, especially about what a 60-year-old woman is supposed to do with her life when her husband dies. It does not look like we've advanced that into these aspects. I mean, no one is surprised when Sean Connery has a love affair in a movie with Catherine Zeta Jones ... but what would you think if he was otherwise? An old woman, a young guy ... well, you're not ready for that, are you? <br /> <br /> The movie has intimate tides all along its length, except for 2 or 3 sequences of what tone breaks and comes out explicit and malicious-mouthed dialogue. Those who touch the vulgar and the way the son and daughter find their mother's love affair (very absurd - you will know what I mean when you look it -) are the only disorderly elements of "Mother" . <br /> <br /> * Me Rate: 7/10
