I first met this show when I stayed in Japan for six months last year. I found it on the internet when I was looking for dramatic sub-titles to help me with my Japanese. My army mother warned me to stay away from her because she thought she was weird, but I found her delightful! Koyuki has shown the characteristics of conflict and spirit Matsujun's mind made my day every time I tuned in! I saw him on "Hana Yori Dango", but I loved him better in this! Although the interesting and well-developed characters, I was ashamed to find that they did not change very much throughout the show. Their relationships grew, but they were not really. Still, a fun time was not all (even for Fukushima!).
