This is a good family show and a great cast of actors. It's a nice break from the Blitz reality at the end of the month. There is nothing else like it on television now either, unless you count Joan of Arcadia being just because it has a young lead character too. Anyway, Clubhouse is worth a look because Jeremy Sumpter gives the main character (Pete Young) a kind of lucidity and naive appeal without overly sweet and cuddly. Dean Cain, Christopher Lloyd, Mare Winningham and Kirsten Storm round out the rest of the main cast members, and each is terrific in their role. I really love Kirsten Storm as Betette's sister Bethy; She is quite a pill, but she still cares about her mother and brother, though she hated to show her. It can take some bugs really to get it in the leg, but Clubhouse is unlikely to one of the best shows coming together in a long time, so check it out people - you'll be happy you've done!
