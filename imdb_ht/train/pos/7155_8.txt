More than just a "child" movie, "hole" looks at how past incidents still affect us today, if we know about them or not. When Stanley Yelnats III's (Shia LeBoeuf) teenager was sent to a prison camp where he was forced to dig all day, he discovered a number of things on the camp, with his personal connection to her. Through the flashbacks, we learn that a number of things are closer to achieving (you will understand this best when you see the movie). LeBoeuf does a good job, like other cast members: Sigourney Weaver, Jon Voight, Tim Blake Nelson, Henry Winkler, Patricia Arquette, and Eartha Kitt. A very interesting movie.
