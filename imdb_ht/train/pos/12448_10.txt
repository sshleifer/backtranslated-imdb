The first; I'm a devoted fan of the Modesty, and have been funny to read since I was a kid, and I found the earlier movies about our heroine unsatisfactory, but where they fail, that's one ROCKS! So here we go: Ms Blaise is working for a casino, a thief gang comes along and it starts gambling for her friends to live. If the thief has a round, he will tell him about it. If it wins twice in a row, one of the staff members goes free. (Sound stupid, yes, well, I'm not good at explaining either ..);) <br /> He tells him about growing up in a war zone, without parents or friends, on helping an old in the refugee camp and how to escape, living by their own nature rules. They hunt for food, and teach it to read and fight. While approaching civilizations to get caught up in a war, and as they were taken to rebellion, they shot in with the old man dying, leaving him to meet the city by himself. He meets people in his casino now working for, and the story has finished. <br /> What to track is that there is an awesome battle and the line are totally cool. Alexandra Staden is a Blaise modest terryphic! Just as modest and strong, graceful and intellectual as the comic-one. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />, as existing. (Not to mention that it is English speaking everyone speaks English in the Balkans .. <br /> <br /> The act is really good, even the child who's personalized Blaise's young must have a stick! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < Look at it, you will not be disappointed!
