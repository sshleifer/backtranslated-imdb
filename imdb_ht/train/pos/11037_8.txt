Now I know the French prisoners are easy to read Lovecraft (and prove my point that writing it should be taught at school, perhaps as a separate topic), but how to think something sound like " ftog yog out "can possibly lead to any good? <br /> <br /> The movie takes place in a prison where morning morning cards are very easy to fall on a magic book that can be, if it's right, get out there. As prison went, the cell was totally unrealistic, so it was hard for me to get into the atmosphere of things. It also moves rather slowly, which can make people. But other than that, this feeling of horror teeth, mixing Sartre's "hell is others" with a kind of Lovecraft / Barker in history, and doing rather successfully. <br /> <br /> Bottom line: take the time to watch this. This means not doing it when you are about to go to work or to sleep or while doing something else. This is a movie that works best if you are immersed in it. Lessons must be learned: Yog is bad, almost as bad as French women.
