I never went to the night show in a movie before "Dick Tracy" out. <br /> I always have the "t-shirt ticket" I had to put them in the show around here somewhere, and, like this shirt, "Dick Tracy" has stuck with me ever since. <br /> <br /> If you've seen the movie, the sharp visuals, bright colors and strong characters have no doubt been brushed in your brain. It's an amazing view. <br /> As a director / star / co-writer / producer, Beatty knows what works in a movie and shows it here, taking a familiar American icon and re-creating it for a whole new era. Still wearing in the '30s,' Tracy "has a kind of timeless quality like all good movie making. I lost track of how many times I watched "Tracy" and I always catch something new every time I do. <br /> <br /> Others are all toothache, starting with Pacino's Big Caprice boy (a reminder that he can do the best and most comedy of them), even Madonna Breathless Mahoney is a release from the bottom of the environment right, it can act (GASP!). But there are still these terms touching on as the necessity of family, keeping true to one's self, good against evil, even Machiavellian terms to explore. Odd for a comic strip movie, but hey, it works. <br /> In all, "Dick Tracy" is a classic for himself. Compared to other films this decade, he made a strong statement. It is a good, strong movie that does not depend on blood, violence, profanity or stripping its fists. <br /> There is a lesson to be learned here. <br /> <br /> <br /> Ten stars. Gran Scott!
