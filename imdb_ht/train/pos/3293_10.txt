If ever I asked to remember a song from a movie of yesteryear year, then it would be "Chalo Di Daar Chalo Chand Ke Paar Chalo" for her meaning, the way she is singing by Lata Mangeshkar and Mohd . Rafi, lyrics by Kaif Bhopali and not to mention photography in the movie when the boat sailing goes out against the black background and the bright stars. The other should do "Chalte Chalte." Pakeezah was Meena Kumari's latest film before he died and the amount of time it took to be seen on the screen. In each of the songs that are picturized, it seems young but after that it does not. But one actor who did not change to look like he was Kumar at the late end, who fell in love with her especially foot, after he accidentally went to his subway cabin and saw them and left a notes describing how beautiful they are. Conclusion: Pakeezah is a beautiful romantic story that, if they should all be possible to see on the big screen just for the sake of photography movies and songs. Movie stars Meena Kumari, Raj Kumar and Ashok Kumar and are led by Kamal Amrohi. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />!
