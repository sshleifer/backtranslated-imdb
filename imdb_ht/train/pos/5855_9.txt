If you have played "Spider-Man" on the PS version, then you've seen it all. To really experience it you should get the DC version. Simply place it in a lot of super graphics games; The sharp textures, levels are easy to navigate, and it has sounds better then it's PS cousins. I bought this game back to the end of '00 and it still holds up to this day. Well, Marvel: Ultimate Alliance is a great superior and strategic game but if you're a fan of Web site yourself must read yourself to pick this up for your gaming library. Swing around the city as Spidey never watch this good and die-on in a video game. If you have a Dreamcast, tear this up for cheap. The DC version is simply incredible.
