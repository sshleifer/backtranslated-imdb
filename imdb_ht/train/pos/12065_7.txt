"Incognition" is a far from big movie, from a stage game, directed by Nic Roeg. In the plot of Roeg's film, this is much higher than the level of most post- "not Look Now" works, which is characterized by the judicial use of Theresa Russell as lead actress. It's actually pretty good here, and far from the issue of other Roeg movies like "Bad" and "Cold Heaven". As the "comedy", who is Marilyn Monroe, Russell is very effective, pointing her as a well-depressed, but sincere mermaid. He plays well together with Michael Emil as Einstein, who is excellent at least said. It looks like the party is admirable, and while Theresa Russell does not look exactly like Monroe, it certainly is attractive enough to make the ring really true. Other players are adequate if they are not arrested as Emil and Russell. A very easy, intelligent script is run well by Roeg, but certainly not brilliant, like "Walkabout" or "Performance". As in Roeg's film, he tends to rely too much on the waves, insubstantial revolvers, which adds a lot to the movie. In many ways the film would work better like a shorter (say, 60 minutes), more modest pieces. Still, a quite acceptable, film film. At times quite excellent, but a bit lacking in general. Rating: - *** 1/2 / *****
