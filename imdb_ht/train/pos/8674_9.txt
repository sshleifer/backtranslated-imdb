Tis is a very typical Tom and Jerry short - is a situation that occurs, conflicts arise and destruction from here. The characters behave in the proper manner, the natural tensions between various characters lead to general chaos. The best (and funniest) party is when peace treaty is in force and respected-all wonderful wonders appear before your eyes. A word of warning-it's most wise to allow Tom to help you do your morning cleaning routine! Very recommended.
