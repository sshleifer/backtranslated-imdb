I get tired of 4 and 5 year old daughter I'm still undergoing looking at Nickelodeon, Disney and the likes. It all seems to be the old old cartoon tired rehashed over and over again. When my daughters were unable to attend just this afternoon because one of them was sick, I wanted them to just relax and rest for a while. I flipped the TV over and in searching for something different, I flipped the channels. My fingers stopped the navigation bridges this moment I heard Harvey's voice. I worship every single thing clearly that man did and when I saw that he made voice-over work for a duck ... well, I could not change the channel! My daughters were immediately mesmerized by the drawing and more we watched the show too, the more I grew up to love it with the message being described. It is not necessarily an opponent of "gay rights" but rather for anyone who has ever been ostracized as a child to everyone. I had friends who had collected for one thing or another .... too fat, too thin, too feminine, being a bully, was not smart enough, only having one parent .... his name! Kids, as a rule, can be very cruel to each other so I was happy to see an entertaining cartoon that actually transmits a LIFE MESSAGE to its audience. My girls are already accepting others as they are and are not choosing to different people. My older daughter actually stands up for her friends if they're taking on (one happens to be a single mom and this girl has been choosing so often - she warm my heart when Kassie stands for her! ). > <br /> So, those of you who are condemning this show because you feel that it's an advocate for "gay rights" or being forced to "accept certain views", you clearly and completely miss this point little little drawing. <br /> But if you need it explains .... well, you need more help than any TV show could ever offer.
