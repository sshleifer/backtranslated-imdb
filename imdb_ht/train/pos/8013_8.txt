Yes, it's another great Muppet movie movie and I worship them all; The characters, the films, the TV episodes show (it's the best comedy or TV music show ever) and all the artists behind it. But here are made such a rare fatal error and I'm sure talking about the weird end !! I think it's very dangerous to involve so much, in American drama, and end up a love affair by marriage !! We, as all the poor viewers, feel free or maybe happy for the absence of its annoyance, and misery! So we all enjoy the stories that pick up 2 lovely heroes like couples in love without the legitimate bail like Mickey Mouse and Minnie, Superman and Lois Lane, Dick Tracy and Tess, etc. So with all of the couples First and foremost, I bet that you feel safe, tranquil and peaceful. Therefore, when you look at what the musicians in this movie have already made you will be as mad like me! <br /> The weakest creature (Kermit) married her everyday nightmares, the most steamy legs (Miss Piggy)! This is a historic change by American entertainment industry measurements! And it was very normal to have a negative impact on the audience who just refused to bless or believe or was satisfied with this sudden marriage (even the pathetic frog did not have the time or the opportunity to think right or decide anything! ). Therefore, do not be surprised at all when you know that this film is one of the most severe Cinematic failures, grossing only 25 million vis-a-vis 65 million earned by the first one (Muppet movie in 1979 the) five years earlier !! <br /> <br /> Simply in this movie have taken Manhattan, and my rest too!
