At first you think of another Disney movie, it might be good, but it's a movie movie. But when you look at it, you can not help but enjoy it. All ages will love this movie. I saw this first movie when I was 10 and now 8 years later I still love it! Danny Glover is superb and could not play the party any better. Christopher Lloyd is hilarious and is perfect for the party. Tony Danza is so credible as Mel Clark. You can not help but enjoy this movie! I give it a 10/10!
