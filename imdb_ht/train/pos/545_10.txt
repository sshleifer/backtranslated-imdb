Sequels hardly ever lived up to the original. This definitely proves true in this case. However, if you're a big fan of the original than definitely give this a look. Although the camera work is missing, Brian Krause's character is annoying, and the plot is clickable, it's much funnier than the first and that's what I get fun about. <br /> <br /> Do not see this movie awaiting the same performance as in the first movie. Quite frankly it's a bit different. Rather than sitting in his writing cabinets scriptplays, Stanley is off in Hollywood trying to direct his dream project, Cabin by the Lake. This movie has a lot different feel but it's still great to see Stanley back in action. <br /> I give it a 6 out of 10.
