The Devil Dog: The Hell Hound is really good movie. It has good act by the cast including Richard Crenna and R.G. Armstrong.The music is spooky and gives that frost decay! I loved the effects on the dog and I think the animal itself looked really cool with its horns, frill like the part of his neck, it really acts gummy! If you love horror movies and have not seen the Devil Dog: The Hell Hound before and they can find and buy this movie so that's why it's because it's a good movie and I do not think you'll be disappointed!
