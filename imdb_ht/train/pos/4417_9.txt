This film is a lyrical and romantic biography said in an eye of an eleven old boy living in a rural urban city in the Castro revolution. It's an obviously deserved task to love. <br /> The names CUBA Libre and Cuban without them simply trying to get rid of this as a movie action. DURING JULIA makes much sense. It has more in common with European cinema than RAMBO and the revolution is merely an inconvenience in everyday life and human life's activities. This fact alone makes the film more honest than most works related to this time period in Cuban history. <br /> <br /> The excessive use of the voice-over narrator makes the story story, but the film makes up for it and qualifies from the Hollywood movie that says so much more visually than the narrator could. The comparisons of CINEMA PARADISO and are just games as the movie makes melancholy wax on movies, but there is a hidden pain in the loss of an unsurpassed life loss love. <br /> <br /> The revolution, like Julie in the movie, never seems to have an end.
