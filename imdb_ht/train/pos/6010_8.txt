"Zabriskie Point" (1970): This was especially interesting to me on a personal level, since it takes place in identical circumstances, with identical mates, in my own life ?? The Culture Culture Movement at late / early 60's, over and over campus. We follow two young people related to separate stories, which slowly knit together. One is a young man in Los Angeles, tired of all endless, pseudo-revolutionary jabber in the classroom and the grandmother of his campus, and, the other, a young woman driving Phoenix to see her dad & boss, and take on a " creation "works. The movie is full of our Italian director (Michelangelo Antonioni) visual notices in America, and, confused, psychedelicrazies in this self-righteous era, "we know it all, we will change everything for the best" genes them. Just what is the "revolutionary"? What really means? Do you dress like one and walk around singing? Do you "fly to the bottom of the radar", but give notice notice of your arrival? Do you keep your plan yourself, and go about the business of change, with no need for approval groups? "Zabriskie Point" is definitely a "piece piece" - full of jargon, uniform, momentary film film (after all, this is a movie by the man who gave us amazing "blow up" in 1966), and era affair there, but it is more. It presents options for cultural revolution, and goes by Antonioni (who seems to be the support of it), the teens are too self-involved to see what is needed for radical success. Therefore, it becomes a powerful, scary movie that applies to anyone, any time, anywhere.
