Although the plot was somewhat creamy at times, and very run to the end, as if the director had run out of his alloted time and needed to hurry up and finish the story, in general it was very good for doing- for-the-Backwoods -Table-TV genre. <br /> However, the actress who played the babysitter, Mariana Klaveno, was very good! I hope to see more of it around in film-country. The music was also well-done, getting every possible cold from dah-DUH-dah-DUH (thinking "JAWS") of music-based tension build-ups. <br /> I do not think I'd want to watch "While the kids sleep" again, but if I did, it should focus on the performance of the talent Klaveno.
