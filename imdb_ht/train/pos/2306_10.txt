Never heard of the Man on the Moon until he saw it last evening on this HDTV channel. Look, my taste is like everyone else, eclecticism. My favorites ran from Velvet Blue to the Dr. Strangelove Ghost and Ms. Muir arrive at the Wizard of Oz and love one, eraserhead, rest, and spy at. It's superb, a gentle heart, happy and tragic movie, very well-filmed, one of which the actors really live at this moment rather than acting. This sweet story shortly will be in our private libraries. This beautiful story of life in a distant era of Louisiana in rural areas literally transports you to its pastoral environment. <br /> It's hard to stay stoic during the last movie's moments, particularly when the girl at the greatest extent she seduces the sister to private pains and forgives. Rather than robbing the fun or making you sobs and my dull lawsuits, will end now with the suggestion from someone who enjoys the movie that speaks in the heart of us. <br /> If you buy no other movie, please buy Man in the Moon. This moving story is one you will enjoy reliving time and again. It's a joy and a gem, a movie all too rare in this world of hearts. <br /> <br /> Simple virtues are avoided in the Moon Man is a joy to see.
