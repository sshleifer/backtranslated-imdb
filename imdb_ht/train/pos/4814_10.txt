I saw that on the big screen and were included with it. The period of Queen Victoria's younger years is a mystery and this is a perfect description of how a young girl shot in one of the tallest roles in the world. The script is perfect, the act is amazing, the story and attention to detail is out of this world. Emily Blunt is perfect as Victoria. Funny how her mother was played by Elizabeth 1st and William IV played by Prince Albert! (Think Blackadder). This Victoria painting shows that she was a rebel girl once - I'm sure she would have been on Jeremey Kyle Show if she was around then: "My mother and her boyfriend are trying to steal my life." A perfect piece of an important part of British history and the Commonwealth.
