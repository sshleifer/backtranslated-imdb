I found on the film "Hole" not heard from those who did not Disney Disney, that both children and adults were both in the story. Folks, let me tell you I was not disappointed. "Hole" based on the novel by Louis Sachar and followed the adventure of Stanley Yelnats, a boy who came to a jungle eventually detained from the desert. He befriends a boy nicknamed zero and together they put out on life-changing adventure. It was a very interesting, unique, different and funny story. I did not know exactly what to expect when I watched it. It was interesting to see the story coming together as a piece of puzzle. The boys who played the juvenile offenders were all very funny and Jon Voight was just hilarious as Sir Sir. Now that I've seen the movie I have to read the book. Most recommended!
