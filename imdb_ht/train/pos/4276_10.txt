At first sight, Who's Singing There Just seems to be an absurd and excellent comedy ?? and only a kind of weird, quiet and slow motion: what a mistake! <br /> Start with two musicians on a desert scenery, then a bus with a wonderful bunch of actors and hidden a gem! <br /> <br /> The story folded, with a fake rhythm provoked you to think, yes it is funny, but just lets you guess it will be a gentle type of movie. <br /> <br /> Not all: very funny not instant, dark subtle cynic on others, surprises its development altogether the story ?? Very common and cleverly presented, all the characters are important, and the actors give them full life. <br /> <br /> And what is amazing, it's based on deep observations, great mastery of the camera work and has a great significance, and really everything, the general direction and how the details are presents, that he simply makes you forget about it in a movie: it is like to watch a kind of human society you do not know, shot by a friend behind a camera. <br /> And you are the one behind her. It's simple, and simply outstanding! <br /> Do not understand me; in no way that would mean the script, the quality of pictures, the music note has a kind of amateur way, no, no! It's great art! <br /> Because it flows like a river ?? From the big up mountain, down to the sea, with all the different sort of strips and peregrinations that a real river will face on its tour of the sea ?? from a small thing to a mainstream. <br /> This metaphorical image I've used is the best way I can get to explain all the charm that has been Singing Over Gen. For me, again, I take the hammer: simply exceptional ... <br /> I saw that the Director is the one who made Chat Blanc / Chat Noir, which I know is quieter famous ?? But as I did not see it, I had no idea about this man. <br /> <br /> There are other reviews dithyrambical writing on that movie, I completely agree! <br /> <br /> European Eastern Cinema is not well known because rarely translated, but I'm lucky to have this one example in the original language, with good English translation. All in all: deep, delicious and exceptional ... <br /> For fast and empty exploding quality and special effects amateurs, avoiding it at any cost, it can be too subtle and good for you! > <br /> But if you're interested in different styles and / or classic, I guess you will not regret this one, and in the case of buying, it will have good company in your personal DVD library, and these are not less than worthy names such as Billy Wilder, Lubitsch, or Sacha Guitry amongst some of my preferred directors. At least for this movie! A movie is never really good unless the camera is an eye to head a poet Orson Welles ***
