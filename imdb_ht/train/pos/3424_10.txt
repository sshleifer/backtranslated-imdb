The psychological trauma that soldiers suffer while engaging in war and struggling to return to civilian life. They do not just change or affect, they are different people and most do not know how to deal with it as they do not know themselves. <br /> <br /> Finally, this movie shows what the military makes our young men in the woman get ready for war and the rules and practices that they have to follow in pursuit of warfare that leads to all psychological trauma la. <br /> <br /> We have over 3000 dead soldiers in four years of invasion; but we have many tens of thousands who will suffer from physical and psychological trauma throughout life because of this war. It does not matter where you are, it is supposed to know the price of the war to decide whether we should be in this business. This movie shows the cost of men and women perfectly.
