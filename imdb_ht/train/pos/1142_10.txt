until HBO started reappearing this month. I remember laughing loudly at the theater back in 1991, and now again in my living room. If I see it over, I have to watch it. There's just no question. This is more fun in my past, more popular parody like Airplanes! (which I really like, BTW). Cathy Moriarty steals the show in my opinion. Quotes like "sudden speech! The last symptoms of brain fever! It could blow at any moment!" put me on the edge. And Whoopie Goldberg was not this funny since Jack Jumpin ''. Kevin Klein, Sally Field, Robert Downey Jr. all turn into superb performance as expected. I started out to give this 9 out of 10 stars, but then I realized that for his movie type is supposed to be, there is not one thing I would change or improve on. So, 10 is. I have to get this on DVD, it's just all there in it.
