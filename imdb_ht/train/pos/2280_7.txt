Hard to categorize the movie - maybe it's a Garde Adventure Adventure adventure? Mother Night is a very good Vonnegut woman, and most certainly one of her easier novels fits into a feature film film. Adaptation to film is very loyal to the original book. The "Indie" approach to how this film was produced is probably more effective than having a great Hollywood studio funding. These days, I doubt an intelligent woman like Mothers Night would never get the green light from the great Hollywood grindhouses. And normally that's too bad, but not in that case. Mother night has tight directions and a solid cast. Nick Nolte seems to become the best roles as he gets older, still has the "everyman" character that allows him to take on a variety of different characters. Sheryl Lee is beautiful and big as always. I always thought she deserved better than she was from the entertainment industry. I guess your first one as a Dead Girl (Twin Pics) and when little time is not the rollercoaster, even if the TV show gets a minor phenomenon. Anyway, this movie is totally enjoyable and you do not need to read the book to understand the movie. In fact, today's political reality, citing the romance can be dating, and some low-viewing viewers in history will be completely confused by the unfolding events (I speak with you, fellow Americans who have the highest score and score The bar of industrialized world of geography, history, and Lord knows what other subjects!).
