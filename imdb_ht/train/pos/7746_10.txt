Those of you who know the band DEUS, know the lead singer Tom Barman. She has directed this film somewhat like creating music, it's a mix of everything. This is a comedy, though mostly absurd and cynical, a drama, none of the main characters have a happy life to say at least, and it does not really have a goal. The movie begins on a morning Friday in Antwerp, Belgium, with several scenes, some of them have nothing to do but will come in contact with each other during the day and night. There are several main characters: a teacher writing his own book, a young researcher and a morbid taste of his death with his sister, a gallery owner, two young men still in contact with the law, a man who works in a theater theater with two young women. Throughout the film a man with something to do with wind. All characters have the problems, and their family or friends or just and life itself. <br /> <br /> The movie is set in Antwerp and shows several beautiful shots in the city and the port. The events of the day are not easy to explain, I am advised to simply watch the movie, there are simply too many sayings. But I can say that, Barman has an excellent use of the camera and uses a lot of music (especially dance music, not really rock) to put an attitude, especially the party is full of excellent music. This movie is an experiment on itself, it will not leave you any wiser about life, perhaps only that you have to live it and not waste it, or you have any fake true moral. <br /> <br /> In short, see it, it's definitely worth it!
