This film is good for what it is, and unpretentious; I would not watch it twice, however: I'm a Peter Cushing completist and that's why I look at her. The best advantage of this film is: BREVITY and EFFECTIVENESS. Compared with other similar movies, it does not steer the legs forever as each of the four segments (plus one) lasts below 30 minutes, and the bottom is below 10. Good vase. In the first segment, horror writers suffer from 'writer blocks' of old home relocation seeking inspiration. He found even too much of it when he began to visualize one of his fictional ants. Draws similar convenience to FIRIAL BURIAL. Good use of the point-of-view score: the writer is getting mentally ill ... or (like the end shows) his trophy wife wants his lover to play along with her husband's fob to drive her mad & security His estates .. will the swirling swimmer survive to enjoy the fruit of his inventive mind? <br /> <br /> In the second segment of long-lost friends get together in the same lonely old house, but can not seem to help visit a rare museum horror featuring the wax statue of the long lost love of young people, who were once divorced. From the gothic musical keeper to learn the woman is described as a dead dog that has many murderers ... or was it? The third segment was less interesting to me. Fourth shows a movie cinema actor - who thinks it is the best of all-dripping in the bottom of budget C budget. Finding a costume lending more credible to her fictional vampires, she becomes the real deal. This segment lacked solidarity from the first two. <br /> <br /> Actress is just, and the initial 2 segments that contribute much to it. Good movie, take with a single tablet. Not Cushing's best, nor Lee ... but worth watching.
