I can only agree with taximeter that this is a fantastic movie and should be seen by a wide audience. The imagination of display, visual interpretation of the script, the humor is always surprising. The two drivers are great and really carry the movie. My advice should not even look at a trailer, just rent the movie and watch without waiting. I rented from blockbuster, so it is available in Brisbane, not everyone will enjoy it but I think most people will have an opinion and that's always good, unless it's just 'what's stupid.' I liked this movie, you just do not get to see the gem like this everyday. This should become a favorite cult. Give it a try, you can just feel the same way about it as I do.
