This would have been a classic fire to make sure they chose ANIMALS before John Abraham. This guy is a terrible actor. Be it comedy, drama, tumultuous-etc. etc. It feels. It seemed like at some point Priyadarshan realized this too, and pretty much he was jumping around like a monkey in order to make his scene solo a bit funny. It is only the apparent drawback (there is a couple more bothered tid-bits) in an otherwise hilarious movie ABSOLUTELY. Best comedy comes together in Bollywood since Hungama, IMO. Like Hungama, he is a state-of-the-art comedy carrying on the shoulders of a brilliant and of course scenario, Akshay Kumar. This is probably the best performance it's up to date. It's best to be a shoe-for best comedy at every premium function. AND is always good at comedy, but it takes it to a different level here. Body language, facial expressions and just ways to deliver each line. It's a engineering performance. The packed theater went black for the very beautiful whole length of the movie and I do not think I've ever seen such an atmosphere for a Bollywood movie here in USA. <br /> <br /> Garam Masala does not have one "lead" heroine. It's incredibly HOT 3 stars stars that I thought made a fairly good job. Just make sure they do all the debuts. Paresh Rawal is solid as usual, although the routine has expelled itself after a while. Rajpal Yadav is typical self annoying (sick of over-the-top acts of each film). Rimi Sen has nothing to do. <br /> <br /> Overall, definitely worth a deco. I'd say it's FUNNIER than No Enter, and that's a lot. Maybe they were even better to have chosen someone a little more competent than John Abraham. <br /> 8/10
