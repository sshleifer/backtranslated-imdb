This photograph was prohibited in American cinema houses in 1930 because of nudity by Hedy Lamarr (Eva Hermann) that caused all kinds of problems among the ladies in the 1930s, but not so much for the male population. This story concerns a young woman named Eva Hermann who is married to an older man and has brought on the threshold of the wedding night and the husband never consumes the wedding and worries about all sorts of very petty things like shoes he kills bugs. Eva leaves her husband's house and lives with her father and tries to explain her situation. On a hot summer day Eve took a ride on her horse and decided to go for a nude swim in a lake in the woods. Her horse ran and chased her and was watched by a young man who found her clothes and returned to Eva. These two people become very familiar and have a romance that begins to flourish. There are many more interesting issues that occur as you see this movie at its very end. Enjoy a great classic movie that was a shocker movie in 1933. Enjoy.
