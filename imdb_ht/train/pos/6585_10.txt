After seeing Jeremy Brett as Sherlock Holmes, no actor should ever have this viewpoint as imagining that he might ever come close to presentation Mr. The board of "one of the most interesting characters in literature". Jeremy Brett IS Sherlock Holmes and in my opinion I can not have any other. The great actor Basil Rathbone is, I must admit, a second but close but still second. One might argue that merely Mr Rathbone was inferior to the top-level productions to Mr. Brett and this I would agree. However when they all said and did Jeremy Brett is still and forever the actor only really "gets" Sherlock Holmes. The book should be closed on this subject and we, the public, let them enjoy Mr.Brett's unique performance. <br /> <br /> Bill Rogers <br /> <br /> (sonarman65@yahoo.com)
