WOW! This movie is the best live test, I think, of what happened on 9-11-01 in NYC, compared to anything shown in larger media outlets. Outlets can only show you what happened on the outside. This movie shows you what happened on the INSIDE. <br /> It starts with a focus on a New York rookie fireman, waiting for the first week of the great fire that he will call for fighting. The subject has a significantly and only existing PHOTO in the first aircraft to hold. Then you give a front-row seat as the firefighters to squeeze the scene, in the group of Tower One. <br /> In the minutes before the crash of the second plane, and the fall of the next Tower, you see firefighters react to the uncertainty sound of people landing above the group. It is an eye you will not quickly forget. <br /> <br /> Heart-ranged, worn-earthquakes, and very compelling from the first minute of the latest, "9/11" deserve down to history as one of the best documentary films ever performed <br /> <br /> We should never forget. <br /> <br />
