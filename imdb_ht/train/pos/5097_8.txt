This is a very rare and probably less known film in the Shirley Temple as it is not about any of her collections. The reason why is probably because it does not have a happy ending, unlike any other movie. It's also not a music, although it's belting out a song called 'the world must be a living'. This film was born in 1934 and originally in black and white, the version I have in color and on VHS, I'd say they did a fine job as the color to look realistic, unlike I would say the colorful films in Laurel And Hardy who is obnoxious. The film is good for her age and the story does not have to date at all, I'm surprised that no one has tried to make a rumor. At the time the movie is a little talk like some of the scenes and Gary Cooper and Carole Lombard seem really dragged out, in some scenes they seem to take fifteen minutes to say what they can say in five. Despite not be put into this because this movie has some really good moments in it, especially when {Jerry} Ga Ry Cooper steals a collar, and hides it in Shirley's teddy bear. The tension and slow build up to his actions, {while at the same time his daughter is singing at an audience in a other room} is very well directed. Gary and Caroles tart facial expressions when placed under the investigations are also very good.In all this is a girl I'm fine from the early 30, accept it for his age.
