Preston Waters, a 11 year old boy, has problems with his parents and their brothers especially because of money problems. He's crazy having his own home and his own rules, since his brother still steals money saved and his parents neglected his will. One day terrible, Preston rode his bike; It was the same day that the villain of the story, Quigley, was trying to scape out of the police and accidentally ran the car on Preston's bike. When you need them away from the police, Quigley gives in a hurry, a check to cover the damage to Preston's bike. The problem was: It was an empty check! Preston is a smart boy and decides to have a great deal on this check: 1 million dollars! All of this gave Preston things that he always wanted for, like a castle and pool, lots of games, and even a limousine! The problems begin to start when the FBI and Quigley want to know where the money is, making Preston in a difficult situation and facing many issues. <br /> <br /> This movie was one of my favorites during my kids. :)
