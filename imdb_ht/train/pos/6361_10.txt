I hastened to anticipate the opening of this film for several months. Being a great Jim Carrey fan, I easily see how he could morph himself into Grinch Seuss' and make his own character. I was not disappointed. <br /> <br /> This movie was the best of magic. Carrey is a master in his trade and no one could play the role of perfection as he did. There was plenty to enjoy for both adults and children resembling this movie is sure to become a timeless classic for everyone to enjoy in the years to come. I already have the vision of my teenage daughter sitting over years after years to watch this video remake, and I undoubtedly watch with her and laugh as I did the first time I saw her. <br /> <br /> Clearly, this movie has Jim Carrey written all over it, and I do not think it would come along without him. However, the support cast was good and fun in their own right, most notably Taylor's teenage momsen who was the perfect paper for Carrey's antique. The set design, music notes and suit all lentils are in a magic, fabulous finished product and I believe all involved can be proud. <br /> It's not an easy feat to turn a 22 minute minute cartoon into a movie full movie action movie, but Howard has succeeded with flying colors. For those who do not agree, maybe your heart is 2 sizes too small.
