Farrah Fawcett is superb in this powerful 1986 drama, where she plays Marjorie, a woman who managed to escape the clutches of a rapist. Well done Farrah for being a Best Comedy Golden Globe candidate. When Joe Vydi (terrificly played by James Russo) came into his home, which he shared with two rooftops (which easily came out!), Marjorie has to play along with Joe's fear paired quest. It makes for some disturbing and shocking images! <br /> <br /> When her roommate comes home, they are surprised (say the least) by Marjorie's action, with a great performance by Alfre Woodard who desperately tries to persuade Marjorie to do the right thing and turn it around, In the police, make the movie even more nail-biting. <br /> I found Diana Scarwid quite disappointing, but when Joe finally admitted that he came there to kill them all, he made the movie a very emotional piece of true drama. <br /> <br /> In general, extreme is a brilliant thought-out and well-acting movie and I have to watch it hundreds of times by now! Well done everyone involved.
