I love movies like this for their minds, no pun intended. It's a decent, own movie on a baseball team that falls behind, and a young fan wants to win to win, since her deadbeat father said it was the only way she would go back to him. The spirit shines in two ways: A funny cast with Danny Glover and a young Joseph Gordon-Levitt, and the German in the sky, take the dynamic shape of Christopher Lloyd. It's an energetic movie. It gets you smile, and really involves you in the sport. <br /> <br /> In my lies claws. The only thing that kind of my bugs is these sporting movies that kind of turn you into an inexperienced fan of the team. There's absolutely nothing wrong with that. I just get it odd that I should be away from the movie Thinking Angels are a strong, cool, really, when my loyal base, like it, lies with the Toronto Blue Jays. It's interesting, really. If it's just a movie about an outdated childhood team, then it's okay.
