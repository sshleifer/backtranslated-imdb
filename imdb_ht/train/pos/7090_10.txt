A linear trip in a non-linear structure. It is a reality this time, in 12 monkeys, flows to this come-and-forth between present, future and past. However, the film linearite can not be avoided: it works much of the projector, unfolding in the narrative. <br /> <br /> What we can see that the temporal temperament is a reflection of the inevitability of our actions. The world of Terry Gilliam's movie is a world of free space-free space. Right from the beginning we are informed of a schizophrenic prophecy, according to which an epidemic could rule the Earth in 1997, forcing some survivors to live underground - the only place not affected by the virus. <br /> <br /> The mission of the Cole (Willis) is clear: returning to the 90's to investigate whatever and anyone with respect to the release of viruses. There is no way to change the past: all that can be done is to pick up information that can help scientists in the present (which, for our viewers, is the future) to get the healing. Do not change what happened (the past is inevitable), but makes the presenter better. In "returning" it in time, Cole gradually comes near a striking dilemma: his life in the past is better than his life in the present. <br /> <br /> The latter is black and dehumanizing, controlled by totalitarian scientists who choose "volunteer" (this is incisively ironic) embark on their journey in the past. <br /> The scientists have not yet reached the highest level of achievement of time travel, and Cole ends up on wrong date - this will be, later in the draw, works as a proof of his sanity for Kathryn's psychiatrist ( Stowe). We can see, through the evolution of the story, that linearite and non linear collar in a temporal circular. <br /> <br /> There are more than one hour of that stage which is the first and end up being the last - and certainly the climate - appears. He modifies himself, according to the evolution of Cole's memory, which comes to his dreams. <br /> At an airport, a man was shot dead while running, armed, toward another. A blond woman runs after the murdered one. This is the scene that connects the past (in which Cole is a kid who visits the airport and her parents), the present (the time of the narrative) and the future (Teen Cole) throughout the narrative, Cole There is a feeling that he has already lived the reality he has now. His prophetic dreams are the proof that it is impossible to escape or avoid what has happened. The agents who shot him stopped him from killing the mad scientist, Dr. Peters (Morse), who is responsible for the dissemination of the disease. <br /> <br /> What can not change. And, in Cole's case, what was going to be. Inside. <br /> A movie is not quite well understood for many. For me, there is nothing less than a masterpiece. Other movies and similar themes: Back to future trilogy (with another angle regarding the character "Crazy Scientist", and although it shares the atmosphere of rotten - especially in the second film - It's way more optimistic than Gilliam's work, that's an odd Hollywood photo). In another register, there are "wild strawberries", one of the Bergman's princes, involved in a striking and infamous journey through the past of dreams and reminiscences. <br /> I never looked "La Jet√©e", but only because I can not find it.
