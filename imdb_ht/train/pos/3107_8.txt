Select just after the Moscow-Showdown in Sipremasi, this is Bourne's greatest adventure with her final point. During the whole, the 115-min-exile film takes Bourne from Russia, Madrid, Paris, Morocco and finally New York. Damon is every inch of the tough assassin trained Robert Ludlum to imagine, he is the most deadly spyware in the movies now, and his emotions suffer his character that makes him so credible, and it's exactly the way fine Damon managed to combine these two polar-opers in his head that's so grandiose. In the third, Bourne is on a mission to save his soul and watching it, Ultimatum delivers such a high-octane performance that you will find yourself sweating and gasping on its really powerful branches of mind and pull- compromise; just watch out for two big-car chases and a realistic battle scene as Bond vs Shaw back to '63. The greengrass director has surpassed himself with this suspended thriller and this is probably as exciting as movies movies found; a true pay-off for Bourne fans and a new breed of spy-driven standards.
