Jake's Closet has emotional power at Kramer vs. Kramer combined with the imagination of Pan's maze. Even in the beginning special effects seem to give a nod to Pan's maze. But this is a story that takes place in modern times, not sixty years ago and in that way it has even more resonance today. Jake's Closet is about a boy, a child only, practically alone on summer vacation, to deal with his family falling apart. It's a horror movie like the others and Sixth's essence, a horror movie for those who think. If you are looking for a slasher movie, this will not be your cup of tea, but if you are looking for a story that both touches and thrills and good acting, this is the movie for you. In the screening I had seen, I swore a moment when the audience called all. I highly recommend catching this movie.
