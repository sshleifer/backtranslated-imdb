This, and the "hidden fortune" are the favorite Kurosawa for me. I do not get out 10 as candy, but this certainly deserves it, if anything. Though it is very good (as all Kurosawa's very beautiful) it deals with the problem that my bugs and most of its films; The storyline is often too loose and slowly highlights, with the necessary scenes or just lenghtened too much without any real-life scenario or character description. Dodeukaden delivers me the same experience as for example "hidden fortune" made; Although its length, was not a single minute I'd cut out. This is also a very unusual film Kurosawa in a way, it has no storyline but very little independent stories that are based more on the character's description than scenario, unlike any other Kurosawa movie I've seen too far. It also leans very much on the dialogue, which it uses glossy (especially in the story between the father and the son planned "new home"). <br /> Always the thing that makes this one a prince is how the subject was so tragic as it is, is managing to be described so humane and sympathetic, without pointing any finger at any point . From the beginning to the end it delivers the emotional scale of laughter and tears in perfect balance.
