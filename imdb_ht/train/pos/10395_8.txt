A fantastic Saudi adventure. An ancient king, Ahmad, and his best friend, robbed Abu (played by Sabu in Black Narcissus) search for Ahmad's love interest, which was stolen by the new king, Jaffar (Conrad Veidt). There's hardly a moment down here. He always invented new adventures for the heroes. Personally, I found Ahmad and his Princess a little boring (there's no need to ask why Jan Justin, who plays Ahmad, listed fourth in the credits). Conrad Veidt, always a fun actor, makes a big villain, and Sabu is a lot of fun as the prince of robbers, who at one point find a genius in a bottle. I also really liked Miles Malleson as Sultan of Basra, the father of the Princess. It collects amazing toys from around the world. Jaffar bribes him for his daughter's hand and a flying mechanical horse. This probably would count as one of the big kids films of all time, but the special effects are horribly dated nowadays. Kids will certainly derelict the images superimposed when Abu and their genes are on the screens together. And the scene with the giant spider looks especially awful. Although most of the younger generation probably thinks that King Kong looks bad at this point in time, Willis O'Brien's stop-motion animation is one thousand times better than a puppet on a string that does not even look remotely like a spider. 8/10.
