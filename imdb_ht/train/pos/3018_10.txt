This movie is an exception to the rule that an end is worse than the original. Its comedy at its best. This film is a quick action slapstick action where something seems to happen every second. In more than one occasion all the audience laughed loudly in a joke. It is a great advantage to have seen the movie first, but not a requirement. <br /> GÃ¶ta Kanal 2 also has the advantage of being a parody about the last decade reality TV series such as survivor (expediton: Swedish Robinson) This is a Swedish film for the Swedish audience. So do not see it if you are not familiar with Sweden and its languages. Otherwise: Have fun! Johan
