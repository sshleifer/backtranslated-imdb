This film is so misunderstood that it's not funny. If you think to see this one to shoot them .. be clear. This one faced with the effects and trauma that survivors must maintain. Even the detectives are looking for the answer we all ... WHY? The fantastic act of leading ladies as we see the people we ignore are affected by the same things we are affiliated with. Yes the language is difficult at times, but it suits the characters well. There are some loose leaves left or unanswered, but all movies have them. The biggest problem was faced with this movie making a great statement about how all of us adults feel after these major incidents. Highly recommended for adolescents and adults.
