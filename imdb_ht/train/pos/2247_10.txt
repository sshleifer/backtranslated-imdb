I'm disappointed in the lack of posts about this film surprising and effective little. Jordi Mollà, probably best known for his role as Diego's Ted "Blow" to write, direct, and star. I will not give away any draw points, such as the movie (at least for me) was very interesting to not know anything about it. If you have a netflix account, or have access to a video store that might bring it ... I highly recommend it. It's a crazy, fun, and sometimes thought many provocative creations. Mollà's direction is * quite * impressive and shows a lot of promises. The great lead performance of the beautiful Spanish "No Nadi" (God on Air) is an amazing movie you can show to your friends.
