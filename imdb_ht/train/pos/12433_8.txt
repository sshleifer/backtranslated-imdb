This is a good movie, although people familiar with the modest Blaise comics and books can find it a little slower and lacking in action. For the Modesty fan, the film will be very enjoyable, particularly because it is very loyal to its presentation of Blaise's "storytelling". Peter O'Donnell is in their credit list as "Creative Consultant" and the movie makers must actually pay attention to how the plot keeps tight details that are presented in the comic books over the years {although events have been abolished modern day). The only thing that the true fan can find disappointing is that there is no Willie Garvin in the story. Lack of Willie is again just the faithful of Blaise Modena's chronology since the film takes place in the early days of Modesty's career. Alexandra Staden makes a very credible youth modesty that actually looks much like Modesty is supposed to look. A change is welcomed from the travesti to the Monesty Monitti Vitti painting in Modesty.
