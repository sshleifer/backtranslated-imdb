In what is a really diverse cast, show this hit it in stride on FOX. It is the kind of sitkon that grows up to you. If you just watch 1 show you may not like it very much, but once you look at two or three - you get hooked. <br /> This is because some of the jokes are hit and some lack depending on how you see them. As is usual today, the terms are very mature. The humor is usually very mature too. Often the most common parts are parties where mature themes collide with these innocents. <br /> <br /> Red (Kurtwood Smith) a veteran actor has made some kind of very good humor on this show. Debra Jo Rupp plays well in this set of cast. Danny Masterson, the oldest actor of the "kids" is also very good. Laura Prepon (Donna) looks best in the earliest shows as a natural breed (which has the idea of ​​making it a blonde?). It shows very good talent & comedy distribution frequently. It looks good without doing too. <br /> This is one of the best entries on FOX in the sitcom's department and it's the most successful action single action since getting married
