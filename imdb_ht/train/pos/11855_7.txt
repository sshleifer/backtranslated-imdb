Wow. Something in a surprise. Though flawed, it is far better than I hope. Arcturus's new lane space brand with some 3,000 passengers is in the last days of sixteen days of his trip to Jupiter. Without warning, the cerebral boat (central computer) sounds a disaster alarm and everyone orders to evacuate. <br /> <br /> Soon, there are only a handful of inhabitants including one of the pirate astrologers (penny), the captain (Cary), and the director of the shipping line (Kenyon). <br /> <It looks like the alarm was false and that the main cerebral is acting <br /> <br /> isregulated. The remaining riders and crews must escape the ship and <br /> avoid personal conflicts in order to survive. The movie starts out very well. The opening commercial is a very nice touch. There is parallel evidence in 2001: A Space Odyssey and the historic <br /> down to the Titanic. The movie slowed at times and met the problem, but it is generally well done and well-acting.
