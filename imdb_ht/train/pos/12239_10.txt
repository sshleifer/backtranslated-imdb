Excellent mascarade! Which, of course, is all it is designed to be. Fortunately, there is no social or political message, or the slightest attempt in that direction. Is drawn to actually take, or to take place at any particular time or place? Easy, for, after all, this is merely, simply, a movie, and spring movies from imagination, not out of reality. The only purpose of this film is to entertain, certainly not educated, and enjoying it, and delightfully realistic and lightheartedly over the wind. I think most would agree that from our documentary we expect Enlightenment and authenticity. But for entertainment I want what nowadays describe as a "no-brainer," which the Mating game is in every respect. For a few chuckles and a laugh outright now and then, this is good price fantasy.
