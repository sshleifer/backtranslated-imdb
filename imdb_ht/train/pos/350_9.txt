I wanted to see Valentine ever since I saw that Denise Richards and Marley Shelton were in it because they played in some of my favorite movies ever. When I looked Valentine, I was amazed at how big the story line actually was. He killed me to see that he had a low rating because it was not terrible at all. Actors and actresses played the beautiful parties and the way it ended was so brilliant and cunning. Some scenes were a bit incredible or poor, and I admitted to a few minor parts he got just a little boring, but in general he was not suspicious and thrilling. It has an idea-twisted story line that has guided you all the way through and does not deserve all the crap it gets. I recommend this movie to watch anytime, but especially on Valentine's Day because it's sure to give you a ton of thrill. Oh, and do not even pay attention to the trailer OR rating, please DO NOT ...
