The inspiring story of Carl Brashear (Cuba Gooding, Jr), a black man who grew up in poverty in Kentucky and then along the American Navy, aspiring to be the first black master diver in Navy history. We show series of struggles in boyhood on which Brashear has overcome his dreams come true (and then keep it alive.) Not least of the challenges were Master Diver Bill Sunday (Robert DeNiro), the head coach of the school The Navy's dive sends Brashear, who is not particularly sympathetic to the Brashear goal, but that ultimately becomes an easy friend and supporter. <br /> This is a good movie; fast paced and with a lot of action, although not a "action" pic in the normal sense of the word. There's a very human story here as well, with an interesting study of racism and the fight to overcome it; There is also a sense of the struggle that occurred in the 1960s between the greatest and smaller naval officers (the "old navy" vs. the "new marine".) Their performance is quite good - particularly Goodings'. I thought DeNiro was perhaps a bit on the head of his portrait on Sunday (although, who knows, Sunday might well have been this extreme cannon of loose cats) and the portrait of Gwen's wife Gwen (by Charlize Theron) also made me wonder if these parts were "jazzed up" to entertainment values. But a good movie, though. I never once wondered if it was worth tuning. <br /> <br /> 7/10
