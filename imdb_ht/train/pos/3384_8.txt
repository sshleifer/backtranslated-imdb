My assessment: 8/10 <br /> I like this movie. Compared with today's brainless films (just action with special effects and nothing new to mind), "Soylent Green" asks something today does not exist yet: Think. <br /> Well it would not be a great surprise a day to eat "cookies" that are created with human bodies. And all that happens on this planet, and see how people are so indifferent to all, this kind of future is possible. <br /> <br /> Make sure that this movie takes some years, but the idea behind the movie is current again. Rich in paradise, other in hell. Well a chance today are television and idiocy like "Show Reality". <br /> <br /> TV is a good wash brain. It's pity to see that intelligence in humans does not have the gains like technology. Since writing all stopped. <br /> If you like reality show this movie is not for you. If you believe all politicians as well. If you do not like to ask yourself questions about now and in the near future never watch this movie.
