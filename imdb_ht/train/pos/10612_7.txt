It's cheese, it's crap, it's gross, but that's what makes it so much fun. It was raised on top of the melodramatic moments that are just plain ridiculous. This movie is great to make fun of. Rent it for a good laugh. <br /> <br /> The movie center around three women newscasters, during a long time before cellphones. They go to a small town to cover a festival, but they can not find a room to stay the night. And it's time to meet Ernest Keller. It is climbing into a kind of psycho in style. And he offered to leave home. But he does not tell them the truth about who is there. Stephen Furst's performance is so amazing as the "Unseen", that he really brings this movie. Most of the film is kind of dull, although finding out the truth of Ernest's family is kind of interesting. <br /> Just see the cast of these scenes making it worth a look. Barbara Bach and Doug Barr make good eye candy. <br /> I consider the film an old gem, hard to find and worth a look.
