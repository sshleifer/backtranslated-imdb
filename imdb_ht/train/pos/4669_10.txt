If there were two more good performers than Peter Ustinov and Maggie Smith appearing together in a more good movie in 1968, I do not know who they were. The first time I saw this cute little satirical gem 25 years ago at the age of 16, and I consider any years in which I failed to sit down and watch it again one wasted. It's smart, original, clean, sweet, sweet, gently subversive, and awesome. The novels of these two social misfits are both ridiculously ridiculous and moving - no more so than Maggie Smith's unpleasant attempt to bring up the right card to the deck, a scene of both funny humor and a perfect thumbnail portrait of heartbreaking shadow. And that final freeze-frames on the worry, concerned, love face in Ustinov as he asks, "Are you really?" - Has anyone ever made the look and sound of devotion so perfectly honest naked? I would never want to know anyone who did not like this movie.
