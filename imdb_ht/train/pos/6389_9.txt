Passing stones is definitely one of the best movie comedy ever. You must have a sense of humor to all enjoy this one. This movie for some reason has not received its credit due. First, let's start with everyone in story stories like a good treasure hunt. When a father dies away from the advice of a hidden treasure, he not only brings two family together but begins a tornado adventure. Mixing into a Polish translator, a comet, a crack head and Surround syndrome, a tight homosexual hypnotist, and a queen, money does not only make the world go round, but can turn the enemy family. My favorite character in this movie should make the sister / crack addict and the turret syndrome, burst suddenly burst will have you crying and mimicking for weeks.
