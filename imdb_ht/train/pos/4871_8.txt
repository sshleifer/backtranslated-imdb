It takes a Serbian or at least a familiar Balkan to understand and enjoy much of situations, characters and jokes of 'Zavet' as well as in many other films in Kusturica. Look at the example of the opening scenes, and the remote village of the Serbian mountains, with low tech devices that defended the integrity and way of life of the inhabitants, the nostalgia for the good days of the Communist rule, and the young frat awakening watching her nude teacher in the sound of the Soviet hymn. Kusturica not only tries to leave the tragic story of Serbia described in his previous cinema but creates a whole world of self in the process. This is not a political film or not a clear political film in any case. It's a fun movie before everyone. Kusturica creates a set of characters that we care about. Music plays an active role in this movie as well as all of his other movies. His style is direct and grotesque, we now what it feels about his character, and we know he wants us to feel the same. His space has developed present, history and magic, and the colors seem to be in a modern rousseau Rousseau. <br /> This is not a perfect movie either. The defect of the director is the length, some corrections and shortening were helpful, as at some point in time the director seems to have run out of ideas and repetitions to show up. It is again one of the most catchy, fun, moving movies that I've seen lately.
