How can I possibly pass the chance to see Orlando Bloom and Heath Ledger together? Well, I could not and so, I rent this chaos in a movie. <br /> I never heard of Ned Kelly and was surprised by what I found out about this young man's legend. I was also surprised at how mediocre this movie was. Perhaps the fact that he was very, very late and at the end of a 4-hour movie marathon or maybe it was because it really was a little slow, I found this story hard to follow. Not because the story is complicated, but because it is slow. Even with a slow story, Ledger and Bloom manage to create interesting characters, dimensions. Though I flounder recommend this as a must see, it's a great story of Australian history (considering how young the country is, this is very rare and should be appreciated) and the movie has some good action sequences. <br /> <br /> 6/10 see it for historical value .... (yes right ... and that's the only reason to see it ...;))
