Catscratch is the best thing from Nickeloden, including Wayne Knight. This shows not just appeals to Maoris and the PI. Some people love it and are all exceptional. At first glimpse I admit it looks a little bit, but it grows enormously on you. Also, to correct something that one of the other critics said In_Correct (Tv.com) does not say "Does this mean you're homo right now?" saying "Does this mean you are homo, owww?" This is his phrase in the show. Mr. Blik is, I think, worst of all like the Peww-Weww Playhouse <br /> <br /> Firstly, I'll admit that the early episode was a bit good. But after a while the episodes have become bigger! And just when the series found it in surreal, whacky ... Nickelodeon cancels it! <br /> I know Nick stands for the kids, but every once in a while a brilliant show appears that they can be enjoyed by adolescents and adults. These shows include Mr. Bean's animated series, Charlie Brown, Pelswick, Rocko's modern life (at times), and Zim's occupants. All of these must have been considered too good, with the exception of CatDog, 'cause Nick felt the need to cancel them. <br /> What I like the epic famous episode, where Gordon fights a duck. /> <br /> I would also like to see a DVD, and lots of audio and re-audio reviews, including the final episode. <br /> But of course, what I'd definitely like to see is the show back on the air. Wake up NICK! <br /> I wish there was a list somewhere on the internet with all the credit close gags. It was good.
