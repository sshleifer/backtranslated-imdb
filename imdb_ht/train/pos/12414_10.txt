The first American movie by Renny Harlin was one of the best films in film-filmed film films (such as "House House" or "The Chair") in the late 80s. Many years ago, Guard Lane Smith was imitating a man sentenced. Now he is the chief of the war in the newly re-opened prison, and the man's ghost is back for revenge. This atmospheric and many film moody feature many gore vultures and violence.Viggo Mortensen, Tiny Lister, Tom Everett and Kane Hodder are onhand for the fun carnage.
