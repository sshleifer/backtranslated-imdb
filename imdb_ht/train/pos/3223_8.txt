Ok, basically this is a popcorn sci-fi movie, but from its beginning it is obvious that it has been directed to a great deal of intelligence. You can count on 10 clich√©s that the movie is building up, but it only delivers over to three of them, and a couple of them have a twist to allow you to know once again that the director was not supposed to be a idiot. Acting Kurt Russell is a wonderful superb and brings a deep sense of the suprising and rewarding character. Recommended if you just saw something really stupid, and you want to rebuild your faith!
