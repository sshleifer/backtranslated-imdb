There was a stylish approach to this film on the part of director Vincenzo Natali and camera angles interesting and effective pre-ups. It was also worthwhile to see Jeremy Northam and Lucy Liu leading the leading and expanding ranks as performers. This film also included one of the most imaginative scenes of "escape" in recent years. Efforts of directors and actors are combined in an effective thriller. Although the film was filmed in the film, the story progressed very clearly as the layers of corporate greed and skullduggery were revealed. In 1949, George Orwell suggested in his famous novel "1984" that the future would be directed by the totalitarian state, which would control the mind and diminish human freedom. It was interesting that in this intriguing futuristic movie, it was not the State, but rather the corporate world that controls and devalues ​​the human worker.
