Little Edie and Big Edie are the characters that anyone can feel compassionate. Even though the homes were dirty, this is somehow understood when they consider mental illness. On board the message a poster wrote that "Little Edie has the ability to survive in an eight year old." This reminds me of the time of the 2009 dramatized version, Big Edie says Little Edie, "If you're stuck, it's just with yourself!" These women had everything; beauty, talent, intelligence, firm belief in their views and actions. Maybe if Little Edie is not so hard on herself things first did not work out, losing her hair, her work, and love in her life, she would do it. That's somehow the link to what I believe is his mental illness: its inability to choose itself when times are difficult and see that the good times lie ahead. The world will never know what happened if he did not listen to his mother's prayer, "Come home, Edie! Let me take care of you!" But these insecure compromises somehow manage to be bright, heartbreaking, and lovable, even in their very dirty home. These women were extraordinary, and the interactions with each other brought humor and sadness. When Edie had one of her emotional breakthroughs, staying on what could, or about how she wanted to get out of her house because she feels like a girl, one gets her intense encouragement to embrace her and says she "all Things will be okay!
