This is one of the best films I've ever seen. My parents are from rural India and in some extensions I have seen the lives of villagers. People are really poor and have financial and social problems. <br /> <br /> The movie just reflects exactly the same. Full credit to the director and the actor. They do a good job. I just wonder how movies like Lagaan and Paheli can go for Oscar and not Doghi. I do not understand criteria on which films are selected. Is the money that makes the difference or has some great names in the movie to make the difference. <br /> <br /> Hope to see more movies like this in the future.
