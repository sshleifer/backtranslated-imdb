I love this show with my 11 year old daughter and I like to watch it together. It teaches good old fashioned value in a fun, adventurous and fun way (albeit with a somewhat predictable story most of the time). It's also really fun to make fun of ... you know, delay and set your own dialogue, in place of the actors'. <br /> I have DVR I put in record all the episodes and I got to catch the end of an episode (just before the next start ... so I do not know what episode it was) but there was a absolutely error sequencer errors! Adam gave Sheriff's cafe a little swatch of "leather", which was worn out of some outdoor clothes as he tried to make his getaway, I suppose. <br /> Well, Roy arrived to have the dress, so he put it on his desk and put the right swatch where he had been torn from. The swatch was exactly rectangular ... which I agree would be almost impossible to tear out of a piece of leather (Naugahyde the post-1950? Yes .Cut? I do not think so). Well, the swatch is aligned perfectly with the mystery solved. <br /> <br /> Not 10 seconds later in the scene, we see the dress again, always lying on Roy's office. But this time the swatch is more like the shape of North Carolina and is now in a completely different place on the dress (but still perfectly aligned with the hole in the dress) and the seam (which was smack-dab in the middle of Swatch) is now going ... as is the seam in the dress. My daughter enjoyed a good laugh as we played the short scene over and over and over again! It is primarily for youtube, I say yes! <br /> We always totally love the show though and the sequence errors make it much fun!
