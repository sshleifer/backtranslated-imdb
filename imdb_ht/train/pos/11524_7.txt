This is a small original movie, and I have to agree that there are some original acting in it as well. She follows the adventures of a young man who decides that he wants to become a famous Las Vegas Illusionist, and is partly about following his dreams, in part on the dreams of others, and all about the showbiz travails. I thought the movie was good, and it has a moment or two of real magic that makes the whole thing refreshing. Alan Arkin is terrific as the magician who has never been, and his frame of Max makes for a comic and touching relationship. <br /> Not for everyone, probably, but if you like movies on the trip, then I think you'll be like this one.
