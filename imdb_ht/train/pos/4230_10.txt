For Columbo fans, like myself, this is the episode episode that made a case why Columbo was so popular, and just how good it really was. Ruth Gordon has one day (as ever) plays romantic novel romanticist Abigail Mitchell. Often Abigail calls his nephew in the law to sign some papers to make him inherit. She never got upset about her soul, and she is persuaded that her husband's late husband (Charles Frank) had made the deed deed. To say more would be harm. Mariette Hartley has a sly role as Abigail's personal assistant. This episode of Columbo is in a class alone. It's a really nice movie movie. I strongly recommend it.
