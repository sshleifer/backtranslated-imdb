While this was a better movie than 101 Dalmations (live action, not animated version), I think it still falls slightly in what Disney could do. He was well-liked, the music was more suited to the action, and the effects were best done (compared to 101). The act was perhaps best, but then the human characters gave the most appropriate role to this end, and Glenn Close is really not to be missed, as in the first movie. It makes it shine. Her poor girlfriend and sidekicks are presenting fur are wonderful characters to play off, and they add to the Disney spectacle gave us. This is a great family movie, with little or no objectionable material, and yet it is fun and fun for adults and children alike. She is bound to be a classic, like many Disney films. Here's the third hope will be even better - because you know they probably want to be one. ;)
