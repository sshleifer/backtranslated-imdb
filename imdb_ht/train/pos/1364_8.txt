I remember Parker Posey about "how the world turned" before she became the Queen of Independent Movies. In this movie, Posey shows her potential as a real-acting actress. In this film and casting support including Omar Townsend as Mustafa, a Lebanese immigrant who works as a falafel seller on the street, who wants to become a teacher. Throw in support features a wonderful actress who plays her motherboard and relative only relative as Judy, the librarian who is old fashioned, dedicated to menopause. Posey as Mary learns that she grew up and matured. Losing the librarian's clerk's position makes it realize how much he misses it as a place in his life. Mary's life is surrounded by friends at the Lower East Side Village in New York City before becoming junkies and yuppies. This movie is quite good for an independent and I've come to enjoy Parker Posey as Mary as well as other characters from other films.
