Since the musicians both go out of fashion and are incredibly expensive to do without all the talents necessary to do one under the contract in a studio, I doubt we will ever find a real life story of Enrico Caruso. But if everything else was in place he did not crash that no Hollywood studio tried to work until England-Goldwyn-Mayer had Mario Lanza under contract. No one else could do it, I doubt if he'll ever have to try again. <br /> And why should it be. I think Enrico Caruso himself would have been satisfied as to how the song was described on the screen. For his tenor voice was his life, his purpose for being on the earth. <br /> <br /> To say that freedom was taken and his life is to be modest. Caruso, like the man who described him, was a man of great appetite although with a lot more self discipline. She has a lot of relationships with several women and two grandfathers from her unmarried son. <br /> Its contribution to the recording industry is treated as almost a reflection. She was shown to a late recording studio in her life. Actually he started recording right around the turn of the last century and along with Irish tennis John McCormack for RCA Victor made the recording industry what he came up. <br /> <br /> When Caruso and McCormack were in the Heights you practically inherited a ticket to see one of them making life. But a lot of Italian and Irish immigrants had a phonograph with a file or three of one of these guys. That's why both became the legendary ones. <br /> What's the movie there are some very well-known operas arias performed by Mario Lanza, a taste of what it might become having discipline in a Caruso baton opera. The Great Caruso won an Oscar for sound recording and was nominated for costume and design design. Mario Mario himself has helped popularize the movie with a red album album RCA from the Great Caruso. Unfortunately due to contractual obligations we could not find an actual cast album with Ann Blyth, Dorothy Kirsten, and Jarmila Novotna. <br /> <br /> Even though Blyth sang it in the movie, Lanza had a great hit recording of Loveliest Night of the Year plus helping to popularize the Great Caruso. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a life of Enrico Caruso, this is not it. If you are looking for a great artist to sing in the height of his career, than you should not miss the Great Caruso.
