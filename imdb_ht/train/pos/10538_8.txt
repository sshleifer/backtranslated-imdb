I work in a movie store, and as such, I'm still on the look-out for an excellent movie. I decided to check out Nothing as it did in our Canadian section, and I tried to support my country's industry industry. I was in for a surprise. The film features David Hewlett and Andrew Miller in a very entertaining story that looks like a lot of our minds and relationships ... without hard work. It is still comedy of the interaction of the two characters, as well as some funny trades ("We can not die, we have cable!"). What more can I say without notice that it's worth a shot, even if you abandon it in the first half an hour.
