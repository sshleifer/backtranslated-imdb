Oowo, the film was fairly good, a good action plot and a fair amount of explosions and battle scenes, but Chuck Norris did so hardly anything, except to disarm the bomb and shoot a few characters. The movie was very similar to the events of September 11, and a charging-like terrorist bin sent a video to the president (Urch) and threatened to erupt. Judson Mills had some superb action roles, taking out Rashid's composite and various kick-butt roles but had a shortage of Chuck Norris. Judson took over the action, leaving Joshua (chuck) and Que on his computer. But in general, it was realistic and did not miss the action, but only did it on Mr. Norris' party. I gave the movie 7/10.
