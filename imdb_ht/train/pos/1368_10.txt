Agree. This was a favorite since I was 14. Granted, I do not watch it several times a year yet, but ... This is not a movie for an older generation who wants a deeper or somewhat meaning sparkling message. This movie is fun. It's pretty late, almost over, but Parker Posey is so brilliant that it's incredible. If you want to be torn by the 90's Breakfast in Tiffany, go to the 90's, or love Parker, this movie is for you. Otherwise, do not bother.
