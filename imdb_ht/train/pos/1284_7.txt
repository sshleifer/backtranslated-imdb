I looked at the Babysitter as part of classic BCI Eclipse 'classic (featuring Crown International Photo Releases) on DVD. I think it is a very good movie. This movie packs a lot of stories in a very short time. You have hippies, rock music, cyclists, lesbians, sexual inappropriate, blackmail, and murder, all in one place! <br /> <br /> The lead actors make a credible job. And, I found the compromised trick scheme to be credible and interesting. However, dropping into support, especially cyclists, delivers a stuffy performance, particularly when asked to deliver lines that are more than just a few words. Maybe they used real cyclists, instead of the actors. A couple of characters, in particular, were exceptionally credible. The music note is absolutely spot-on, for the time, tempo, and for moving the story forward. I found the music a real treat. I noticed in the movie opening films featuring the music in the "Food," I'm googled; but could not find anything ... <br /> <br /> In any case, George E. Carey wrote, produced and starred in this movie liked the very idea (in an adult married man bringing in redemption through trial and tribulation; and, a little help - of course) that he writes, produces and stares at "Weekend and Look at."
