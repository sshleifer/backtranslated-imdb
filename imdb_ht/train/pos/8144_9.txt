When you see both "scared of a black navy" and "This is Spinal Tap", I can honestly state that while similarly, both movies are truly to be seen. It will do many times in "fear" that will have you in hysteria. No wonder why both movies have such a great culture. "Fear" will soon be available on DVD. Rent it if you owe, but the only way to fully enjoy this movie is to have it for yourself.
