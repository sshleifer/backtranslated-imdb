If I could go back, as an adult and revive the days of my summer spent in camp ... I should have so fast. The camps I went to was not even that great. They were in Texas where mosquitoes actually brought people from our horses and fishing. The movie movie was surprising, the characters are funny and credible especially Perkins, Pollack and Arkin. Sam Raimi characters and sub-antiques were priceless. So who ever thought this film was lit ... I'm sorry because they can not stop their disbelief long enough to imagine life again as an adult or they never go like the kids. The whole point was that these people had an opportunity to regress and become juvenile anymore and thus did all the opportunities. I wish I could. It was funny, smart, beautifully scripted, brilliantly dropping and the artistic take me back so I want to look it over and over just for the same scenery. Sort like dance with wolves and ladyhawk ... good movies but the desert gets as much as the actors. Rent it, see it, buy it and watch it over and over and over ... never become old. ; 0)
