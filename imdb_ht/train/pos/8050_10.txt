Most agile fat guy in martial arts makes it again. An early Sammo film that has her imitate her character's hero, Bruce Lee, Sammo is amazingly Lee as in his actions and battles. His way to slip through Bruce style and then back to his own, most familiar Kung Fu is a joy to look and shows how accomplished and adaptable he is in his art. Throw in a bit of slapstick humor so beloved in this type of cops and this movie that has it all - comedy (some unintentionally, like the black fake guy), and some incredible fighting scenes. A great beer and ami movie is worth one hour and a half in any time.
