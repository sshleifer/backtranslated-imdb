Well, like many other films, spawned out of a SNL skittle. But Tim Meadows does a fairly accomplished task to make a 3-minute character one dimension in a moderate comedy movie moderate. It drops amusingly still-threatening one-materio that has fair frequency, Billy Dee Williams is in it though his Lando days are long gone, and the whole thing is shot very well. True, it's not great art, but if you've gone to Wayne's world looking for the gone and the wind, you've done something wrong. Agree to what it is.
