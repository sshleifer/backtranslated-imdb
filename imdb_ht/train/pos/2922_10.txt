This movie is a perfect example of a movie that divides people into 2 groups. People who find the joke and those who do not. People usually attack what they do not understand. This movie has a funny style and charm that has been unparalleled since. He is a GREAT comedy .. and a GREAT romance. It's a perfect movie date. A perfect movie for someone who wants a good lighthearted laugh. But if your perspective is too tense, perhaps this movie is not for you, and you may need advice. It's an injustice that Paramount has kept this movie on the shelf since the early 80's, never seen the light on DVD on DVD. But to feel an urban version of the "Honeymooners" is a good idea. I find it odd that my favorite romantic comedy ever has never been released on DVD. The other had Gene Wilder of the "favorite lover of the world" that Fox was sitting on since early in the 80 as well ... But "Justin from Kelly" is in almost every video store in the country. There is no justice in the world. Perhaps those who took time to hit this will enjoy "From Justin to Kelly", I'm sure one only watered for "getting". At times and ages people lose their sense of humor ... Or sometimes it just goes to stale and they find comical satisfaction in the "Full House" reruns.
