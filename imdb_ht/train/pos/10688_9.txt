I did not really know what to expect when going out to watch the movie, apart from the slightly surreal basic plot of a lonely man ordering a Russian bride on the Internet. That and she had Nicole Kidman in her. I absolutely love the movie though, and out thinking 'wow'. <br /> <br /> Refreshingly down the earth, the movie moves along nicely, with a few surprises in every corner. The relationships of the film are believed, and Nicole and Chaplin working against each other very well. The humor is subtle, with some big 'office' such as the scene of the bank, and the suspension component adds blood pressure without Hollywood. Overall the film is about real people in an unusual situation. It's less heroic and more about delicate relations. The british movie is its best ... <br /> <br /> (9/10)
