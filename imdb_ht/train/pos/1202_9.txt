I really liked this documentary on Kenny and Spencer 's tentacles invading the "Dawn". A great look at how exterior attempts to get into the inside makes it great. <br /> <br /> The story has been put together well and organized in an exciting way that has made the film flow thoroughly. Certainly worth a look. My only complaint is that they appear to have no closure. Maybe this is part of the point. We hope it in reality is not what happened (or usually happens). The movie is a great way to see Kenny and Spencer's personalities outside of Canadian TVs. You can see a bit of what's not yet to come. <br /> I look forward to a chance to see the Paper Chase.
