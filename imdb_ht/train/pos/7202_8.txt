Long before "Brokeback Mountain" (about 23 years earlier), "Deathtrap" was the first time I ever saw two passionate men kissing on screen, and frankly, I was shocked. I understand it in terms of the draw, and it did not really upset my sensibility (not much), but it was the first time I ever saw it, at least, in a "mainstream" movie. I thought he was a gutsy move for his time and took courage to try it, especially Christopher Reeve, in the middle of his time as PG-rated Superman. Male bisexuality on screen may have hit its stride and "Brokeback," but it's interesting to note this much-incarnated incarnation.
