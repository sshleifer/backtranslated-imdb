Murder of Mesopotamia, I have always considered one of the best Poirot books, as it is very creepy and has an inventive spirit. There is no doubt that the TV adaptation is visually striking, with some pretty photography and a very haunted music note. As always David Suchet is impeccable as Hercule Poirot, the comic creature of the episode was fighting the Poirot with a mosquito in the middle of the night, and Hugh Fraser is a good thing as though Captain Hastings. The rest of the turn thrown in decent performance, but careful not to cover the two leads, a danger to some adaptations of Christie. Some of the episode was very creepy, a juxtaposed into a tragic episode as Five Little Pig, an episode that I enjoyed a lot more than this one. What made it creepy in particular, to save the music was when Louise Leidner saw the ghost figure across the window. On the adaptation, he was fairly faithful in the book, but I'll say there were three things I did not like. The main problem was the rhythm, it is rather slow, and there are some scenes where very little is happening. I did not like the fact also that Joseph Mercado was a murderer. In the book I saw him as a rather nervous character, but the intervention of the idea of ​​making him a murderer, and under-developed, made him a less appealing person, even though I'm glad did not miss her drug addiction. (I also note that the writers leave out the fact that Mrs Mercado in the book falls into hysteria when he believes he is the next victim of the murderer.) Other things that were not so impressive was that I felt that it could have been more effective If the adaptation was in the opinion of Amy Leatheran, as it was in the book, Amy somehow seemed less susceptible to the adaptation. On the whole, despite some misjudgements on behalf of the writers, I liked murder in Mesopotamia. 7/10 Bethany Cox.
