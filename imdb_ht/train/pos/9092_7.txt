I think that this movie adds to diversity and is very accurate in terms of historical reconstruction. The road shows the various communities left in Thailand are very interesting ... Portuguese, Japanese, and various communities have been managed by the king. The plots around the court are as usual a fight for power and a lot of betrayal. Wardrobe is fine. The film is also made locally in Thailand in a reasonable production. The scene and the elephant as executives are very interesting. It is fun and I think it can also be used in schools for its historic accuracy because it shows that the European in Asia were subject to local kings in very different ways from Hollywood's traditional perspective.
