The sopranos are arguably the greatest show in dramatic television history. It's hard to think of another series of intelligence, sublime writing or initial performance rates. Its subjects season produce fresh and iconic characters with a constant level of high quality. Centralized through one life Tony Soprano, a man who lives in two families. One is the conventional wife with two other Native American families a great New Jersey Mafia group, in which he is boss of both. Played by James Gandolfini, in True Romance and the Mexican Fame, Tony is a fascinating, scary but also likable guy. All praise to be given to Gandolfini to conduct a brutal and brutal aggression of a truly identifiable and perfect leader. Contemporary American drama never had such an arrested and iconic figure as Tony. Throw in the hundreds never has a flat performance and these stand out characters like Paulie Walnuts and Ralph Cifaretto will stick to your memory forever. <br /> <br /> The true engineering of this story however, is the creator and brave and revolutionary writer to take on a conventional drama series. Six minutes sequel long dreams, the powerful and original uses of symbolisms and metaphorical imagery and truly shocking scenes of violence. But all this style meets in really touching the theme of love, honor and respect for the family. The series never gets cold or free. <br /> With current now competitive and often poor Sopranos TV stands high above the rest as American and American drama is the most original and compelling. Forget Family Report. This is TV Rediffined.
