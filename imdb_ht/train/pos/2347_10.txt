I was a fan of Pushing Daisies since the very beginning. It's nice to think, and Bryan Fuller has the most remarkable idea for this show. It is incredible about how many TVs need a creative, original show like Pushing Daisies. It's a great relief to see a show, which is unlike the rest, where, if you compare it to some of the newer shows, such as Scrubs and House, you'd see the similarities, and get tired of watching show times closely attached to identity. <br /> With a magnificent cast, wonderful script, and hilarity in every episode, Pushing Daisies is, by far, one of the most notable shows on your TV.
