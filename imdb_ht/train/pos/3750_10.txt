This is a short one. I think each voice is made by jelly steele. (you can just barely say if you've heard his usual voice though, so do not worry about the sounding same .. they do not ..) it's about 15 minutes time. <br /> <br /> The sparrow Edward is fighting war against war and he encountered some strange people. In fact, everyone she knows looks pretty crazy. <br /> <br /> "edward!" "General Peterson, we have to get you a medical unit!" "No, I will not do it edward." "Do not talk like that, I'm sure you'll be fine." "Im a goner edward, and you know it before I go--" "yes?" "Can I have ... one kiss?" "Umm, no." "Come on, just one, small, peck on the lips?" "I'm going to go now." <br /> there's going to be movie very soon. The date for that is in September, but probably it will get pushed back.
