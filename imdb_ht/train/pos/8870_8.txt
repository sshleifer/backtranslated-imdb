When John Singleton is over, he is * over * !! And this is one of his best films. Not quite as tight as the boyz-n-hood, but close to it (and lots of even the stellar cast). This film was very well written, beautifully combined, and beautifully shot. There are so many criticisms, and many of my complaints are superficial (eg: where does Fudge get the money for 6 years of college and a lot of expensive things? Not to mention a rich background ... And why not Professor Phibbs has a office? A teacher in high * he should * have one ... And while we are in it, for a genius student, Hick or not, remy a very dumb character - I would think it would be a bit as more in the way of basic intelligence - it talks to act as a total buffalo). <br /> But, aside, the movie was very sharp. A good array of characters and points of view; and Singleton does not take place in the story - many of the characters are empathetic, and it does a great job of interplaying the panthers and supremacist scenes together to show the frenzy on both sides. Many of the cinema was excellent; I especially liked the scene where Kirsty Swanson gets intimate with Taryn and Wayne each stage watching closely. Also the Malik / Already scenes were really well shot. <br /> In the dialogue was a bit much at times; This movie has a tendency to get * really * preachy at times, and it also tends to muddle the points it did on yourself when the points would be just as clear and outgoing (we really did not need the flag US and 'UNLEARN' typed on it, give some credit, we do not boil ...). With itself cut, although * most * in the Singleton time uses melodrama well, sometimes it gets * way too cheezy (like the Already Death, which is fine until it shout out 'POUKISA !!!' that simply loses all effects and scenes). <br /> But acting, in general, was head to the line. Fabulous performances by Omar Epps (perhaps the best I've ever seen), Kirsty Swanson (who knew Buffy could act ??), Michael Rapaport (marvel at the hell from me ... after True Romance with my beautiful girl though he was a single-role actor), and of course Cube Ice and Laurence Fishburne are * still * outstanding. <br /> <br /> Downside? Jennifer Connelly was flat; even though it's not entirely faulty: its role was stereotyped and one dimension. Generic to the highest degree. And Tyra Banks, who had the role, was nothing short of surprised. She whined and whined and whained. But another of the long line of pattern-turn-actress that fails miserably (though some are proving the exception of this rule). <br /> Finally, the soundtrack! Wow! An amazing band (which is definitely worth buying!) Which fits the movie as a glove. Each scene has a twin song (although the songs Tori Amos started * really * annoy me to end ... by her best work). Liz Phair, rage against the car, ice cubes ... how can one go wrong? <br /> All in all: a really good look, a really strong cast, great script, great movie. 8/10.
