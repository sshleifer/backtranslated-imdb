As anyone is old enough to know, South Africa is suffering from harm, the racial oppression of apartheid, which completely subjugates the black population. One of the most popular anti-apartheid activists was Steve Biko, who was murdered in prison. After the assassination, reporter Donald Woods sought to get Biko's message out of the world. <br /> In "Freedom Cry", Woods (Kevin Kline) befriends Biko (Denzel Washington) before being arrested on trumped up charges. When Woods tries to spread Biko's words, he and his family begin to live under attack, and they are finally forced to save the country. The latest bow-wrenchingly scene shows police shooting at the demonstrators. As one of two movies (along with "A World Apart") that helped galvanize the anti-apartheid movement, "Cry Freedom" means the best work ever participated.
