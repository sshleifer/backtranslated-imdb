I think this show is definitely the greatest show. Jessica Alba does such a great job in her. Michael weatherly also performs an awesome job, as well as the rest of the cast. The show is very intriguing and has wonderful storylines and the amazing exhibits. It's like watching a movie 1 hour. It's definitely worth seeing.
