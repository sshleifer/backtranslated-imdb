Who would not want to go on the road trip with Peter Falk? This guy's guy guy has more character than most actors today. This is the kind of funny and touch movie we all are looking for a counterbalance of all the special special effects bombs. Women will love it for all romance advice for men, and boys will love it for placement-on father / son's study - a great little scene after another. And it's just enough of a corner to be a true indie get. Obviously this is a work of love for Paul Reiser who understands what he likes to be both a father and a son, as well as having both laughter and tears as you move into life. The most fun part, though, was watching Reiser watching Falk. You can say that both his character has come to a new appreciation of his father and a fellow actor really enjoy the special craft Peter Falk. Really delightful. Let's hope that this movie makes it in theater around the country sometime soon so everyone can have a lucky laugh and cry with Paul Reiser and Jan.
