First of all, this movie is 34 minutes long, which means you can watch it three times in a row and still spend less time than you would have to watch most other movies. Second of all - you need to do this. This sensational film short explores the potential of animation through a world of playful or turbulent, but still powerful. Cats riding and drinking from a water elephant, a circus presents a bird that burns the sky, and pigs eat their own fried meat - that's just the beginning. Scenes and images, extraordinary on their own, flush together without causal causal links in a way that requires re-watching. In addition, the DVD includes an amazing director of the director, which, given the extremely spare dialogue, only improves the look. The comment gives a few interpretations of scenes, but also provides priceless quotes on cats' satting crafting, along the lines of: "Well, the artists asked what we should do at this stage, but I did not know myself , so its hard to say why it turned out as it did "(that's a bad paraphras in the way). Also, the sound of the movie is very high quality, very precise, and very moody. In all, the absolute minimum experience should go as follows: <br /> <br /> First look: Watch the DVD without the Next. Second look: Watch the DVD and the Next. Third look: Rewatch without commenting. <br /> Once you've been watching it three times, however, you're not going to stand up there.
