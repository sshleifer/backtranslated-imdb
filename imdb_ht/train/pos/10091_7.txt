I watched "Elephant Walk" for the first time in about 30 years and was struck by how the same story line is the lot of "Rebecca." As the others said, you have the sweet boy swept his feet by the good varied and brooding master of the manor, only finding his marriage threatened by the inevitable memory of a relative greater than life again deeply flawed. You have the stern and desperate servant, a crisis that will either tie the couple together or tear them irreparably apart, climaxed by the destruction of fire at the lavish homestead. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, "Elephant Walk" also has some of its creeping forest atmosphere in the "Letter," Bette Davis loves the triangle placed on a Singapore tires plantation rather than a Sri Lankan plantation. <br /> <br /> Maltin gives just "Star Elephant" to stars, and IMDb readers are not very kinder, but I enjoyed it despite its predictability. Elizabeth Taylor never looked lovelier, and Peter Finch does a credible job as the basically good man can shake the influence of his father annoying. Dana Andrews - a favorite of "Laura" and "The Best Year of Our Life" - is wasted as Elizabeth's frustrated fan. The real star is the bungalow, one of the most beautiful interior interiors in movie history.
