Director Edward Sedgwick, an old hand in visual comedy, successfully leads this Hal Roach road that deals with a fast-moving, straight-forward and casting scenario, hiring a large number of serious Roach performers. Although the movie was originally set up as a car for Patsy Kelly, Sunny Star Jack Haley as Joe Jenkins, a teenager who sold his auto repairs business and Hollywood tour, where he tried to take a screen role for the girl he liked, star Cecilia (Rosina Lawrence). Sedgwick, who prefers using the entire MGM studio, does this here as Cecilia, always ready for an audition, treated by a paramour, would be cinema, movie star Rinaldo Lopez (Mischa Auer), behind The acting scenes, of course, a musical comedy, featuring Broadway titles Lyda Roberti. Laurel and Hardy provide many enjoyable interludes, including well-known ones including a small harmony, and we look closely at not like Joyce Compton, Russell Hicks and Walter Long. On balance, one must give the Mischa Auer berries, who clearly threw the picture as an emotional film star, a role that he largely created, and the director to shut down close to the busby Berkeley.
