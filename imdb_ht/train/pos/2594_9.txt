This movie took Jerry Springer approach to super-human power. "Wilder Napalm" is the kind of theme-based movie that I love, addressing the idea that the prodigies of America are defined either by their gift or by trying to hide them. At the same time, the film shows that every prodigy is only human, and no longer have to be feared or worshiped than anyone else. This was a great comedy, humorous and humorous corner.
