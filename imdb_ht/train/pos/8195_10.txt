Often Impact is the best of five Harry Movie Rooms. They do not come any more lean and significant than this as Harry romps in a series of violent clashes, and the bad guys are getting their dessert just. That's just the way I like it. Large stories too skillfully directed by Clint himself. Excellent entertainment.
