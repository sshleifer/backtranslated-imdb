I think this film is very fun with horrors. I love Elvira and I love this movie. It's very pity that the second part of this wonderful movie had no success, because it's very funny as a first part. I also regret that besides this movie I have no see Cassandra Peterson in other films. I think it's amazing actress and great ... potential. I hope II'll see him in the future of Elvira's third party adventures. Cassandra Peterson is one of my favorite comedy actresses. Cassandra, if you read this, know that you are the best and my heart will be with you. You can count on me. What can I add more? This is cool movie and classic!
