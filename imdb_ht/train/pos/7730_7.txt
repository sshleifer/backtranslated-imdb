If in the 90's you will have a book written in the 50's, place the blood in 50's and not '90. Look, 40 year old Mum and their value tend to not play as well, or rings as true, which far down the road. It's a simple rule that Hollywood usually holds violations. And this is the problem with this movie. It should have been laid in the era he wrote in. You would think that would be a no-brainer, but Nooo. I would elaborate, but the comment bmacv spelled it out very well. I will limit my book to Rachel Ward. It seems that it regimens its donkey completely out of existence for this role. As a result, it looks like a crack on 'chemotherapy, and is about as sexy as a gay leather couch to drag. I found it "I was able to die at any moment" look quite discouraged, and it's very detracted in it to suppose the "hot" and "sexual tension" the movie intends to create. Otherwise, the movie was fine; a 7+ out of 10.
