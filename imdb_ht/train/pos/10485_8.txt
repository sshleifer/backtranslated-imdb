I saw her last night on TV, and she was happy. <br /> It's sort of movie that makes you feel beautiful and warm around hearts, and they believe there is always some goodness in the world (all the neighbors pretend to see what favors did in order to help it and protect it - the old policeman is my favorite), although you know that this story is not quite realistic. <br /> I love acting (they all seemed as ordinary, common people, living in small picturesque English coast city) but the greatest thing in the movie was the wit and humor it has! Just remember the scene of the shop and two old ladies after they had the "tea" ... <br /> <br /> Perhaps the finish was a bit confusing but it did not stop me from In fact, really enjoy all history!
