Director Douglas Circus notes again with this, the grandaddy of all dysfunctional films. This lush, legendary trashy is a masterpiece, beautifully combining all the elements in the circus circle and strategically putting them all in one movie. "Writing on the wind" very evidently influenced the 1980s series "Dallas" and "Dynasty", as this is basically a feature-length version of those soap late night. Lauren Bacall, beautiful and subtle, plays Lucy Moore, a New York City secretary who marries Baron oil, Kyle Hadley (Robert Stack). Unknownst of both of them, Mitch Wayne (Rock Hudson) is also in love with the secretary, but sexy. They all go back to Kyle's family mansion in Texas where we meet his white-and-white garbage, Marylee (Dorothy Malone in an Oscar-winning turn). Yipee! Sparks are beginning to fly - from their romance to the catfights, this is a camping trip. Not only Mitch has to fight with her feelings for her best friend, but Marylee is trying to sleep with everyone since she can not have one true love that is Mitch. Topping it all, Kyle learns it's important, but somehow Lucy ends pregnancy. This is so much pure and most melodramatic entertainment. How can you not like it? This movie signals one of the most popular universal films and one of Sirk's best director's works. Some of the dialogue is absolutely sizzling and the visual metaphor is thrown in every way - the theme of wind at all is great. Throw is great, although Bacall is completely underused despite getting self-bidding behind Hudson. The Oscar Stack pairs reported devastating it. He considered this its finest performance and apparently was not too happy to lose out. And he made out a fabulous performance as the alcohol whimpering. What a stunning movie! This movie proves what I thought for ages - Circus is the master of classical melodrama. Where's His Oscar? <br /> <br />
