This is a complex documentary that shows much about Gay life. To put it into perspective it was when Gay was the word used for the homo-sexual revolution, and not just Gay as a descriptor. Or does he still use this way today? I believe most of the film came from about 1968 to 1989. It was released in 1993, so it was around. <br /> <br /> I was touched by the documentary captured in one's love for another over a 20 fewer odd year period. A love expressed in the way that only true love. There are many scenes of incredible sympathy and pain, along with scenes of joy and pleasure. There are scenes of life as a homo-sexual and life as a gay. The film itself was a work of love, and I believe it to be a diamond. At least one will get out of this movie an understanding of the devastating impact of AIDS. As I write this, I think how much earlier this film seems to have been set. The gains in medical science, politics, and social studies and cultures that have taken place since this film has been set (some 15 years ago) are amazing. However, obviously, in the case of the disease of AIDS itself, we do not do it yet. Heck I guess we do not do all over the front. <br /> <br /> Anyway, it's just a good darn good document. I would encourage anyone who feels that they do not fully understand gay life, gay issues, or the devastation of AIDS to watch this movie.
