There is nothing more enjoyable for me to pass a story of who is dun-it or suspense that keeps you guessing in how everything is going to end. And that's what happened to DEATHTRAP, based on a play by Ira Levin ("The Baby Rosemary"). <br /> And in it, MICHAEL CAINE and CHRISTOPHER REEVE get the kind of helmet that Caine and Laurence Olivier pull in SLEUTH - and just about as many skills and many puzzles as they have ever existed in this extraordinary smart game . <br /> But because it means to scare you, surprise you, and keep you guess As the result, it's hard to write a review about the plot. Let's just say that what we know from the beginning is all you need to know about the movie for the present. MICHAEL CAINE is a dramatically jeopardized author whose latest play has failed miserably. When a young aspiring writer CHRISTOPHER REEVE sent him the manuscript of his play, Caine realized that his passing as his own would solve all his problems and get his reputation back. From this point, it is a problem of fun and games for the audience as Ira Levin's story relaxation, managing Trump Agatha Christie for the number of twists. Caine and Reeve play in each other brilliantly, each brings a certain dynamic tension in history as well as some funny touches from a script that drives drama and humor. <br /> <br /> Summing up: Well worth seeing - but not everyone is happy with the finish.
