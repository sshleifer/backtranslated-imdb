So, finally, I know it exists. Along with the other Uk contributors over here I've seen this on what must have been it's only UK screening in the 70's. I remember the title, but it got nowhere when I mentioned it to people. It scarred me (this 2 'r), but when you go to bed with bankruptcy whizzing on your brain and listening to all around for fear of horror, then it's not that a movie TRICY CLASSIC movie is all about ?? I can barely remember the subtleties of the movie, but what I dreamed is my body leaking and intense sense. Can anyone can confirm my suspicions that this is black and white? Again, if anyone has any information on how to obtain a copy, please get in touch ...
