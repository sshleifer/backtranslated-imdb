Dick Tracy was not very good for many comic books fans, because they wanted something like blood like Batman. Dick Tracy plays innocent in just being a comic book with bandits with serious appearance disorders and being fun. Warren Beatty heads with stars as the main character who fights crime without even using super powers. I liked Dick Tracy since I was a kid because of the humorous atmosphere of the main colors: red, blue, orange, yellow, green and black. This is the perfect movie for anybody to watch with their children. Al Pacino is like Jack Nicholson's in Batman and plays Big Boy Caprice and Zest. Madonna as the babe who is the second villain of this movie does not play the same game boy she represents. As I said, there are no blood, obscenities, sexually innuendo or anything to offend anybody.
