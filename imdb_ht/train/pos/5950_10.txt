This movie is great. The draw is very true in the book which is a classic written by Mark Twain. The movie begins with a scene where Hank sang a song with a bunch of kids called "when you wipe your toes on the moon" It reminds me of singing high in Sinatra's hope, it's fun and inspirational. The music is great at all and my favorite song is sung by the King, Hank (Beng Crosby) and Sir "Saggy" Sagamore. OVerall a great family movie or even a great movie date. This is a movie you can look over and over again. The princess played by Rhonda Fleming is gorgeous. I like this movie !! If you liked Danny Kaye in the Jester Court then you will definitely love this movie.
