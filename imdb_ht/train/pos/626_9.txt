The power of dreams is something wonderful. There's a saying, "Not all dreams come true, but all meeting dreams." By exploring our imagination we form our own future. Or build empire. Maybe overcome our fears, limits and obstacles. Gain wisdom and humanity benefits. Or (simply put) just to find our way of true love and happiness. Freud could express things in the symbols. The language of fantasy. <br /> <br /> Tristan novice from a village instead of English English called the wall. He goes to rest in the wall. A portal. In search of something that will prove he loves Victoria (Sienna Miller). Victoria does not take it seriously. So he promised to bring back a falling star. <br /> <br /> Storm is the world outside the wall. She discovered the falling star took the form of a beautiful girl, Yvaine (Claire Danes). For complicated artifacts, three evil witches want to get caught by Yvaine. If they can eat it, it will strengthen the youth. (One of the witches played by Michelle Pfeiffer, making the fabulous young-old transformation similar to the way.) The 'good guy' they encounter on their way is Captain Shakespeare (Robert de Niro). He has a bad exterior, swashbuckling boat but is a sweetie bottom queen. The legacy of the storm is time to engage in a fight on the heirs of the kingdom. Ricky Gervais is an extra add. A Buffoon trader sends Gervais-quality assortment of goods well. Tristan's treatment in the spirit of excitement of love in Yvaine, so there is a pretty little triangle going. Until she realizes the maturity of discovering various parts of real women. <br /> <br /> Estel is a full-on, large scale scale that makes its myriad stars credit. All positive, and written with a clear that makes it more worthy of psychoanalysis than a full covenant in Harry Potter romps. Production of Hollywood's rivals, and the free scenario of the racial, misogny, religious or aging estereyotiping than many shapes and pervertes of great scale fantasy. <br /> <br /> This does not mean that Estelust is perfect. Draw and dialogue have many predictable elements, and the Fairytale quality can be too sacrificing for some audiences. But if you want an excuse to let your heart fly, this movie can be well-read. <br /> <br /> As a boy, I remember listening to surprised albums by the Moody Blues (practicing in a home away from where I lived). They made records with names such as "In Search of the Lost Chord," and wrote lyrics such as, "Thinking is the best way to travel." I would fill myself with books about magic and mystery, from Timothy Leary to Aleister Crowley. Put Dreams. Learn to make them real. Nowadays people can talk about NLP or positive thinking. Adults who remember how to dream with the force of youth, but with the vision and maturity application. Do you still enjoy this feeling? <br /> <br /> You are advised not to wait for Stardust on DVD. Watch it on the biggest movie screen you can find. And Dolby Digital surrounds sound if you can find it. The actors seem like they had a ball. Maybe you will also.
