Artemisia film can be considered betrayal, or as a true artistic license. <br /> In that documented history, Artemisia Gentileschi has been victimized thumbscrew, and still confirms that it was r *** ed, such as Mary Garrard and Gloria Steinem have eloquently certified. In the movie, under a different turtle, she refused to condemn her lover / violator. <br /> <br /> How can a movie divert much from getting history, still informing the human heart? <br /> <br /> The answer is not so difficult to find. In the movie, the director and cast filed a gaping hole in the historical record, and the power of imagination. <br /> <br /> Leading to a different conclusion from the file. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> So, be it. I find the _both_ file and the movie to be compelling. <br /> In both the movie and (it seems) in history, Artemisia was a painter, before all else. This vision, which is framed by films (sic) films, I am really grateful. <br /> <br /> Rarely I saw a movie that forced my eyes. David Broadhurst
