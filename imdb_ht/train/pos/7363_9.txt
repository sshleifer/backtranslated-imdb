This is not a Love Song. <br /> <br /> Summary of my word in this movie would be 'Excellent'. <br /> It's probably not going to appeal to the mass movie watching it ?? it's a movie that forces you to participate. You observe, think, and question. <br /> <br /> Comparison could be made with salvation (Topic / Theme) and <br /> <br />, perhaps with the Blair Witch Project for overall manure style. > <br /> However this film stands unique against both. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />, > film the natural tension in the story. <br /> <br /> Actim is raw, menacing and utterly credible. The movie is about friendship; The title really gives <br /> <br /> the game goes. It's probably not the kind of friendship that most of <br /> we have experienced or indeed would like. <br /> It's a love song.
