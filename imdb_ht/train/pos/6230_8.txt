1936 was the most prolific year for Astaire and Rogers. The second film for RKO this year is the third movie in this collection ?? Mark Sandrich 'follows the fleet.' This time from Astaire is painfully uncomfortable like Bake Baker, a seaman on fairies that just happens to stumble in the sedimentary coffee bar where Sherry Martin (Rogers) is a romantic warmer sweet nothings in the ears of everyone. Yes, you guessed it ?? They're hot for each other once more. Only this time Sherry's spin sister, Connie (Harriet Hillard) threatens the whole romance by falling to Bake's seafaring groom, Bilge Smith (Randolph Scott); a sort of use of 'em up and throwing' em out of guy type, thus forcing Sherry to reconsider his views of all sailors in general. Irving Belleys pretends to be inaccessible to classical and classical procedures, stylish notes, including 'let yourself go away', 'I put all my eggs in one basket' and 'Let's face the music and dance; The letter is an incredible divine inspiration of suicide that comes to another instantly recognizable and well-sublime passionate depression for Fred and Ginger. <br /> <br /> The transfer on 'Follow The Fleet' is a weaker one. The gray scale stays nicely balanced, but now it's a thick topping cap and not nearly as many tonal variations as previous titles. Seeds are still present. So they are age-related affairs. Once you've established in the image quality a little dance and sometimes better focus, the overall impression is more than acceptable for a movie in this former. The audio is mono but very nicely balanced. Extras include a featurette, trailer theater and short, but strange topic ?? There are no audio comments. Considering the importance of this movie in the general cannon of Astaire / Rogers, this is an uncharacteristic supervisor from Warner Home Video.
