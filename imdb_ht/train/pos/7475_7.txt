After reading some very negative opinions for this film, I was not sure I should fork out some money from her rent. However, it was a nice surprise. I have not seen the original movie, but if better than that, I would be in the sky. <br /> Tom Cruise gives a strong performance as David's seemingly unstable, convincing me that it is more than a smile on foot (for only the third time in his career - other examples were Magnolia and performed in the fourth of July). Penelope Cruz is a little lightweight but fills the demands for her role, as does Diaz. The only desire is the slightly baffling Kurt Russell. In the movie, however, it's not the act that is truly impressed-it's the movie. <br /> <br /> Cameron Crowe excels in the role of the director, giving himself with a welcome change of speed from his usual schtick. The insanity of the film is perfectly executed by Crowe (the short sequence where Cruise Walk in an empty Tan Square is incredibly effective). The soundtrack (a distinguishing feature of a movie Crowe) is also sublime. <br /> You will be shocked and challenged as a viewer. The plot seems a little perfect, but the issues explored behind it are infinite to argue. The film is not perfect, but it's a welcome change in speed for Cruise and Crowe and for those who have risen over a diet in Hollywood GLOSS, they should be a revelation.
