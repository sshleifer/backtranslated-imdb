An American in Paris is a showcase of Gene Kelly. Look as Gene Sing, act and dance his way to Paris in any number of situations. There are some peppers majestic, others the best of the corn. One can imagine just what Kelly did in as he did this movie only a year before "singin 'in the rain". It is definitely one of all the times. It's interesting to look at the parallel between the two films, especially in Kelly's characters, the only difference being that one based in Paris, the other at LA <br /> Some have said that acting Leslie Caron was less than pure. Maybe Cyd Charisse, who was originally intended for the role could do better, however Caron is quite credible in the role and has chemistry with Kelly. Or shortly Oscar Levant in this movie gave it just what he needed, someone who does not seem Gene Kelly. Filling the role as everyman is not an easy task, but Levant did it with the class as any other lead. <br /> <br /> Singing and dancing routines are all perfection. Even the overlong ballet at the end of the movie makes it a better movie and it passes without. Seeing that there is really not much time screen done like a loving love relationship, Minnelli uses this sequence to make it seem as if you spend four hours with them. Enjenyeu! <br /> I should miss this movie up with Singin 'since it looks very much in history and song. Singing 'would barely get naked because of debbie Reynolds uplifting performance. <br /> <br /> Full Recommendation. <br /> <br /> <br /> 8/10 stars.
