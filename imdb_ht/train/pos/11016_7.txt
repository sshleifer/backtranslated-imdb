Good action shows, but nothing new. This one took high places in the mountains, which showed some beautiful scenery with these. One man takes on a mercenary group, the lead fly, and he kicks off. It could have been called "Rambo goes to the Rockies", it was not dirt. He did have one very effective scene right in the first of the movie that made me cringing in horror. Not a bad picture, but just ol ', even ol'.
