I can find myself here, but although the movie itself was a technical masterpiece for its time, I watched it piece-to-piece on TCM last night, the question came to me: why are they doing so? putting their lives in danger, many of them dying on the trek, why they would undertake such a life-threatening journey, just get food for the animals (!) once they reach the "land of milk and honey" why do not they just stay there? Would you jeopardize your life, and that's all in your community, just getting food for cattle? As dangerous as it was, doing it for this purpose alone, shows the inbred simplicity of these kinds of people. Death Risk for a Cow? Better Than Them!
