Still enjoying the great act of Drew Barrymore and his great performance in this film, where he plays a very very complicated young galley (Holly Gooding), "Skipped Party", 2000, who left New York and traveled to California and shared an apartment with a writer and come, George Newbern, (Patrick Highsmith), "Far Harbor", '96. Many strange things start to happen to Holly and she's looking to get her brother to a mental institution after having killed his father. If you look closely close you will actually see the mother of Drew Barrymore in real life appears as her mother in this picture. If it was not for the good act of Drew Barrymore and George Newbern, this movie should only be seen on Halloween night! However, it's sure it's surprises at the end !!!!
