This movie has many wonderful elements of it! The first performance of Reese Witherspoon is, of course, wonderful, but so is also its chemistry with Jason London. The note is remarkable, breezy and pure. James Newton Howard improves the quality of his movie composed for dividing. She also seems to have a talent for lost-day-of-the-teen movies, make sure you catch her score for the latest "Peter Pan" and gothic haunted music in the "Village." I saw this first movie of about 13 or 14 and now I'm not just crying in the end, I shed a water or two for the nostalgia. Show this movie to your daughter. It will end up becoming a lifetime comic movie.
