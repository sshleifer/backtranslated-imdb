This adaptation of James James's 'A View From a Mountain' story was first featured on British television in 2005, on the look of BBC Digital Channel 4. I saw that it was repeated again on BBC 4, and decided to give it a go, recall the BBC's success of 1970's adaptation of James James's history including 'whistle and I'll become your ladies' and the 'signage'. Even if not in the same class as those heads, 'a view from a hill' is always a pleasure and at times dramatic dramas. <br /> <br /> A historian arrives in a small rural village to look at the collection of a recently deceased collector of antique artifacts. Also out of the country, he saw an Abbey who was in ruins for hundreds of years. But what does this have in connection with an old pair of binoculars and a virtuous legend about the Hillos Hill called? And what makes the country brusk squire and his servant know about the situation? Also not afraid in any way, I enjoyed this little production, and the running time was longer than 40 minutes it could become a really great adaptation. As it is, it all feels a little running and a bit more exposure to the mood would be welcomed. <br /> I give it 7 out of 10.
