This is the best of the 43 films that Rainer Werner Fassbinder has done; It's more successful at least. He was one of the leading directors in New Germany after WWII. Hanna Schygulla was as spectacular as the cold, Maria Bruan's calculations, which lost her husband in the war, found her after taking a U.S. soldier as a lover, losing her again after she went to prison for her, he found him agin at the end. Her day with a half wedding before she disappeared was longer than time together at the end. Things come and go and you do the best you can. You can give up or adjust your way of thinking to survive. Though Maria adjusts his thinking, he does what he needs to do, he does not stop love Hermann, making the end a tragedy. <br /> <br /> Excellent drama.
