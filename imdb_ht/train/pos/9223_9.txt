Ashanti is a very 70s sort of film (1979, to be exact). He reminded me of wild goats in a way (Richard Burton, Richard Harris and Roger Moore on a mission in Africa). It is a very good movie too, and I loved it very much. David (Michael Caine) is a doctor working in Africa and married a beautiful Ashanti woman named Anansa (Beverley Johnson) trained in medicine in America and is also a doctor. While being a physician, one day he is arrested by slaves working for an Arab slave slave called Suleiman (played perfectly by Peter Ustinov, to everyone). The rest of the movie is David trying to get it back. Michael Caine is a brilliant actor, of course, and plays a very determined character and prepares to do anything to get his wife back, but rather hopelessly with something guns and actions. He first helped by a British campaign against slave trade that no one acknowledges that will be on (Rex Harrison!), Then briefly at a Helicopter Pilot (William Holden), and then by an Arab called Malik (Kabir Bedi). Malik has a resolved note and Suleiman (it's very intense at all, a very engaging character), and so rides off with David to find it and get Anansa back - this involves a wonderful scene in which David fails to be p her camel. <br /> Then there's lots of adventure. There are also plenty of morality-questioned. The progress of the story is a little predictable at this point, and there are a few libraries taken and drawn to move things faster, but it's all pretty forgiving. The question is, David will find Anansa before Peter Ustinov sells it on Omar Sharif (yes, of course, Omar Sharif is in it!)?
