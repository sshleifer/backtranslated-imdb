I found 'Still Crazy' to be wonderful, fun and not only in those we lived in the era of the late '70s, early' 70s rock. My 15 year old daughter watched her with me every time I dragged out the DVD (do not worry, she was only three times) and she liked it too. <br /> It's a really loving, intense and hilarious nod of the era, and all actors hit her score and perfection. It was my first introduction to Bill Nighy and I am glad to turn a bit similar to 'Actually' love to bring him more attention. Bruce Robinson was incredible as Brian, bringing real life to what could be a caricature of the damaged drug steroids damaged. It was interesting to see that Robinson did well a name for himself as a writer. <br /> I lived in Sherman Oaks, California, and after the first time I saw the movie I was hit by Billy Connolly at the local mall (she lives here at the time), saying she was one in my five favorite movies of all time. He invited me to sit in the court with him, and we discussed the movie for some time. We even talked about the idea of ​​an American-oriented notice before wisely expelled. Why mess with the original? <br /> <br /> My only problem with 'always crazy' is that it has not been widely popular in theater and too many people have been missing out on a wonderful experience.
