After all the crap that Hollywood (and the Indians) churned out, we finally found a movie that delivered some awesome moments. There are some clich√© moments, but I'm not sure it's possible nowadays to make a totally original movie. There are not many new here ... it just does well. <br /> Make sure you pay attention, as the "subtle" crisis come quickly and often. This is not a movie to watch while eating pizza. There is one very well written red herring in this movie and, unfortunately, one very poorly-driven role. Christian cherished just does not make an effective Julie (wife / mother). For one thing, it's totally unsympathetic. I know, I know ... it just goes through a traumatic experience. But the viewer never gets to know it as "normally" and the relationship between her and her husband is rather discomforting (in an unwitting way). I think the director meant we had some sympathy for her, but I never did. <br /> <br /> Finally, a thumb-for the end, which is both disturbing and satisfying. It could easily be cheapened with a sound effect at the start of the credit, but the director wisely resisted. This is not a masterpiece by any means, but it's a good, old-fashioned movie scary ... something that's rather scarce nowadays.
