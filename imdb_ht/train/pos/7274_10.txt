No Secure Strings is one of Carlos Mencia's best performances on date. Mencia is known for poking and having fun in racial issues. However, he did more than that of this stand-up performance, which took place in San Francisco. Overall, Mencia's material not only makes you laugh but it also makes you think about what's really wrong with today's society. In this long performance hours, Mencia talked about things like illegal immigration, what women really mean when demanding equality in the work, terrorism, its opinion in Passion Mel Gibson of Christ and a discussion that he entered with a woman about whether it is affected by Jesus, and how society should treat those who are physically or mentally disabled. Mencia even discusses whether one should have the right to speak out and say a joke. Carlos Mencia is not afraid to offend, who at times has his problems with his critics. For example, he goes a bit further (and admits) and a joke about Pope John Paul II and it is most likely to do in heaven now. <br /> <br /> Main message Mencia in all its performance is that we all have a voice and that we should use this voice to speak what we feel and not afraid to offend. It reminds us that we have the freedom of speech and that we must use this right as Americans. If you enjoy this performance, I definitely recommend watching Mind of Mencia, showing it on Comedy Central.
