The movie was almost entirely etc. And it included number random music, advertising, one contest came in by mail, and a host of other innovations.

It is a grand and bold experience of recovering recurring etc. A triumph. Now, if only someone would wear out a version with the subtitles of a * other * color than white ... The white subtitles tend to wash out and become invisible.
