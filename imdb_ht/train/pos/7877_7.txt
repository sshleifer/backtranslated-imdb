The Word Writing <br /> What you see is what you get. Not really! What Madhur Bhandarkar's brave and brilliant 'Page 3' do is to destroy the myth of the glamor and glitterati that color the pages of our journals and whose life (its habit party) we follow with maniacal fervor Only the intrinsic intrinsic trials can be explained. <br /> <br /> The phenomenon of page 3 is as devious as it is enigmatic. How exactly did he get that control on the printed word and when he started on the front page is subject to another debate. Bhandarkar malen avoid this. It concerns only with this mechanism of gross existence. And in doing so, it pieces together the various components in this way of life. Like Robert Altman (although I do not compare Altman's Bhandarkar genius), Bhandarkar used myriad characters to motivate her. Whether it's an NRI Page 3 wannabe, the barrier-crashers, the new wealthy, an upcoming model, a socialist politician or an erotic erotic author; All the characters are presented with a purpose and each of them has a separate characteristic character, though the parts can be inverted. Then he puts the movie appeal. Concord Sen Sharma plays Madhavi Sharma, a young and talented journalist who covers page 3 for the nation today. Initially content with her work, she soon begins to see the ugliness of this underbelly covered by her false and cosmetic profile. But Bhandarkar resisted the temptation for making the topic of a moral-policing film and avoiding focusing on a character alone. So the film is not just about Madhavi, but also equally on Deepak Suri (Boman Irani) - Madhavi's editor who permanently accepts her role as a cog in a major car, Anjali Thapar (Soni Razdan) - a social suffocating The social pollution, Abhijeet (Rehan Engineer) - a homosexual make-up artist and Pearl Madhavi (Sandhya Mridul) - the sassy airhostess and Gayatri (Tara Sharma) - an aspiring actress. It seems like an impossible task for assimilating many characters (and more) into one story but full credits Nina Arora and Manoj Tyagi for writing a scenario scene. The dialogues by Sanjeev Datta and Bhandarkar were carefully written in detail. <br /> <br /> Any narrative, no matter how good, can fall flat and lack of genuine performance. Fortunately, 'Page 3' brims and actors and not the stars. Conscience goes in the role of author-backed with easy ease. Dito Boman. Sandhya Mridul gets better written parts, but almost too much. Atul Kulkarni is wasted though with a civil character. Sometimes the director looks too keen to incorporate as much as possible (pedophilia, homosexuality, etc.). But the contexts in which they are used do not make them look run. <br /> <br /> Finally, Bhandarkar's attempt is to satiate our voices, but it takes it a step further. It takes us inside the pictures and exposes us to the realities that are really in the circle of humanity that weird seem to live in a different and remote world. These are the ones that indulged in the new-year revelry while a few hundred miles away from fellow compatriots being ravaged by the innocent nature! Intelligent writing, skillfully incorporate songs, performance can and a sincere feeling of sincerity is what makes this movie deserved in spite of its lack of delicacy and poor product value. 'Page 3' is a major way to get into a new year in the movies. <br /> <br /> - Abhishek Bandekar <br /> <br /> Rating- **** <br /> <br /> * Poor ** Average *** Good **** Very good ** *** Excellent <br /> January 29th, 2005
