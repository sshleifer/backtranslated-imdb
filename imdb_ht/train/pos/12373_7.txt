Time was not good for this film. Once controversial adaptation of best seller Jeffrey Konvitz, now this movie looks like a mainstream version only in your typical spookfest. Hunger touching sideways (particularly crazy, on the top up), this is essentially a brilliant horror movie for those who do not care much for the genre. It has an extraordinary cast in small roles (Jose Ferrer, Ava Gardner, Eli Wallach, Burgess Meredith, Christopher Walken, and many others), but something tells me that the producers wanted such an expensive cast in order to convince the audience that this is not your average lowbrow film (producers of '70s movie cinema had a similar idea). I love to see the faces familiar, but the story is very funny, and no matter how the high class movie pretends to be, it operates at the average 70 'movie level or exploitation (not something entirely bad, though) . Still, it is an enjoyable movie, especially for those viewers who enjoy stargazing. As usual, Albert Whitlock's work is exceptional. In general, pretty fun.
