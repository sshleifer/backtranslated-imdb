I agree all-heartedly with the comments so far. I remember this documentary as one of the most amazing and informative I've ever seen. As mentioned before, I remember that I was starting to look, thinking it was just another nature of nature - interesting, not necessarily special, but I was so bad. Not only was the story of the incredible colony, but I remember the music as being so part of his appeal. If I remember correctly, it was U.S. American (analogue of the music at the end of One Flew Over the Cookook Nest). I, too, was looking for a copy. These should have to look for anybody, but especially the schools. It should be re-released.
