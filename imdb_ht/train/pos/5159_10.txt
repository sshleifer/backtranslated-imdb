This is certainly one of the ever-best episodes of trek. There is just so much going on in this one movie that is crazy it's cool. The first beam man goes down to an alien planet exploding. They meet a typical librarian dude (very well played). Then Kirk manages to get himself transported back to what is so much like 16th century earth. McCoy and Spock try to follow but rather freeze to death on frozen versions of the world's 100,000 years ago in the past. Kirk manages to get himself locked up and loaded with magic while Spock enjoys some fun time and a sexy cavegirl who has been victorious in this world frozen, awful by some bad guys. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Spock decides to hes happy place in hes and gives McCoy a whuppin royal assistance when the doc suggests they need to look for a way out. Anyway, they finally escape, leaving cavegirl poorly behind. It takes a ton of conviction before Spock finally gives in with the leaves. You can literally taste in the sadness of the end. Leaving the cavegirl all alone in frozen desert it just seems cruel and really touched. Spock must have been from his vulcus idea to leave behind his greatest hope for love and being people. Whatever, you just get a lot of bang for your buck with this episode .... A love story, Salem witch trials, Spock as a person, despair being left in total isolation ... abandoned, and three entirely different settings on the alien planet. The amazing they managed to jam all this in a movie five minutes movie. This one is a classic, do not miss it .... I want to read about DVD vibrant shure fer? !!!!
