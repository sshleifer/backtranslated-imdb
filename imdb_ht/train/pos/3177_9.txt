Adam Jones has a brilliant sense of humor. There was nothing I did not like about this movie. Cross Eyed was beautiful shot. Adam does a good job of not only developing the main characters, but also the minor characters. <br /> <br /> Cross Eyed gives hope to every budget film out there. That you do not have to spend much to create something worth seeing. There is something for everyone. If you had a terrible roommate. if you've ever taken on a high school dork. if you've ever parked anywhere in the city. if you have any kind of humor sense of all you will love this movie. This is the kind of movie that will be around for a long time and ends up belt again once Adam makes a big name for himself. I hope Adam's future projects.
