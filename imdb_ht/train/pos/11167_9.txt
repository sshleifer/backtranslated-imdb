A favorite of me, this movie tells of New York's "character" foliage, Steve Brodie (Raft) and "Chuck" Connors (Beery), which both strive to be the "Main Guy" of the bowery of centuries late nineteenth. <br /> Brodie (1863-1901) and Connors (1852-1913), were real people, though this is a heavy fictional account of the antics (based on a play) .The legendary scout (he was do it?) - Going to the Brooklyn Bridge (1886), for which it became famous, is shown here as happens around the same time as the Spanish-American war (1898) .Walsh director clearly had a big The affection for the period, so beautifully recreate here, and it includes a ragtime timber tree ragtime from singer Trixie Odbray singer (a young Pert Celtic) .Raft is in his slickest like Brodie, and Beery shows again what A smart actor was, as tough, big heart, and at times well touched Connors.Pretty Fay Wray is the love interest both boys are pursuing. <br /> Full of life and energy, the "Bowery" moves at a quick pace (unlike "greetings" happily). It is not an easy movie to find, but is well worth looking out for.
