I was looking for this movie name for years. I was 14 when I believed he was on TV in 1983. All I can remember was about a young girl, alone, who survived an aircraft crash and survived the Amazon. I remember the people who were looking for her (family) and she knew how to care for herself-she told the story and I clearly remember knowing that the bugs were under her skin. I do not remember many other things about this movie, and you want to see it again - if this is the same one - and if any of you have a copy, can you send me an email at horsecoach4hire@hotmail.com? I should be curious to reach a copy to see if it is in fact the same movie I remember. It was revealed on Thanksgiving (U.S.) in 1983, and I went to trouble in my own and this movie really affected heavily on me. Thanks in advance!
