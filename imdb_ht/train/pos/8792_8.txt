An entertaining kung fu movie, and act, draw and scene battle a cut higher than jumps in average cuts. All of the cast are simple characters and martial arts artists. Alexander Fu-Sheng's Proto-Jackie Chan comic comics are fun to watch, and boyfriend says he shows sports skills specifically. For me, the only flawless movie movie is the size of the cast - at times, things get a little confused as the movie chops and the changes between various various, and some of the characters are not as completely fleshed-out as one might want but a kung fu movie should judge first and foremost about the quality of the action, and Shaolin Temple definitely delivers on that count. The climate film with a big-bodycount battle that allows each character to show in his skill against a worthy opponent. <br /> <br /> Overall, Shaolin Temple is an enjoyable low-budget kung fu movie. Not up to the quality of a good Jet Film It, but definitely worth a look for fans of the genre. My Rating: 8/10. <br /> <br /> Misc note: 1987 Warner Home Video released in I've seen (warning) poorly armed, and missing all cast & crew crew.
