A young woman came to her husband's house after she passed away in an accident. He barely settles down into this small town, but shortly after, losing his son in a kidnapping with all his hopes ... This could lead to all these types of plots in a normal movie: get a new partners and were happy finally; or depressed enough to wrestle and ultimately kill himself ... He tries to kill himself, but not after a series of serious battles, and God. He trusts, only to find that God seems to forgive everyone, even the killer. Well, I should be careful here about God, the movie does not mean something against God. The movie's way to deal with the issue is quite interesting: not to the point of woman in view or from God's perspective (in that way, there would be plenty of grass growing, cloud flying views, I suppose). Instead, it's a third party's eye, the movie let's see and not explain something. The film would not be so interesting they had only the woman. There is the man in everywhere the woman and obviously in love with her, but in her own way. It's a funny guy, like a clown I should say, who swinging hangs around our heroine. Combinations of these, the woman full of tension, weeping and throwing still, and the man, smiling and pale stupid, ends up in a good balance of emotions: nothing absurd bad or too tedious. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
