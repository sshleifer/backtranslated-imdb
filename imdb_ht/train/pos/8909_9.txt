This is a very well-known one so I will not get too deep in it. The basic story is about adolescents who get information about an alien slab of goo-gourmet earth across meteor. Human contact with this sugary ball is consumed in the body as acid. It also absorbs human body to make it grow bigger. Nobody believes the youth (Steeve McQueen and his girlfriend) and finally makes it seem that the blob can not stop. It's really well done for its age and unlike a lot of other 50 flicks at the speed is very fast. The story is very unique to make it and a must see for any fan of old sci-fi and monster movie. If you can dig Gooey Gooey in horror 80s be sure to check out the rumor from '88 as well.
