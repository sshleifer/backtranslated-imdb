Tarzan and Jane live happily in the jungle. Some people come looking for ivory and take Jane back to civilization. But Jane loves Tarzan and refuses to leave. One of the men falls in love with Jane and is determined to take him back ... though that means killing Tarzan. This is a rarity - a better end than the original. "Tarzan, Man Ape" in 1932 was good but had some effects of special effects and sort of drag. This one has a lot of good effects and is a lot more adult. There are tons of blatant racists (a black person shot in blank empty points - and no one really cares) but this was 1934. There are also lots of blood, gore and violence (for a movie 1934) and tilt printing there are Jane make an underwater long wait totally naked! There are also obvious sexual content and Tarzan and Jane are bringing along nothing and (it implies) to sleep with sex - without marriage. This would not bother anyone today but in 1934 this was extremely extreme. <br /> <br /> That aside, the movie is well-directed, very fast-moving and full of adventure and excitement. Seeing Weissmuller in linen skimpy cloth is certainly a treat for the eyes and Jane's outfit is also very revealing. I still think Maureen O'Sullivan is bad as Jane but Weismuller is perfect as Tarzan. Everything else is OK. This is Weismuller's best-known - O'Hara Tarzan out there. WELL is worth seeing but not for kids!
