OK, so I do not watch too much horror movies - and the reason is films like 'black stay'. I keep this on (an amazing feature-filled) DVD and it scares me funny. In fact, the only extra way I think the DVD was missing a pair of new pants. However, the next day I told someone about it when I realized I'd only really see about 10% of it. The rest of the time I would watch the pizza on my coffee table - nervous that my girlfriend would catch me if I actually covered my eyes. The few times I was brave watching the screen I jumped so hard that I decided not to look again. The movie-making of the solid and character's characters was really compelling. The simplistic film is what really captured my jump-button - it's just a woodland, a cabin and a mess of chaos - and a lot of darkness. Most surprising that I was the fact that while this was clearly not a multi-million dollar production, the make-up effects really seemed known! Also, it's obvious this is a movie made by someone who has a beloved movie-maker. The sound design and the music really made use of my surround systems like many Hollywood movies never done. I noticed on the line that this film was the LA Shriekfest - a really great achievement, and I guess that the festival saw their clear film makmmakers - and probably a great deal more in this film than I managed. <br /> Turn up the sound, turn off the lights and, if you want to keep your girlfriend - order a pizza.
