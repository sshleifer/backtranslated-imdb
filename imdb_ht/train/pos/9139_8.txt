The movie is okay, it has its moments, the music scenes are best at all! The soundtrack is a true classic. It's a perfect album, it starts out and let's go crazy (appropriate for the start as it's a big party and lots up-tempo), Take me with U (a fun pop song ...), nice (a cheerful blue balloon (a little angry song towards Appolonia), Darling Nikki (one of the funniest songs ever, it's very vaguely fun in Appolonia), when Doves Cry (the highest point this chief) , I would die 4 U, my baby is a star, and, of course, purple rain (a true classic, a very suitable finish for this classic album) the movie and the album are both very good. I highly recommend them!
