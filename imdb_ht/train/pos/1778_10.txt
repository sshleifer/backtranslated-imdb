I just mean that I'm so happy someone ultimately shed their weight on this movie. Bravo "Spaz", Bravo! This film is a ridiculous farce of film-making. Especially for a student movie! I just want to give Spazz's credit for taking the absurd amount of time a care is found as an unusual picture, and then for the sake of it! Most people I know do not have this time, especially so few will end in reading it. Kudos for you guys! Anyway, the film follows a thin storyline of at least incredible and just plain silly. I understand the idea behind creating a satire in Charlie's Angels but why hired these athletic comedies! Also, what kind of director has himself act, write, produce and edit the photo! Choose a job and put all your love in this man! It's a shame because I heard he had a good movie on a toothbrush. Once again, thanks to the Spazz to pull back the curtain on this movie, people like you are a rare find.
