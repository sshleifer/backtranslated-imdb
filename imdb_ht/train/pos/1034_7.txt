I think this film was probably a lot more powerful when it first debuted in 1943, though nowadays it seems a bit too preachy and static to elevate it to greatness. The movie is set in 1940 - just before entering the United States of the war. Paul Lukas plays the very serious and decent head of his family. He is a German who has spent seven years fighting Nazis and avoiding capturing. Bette Davis is his wife's very comprehensive and long suffering that has managed to educate and raise the kids without her from time to time. As the movie begins, they cross the border in Mexico in the USA and for the first time in year, they will relax and stop running. <br /> <br /> The problem for me was that the family was too perfect and too decent - to make them seem like obvious positive propaganda instead of a real family suffering from real problems. While this was a very noble goal at the time, it just seems particularly today. In particular, the extremely odd and highly scripted dialogue used by the kids just was not true rings. It sounds more like anti-fascist speech than the voices of real kids. They were as a very annoying result - particularly one of littlest who came off, at times, as a spit. Of these only the real sounds were Bette Davis and his extended American family as well as the Romanian Romanian scumbag living with them (though it had no accessible decibel). <br /> It's really hard to believe that ultra-famous Dashiel Hammett wrote this dialogue, as it just does not sound true to life. The story was based on the game by his lover, Lillian Hellman. And, the story of history and scheme is good, but the dialogue is just wrong at times. In general, an interesting Curio with a movie and some excellent moments, ... but that's really about everyone.
