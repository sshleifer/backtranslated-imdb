Like his earlier film, "In a Glass Cage," Agust√≠ Villaronga has achieved an intense and very poetic cannula that is even more refined visually than its predecessor. This is one of the most visually and haunting pictures one might ever see. Dramatic intensity, intensity and vastness of violence threaten the melodramatic or cancer, but never step into it. In this way, it pulls on a feat is almost impossible: to be so over-the-top and so painfully restrained, to be checked and yet so understated, and even the ultimate explosives are fatty to the eye. Unabashed, gorgeous, and very tense ... this movie is simply superb!
