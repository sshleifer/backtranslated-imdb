I have always been a fan of David Lynch and this film Lynch has proven critically that he has the talent, style, and artistic integrity to make films out of the surreal Aura that he became known for in the past decade. As much as the movie is G-rated, it's Lynch most in style, rhythm, and tone. The film moves in a rhythm to master hypotheses and fills with genuine emotions and emotions. <br /> <br /> The cinematography is terrific, as is to be expected from a Lynch movie, with the sequences attached to the grandiose transitions. It is also very refreshing to see a movie where characters are all friendly, popular characters and unmatched characters that are clearly labeled as either "good" or "wrong". Richard Farnsworth turned into a wonderful performance as the rest of the cast, most notably Sissy Spacek in an endearing performance as his daugher, and Harry Dean Stanton in a small but infinitely critical role. With this film, David Lynch proved critically that he could make a powerful moving motion picture as he did in the 80's with 'Blue Velvet' and 'The Elephant Man'. Critics seemed to lose faith in the past decade after it produced surreal film such as 'Twin Pics: Fire Market with Me' and 'Highway Lost' but with this movie it showed that there were FWWM and LH methods, and it seems that if critics finally hold on to its recent drive to Mulholland, considering the high praise he received with the Oscar nomination for Lynch. <br /> <br /> 'Right History' is for me one of the most moving pictures I've ever seen. It's a love story about family, friendship, and kindness for the Gentiles. I would highly recommend it.
