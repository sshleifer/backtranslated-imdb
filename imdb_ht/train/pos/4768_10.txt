I liked it and they broke down so there was not another season !!! I hope they would! it has been the best ever ever !!!!!! there's probably no chance for them to decide not to cancel the show is there! ha ha i wish there was even though! i would be so excited !! I really would! I miss it! and it was especially ruined by knowing what happened to Jason! I think they should do another ... I even think it's funny that u have writr ten lines to post a comment .. he makes your comment steal .. and no one will read it !! I really want to know what would happen between jason and nicole ... maybe they could make a turn on !!
