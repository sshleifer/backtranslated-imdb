This was a good example of how an exciting film can be done without using great stars and great effects. Just tell a true story about the struggle of African American women over a turbulent century. <br /> <br /> This challenging movie we all look at our own personal prejudices and see that people are people, not white, black, etc. <br /> Good movie with a good message.
