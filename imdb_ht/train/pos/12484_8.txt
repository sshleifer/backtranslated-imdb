This movie scares the crap out of me! I must admit that I spent most of the movie looking at my finger, but what I saw was really scary. I shouted two or three times during the show. <br /> <br /> Film-to-do with my favorite aspect of the sound and photography. The sound was particularly big and the environment was really nice to climb. I read somewhere that it's some strange husbands and wives who did it. For some reason this even stranger to me. <br /> <br /> If you enjoy the jumps and jitters of scary films than this is for you! Very suspense with a huge movie rental with a bunch of friends who like to watch movies creeping up on a screaming sofa like little girls!
