This is a great movie, I did play in a while ago. He had an extra angel - in it. I loved Vanessa Williams as Rosey, and also Jason Alexander has a good voice. It was very good. The environment was also very good. Except the fact that it is 2 hours and 50 minutes, make it very long. In general I give it 8.5 stars. They also added some parts, but it was always cool.
