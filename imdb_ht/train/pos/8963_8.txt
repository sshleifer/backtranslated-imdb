John Van Druten Broadway hit is brought to the screen with a maximum of power stars in this romantic fantasy on a modern-day witch that beguiles a successful Manhattan publisher. James Stewart can find top bills, but it's Kim Novak who steals the show as one of the most attractive witches ever cast a spell on the movie screen. The lead period is, in fact, one of the few weaknesses of the film: The gray-haired Stewart looks a bit old for the role, and while it is easy to see why it falls hard for Novak, it's a little bit It's harder to understand what it's getting attracted to it, as they seem mismatched in temperament and outlook. (It's one of the entertaining funky tales that witches and warlocks are described as Greenwich Village Beatniks and Bohemians.) Curiosity, the permanent Stewart-Novak would generate plenty of heat in "Vertigo", released the same year as this movie, but when This "Vertigo" had a compelling sedentary history, with the benefit of Alfred Hitchcock's direction. The same comic film is mainly given in the casting cast, including a young Jack Lemmon (as Kim's warlock brothers), Elsa Lanchester (Auntie Dizzyti), and Ernie Kovacs (!) As a befuddled writer. Hermione Gingold even shows up in a hilarious comedy as a sort of grand witch. There's a lot of love in this movie - understand, romance, and a great cast - that is, if you can possibly take your eyes from Miss Novak's Wonderland. I saw the film a half a dozen times, and I never could.
