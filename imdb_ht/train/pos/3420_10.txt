This movie is a must-see movie for everyone. Congress should see this documentary really out of point-of-view of the soldier, as they should all be in America. The previous review totally misses the point - the point is to reveal the truth about teaching our soldiers to kill non-terrorists, but who just lives in the territory of our "enemy", and what he does to these soldiers. We must support our troops by bringing them home immediately, before another person dies or injures. This also reveals that the government does not help its veterans, mentally injured, and pTSD-after-traumatic disorders, or physically, and lose branches. Julie A. Roberts, Streamwood, IL
