I saw this movie in the first couple of weeks it came out, (I do not remember exactly when.) I thought it was OK, for a movie by Ben Stiller. This movie is not for someone without a good sense of humor. Like most of Ben Stiller's jokes you must think about them. Or like I said you have a good sense of humor. From a couple of people on this website I saw that people had nothing good to say about it and did not get a very good rating, but I would give it a larger one This Movie, I thought, was very good and it should have gotten a better rating. Perhaps this is not a movie for you. I just give you the opinion of someone else.
