This flicker cops formula in the "Walker, Texas Ranger" squad has some of the most incredible scenes ever witnessed in a TV movie. In addition, one can pretty much predict the outcome from the get-go. However, it is a fun little movie that gets the job done: it's fun. That's all he meant to do and he did. The cascades and explosions are fun and exciting and the draw is not half bad. The act is also decent, which is not much of a surprise, because everyone knows that Chuck Norris has no Seagal Steag. If you're a fan of the genre (and in "Walker, Texas Ranger"), you'll definitely love this. If not, then do not waste your time. 8/10
