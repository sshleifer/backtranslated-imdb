When I saw it for the first time I was really impressed. The director made such a mysterious atmosphere, especially at the end. Through all the story viewers can hope that Richard will really kill Thomas or he will do it first.But the main point was not controversy but .. FRIENDSHIP! Older and mature one prays themselves to save the younger who has a lifetime of life. It's amazing. Every time I look it I enjoy! Of course it is very violent as every action movie but I think it is acceptable. Thank you so much Louis Liosa and Tom Berenger! Amazing movie! I advise everyone to see it. I'm sure people do not regret and will really have a good time.
