The Sly is best out and out of action movie. It's a superbly enjoyable movie with some interesting characters, solid performances and stylish Renny Harlins direction. Stallone is rarely this exciting in his action movie and he certainly looks like the party in terms of stage action. This was one of the best action films of the year with one of the most thrilling and enjoyable in the 90's, a classic genre. As a Stallone fan of this is one I look back on with fond memories. Many of the superb actions with Sly in the first human form of action. Action lovers appreciate this movie because it has all the features that make a good Aciton movie. The film looks great and has great support from Janine Turner, Michael Rooker and John Lithgow. ****
