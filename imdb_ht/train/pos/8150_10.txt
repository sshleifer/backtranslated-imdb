I, Kasi Lemmings certainly is a beautiful woman looking. This film is a lost gem, a satirical "mockumentary" die of the early 90's Hip Hop scene, when MC Hammer has just started to fade away at that good night. We followed three members of the NWH as they embark on the picaresque journeys in their late-wealth and fame. And like Nickolas Nickleby, in the end, they finished their journey by far from where they started, but at least a little better understood and much less naive. This is one of the best films that no one has ever heard, but it's your movie type either love or hate, a lot like "Company Man" in this regard. I think this film is like 1000 islands in Upstate New York: it's a nice little secret to you.
