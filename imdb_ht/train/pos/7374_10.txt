For the first time ever this movie has some riveting and refreshing moments. In the movie film best supporting the abdominal abdomen you boost every moment during this film. The finish is superb. The makers of Blair Witch obviously looked at this movie and ended up not a sequel but a start to the end. A great movie with only a great piece of Japan as far as scary factor is a perfect score it makes you think and afraid from yourself.
