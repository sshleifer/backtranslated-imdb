This film has put together a tad better, it would be the best and best of Astaire and Rogers. As it is, it's a fine film, but overly long with a tedious subplot, ie, Randolph Scott Rogers' sister, played by Harriet Hilliard (that's Ozzie Nelson's wife or baby boomer). Scott is two navy men. Scott meets Hilliard the first time he appeared as a stereotype librarian, and later after Ginger Rogers asked his friend (a blond, but unbearable Lucili ball) for his glamor. Meanwhile, Astaire tries to pick up her place with her old dance partner to stop. The result is some wonderful dance numbers, and Astaire and Rogers as a team as well as separately: "I put all my eggs in one basket," "let yourself go," and "I'd rather lead the band. " Hilliard is sweet, but a little bit like a plain Jane glamorous girl, although she sings two songs well, "But where are you?" and "Get You Behind Me, Satan" - a poster did not care for this song but I love the title. Rogers are alive, and a juvenile Astaire is a dynamic one. <br /> <br /> The highlight of the movie comes to the end with "Let's Face Music and Dance," one of the most achingly beautiful songs ever written and certainly one of the most brilliantly executed by Rogers and Astaire. In it, they are suppressed 'glamorous 30s and fantasy. It is really to be treasure and look again and again.
