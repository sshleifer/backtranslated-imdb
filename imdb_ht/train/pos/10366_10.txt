A qualified "10." The writing and acting level of this Australian film is reminiscent of the best of Hollywood's "old". Sam Neill and Meryl Streep are very good together. Neill matches Streep Line for Line, and Take Take - it is one of the best exhibits in her prodigious talent and she is at her best sexy and gorgeous, despite the intensity of her role. This engrossing film is a treat for any movie fan who loves a treatment treatment drama, described in the most humane, but unmanifest terms. The film - which won several top awards in Australia - boasts not only a supreme cast and director, but local wonders and authentic Australian. It proves that people are the same all over the world. And, after all these years, people always enjoy the repeat of the famous Streep line, accent and all: "A dingo feeds baby moy!" Including imp "Elaine Benis" on "Seinfeld."
