As many people know, Mexican movies have been very poor after the so-called Golden Age of the Mexican cinema, fortunately, during the late 90s and early 21st century, big movies such as La Ley of Herodes, Bajo California, Amores Perros, Y Tu Mamá También and, of course, El Coronel No Tiene Quien le Escriba, appeared. El Coronel ..., is a wonderful movie, which tells the classic story by Gabriel García Márquez, by eliminating the realistic magic elements, and replacing them with the bit reality living in Mexico, not only by people like the Colonel, who wait for the pensions, but no more than half of the Mexican population, who live in complete poverty. The film character, satiric represents classic characters found in Mexican society, such as the Colonial Nationalism, the cold and ambitious priest, the hypocrite, but at the same time loyal companions, the tolerant wife and patient, the heterogeneous hospitality, etc. The movie is a must-see if you want to know more about Mexican societies, and especially, if you want to watch a gorgeous movie, not one of Mexico's finest directors
