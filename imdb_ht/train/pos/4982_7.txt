I love these "Diaper Baby" movies! You could not make a movie like this today and it's rich in cinematic history. It is stamped and the movie made you laugh, which she does. How to ever get these kids to "act" I will never know. I think they are expensive and kids make me laugh, but so the others have made this movie as it shows the naive's that existed in the early 30's. You must remember that this is when the movie industry was very young, the stock market crashed, the global depression began with the films made to someone a break in the real world. The fact that you could see movies for five cents is beyond my understanding, but then dinner for 25 cents too. It was a different time and a totally different spirit.
