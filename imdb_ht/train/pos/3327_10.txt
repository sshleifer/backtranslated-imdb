I love and admire the Farrelly fees! How do I just get to see this great movie 3 years after it's released? She made me laugh, she made me cry and she reeeaally warm my heart. Big time. It is difficult to describe in my English rot - but I must try anyway: <br /> the cast is excellent at all - from the lead - the supporting roles, the acting is great, the dialogues are great and the movie is perfectly directed and edited. <br /> I think the movie Farrelly fees are often underestimated - they are not light comedians - they're deeeeeep! They talk about what life is all about (I will not tell you!). <br /> <br /> In my case, this movie tells me that their relationships are all about: <br /> Do you love somebody: Put them free, let them be - try to share the passion with the pain And always true to one another. <br /> I'm not a sport-hater, but definitely an ignorant sport. But in this movie - the vibes get you. I could smell Baseball atmosphere. Finally, this movie tells me that a sports fan could mean for you and what fresh fans-family to be out there. <br /> <br /> Thank you very much, Pete & Bob! <br /> <PS: If you have not seen it - please check out KINGPIN!
