New York, I love you is a collective work in eleven movie films, with each segment running around 10 minutes in length. The shorts are not exactly related but they all have something in common, like. Each short is about to find love, either if it's about a couple or just two alien chitchatting.The movie star an ensemble cast, among them Shia LaBeouf, Natalie Portman, Hayden Christensen, Orlando Bloom, Chris Cooper, Andy Garcia, Christina Ricci , Irrfan Khan, Robin Wright Penn, Julie Christie, Ethan Hawke, Bradley Cooper, Rachel Bilson, and Anton Yelchin. With such a stellar cast and an interesting quote, I was expecting a tremendous movie; The problem is New York I like you do not add. It remains the sum of its parts. Some of the segments are funny, original and interesting, but others are idle (Orlando Bloom / Christina Ricci and Ethan Hawke / Maggie Q segments) that it is appalling. The movie is definitely uneven and has a very experimental tone. Wise history, it looks like something some movie students can put together. After saying that, the movie has some great moments too, one of the best ones being the segment of an old couple, played by Eli Wallach and Cloris Leachman, march along Brooklyn on their 67th wedding anniversary. And the moment like this, which made me as a viewer, wanting the movie was more consistent, because, there is a lot of potential here. But as satisfactory as the overall story ends up being, for me, the cinematography and soundtrack save everything. The correction was perfect, the way the shotgun was very impressive with the volatile band, could not be more tight. In the end, New York I like you feel like an experimental film, and even as most experiences are high and enabled. It's how one looks at the movie as a whole that will determine if he or she is enjoying it or not. It might be worthwhile for some and a waste of time for others. <br /> <br /> 7/10
