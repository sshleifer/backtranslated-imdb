Moon kids, starting Japanese rocket Hyde and Gackt, was a better movie then I hope. In fact, I was very impressed and he immediately became one of my favorite movies. <br /> Place in Mallepa, the story follows a group of street orphans, Sho, Shinji brothers, and Toshi who stole and murder make a living. On one of flights, Sho meets Kei Vampire Hyde's burning in sunlight. Through the coarse of events the Kei's true nature is shown, but no one pushes it away. <br /> <br /> The time passed and implies that the immortal, never changed Kei was raised Sho, and the two have a very close bond. Sho and Kei then meet Son in an outrageous battlefield, and become quick friends. Both Kei and Hyde fell in love with Sister Son, Yi-Che. <br /> <br /> Time to jump ahead again and show a sho grow, this time is canceled in Kei. He also explains that Sho and the children have become enemies. <br /> Through tragedy following tragedy this film diving into the reality of life and its struggles, focusing on friendship and love. It's a really touchy movie that's sad yet beautiful at the same time. <br /> As for the act, I think Gackt has done a magnificent job. Hyde has done an amazing job for a first time clock. <br /> <br /> The shots were beautiful, but the movie had it in rare and short shots. <br /> In all, I must say this movie is amazing, moving, and I highly recommend it.
