I watched many film days shot in this film this summer, the end result was just two scenes from the movie. The place was Sylvan Lake in the Black Mountains. Bring the wagon, stop the wagon etc. So this young Dakota looks forward to seeing the movie and not being ashamed. The local Buffalo animals were abolished for the real shooting scenes. (oh Doris, the animals were injured during filming) I think that ended up being cheated by Jack Nicholson in the shining? A great west / social comment from the 50's. This should be in the same class as the real western drama or used as a social statement like Blackboard Jungle or Rebel Without A Cause for the 50's.
