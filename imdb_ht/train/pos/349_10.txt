Call me stupid, but I absolutely love the 2001 horror movie, Valentine. It was so well done, well written, well-acting, well-directed, etc.! Everything about it was wonderful! There was a relatively routine part (Lily's death), very funny (www.Bleed-Me-Dry.com), completely awful and creepy (Paige's death), and just plain secretary (the first scene). I think the cast all done a great job, especially the three drives: David Boreanaz, Denise Richards (both of whom I met, and got the autograph from, while filming in this movie - very nice people! ), And Marley Shelton. br /> <br /> I am very sick of those who called this movie "another scream". This movie is, in no way, a raw script. In fact, this movie runs rings around screams. It's actually done SENSE! Cry is also NOT the only movie to introduce a masked killer into it. Excuse me, but it seems to also call a script also (ahem ..., Friday 13, Halloween, and many other awesome movies featuring masked killer). I also think the gift of the Cupid-masked killer is brilliant. It's so strange to see a sweet, Kipid face doing all these terrible things. Another gift (bleeding nose) makes way for a fantastic end! The finish gives me thrills every time I see it !!!!! So, even if you did not like it the first time, look Valentine again and give it another chance! <br /> PS - Keep an eye out for my new website (WWW.LOVE-HURTS.ORG)! Come soon ...
