The film "Cross Eyed" by Adam Jones pushes the viewer on a ride of redemption as the main character takes back control of the wheel and sets his life in order. Adam Jones has found an imaginative and refreshing way of allowing his character to realize what is most important. These truths become apparent in both the characters and viewers as you laugh and gag credit with them. The simple but attractive settings suit keep you guessing what you will see next. You can not help but smile and laugh at the antics that take place in this movie. I can not wait for his sophomore effort. It's just a matter of time before Jones hit again. Bravo!
