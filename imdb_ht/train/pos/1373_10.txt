This movie should have to look for all librarians or you should be librarian. All the best lines are directly related to the library. Public libraries and academic library arguments are a classic argument that is featured among libraries and libraries of libraries. He also broke many librarians stereotypes. Libraries can even be fun - even if they * usually do not have sex in the Romance language section! (The best movie on the librarians? Office set, with Katherine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy, of course.)
