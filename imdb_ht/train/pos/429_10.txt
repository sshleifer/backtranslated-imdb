It was about 50 years since a movie was made about romance and mysticism. Only the two films I can think of are "Enchanted April" (1992) and "Enchanted Cottage" (1945). Both movies use wonderful stars by stars. In both movies, all actors have given their best romantic performances. <br /> <br /> "Enchanted April" is about four English women after WWI who are not happy with their lives and get happiness in Italy during vacation. It is amazing "Enchanted April" made in 1992. It stands out as a classic enjoyable.
