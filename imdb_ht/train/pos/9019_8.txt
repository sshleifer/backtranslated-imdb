Do not want to give * anything * here, I would just say that technically excellent, flawless acting and uplifting small cops will reward the viewer with an excellent hour and entertainment a half: It will entertain, surprise, possibly nasty occasionally and almost certainly tug in the heartstrings from time to time, as it approaches the inevitable, but not obvious, ending without becoming clich√©d or predictable in any way. Most definitely recommend. <br /> A comment from the previous user gives 8 out of 10 for the movie and 10 out of 10 for both Branagh and Bonham-Carter's exceptional performance - I agree entirely.
