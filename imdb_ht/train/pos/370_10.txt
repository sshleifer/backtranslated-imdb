I saw this film at least fifty times and after watching it last week for the first time in a while I still FELT it. <br /> <br /> The story itself was incredible, but came alive by Spielberg's expertise and fabulous cast including Whoopi Goldberg, Oprah Winfrey, Danny Glover, and Margaret Avery. Akosua Busia deserves an Oscar nomination for his powerful but powerful portrait of Nettie. <br /> You will experience all human emotions while watching this movie. I laughed and cried and they were upset. Like most major movies he watched the Academy with a host of nominations but no wins. But this movie, without a doubt, is definitely one of the best films of all time.
