This is one of the greatest movies ever maybe even the greatest movie ever. I forgot about the movie for about 12 years. Until I saw an add on TV for ADGTH and she brought fond memories to me watching her when I was a kid. And when I watched him a few nights ago I became addicted to the movie. Generally, I do not like an animated animated cinema but this one is special it is the perfect family movie. Finishing in the movie always touches my heart and saddens me so much, but that makes this movie amazing better than all of the garbage that comes out for today's movie movie. I mean the film is G rated and it's about 2 dogs that are participating with gambling, there are a lot of smoking, drinking, killing, death and hell showing in the movie. Which I believe to make the movie come from the great good. I mean cinema today does not bring reality to children and to this movie they did. <br /> <br /> RIP Judith Barsi & Dom DeLuise
