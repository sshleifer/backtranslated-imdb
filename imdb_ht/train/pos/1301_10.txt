I liked all of the work's work, as there is such a small and costly catalog of their work taken to keep. Even as they go for as long as twenty minutes and some of the songs (spoonful and frogs cut into the Fire Wheels are the first examples) still stone socks are cut off by more than half of any stone acts to work today. This power of frost on stage gives one of the most anticipated rock band meetings ever with Royal Albert Hall to show last year. They may have gotten bigger, as there are fans, but the energy is still there, and the arrangements are great classic singing blues as well as their own. The rules of White Room, Badge, politician, spoonful, Sunshine in your love, no one seems to miss a beat. Clapton's solos have a training that he sometimes does not have on stage with his solo band. Ginger Baker, enough said. Jack Bruce is solid enough with her vocals and a kind of power that Clapton can never find on his own. Underline, if you want to see what was best shown you want you to see last year (well, some can see them), it's all about this DVD, with fresh special features.
