As a movie this barely percentage of 4, but for film fans in the 1940's period, it's almost a must-see and a 9 percent rate as a variety of shows! I drew them to watch this by the presence of Richard (Captain Midnight) Webb who plays the Colonel in charge of the event. What surprised me was the stunning performance of Doris Day. Outside of 'Calamity Jane', I never saw her put on a song better than she did here. Randolph Scott is memorable as well, though he does not see much screen time. It was a while since I saw the movie but I was almost sure that Humphrey Bogart put in an appearance. With many familiar faces, it's hard to keep track. If it ever turned on a TV station near you, be sure to catch the Doris Day sequence, if nothing else! <br /> <br />
