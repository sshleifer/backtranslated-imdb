This is a great example of a rather simple film Noir film that deals exceptionally well - thanks to the excellent direction by Otto Preminger as well as some nice performance performance. Dana Andrews star as a hot-headed detective who all too often uses her fists instead of his brain. Soon after the movie began, Andrews was reprimanded for this and warned that if this continued he would cut off the force. A bit later, while investigating a crime he was attacked by a suspect and Andrews is forced to fight to protect himself. This time he does not use too much force, but he is killed. Andrews panic and assumed they will not believe him so he tries to cover up the death - though instead of an innocent man is ultimately blamed for the crime. <br /> There is a lot more in the movie than this - including a plot involving a Thin Wicked (Gary Merrill) with a Love Interest for Andrews (Gene Tierney). All in all, this is one of the best examples of the genre - with great fear of dialogue, superb lighting and a simple yet very effective story. This is the way Noir was meant to be.
