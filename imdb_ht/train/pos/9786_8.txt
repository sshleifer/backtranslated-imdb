I really enjoyed the performances of the main cast. Emma Lung is courageous and exciting. The director has developed performance where the characters are not one dimension. A complex and changing history between eras. Also appreciate the hidden history of the power loss unions and the effect of a large employer close to a small town. I do not agree with the comment that older man has to be attractive. There are many relationships with boys and older women - without the boys being good looking. Depth of the characters can appeal to not so. The movie has a good look and the cinematography is also good.
