I thought this film was LOL funny. It is a pleasure, not to be taken seriously, the movie about one person's twisted opinion on life, love, and ... well, ladies "at the lowly bus station, in high-class beginnings ... skank bus station . " Tim Meadows plays a guy (Leon Phelps) who has been raised in a Playboy-style castle by a father's father Hugh Hefner-esquire, surrounded by beautiful porn and actress models. When his father bumps him out of the street he must learn to unravel himself and nothing but the chauvinistic outlook on life that his teen taught him ... with an incomparable, almost mysterious level charm and dumb luck. So the hijinx begins! If you have not seen this film and you enjoy a light-hearted, semi-stupid, comedy / love story, then I highly recommend renting the "Ladies Man".
