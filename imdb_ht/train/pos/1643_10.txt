This is a movie that should be seen by everyone if you want to see big act. Mr. Torn and Ms Farrel performed an outstanding job. I think they should have it on TV again so a new audience can enjoy it. Wonderful performances. <br /> It gives you a real feel of what pioneers are going to both physically and emotionally. Great unusual movie. <br /> She did when Ms. Farrel was very young. I've always thought about it as a comedy, but that's certainly not a comedy and it's just wonderful. There are very few dialogues, but that's just making it seem more real. Mr. torn as always is a great presence and just breathing he has great feelings. I have to watch movies.
