while eddie murphy stops a woman from the crying audience of eddie and a man from the audience responds. What has to say is, women - DO MR ROB (this is a character on Saturday night live), the man responds to the SHUT UP package. Unlike the previous post to tell women called gumby, this is incorrect, although the post-er said he had to have a hearing problem! despite that the post-er says about not being able to read it on DVD has a close list as you actually can hear it on the DVD - DO MR ROB !!!! I hope this helps anyone curiously explore their gas cheers !!!!!! !!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!! !!!!!!! !!!!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!! !!!!!!!
