Gus Van Sant has made some excellent films. I'm really a fan. However, I can not help but feel that the cerebral edge of Tom Robbins book "Even Cowgirls Get The Blues" loses in the big screen translation. By itself, Tom Robbins and Gus Van Centers are incredible visionary and talented towers. Finally though this one just did not work. <br /> It was not that the characters were not well developed or the plot and content did not come alive. It's just that our imagination is much more powerful when reading a book like this. We take in a different time and place and sometimes think the worst and / or the best and add to the roller coaster in the book as it is clearly unfolding according to the author's accuracy. Movies however can leave one with less of the imagination and roller-coaster emotions jumping from the overall experience. This is what I believe happened here. <br /> I suggest reading the book!
