I thought this was a wonderful movie. It touches every fiber of a person. Love in the movie is very intense. I thought it was the best Will performance on the date. Great LED. Liked the correction. Music was great. Good use of flashlight. This is the kind of movie everyone should go to see. I hope people will find this wonderful thing. In general, excellent film. I think Hollywood should have more movies and subjects. Even action films can have a caring story. I love the fact that they were very subtle in his acting. It has a purpose and a rare dedication to see. I would suggest watching this alone or with someone you really care about. For me, I found that the world stopped and focused only on the movie. The world outside was suspended for a moment. It was a nice feeling and all this mess will be over in this world. And this generation I was great to see something (someone) who cared about others more than himself.
