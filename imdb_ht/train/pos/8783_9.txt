Mr. Jim is not really a boxing movie. It's a vehicle for Errol Flynn as Jim Corbett. But he said that, the boxing scene is a real eye-box in front of the modern viewer. There are no 12 rounds, decision points here. <br /> <br /> Errol Flynn plays the Irish bank clerk who gets a shot in the world heavyweight title. Flynn is well suited to the role of unprecedented Corbett. His opponent John Sullivan is still better however, a troubled in the old school played by Ward Bond. The theme of the movie is a man pushing for his great luck. Corbett left Mund's life behind and built a new character like Mr. Jim. Jim is a Chaner who can adapt to any social environment. He is a liar and an egotist. Sullivan champion boxing positioning is described as a simple brute, but honesty and sporting gives a certain contrast to the main character. <br /> There are actions and excitement aplenty and a wonderful finish with the redemption redemption for everyone. And Errol Flynn gets the girl.
