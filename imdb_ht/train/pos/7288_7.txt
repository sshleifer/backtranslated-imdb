This movie is an absolute classic for camp. That's why it was an Elvira and MST3000 classic. Everyone knows the story. Scientist kept his girlfriend alive in a laser saucepan in his basement while he was cruising town and try to find it a body by checking out the local chic. Finally, he finds a real dry body with a head chick-facing top head. The separate head to make friends with the experience failed in the closet and the horn out of the closet and rattle of the assistant to staying "good" arms (his other not right from earlier a scientist in failure), and the place whole burnt down. <br /> <br /> The movie scares us so much as kids that my friends would not go to his basement for a year after seeing it. As our kids rank the horrible movies of all time and this one was the number four. Only one of these scary movies was really any good (Original "Haunted.") <br /> I had to give this movie a seventh rating for the tremendous amount of entertainment value it offered. Its unusual effects because of the nasty production and the unusual sexual angle when the scientist looks for their bodies (filling and listening to porn sounds) to scare the hell out of innocent children, while the ridiculous aspects make it the first material to be look at talking and laughing. I could watch this movie tonight and enjoy it while I'd rather go to the Dentist than look "Chicago" again .. <br /> The most I can give it, because its entertainment value is just lucky. The film, as a movie, is a disaster.
