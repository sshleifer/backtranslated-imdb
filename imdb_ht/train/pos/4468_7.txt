The sailors on the left - lady man Joseph Brady (Gene Kelly) and shy innocents Clarence Doolittle (Frank Sinatra). They meet beautiful Susan Abbott (Kathryn Grayson) and both fall in love with her. There are more but you've probably guessed it. <br /> The story (even for a 1940 music) is ridiculous and everything is so beautiful and good - gets annoying very fast. Also this movie is too long. It's 140 minutes and this way too much for this funny story. There are also some boring numbers by Jose Iturbi and his orchestra. Still this is worth catching. <br /> When Kelly is dancing or Sinatra or Grayson the song becomes magic. None of the songs are particularly memorable but sinatra was like a beautiful voice you will not take care of. He was shot in rich technicolor and all MGM's in GLOSS had. The act is OK - Kelly is good (although seeing him as a lady is pushing her) and Sinatra is just great (although seeing him as a shy guy pushed her too!). Grayson is giving nothing to do, but it's incredibly beautiful look. Some shots in it literally took my breath away! There is great importance here: Sinatra and Kelly big dance and song numbers; Sinatra singing anything; Grayson's two songs and justice are the best animated sequence in which Kelly dance and Jerry - an animated mouse! Tom makes a funny comedy too. Also, there is little Dean Stockwell who steals each scene in inches .. So it's too long and the plot just does not hold but it's still worth catching. This was a big hit in its day.
