A solid B movie. <br /> I love Jake Weber. Its understated delivery is refreshing at a time of more than the top performances. I loved the relationship between father and son. I loved the family's dynamics. The Wendigo looks amazing, but it's a representation of kid's game and the deer die. Is such an amalgamation, see? This is a psychological story, not a Freddy cut em up instant gratification flick. Look at it and think about your child's interior and the movie can tell you, and you'll be fine. <br /> Nice job.
