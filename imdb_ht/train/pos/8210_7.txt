Clint Eastwood darts her role as Harry's room that this time is about the case of a Surrender (Sondra Locke) who kills people who raped her and her sister at a carnival many years ago. Eastwood performs the role of it and the film is especially more action then speaking, not that I'm complaining. Sudden impact is indeed entertainment entertainment.
