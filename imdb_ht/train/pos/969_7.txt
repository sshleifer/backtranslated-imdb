Miike makes a child's adventure movie, not unlike the Neverending story. It's actually one of my favorite favorite films in the movie. Even the worst Miike is better than a very good film, though, and the Great Yokai War has a lot of it's worth recommending. It's at least as loud and obnoxious as most Americans kiddie flicks. I might think that kids themselves would get a lot of love in it (the DVD includes an English dub), but, like all of Miike's films, it might tend to move very slowly. This means you had the kind of a strange inequality, where sometimes there is a sequence of loud actions and the next scene is dragging forever as a conversational character. The story itself is not very good, either, with Miike's ever-ending incoherency rears its ugly head. Most of what I liked was from the technical side of things. This has to be the most expensive film Miike, and it looks fantastic. "Yokai" is Japanese spirit, and they come in all different, fabulous shapes, and the costume designers, special crew crews, and anyone else involved in the drawings just did an exceptional job. I saw the movie in 1968 this one is supposedly based (Yokai Monsters: Spook Warfare), with the rubber-costume monsters cheese you can find there being transformed into more credible entities using state-of- The art and special effects. I especially like to look at one of the bad guys (or girls, in this case), Agi, which sports black eye shadow, a tight, white outfit, a white beehive hairstyle and a whip. He played, incidentally, by Chiaki Kuriyama, whom you could remember as Lucy's Henchgirl's Kill Bill: Vol. 1. The hero of the film is played by Ryunosuke Kamiki, who gave voice to the Spirited Miyazaki Away and moving Castle Castle.
