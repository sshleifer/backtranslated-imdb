CONTAINS SPOILERS! <br /> I saw an announcement for this on a video. Then my sister discovered that we had the book to read it. I rented the video on the same day I finished the book. thought it was very memorable as the book was. The cast was brilliant.Tara Fitzgerald was excellent as Helen and Rupert Graves were lovers as Arthur.The costumes, music and settings are stunningly beautiful. <br /> <br /> WARNING! DON`T READ MORE IF YOU HAD 'T Watch This <br /> <br /> On the downside there are some sex scenes that are added to and some violence .this is why the video is rated 15. There are other things which was thrown off.After the first part, I felt that the accuracy descended down. While the book is better than this, I'm glad I saw it, it would restore it to those who have read the book, are fans of Bronte or like drama drama (i all 3!) As long as you fastforward in the scene sex. The book is rather underated.Anne Brontes book don `t seems to be that broadly read or well known as Jane Erye or Wuthering Heights who made it on television and film several times. Another thing. When I read the book, I was surprised at how many religions were in it, but here they were axed that all out! <br /> <br /> 7 \ 10
