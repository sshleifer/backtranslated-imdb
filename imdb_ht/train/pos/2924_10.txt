Rated NR (Rated R for Strong Strong and Sex Humor Language). Quebec Rating: 16+ (should 13+) Canadian Home Video Rating: 18A <br /> Eddie Murphy Delirious is Eddie's first standing comedy comedy. This was from 1983.Back then he starred in the movie 48 hours and place of commerce and it was on Live Night Live.Eddie made two comedian comedy movie.Delirye and Raw.I preferred to get raw because I just found the subject to be more funny. But though it is also very funny and Eddie talk about It's childhood and fun in celebrities such as Mr.T and musicians like Michael Jackson. Any fan of comedy movie stand-up should see Eddie Murphy's Delirious.
