This movie gives legend to a legendary Wild Bill Hickock. She, Buffalo Bill Cody, and Calamity Jane, are the central characters. <br /> <br /> As the Civil War closed, Lincoln mentioned his concern for the country's dynamism should increase if people would follow the advice, "Go West, the young man," which, miserably, the movie was not 'countless attributes of Horace Greeley, as a number of others did. But then, it gets murdered, and some speculators suggest that they can find wealthy selling to the U.S. Americans. <br /> <br /> In the meantime, we see Wild Bill Hickock, who reacts with a little boy, while a Vehicle is packed in a Mississippi dock. Bill Wild uses a Bowie knife, which he eventually gives the boy, calling it a "Arkansas Toothpick," which in fact was a different type of knife, though both were used across the border. <br /> <br /> Hickock eventually meets Bill Cody Buffalo, which looks close to the pictures and paintings of the real man. Cody just got married, and she brought her bride to the Old West to settle down. <br /> <br /> When they reach their destination, they run into Calamity Jane, who has a crush on Hickock. She looks to Cody's wife, and asks Buffalo Bill, "Is this your mopsy?" The line is one that has led the Hayes Commission to some issues, since a definition of "mopsy" was whore. Demille wanted the line in, and one of its help pointed out that in Beatrix Potter's book about Peter Rabbit, three of the rabbits were Flopsy, Mopsy, and Cottontail. He showed this out and demanded the senses to identify the "rabbin of sick virtue." He worked; The line was left in. The Indians got restless, partly because of the superior weapon they received from the agent of the Eastern financiers. Cody and Hickock asked to help Scout the area, so troops could get safely in a given area. Cody led the troops; Hickock went to check out the activities of an American chief, who was an old friend, and who led some of the hostile Indians. <br /> <br /> Calamity Jane gets captured, and Hickock gets captured trying to save her. He was led to the chief, and although he did not speak, torture was applied to Hickock to break Calamity Jane's will, and told Cody's way to use. <br /> <br /> Two are released, and Hickock joins Cody and his forces, partly in the alerts walking in a trap. With Hickok's help, they are caught up in the Indian attack. Hickock decided to go after the gun runners, and finally took the prisoners. While waiting for the authorities, Hickock is shooting down at being fired at the back while playing cards. <br /> <br /> There are many historical anomalies in the movie, but it retains the legendary taste. Pretty good for the 1930s.
