After some of the negative reviews I heard about this movie, I was doubtful in giving it a go, but I was Â£ 3.99 in my wallet & thought ID game play about buying a budget like film & saw this, it was give it this and I'm glad I did, I enjoyed it. Led by the star of film such as chain reaction, the ring, Bourne Identity, (Brian Cox) I had to play with this even though it was garbage but it was not at all, I found some of the humorous comedy humor especially the Alfred Molina star of the character O. Spider-man 2 character. It was the most enjoyable part of the film. Of course like many others who bought this movie I saw the name of Matthew, and that made me get it! and no part of it is great at all, it's very short at the very end of the film, it's not a big part that makes me believe why people hate the movie. I suggest you give it a go. Some parts are a poor pit that needs polishing, acting, and a bit more action. But he looked.
