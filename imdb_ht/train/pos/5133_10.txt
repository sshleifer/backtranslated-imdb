Each of the major studios cranked out jazzy one-reelers throughout the thirty and quarantine (and Universal takes the lead). While most look like cheap on screen as they did, Warner Bros. (which suddenly ceased to perform in 1946) often distinguished their thinning and cutting camera angles, mirrors and optical effects, thanks to some creative directors such as Jean Negulesco. It is fitting that the best of this genre would be out of this studio. <br /> <br /> What sets the "Jammin 'Blues" apart from the rest of the pack is that it looks best with an Avant-Garde experience than a Hollywood music. Films in July 1944, it transforms an ordinary jam session into a "trippy" dream-escaped from war-time issues, highlighted by the tune of "On the Sunny Side of the Street". Gjon Mili and cameraman Robert Burkes (later working with Hitchcock) have allowed many artistic libraries, perhaps because Lester Young was not Glenn Miller and the studio could care less about how he and his fellow musicians were presenting. The optical printer is set to good use, and multiple images of the same scene appear at once. (Norman McLaren really wrote this process two decades later in the "Deux deux", while Linwood Dunn team realized the different effects of "Citizens Kane.") The strong emphasis on silhouettes and lit smoke cigar was also ahead of time ; In some ways, this has predicted the psychedelic rhythms, but with a style of style that characterizes very long features.
