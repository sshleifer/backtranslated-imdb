I think this film is brilliant.There are many reasons why these are some of them 1) good act by Tom and Tyler 2) brilliant car gun scene that was a piece of shine 3) I thought the finish was a good twist because I never expected to end all credit Sam Mendes.as well as a 3 point these films in the movie is good as well. I'm a college movie college and we studied this movie in great detail and it was one of the best films I've seen in many years. I would just like to say a great thank you to everyone involved in doing this movie. Finally, I would like to say that the best scene in the film is the machine gun scene where John Rooney comes to kill it is just good good at shooting the scene in silence until John Rooney says "I'm glad it's you" it's a lot good as I think because the viewer creates sounds sound and that sound is totally different to each brighter visualizer. <br /> <br /> thank you for reading this comment written by Ross Kirk aged 16
