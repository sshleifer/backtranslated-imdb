I saw this film and a special screening of Owen Alik Shahadah's work. It is so interesting where this guy comes from. Now it is probably the key independent film of the world. And I'm not talking about my black filmmaker talking about filmmakers who are rooted in culture. The idea is that nothing testifies to the diversity and range of African terms, and its films 500 years after it is an African issue. But the idea does not fit the mold. Showing the artistic diversity. The film is an all-African cast but the subject is a human subject that most of us can relate to. I just love the humorous comedy of it. And the Kora of Tunde Jegede is just amazing, it is really a gem art-house.
