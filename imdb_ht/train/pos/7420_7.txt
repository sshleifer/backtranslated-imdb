Although Kris Kristofferson is good in this role, who does not want to see Elvis Pressly instead? With the drug addiction and the fall from supreme fame may be scared away from Elvis' agents to be apart from the movie, it was a mistake. This would be a perfect movie for Elvis. Though the band is far from terrific, Paul Williams and Barbra Streisand perform a decent job of creating an original band for this "period" / music piece. A bit of a love story, this is more of a drama about the fall from grace and the gift of redemption. Like most tragedy, heroes of the story have died. Also, Gary Busey is once again perfect in a not so perfect role.
