I found this to be a good adaptation, very lively and full of pleasure. With the exception of a couple of major mistakes, the cast is wonderful. I have to echo some of the earlier comments - Chynna Phillips is horribly miscast as a teenager. At 27, it is just too old (and, yes, it shows), and miss the song "chops" for broadway-style music. Vanessa Williams is a decent-enough singer and, for a non-dancer, it's adequate. However, it does NOT Latina, and her character is definitely. It is also very stressful at all, which becomes tedious. The girls in Sweet Apple fans fan Birdie fans really sparkle - and special kudos Brigitta Dau and Chiara Zanni. I also enjoy Tyne Daly's performance, though I'm not generally a fan of her work. Finally, the dancing Shriners is a riot, especially dorky three in the bar. The movie is suitable for the whole family, and I highly recommend it.
