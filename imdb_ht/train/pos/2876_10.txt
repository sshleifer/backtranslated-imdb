The story of Cinderella is one of my favorites from Charles Perrault, and Sleeping Beauty which has also been made in a Disney movie in 1959; This movie is a sweet, magical masterpiece from Disney. <br /> <br /> The movie has a great band; One I love in a movie is a very good soundtrack, and I love the songs as well; My favorite song is the boyfriend "So this is love." I love the mice from the movie too, they are beautiful. My favorite scene is the scene after the story, the little birds tried to wake up Cinderella up in the morning; I also like it when Cinderella's cattle friend (mice and birds) arranged up Cinderella's birth-mother clothes, so she could go to the ball ... until Drizella & Anastasia tore her to bits, b ** ** la!
