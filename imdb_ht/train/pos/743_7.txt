This work is struck by its accurate illustrations of young life at the time of its execution. Even though this is a great generalization, parents at that time were too self-absorbed to be real parents, and those who were home tends to be so far distracted from the real issues where children were concerned. This movie teaches us how to let go, even when it is painful, and to do this with a sweet, saddeness, but to inform style where Foster talks philosophy about feeling the pain in life. I loved this scene. It was my favorite scene in the movie, actually. The transition from the wedding funeral meant to show that life goes on, and so we must. Baio's skateboarding in a packet of goons and outrunning has meant to show us that the troubled times will pass, and we mean that they get into them, at best times. <br /> <br /> The whole metaphor of "moving on," and the procession of life, is present throughout the movie, and it serves for us hope, in the end. <br /> I love this movie, though I do not watch it often, as it tends to make me sad. <br /> It should not be seen by young children, and probably only those who have risen in the 1970s -80s would. <br /> It rates a 7.4 / 10 from ... <br /> <br /> The Fiend:.
