ANCHORS AWEIGH is an entertaining MGM music that fans of the genre will enjoy but I would not miss it up with the classic like SINGIN in the rain or the WAGON BAG. This was the first of three musicals that Gene Kelly and Frank Sinatra appeared in together. Kelly and Sinatra play Joe Brady and Clarence Doolittle, the sailor on the Hollywood holiday that promotes a young boy (Dean Stockwell) that introduces them to his young (Kathryn Grayson) actress who struggles to work as a supplement to MGM. Though both guys were attracted to Grayson, he eventually voiced a preference to Joe, but Clarence later hooked with a waitress (Pamela Britton) who, learning from his city in Brooklyn. The paper-thin sketch leaves room for several great musical numbers including "We Hate From", Joe and Clarence in their fellow sailors as they leave the boat; Grayson's pronunciation pronounced "Jalousie"; The movie of dreams in the reality of "I fall in love too easy" (a number that is sadly deleted in some prints of this movie), and "The Worry Song", a fantasy dance that Kelly does with the animated Jerry Mouse Out of Tom and Jerry fame. Kelly also made a sort of Bo Bandit Fantasy Ballet that rivals her Ballet Pirate in later PIRATE. Kelly is in the peak shape here, in a robust and energetic performance that earns her only Oscar nomination for best actress and character endearingly shy sinatra here is endlessly sexy. An entertaining rehab for fans of the MGM music factory.
