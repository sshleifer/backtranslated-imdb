This is undeniably the hideous game I've ever played. It's not the average shoot-everything-that-move type FPS (which I usually do not care for so much), but acceptable gfx, exciting and magic weapons, great sirkophysical sounds ("Scryeeee, scryeeee ..") and higher to all incredible atmosphere. I love the scry, allowing you, in some places in the toys, to see or hear events that have happened in the past. The only game I had to take regular break after a few minutes to play just because of the intensity of the atmosphere. I'm a big fan of horror, essentially in Clive Barker's story and movies, and participating in a horror story like this makes me crave for more games that emphasize atmosphere and a more involved story. 9/10 (-1 because I have no FPS fans, and maybe the game was a bit short?)
