Eskimo is a serious film about the cultural difference between a homeland and the white population. Although filmed in a seemingly non-professional documentary style, Eskimo is a skilled production that has a credible history audience will want to see in the final shot. The native Eskimos simply have different beliefs and behaviors about women and life than making their dark landscape candles. When an eskimo man loses his wife, it's natural that others share women and friends. It is also normal for women to want to take the place of the missing spouse. All of this seems natural in the context of the deforestation of Arctic environment foreboding. Eskimo in confidence falls into the unscrupulous white scrupulous (with heavy European accents) that do not see those natives as equal. Deceit, drunken origin, rape, and death occur after the Eskimo people go for work on the cold ice. Eventually the lead Eskimo (mala) realized he was scam and took revenge. The audience would have the strength of the 1930s. <br /> Enter the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and the moral dilemma of whether to bring back Mala for trial. Mountains play as feel policemen who know this is not a case off and dry. Can the mountains find people? Does it just keep Mala in a code of outward behavior in its traditional society? Is there a way out that does not punish Mala? Is it inevitable that the law of the white man must have? Is not hope for innocence? <br /> This is not a big movie, but one that you will enjoy for the depth of the problem is addressed in a very different environment. I suspect that the movie sequences and animals made before warning today that none were wounded in making the movie - so beware of the raw nature sequence. Very recommended.
