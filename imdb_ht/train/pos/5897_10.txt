This movie needs to be placed on DVD. It was so funny and I loved it. Really, really nice and funny. Not realistic, but not supposed to be. The only thing I did not like about it was the girl relying on the guy too much. It represents time period of thinking. I was trying to get this movie for a long time and was available for US only format in the UK and will not play on US DVD players. It is unfortunately a movie about film movie! Believe it or not, but this movie could easily become a favorite cult for all ages. Too bad, we do not legalize certain things that could really save our small or our own country. Lindy is impractical, a positive character that makes lemonade from lemons. It's funny and good. He stole the show!
