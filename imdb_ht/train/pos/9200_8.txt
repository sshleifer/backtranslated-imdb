I have read countless of posts about this game being so similar to Max Payne, when I played it the first time I thought it was a bit strange arcade game like with a desire to rip off the Max Payne style (by only bullet time). So when I played it for a couple of hours I realized how much fun it is! and how different from "Max Payne", yeah the bullet time is a bit different, but I think it fits differently in the game-style. This game is a non-stop action - a mix between a shoot'em up and a battle'em up, so much fun, as a big fan of Max Payne I must say that the storyline of DTR is not close to the greatness of Max Payne, The graphics are somewhat averaging and some of the levels look the same, but if you want a bit more of that "bullet-time" you should definitely own this game.
