I saw this film at Birmingham South College in 1975, when it was shown in combination with the red balloon. Both films are similar in their dreamlike style. Many of the films entice a fish swim happily in her bowl while her new owner, a boy, is away from school. A cat enters the room where the fish and bowls are, and begins to stalk its "beasts". The boy starts walking home from school, and the wonderwalker sees it will happen in time to save his fish friends. The fish gets tense by the presence of the cat, and finally jumps out of the bowl! The cat quickly walked over the fish, slowly pick it up with his skin and return it to his bowl. The boy returns happily to his fish, no wiser. <br /> <br /> The finish is amazing in both its irony and its technical complexity. It's hard to imagine how the director could pull the feat back technique back in 1959 - it looks more like a trick for 2003. If you can find it, look it - you will not be disappointed! But if you * get * get it, let me know so I can get a copy, too!
