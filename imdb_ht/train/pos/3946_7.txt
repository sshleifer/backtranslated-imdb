I found the one and only comment on this movie entirely uninformative and altogether too hard, so I decided to write my own. I saw this first movie when it came out and kept it a few times more since then. First of all let me say that, in general, the things that this film become the Right is what makes it worthwhile. It does not matter that it has some budgetary and low-budget budgets. It is worth watching. The idea of ​​sitting on a movie in Walt Whitman's visit to a restrictive, narrow-minded Anglo-Canadian community in South Ontario and bringing people into life is a brilliant mis-en-scene. The film is about the type of humanizing catalysis Whitman inspired by people. And in that sense it is exactly accurate. Acting - especially by Rip Torn (Whitman) and Colm Feare as the doctor - is good. The scripting and dialogue are strong and pay proper attention to the dead and inflection of the time. In general, what does not like? In addition, the name of another film in which Whitman has been so clear in life?
