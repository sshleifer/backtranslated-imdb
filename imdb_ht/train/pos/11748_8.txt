Tripping on. I must say the first time I was a little shameful at the first few episodes, but there was confidence in the show, with Abe Forsythe's unprecedented talent, I continued to look. I can safely say I am happy now that I did. The story has developed well, and all characters have a solid basis, and most have no information missing. <br /> <br /> The only thing I can fault in producing this is a bit annoying voice and pronunciation owned by the character Lizzie. <br /> Some good act coupled with a stellar plot really gets this show on the line. Here's waiting for another season!
