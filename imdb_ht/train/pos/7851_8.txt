Kipitar's revenge is a short strangely not because of the subject (adultery) or because it animates (Winsor McCay has introduced Little Nemo on film by this time), but because it depicts the bugs telling the story! Ladislaw Starewicz was originally wanted to fight current bug films but he could not get to do it on camera because of the hot light they had suffered for taking the dead and started using suspended techniques to manipulate his satisfaction movement. This short one does a great job of putting people's features on small animals like motorcycle riding, painting, filming, kissing, and dancing. Starewicz would also make Frogland (1922) and the Mascot (1933) but his first remarkable job would be this one. If you are interested in this and the other shorts mentioned, check out your local library to lend DVD to Revenge at Cameraman't and other Fantastic Tales from Entertainment Artwork.
