Nearly all films take place in a public bath in China. There is no fancy sex, explosion or glamorous person - just write well, act and direction (Hollywood, take notes!). A man turns back home when he believes his father is dying. It is surprising to see that Dad looks fine and is going to run the family business as usual. In fact, he noticed that his father and his late brother had really forged a tight and caring relationship and soon became evident that he was from the village! The very traditional father and this son's visit is from the big city and does not really see the value of the old ben. How to shift relationships with where the plot comes from has exceptional and credible. I was pleased to see that not all Chinese films are a picture of action (such as those beginning to Jet Li or Tiger Couples, Hidden Dragon), as I do not particularly care for the frenetic films. The shower as well as Springtime in a small town are two wonderful examples of fine Chinese films about people!
