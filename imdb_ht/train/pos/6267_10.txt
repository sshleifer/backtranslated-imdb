I thought the original of this movie was picturesque and spacious as well as I sat on the corner of my chair trying to figure it out. Since I've already seen the original, when I saw this on Sci Fi Channel - I do not know if this notice was deliberately made for Sci Fi - I knew it was the first few minutes. Since I love Richard Burgi as a character actor, I wanted to see how he would pull it off. <br /> <br /> The writers / producers etc., upgrading the movie a bit by trying to explain the plight of the "aliens" (They can not reproduce their own kind and need help) using the same science The pseudo has been stacked in our ears in the 90's. Maybe he added a bit of the Polish movie, or not. <br /> <br /> This movie. Movie? This production takes on a more disaster-shaped edge than the original-the original ended with a confrontation between the young woman and the alien and an understanding of quality took place, although there is no resolution to the alien problem. I sort of remember that in this renewal, the woman became rather hostile towards the Burgi / Alien - I think it might have ended better. But the finish is just finishing off, and the thread is a swollen thread, being at the core of the Fiction Stock Science stock 1958. Many great science fiction stories were written in the 50's and some of them even made it to the movie. This is something swollen to look like a rainy day or something. I rate her very cash from all the remakes of the Sci Fi 50 old, this one has come on well. I actually liked this quite a bit. But if someone really wants to see this story said well, I suggest the original 1958 version with Tom Tyron and Gloria Talbott, directed by Gene Fowler Jr.
