I had previously thought that this film was the lamest of the Muppet films. I would like to now remove the statement. In my opinion now, the film MUppet lamest was her TV movie in a wonderful MERRY MUPPET Christmas, I'm a really cut off that was really obnoxious. MUPPETS MAKE MANHATTAN nothing special, but miles more enjoyable than the MERRY MUPPET Christmas. <br /> <br /> The best songs are that 'You can not name for a song' response, one of the Muppet baby songs and songs for the ultimate great head. As I liked the Muppet Babies TV show, I liked the baby Muppet sequence here (I say that it was inspired by Muppet Babies to show) <br /> <br /> MANHATTAN MELODIES to show itself the real show , and Muppets from Sesame Street even appear for the wedding. As Kermit puts it in his final line 'What's the best way to do anything? '. But I hope that that was between the beginning and the end was a bit more fun. There are beautiful quotes from Brooke Shields and Gregory Hines with a great dance sequence from Rizzo and the Rats (choreograph by late, great Jim Henson himself) and the movie certainly entertain. I must point out even though MAPPET MOVIE, GREAT MAPPET CAPER and MOPPET Christmas Carol are three definite MUPF movies.
