Very good martial arts movie and Jet It is the best since the master himself Bruce Lee .It is excellent as the key librarian key / cop that survives ever and again. It has a presence and a look that is riveting and credible as the kung fu king that you do not mess with .Francoise Yip is simply beautiful in that race mixed original way unique because of her mixed heritage, she has an innocent and an attractive all at the same time that I found unforgettable .The guy, the man with sunglasses and long hair was very good as well but I can not find his name in the credit, can one help me out with that? Thanks! Enjoy Hak Hap or Black Mask, in any of its good entertainment languages!
