I already liked "How the Grinch Stole Christmas" when she was released and I still love it now, 5 years later. Still many people seem to agree with my opinion and this movie has never really got much love at the time it comes out. <br /> <br /> Sure, the movie is over-the-top with campy, but that's the very same is also the reason why this movie is so good and fun to watch. All of the costumes, costumes and characters they make perfectly on-the-top in a fun way, without ever becoming really ridiculous. It's a spectacular vision film to watch. It's a movie movie to make at its best! Director Ron Howard really surprises with this Christmas little fun. <br /> <br /> The main reason the movie works and why it's so much fun to watch is Jim Carrey as the Grinch. He really brings the movie with his good and fun role. It is of course helped by convincing the make-up, which also received an Academy Award. Of course if you are a Jim Carrey hate you should not even think about watching this movie. This movie is really its movie and it does it all with great fun to watch. Other fun and memorable roles were played by Jeffrey Tambor, Clint Howard and Josh Ryan Evans as the young Grinch. The movie has a good moral but it's all a bit tired of me. Maybe it's because I'm Dutch and we do not really celebrate Christmas that is enthusiastically as well as here, as in the United States or England. For me the movie was simply fun and fun and just let me quite cold to be honest. The sound of music by James Horner is good and fun, though it's your average daily Horner thing, it's still all working perfectly for the movie and helps make some of the scene work. <br /> <br /> Perfect Christmas entertainment. <br /> <br /> 8/10
