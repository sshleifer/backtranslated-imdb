Superman and the moles guys are extremely difficult superman warnings of all time. <br /> <br /> Lois Lane and Clark Kent are sent to Silsby, home to deeper oil in the world well. While there are some radioactive moles coming into the oil well and exploring the city. Jeff Corey and many other townspeople try to dispose of the invading moles. Is superman changing the way people in time to save the moles guys? Does Superman warn the people of time about the radioactive dangers of the molten people? <br /> <br /> In my opinion, the Superman and the Mole Men are a very clever, well-written and well-acting movie. Even if we only get to see Superman flying once a while, He always does a great superman adventure. A must see for anyone. <br /> 10/10 Stars
