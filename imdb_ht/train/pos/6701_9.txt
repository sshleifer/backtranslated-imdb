I really liked the first 2 seasons. because a lot of good characters disappear later on. as most shows are a bit slowing at first then get better in later times, but this is absolute reverse. Jenny from the 1st season and Valarie from the 2nd season were Sabrina's friends, I really did not care for the others, Jenny and Valarie were her coolest friends. I think for some reason, the producers wanted us not to love their college friends for some reason, being so cruel to Sabrina. but my favorite episode from epic 1 is cat showdown and my favorite episode from season 2 is garbage witch, that is the funniest episode. I thought it was funny as Libby was popular but she was still jealous of Sabrina, and never seemed to be a real companion but she still wanted them and Harvey. I just wanted to be able to make more people. I also liked how the first 2 seasons, while the open credit Sabrina would say a few words while wearing a costume, as in the pilot episode where he's witch costume, I liked how he said "this is not me "and later on being caught trying to change herself to something else is what I think, but this is a really cool show. It's kind of like the ety griffith show in a way because it's good at first but once it turns colors and barney fleeing left, it was again good. but I still love watching it, but the only reason I look late later is because of sabrina. What I mean about the sequence of the opening is: The opening titles of Sabrina's 1st Sabrina showcase a glass of ice and several different costumes and crews as their cast members quickly flash on the bottom of the screen. In the end, Sabrina would say some sort of punk related to the outfit she put, then disappear. The opening sequence of four seasons includes the characters of bubbles. Credit is open in 5-7 season Sabrina features in various locations around Boston
