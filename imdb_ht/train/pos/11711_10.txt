The story of Patty Duke's story about her life and struggle with manic depression was just like my life's struggle. I saw myself acting just like her. I was surprised at the similarity of our lives to include sexual abuse that we both endure as children. <br /> I saw the movie when she first premiered in 1990 and I loved this movie very much. Anyone who has struggled with depression manyak could get so much from this movie. Never think about whether she has shown her awards or what she has to. That's not the problem here. The problem is how Ms Duke had a disease and fought to survive it and beat. Ms. Duke is very proud of her achievements and her struggle to survive in a disease that often leaves many victims without hope. Unless someone struggled with this illness personally they do not know the hell they have to live with. The movie was a success because it showed the real issues and how a depressed man and manic acts. It was so real ... So, so real. It was like watching my head up on screen. <br /> I wish I could thank Mrs. Patty Duke in person for the courage to let the public know about her illness. Bocka
