This animation is a must-see for Evangelion fans. It is an earlier work of Anno Hideaki, but his frantic, dramatic style is well-in-place. Also, those who did not like Evangelion might find this release in somewhat more palatable bit. Gunbuster is rather unique to sci-fi anime that it actually is based on real science. In fact, the show contains several little "Science Lesson" interludes explaining the physics behind some of the events in the movie. One of the dramatic dramatic points in the movie is the relative passage of time at speeds near light. The series makes a great deal of dealing with the traumatic imaginative experience of leaving earth for a six-month mission traveling near the speed of light and returning to Earth at ten years. The main character remains age 17 or 18 throughout the range while almost all the other characters are considerably large. Be warned, this show is heavy on the liver of liver. She also had a couple of vaccines in the most unperturbed breast that I had ever seen. I found it fairly easy to ignore the skimpy uniforms and boo-hoo scenes, because the series is otherwise very good, but viewers with a Tol tolerans tolerance might want to stay away from this one. On an interesting note, Gainax, as always, managed to run out of money in the last couple of episodes. However, they managed to use black and white films and still drawing stocks to produce a good resolution anyway. The finish is a bit funny, but it leaves me with a good feeling of my gut I can not help but love it. Gunbuster is, in my opinion, one of the finest pieces of Anime around.
