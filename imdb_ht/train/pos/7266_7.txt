I remember having a very considerate regard for a corporate like this when it was first released. James "by Jim" Belushi, a hammy kid actress, and a cheesy titled in a John Hughes formula. You could not have paid me to see it 15 years ago. But I kept watching her while wasting away a Sunday afternoon, and she hit me on a couple of levels. Story fairy (Party wife, Pretty wife), very vulnerable, Elizabeth_Perkins_in_Miracle_On_42nd_Street -like performance by Kelly Lynch, escapism. Over all, it gently pulls some very nice strings. It's very hard not to fall into the story, developing a crush on Kelly Lynch, identifying with James Belushi, gripping stupid guys to bad guys, and laughing at the Sue Curley lines. Has all the ups and downs, with a happy end, and the type of message you want to hear. Go ahead, waste your time on this movie, it's worth it.
