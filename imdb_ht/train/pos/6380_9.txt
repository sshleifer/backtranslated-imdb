Atlantis: The Lost Empire is a better movie than I thought. I never thought this film would lead to my expectations. True, this movie started to slow down, but as the film put on it became more of my taste. The story takes place in 1914 and is about a guy named Milo. Milo believes in the Atlantis fabled. Together with friends of his grandfather, he bombarded an amazing adventure to his own. Along the way, he must love friendship, betrayal, trust, and much more. Throwing in voice is great. They surely know how to bring movies and their talent only. The music is nothing special, but likable anyway. The animation is not the best, but it's always good enough. In general, this is a good family movie for all ages. I would like this 9/10 movie.
