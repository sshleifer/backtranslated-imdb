Excellent film from Thaddeus O'Sullivan featuring strong performances from an army of British and Irish actors. The film deals well with a thorny subject, and effectively captures the despair and atmosphere atmosphere in the 1970s Belfast. Surprisingly realistic, he does nothing to praise anywhere else in this conflict. On the one hand, it shows a young Catholic father trying to raise his family without getting drawn into the issues. On the other he deals with a loyalist gang who intends to proliferate. Very interesting and, fortunately, fun. Do not expect any laugh, though. 7 out of 10.
