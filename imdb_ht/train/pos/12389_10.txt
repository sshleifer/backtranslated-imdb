Bored with the normal movie, run-of-the-mill to watch this Halloween that I've seen over and over again, I took a chance on the "Sentinel", hoping it can get my horror juice to flowing again. Thank you, I've just come back to seeing the Black Castle rumor in the "Haunted Hill House" - complete with pronounced crap. Fortunately, the "Sentinel" MY BLESS! In a story featuring a model that moves in a creepy building in Brooklyn Hights, the movie offers everything I hope to get in a good movie - (1) Campy and fantastically juicy characters, trades and dialogues, which have including turning hilarious by Christopher Walken, Jeff Goldblum and especially Martin Balsam, as an absent teacher - (2) Terror Fear! Do not give a far frame, but there are scenes of this movie that are cold to me in my pancreas - (3) Fantastic Gore, terrific make-up and wacky (if very uneven) direction from Michael Winner, which flows rather nicely and this real treat. If you liked "Evil Dead 2", "Dead Alive" and "Deep Rising" - this will be your queen of favorites. Just emphasize my love for this movie - after I watched her for the first time, jaw-dropped, I rewound her and watch her again. It is now one of the favorites of all time. Make yourself a favor and check it out!
