Very good except for the end that was a big disappointment. The script was very good as it did. The visuals were often very green, but in a way added to the movie as the snowy features were in good places that helped create an attitude towards the movie. This affected was ruined by the extremely incredible finish. <br /> I was going to give this movie an 8 out of ten but the finish hit it down a point to 7 because it seemed to leave radically from the first 75 minutes of the movie and seemed strained to end Make the movie makers look smart. This film was even better than film and quite a lot of bigger budgets and seemed to be filmed as a home movie and some extra equipment. Not much in the way of special effects as they go, but for suspense it was very good.
