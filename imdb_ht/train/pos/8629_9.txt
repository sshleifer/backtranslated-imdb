I read a few ads in some horror magazines in the early nineties about Love of Totes (the love of the deceased) or something similar. This course awakens my curiosity for I ordered Norromorphic 1 & 2 and Der Todesking (King's death). Nekromantik films are ok, the same interesting and unique types of approaches to the subject Necrophilia (though they are obviously entertaining therapist-opera rather than intending to invoke fear of the viewers themselves, they are actually quite funny.) <Br> <br /> TODESKING, on the other hand,, in my opinion, one of the best films ever done. It consists of a series of scenes depicting many aspects of death. Death as an enemy; Death as a religious, Death as the very physical decomposition of the body. The film is a metaphorical life. It shows how vulnerable life is and how short our lives are. It reduces its viewers to the children (we) actually are. The fact that we can not really understand the nature of death, and hence the process of dying is the basic message of the movie. This is a more realistic film. Never Buttgereit tries to hide death behind white roses or whatever. Regardless of your moral standards, death is inevitable, and it will sooner or later be a fiction but your reality. This applies to YOU, Dear readers, as it applies to the viewers of the movie. Some juvenile revisions seem not to understand this, which is completely excused, since they of course live forever ... <br /> This is not movie exploitation. Why? Because death does not exploit people. He has harvested us. We grow seven days, then we are brought back to the schopenhauerian state at birth before, that's death. Buttgereit gives us his version of the oldest in account. Whether you choose to consider it as "optimistic" or "pessimistic" is up to you. At first glance it may look pretty black. Consider though, that in order for something to live, something else must die. "Who Wants to Live Forever?" <br /> I believe that when Buttgereit shows a body, being burned by maggots, it shows not only the decomposition, but the generation of new life. Is it not best to die and give life to maggots and then birds and eventually become ground, than to survive the living zombie which is one of the favorite animals in the genre? <br /> <br /> When you realize this, you see Todesking read its right context. <br /> <br /> Seven days were the week, seven times the last time. Seven is the weekday (weak, mortal!), Seven times the last hour. <br /> <br /> Do not fear Reaper, Buttgereit tells us, because the Reaper takes only what is ripe. And apples that do not hack for food will rot! <br /> <br /> There is a good life, fellow IMDB'ers! (And watch this movie, which compares only to Ingemar Bergmans "Sixth Seal" in terms of depth and universities)
