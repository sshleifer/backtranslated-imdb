What a fun full, sexy movie! They certainly do not like them again. 4 sexy athlete arrives in London and have all sorts of sexual movements. The tone is odd innocence, as the considerable nudity evolves out of culture stability situations, rather than any sexual desire desire on the part of the characters. It is only when the actresses accidentally lose clothes that the male characters become rampant. Richard O 'Sullivan literally becomes' Randi' (sugar). The film certainly draws the origins of the softcore feature as lying in the nudie cuties and nature films in the old school. My special interest in 'Au Pair' Girls is that I'm a big fan of Gabrielle Drake. If any actress has ever looked best naked (it's slim, but pretty curve), or clothes, come to that (I loved it since the original run of UFO - which others could bring in a red color wig Violet!), I'll eat my hat.
