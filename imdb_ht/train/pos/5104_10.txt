This is a smart drama on the way to life in a tonk Texas sponge in the early 1980s. John Travolta and Debra Winger turned out to be very credible as Bud and Sissy Davis. This movie really opens the country music scene and helps presents America in the mechanical bull. If you love a good romance movie, then you will love this movie.
