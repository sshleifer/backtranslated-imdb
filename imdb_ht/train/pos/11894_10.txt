A really adorable heroine who, in turn, is surprised and afraid not to throw, wrestle and mattress, run full-on in closed doors ... just some of the brightest moments in my memory of the 'naked truth'. I love what I take in this show: enjoyable daffy cemetery and some good characters to support the environment for the diamond in the show - Tea Leoni as 'Nora Wilde'; beautiful, clownish, and beautiful crash-trends - How refreshing to see an actress who can clown - it's no wonder Hollyood does not seem to know how to throw it. But where-oh-WHERE are they releasing DVDs? The amount of (blow) is released, it's incredible that this little gem continues to be buried. (Someone please correct me if I'm wrong.)
