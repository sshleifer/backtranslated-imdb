'Loulou' delights in the same way as a good, quality French wine. It leaves you with a very good taste. <br /> <br /> 'Loupe's theme is not new. The film does not bring an original scheme either. Her colored picturer shows fine, but not extraordinary. Its surroundings are serious. Her elegant style never and nowhere to put any weight on yourself. Whatever another can say about 'Loulou', it's beyond doubt that this very French movie means its excellent acting. The three convincing leads reflect many doubts and dazzling brilliant between them, making the plot alive. Acting to fully invite you to participate, make friends. <br /> For people around the clock, 'Loulou' also provides an extra bonus: attitude perfectly taken in 1980.
