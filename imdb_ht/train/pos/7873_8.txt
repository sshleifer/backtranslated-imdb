Page 3 is most definitely a very enthralling and fascinating eye-box that is very cleverly exposed to the hypocritical lifestyles of the Mumbai elite. From the fake kisses of the smashed smiles, leaving no unturned stones to reveal the shocking lives of the rich and the famous. Backstabbing, gossip, bribery, and scandal persist in every dark corner of the world of glitz and glam. Humanity and generosity are analogous to an oasis in the desert in this world where social Darwinism is the dominant mentality. Everyone is constantly craving for more money, more fame, and a higher reputation, driving them to make the most shameful imaginable things out of signing film contracts at a funeral in childhood molestation. Anything is possible in this metropolis where there is a difference as wide between social classes. The audience saw the shrewdness of both of these classes in the eyes of the protagonist. It observes the suffocating atmosphere and the mind-boggling insanity that society lives in. Bollywood, business tycoons, politicians, and midfielder are all tied to a completely complicated mess! Kitje Ajeeb Hai is a beautiful track as is the peppy Kuan Main Doob Jaongi. Horror movie and excellent character development!
