There are movies, and there are movies. Movies are more often than not simply cinemas "candy," whereas the films are true in art. Fraulein Doctor is certainly well placed in the letter. As most viewers, I was very impressed with the battle scene, but the poignancy of the painter of the central character is what I consider to be the best of sterling in the movie. Did you do everything possible to serve his country as a true daughter of Germany, all the time in the thrills of addiction morfin, deceiving Fraulein to be treated highly by the German high commander despite all of his efforts. The scene at which the doctor was targeted in the chair behind a Mercedes Benz auto order, by itself, desolation, and sobbing is perhaps one of the sad yet dreamlike dreams of a "spy" of many lives. Only emotional pain is presented by Richard Burton of spyware that came in from the cold to come off. Fraulein Doctor is a film far deeper than one can be achieved on a singular look. I only want its producers to see it fit on DVDs so people who have never experienced it can, and those who have seen it may again (maybe again and again) enjoy this picture of outstanding movements.
