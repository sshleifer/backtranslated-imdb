This is probably Karisma in its best, apart from Zubeidaa. Nana Patekar also gives out his best, without even trying. The story is very good at times but in the end seems to drag, especially when Shahrukh comes in the picture. What really made me like the performance of their drive, the delivery of dialogue, as well as the story, for what it was. He could have been leading better, and edited. The support was even bigger, including Karima's mother in law, though she just had one shining moment, it was great to look at her. <br /> <br /> lying was also pretty good. I did not really like to paint them in a Canadian family, but once they step into India, it's as real as it gets. <br /> Overall, I'd give it a thumb up!
