I loved it! Fred MacMurray is wonderful as Skid Johnson, a bit proud, proud yet at the same time highly vulnerable Saxophone player who is in love with Maggie (Carole Lombard), who always has for him. They met in Panama after Maggie from a boat and finished in a bar with Anthony Quinn. Tony gets punched in the nose after insulting her Maggie does not think she's a loose woman - all because she had taken her hat off to the public. Big brawl and Maggie finished upstairs in Panama. Romance. Carole and Arthur are great together. Maggie is always there for her every time she needs it. He encourages her to go to NY where (well watch the movie and find out). They have the wonderful scenes along which he sings in his arms while playing the saxophone. I definitely recommend it.
