Paul Reiser is one of my favorite people in business shows. I read both of her books and think it's great. Peter Faulk can deliver a punch line with the best of them. The combination of the two is magic. This is a story about a family really come to know each other. Through a road trip of a father and son connecting for the first time in their mid-life lives in a family crisis. They do everything ancestors and children believe they do in life ... they just do them a lot later in life. The situations are very funny, but they feel that they can actually reach people in real life (not obsurdly on the top or cartoonish). This is the first time I look at Paul Reiser and fully believes all the emotions described. Sometimes his eyes look so sad. <br /> <br /> Gret movie with great stories and draws. It has comedy and emotion but an uplift message ... Olympia Dukakas does a good job too :)
