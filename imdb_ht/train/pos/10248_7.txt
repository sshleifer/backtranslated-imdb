I first heard of this movie after purchasing 1976 flickering the "Snuff" movie. I said that the Devil's experience was so great that I naturally went ahead and ordered the pig guinea pig. I was really interested to hear that Charlie Sheen was out trying to ban either this movie or the second one, so my interest was some. The Devil's Experience is a short film with no history, no character development. Just 3 people tortured a woman for about 45 minutes. He tortured him in various ways like beating him, spinning it in the circle over and over again then forcing him to drink alcohol, forcing him to listen to hi-pitched noise for 24 hours, breaking his hands 'with a mallet, burn and put maggots on burns, send bowel into it, and finally blush a sharp needle in his eyes. <br /> <br /> I must say that a lot of this movie was fake, like the beat scenes. But then, some of it was actually well done as far as grossing you out. The scene in which the woman is being spun around in circles made me dizzy. Or the scene in which he was forced to listen to sharp sounds for 24 hours is painful thinking about. The worst is the eye scenes. I did not fly when watching it, but simply thought "damn, which looks very good for such a low budget film." I enjoyed the cops but I do not know if I can really recommend this unless you've seen most of that genre the horror has to offer. 7/10
