Here is one movie that is really funny at every single moment that it covers. How can they not give this film to the creators of South Park and is directed by David Zucker? When I first saw this film, I did'nt immediately realize that Coop and Doug were really Matt and Trey but their talent to act and writing out as quite impressive. I was surprised to learn that they were really Matt and Trey, later on. Humor is sometimes rough, sometimes bad, sometimes brilliant, sometimes subtle, sometimes loud and sometimes stupid but in general, this is one hell of a film that is undoubtedly, beneath rated. Well actually, its crazy. Totally crazy.
