Shawshank, godfather, pulp fiction ... all good movie. Great movie. But nothing, and I mean nothing live up to the greatest Christmas movie at all, Santa Claus. <br /> <br /> The movie is so great and it has lots of messages, I shouted as I watched it. Seriously, this is one of these movies you need to watch 10 times. When we see Pitch get said he will have to eat ice cream, we see the sadness in his eyes, and we feel deep sorrow, and then we ask ... what's so wrong about that the ice cream? Does it mean that we as humans treat ice cream as good as all that it does is wrong? Thinking movie makes you think. This film has better pronounced in Santa Claus ever. Unlike other Santas, it is a normal person. We see him prisoners of children and spy on childhood dreams, and we wonder; is the Santa we believe in really good? Also, this Santa actually mentions Christ, the whole meaning behind Christmas. <br /> <br /> You must yourself to watch this cinema masterpiece. We should just stop making movies and when there is nothing but this season 24/7. Whether it's Christmas or not, this film gets a 500/10. Anyone who tells this movie is bad is a foolish ignorant.
