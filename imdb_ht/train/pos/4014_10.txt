Spoiler for anyone lucky enough to ever see this movie (so do not really shake after all). See this film when it was released and can always remember the part of it. It's all set in a small town in the west or the rest of this city. It looks more like a ghost town and few people. Among them a couple, where the wife is especially cruel. He allowed his man to die at the end of the film and left the city, but he crossed the desert. We never know what's going on next to her, but just before she left her dead shoots after she and deliberately did not hit her, and instead ran the water. It is not aware of as soon as it will be very thirsty. Mark Damon killed a couple of bad guys in a funny mania - but that's another story, which I do not remember too much. The remaining impressions of the film was that it was one of the first times I saw a really cruel woman on film, who pretended to be anything but cruel - can not be compared to the witch of 'Snowwhite', who , in comparison it is easy to get out. Very tight west with some main characters and still absorbed.
