Identical pig hack, a babe, a safe, a plane and a baby. Add them all up and you get the best comedy you've never heard of. <br /> Even with some a-star list (at least one-less ... okay, b-plus?) this movie has gotten very little advertisements. Do not reduce its genius. <br /> <br /> writing horrible, solid deliveries and a credible group of characters. There are some really classic lines, and a fun twist at the end. <br /> <br /> This is not some rust-down "Nutty Professor" comedy. These are low-life guys. They speak the language of life bad language guys and they do things low-life bad guys. But they do it for your entertainment and entertainment, and they do well. <br /> One of the best comedy I've ever seen.
