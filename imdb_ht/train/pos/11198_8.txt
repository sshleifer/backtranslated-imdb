Hitchcock exhibits her understanding of the early life of this film very early in silence. The plot of the movie, involving two boxers fighting on a girl, is drama-forward drama without much recommending it. Hitchcock's talent, though, is found in stunning use of images. Almost each shot is filled with visual symbols. Especially memorable is the jewelry that one boxer gives the girl just before he marries the other boxer. She slips her up in a clear and sexual way with a single simple movement Hitch showed us all we need to know. The boxing scene occupies well with some point-of-view shots that prove again how far ahead of her time was Hitchcock. The film also provides insight into her later treatment of women. The object of boxers' desire is to drive by money and lust, not to purpose or love. Only other women in the movie are either beautiful party girls who offer open sex or old crowns that help destroy happy relationships. All in the ring is a must for anyone interested in Hitchcock's early works and its development as a visual audience.
