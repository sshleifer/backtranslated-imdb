I liked the quiet quietness of the first part, acting in Pacino and Cusak, especially scenes together. Humidity in the environment and the juxtaposition of the old pole and the young idealist was effective. I wish Bridget Fonda had more stage in the movie; It was a serious and appealing character. The film went to the rails for me when the assistant mayor started to snooping around the mafioso to get to the bottom of something his boss clearly did not want him to mingle. No one right idea would encounter a mafioso on an abandoned pier at a Junkyard. Here the story became plausible. Something I do not understand: why the cop and Vito have a shootout if the latter has provided information that could bring down the corrupt judge?
