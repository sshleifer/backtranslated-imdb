Besides the fact, that's all in awesomeness this movie has risen beyond my expectations, this masterpiece of portrait movies spoil the bad filters to it's best! Paul Johansson and Craig Sheffer show a brotherconflict and all include it. As a woman usually agrees to her true intention. The end became as astounding as unforssen as the murder of Keith Scott by his older brother. The scene of 'wiking country' is just as I remember it in my early trip. - To honestly my strong passion for garbage films make this one a must have in my never-ending collection. <br /> I recommend this movie to everyone in love and cast most awesome brothers from One Tree Hill. <br /> <br /> -Odin-
