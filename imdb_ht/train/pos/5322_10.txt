A true movie movie black film with a very graphic movie, beautiful scenario of a man pursuing redemption, which could have just left it all too late. Visually there are some really wonderful artistic scenes as what can be done with a minimal budget. Full Mark of Gareth Maxwell Roberts and team, I look forward to the next project with new ideas although hopefully more British actors would be great. Lisa Ray looks beautiful not to see her before and hopes to see her again in the future. Subject all kinds of sex, drugs and violence. Bring it on. I would definitely say this one rent and check it out if you are in the mood for a Semi Mood semi.
