George Lopez is a funny man even without the sitcom. The first episodes I've seen this too often made jokes at the expense of her mother. As I watched this more, there were more & more varieties. No one on the cast is really safe from his understanding now. <br /> It seems like this season has progressed that George is getting more comfortable with the role of father's family sitcom. At first it was not, but it is getting More & more in a groove. This makes both his & show progressively funnier. Added a couple of characters for George to play this year too. His wife's father is getting more and more involved in the plot. Her mother still has, but not as central as past season. I think it is cautious to tell George's sense of distributing comics, and the ABC's lack of good sitcom, George Lopez has a good chance of being here on ABC long after George W. Bush.
