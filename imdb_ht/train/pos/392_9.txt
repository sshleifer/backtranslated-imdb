Legend of Zu, as I saw it, was a very interesting story. I think many of the people who did not like it did not see the mythology hid behind the movie. They expected something analogues of Star Wars, and it was not that. Joseph Campbell, I believe, would like this movie. There was a number of metaphors and hidden meanings that an average viewer could have neglected. We all have a mountain of the sword in us. We all have to go to our own cave sometime in our lives. We all have to face our own insomnia a day. Granted some of the narratives were a bit confusing, and some of the action got a little hokey at times, but I think the other point in the movie was readily made for it. I would look again. I do not know if there is a difference between the Zu Zu legend (which I saw in Mandarin with the English translation) and Zu warrior (dubbed USA version.) It might have been dumbed down for American audience, which really would was detracted from this movie.
