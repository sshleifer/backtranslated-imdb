This is the most compelling and excellent performance that Robert Taylor has ever provided. She even surpassed her wonderful performance as "Johnny eager" comes a full 14 years after that movie. Its dreams are always a wonder to see, but it has a maturity now that gives him the edge of this fearless, violent role. Charlie Gilson (Taylor) is the last of her breed, a Buffalo hunter who is killed by the money, but for the fun. Wild in his eyes not only Buffalo but human beings, is stunning to look. It is basically a lonely man, who needs people around him, but to flu him because of his sociopathic behavior. His partner is Sandy McKenzie (Stewart Granger) who is sick of the hunt, and only goes along, because he's a failure of anything else. Along the way Charlie kills a family of Indians and captures the beautiful Debra Pagent. Charlie tries to seduce her at no avail, but she sees that Sandy is interested in her too. Granger is kind of sad to look, so fed up with the hunt, longing to go with the girl and her baby. Lloyd Nolan as the drunken diner is wonderful with his wise crap and playing acoustic. Russ Tamblyn plays half crosses trying to fit into a white world. The group is an odd mix of good and evil, young and old. At the end of Taylor gets spooked by the Buffalo, as many hunters before her, and ran away from Sandy and the girl. When his return was gone, this night Sandy left with the woman, putting Charlie off on a rampage of killing in a quest to get Sandy and having the girl for herself. The final confrontation comes in a snowstorm and the latest scene is so shocking that you have never forgotten it. She is Taylor's film all the way and she's really a very obnoxious actor in the era.
