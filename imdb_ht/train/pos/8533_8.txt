This movie is more Lupine then most, especially from Funimation. Other then the bad dub, it's not bad. <br /> <br /> The first hour is a lot like the comic (which is what all the Lupine 3rd-Based Thing). Lupine is trying to get a great treasure. Fujiko is using Lupine's weakness for women to try to find something out of it. The last bit is not wrong, it's with another woman, but of course Fujiko is still his single number. A lot of other Lupine movies are more Family with Cuss then Lupine. Any good Lupine fan I think they will be pleasantly surprised (I know I was after hearing many bad things about this movie). It might be a bit better without their animation little rolling during the credits (they make it a little mushy) but in general, it's not a bad movie. Good enough to be one of the few I would look again at the Lupine III movies.
