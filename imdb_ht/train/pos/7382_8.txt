My short comment for this movie is to pick it up. Chances are you will be positively surprised by a diversity of superbly elements explored in this criminal thriller. There is no way the character of Miklos, claiming and pushing for the room every way possible, by pushing your nerve to the edge ... 2 thumbs up!
