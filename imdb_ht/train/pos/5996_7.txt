Time and time again, I have stated that if people do not want to remade or end doing, they should stop seeing them and the world's most independent film of independent films. After saying that though, last time I saw an independent movie myself was to be easy six months ago. So here's a review for an indie that I was intending to draw in on YouTube; Cure a. <br /> <br /> Straight away, you can say that the movie is going to be an avant-garde film approach that is telegraphed in its use of extreme lock ups, scopophilia and fast editing. She is proud of how she looks - and she has the right to her. For the most part is a very nicely composed little piece, save for an unbeatable inexhaustible rule for 180 degrees and a bad humor shotshow effect that is a phenomenon that seems to call the card for self-funded projects. <br /> <<<<<<<<<<<<<<> <<<<<<<<> <<<<<> <<<<<<<<<<} We present with a good use of accessory and location, good acting and some very atmospheric, liquid correction, which is made more devastating as this is definitely something you will not see very often at all from a Youtube submission. The plot is fragmented and although the basic quiz is fairly simple some can find it difficult to track exactly what's happening, but what we see here is avant-garde telling stories at work; you can not really expect a straightforward act structure and if you do what you might not be ready for this kind of movie. <br /> <br /> Where the movie is unfortunately left down however is the sound. What you will hear at all is a distorted voice that often sounds insensitive and worse still is the continuous background music, which goes to minimal changes and does not add much to anything. So much to pay attention to the visuals that the audio frankly sounds neglected, and this becomes really apparent when you realize you've just missed over four sentences of the narration and have remedial pick up that slip past your attention. > <br /> So give it a look, but do it with the sound off. <br /> <br /> Last thought; Was anyone else reminded of the cover for Roman Dwarf Doug Naylor's "Last Human" early in the movie? If you have the book you know what I mean.
