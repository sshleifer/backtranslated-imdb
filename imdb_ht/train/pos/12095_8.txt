When American author Edgar Allan Poe visited London, he was approached by British journalist Alan Foster, who became the target of a peculiar wager. Do not believe Poe's statement that all of her grim stories are based on real-life experiences, Foster accepts a bet from Poe and her friend Sir Thomas Blackwood that she can not spend a whole night at Blackwood's haunting castle. Once installed in the abandoned castle, Foster discovered that she is not alone, as she is approached by various beautiful women and lovely men, and a physician of metaphysics - who explains that they all lose their souls to replay their stories denises them on the anniversary of their deaths! The first time I looked this cute little in this classic horror, I was mesmerizing the whole time. I found the film really crap and at the same time mourn. Babs Steele is pretty indulgent. The music notes make the atmosphere twice as awkward to induce. The topless scene drove me for a loop, as I did not wait for it. It seems that Synapse has done a great job and photo upgrades, because this movie looks like damn fine for its age, and it's in the Version Version Version, in boots. This movie is responsible for starting a Babes Steele and Kinski collection collection.
