This was a good movie. It did not flick your typical war, but something a bit different. This movie showed us recruiting in pre-war training and does not actually fight a war. This film is one of the more realistic views of war and army than most other films like this has been. Colin Farrel has done a great job in displaying a military recruit with Clifton Collins Jr and Matthew Davis as well. See Colin Farrel moving from grade to class in a few short years, you would never think it would happen. I'll also add that the musicians in Tigerland did a great job in filming a movie in the year 2000 and making it look like 1970 was a good touch. It is good to see talent use wisely and I hope to see this same talent in the near future.
