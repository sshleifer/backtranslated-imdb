I've rarely come from watching a movie with such a hot, happy feeling. I felt as if I was out with really good friends and had a wonderful time! I really enjoy this movie. The act was superb, although I should mention Bill Nye in particular as giving a absolutely blatant performance. Bill is an excellent actor and he wants to see her in more movies. Spall and Jimmy Nail are also favorites and always love to see them as a solid performance. And Billy Connolly, as always, totally gorgeous. It was a great performance ensemble at all concerned. These are a refreshing experience to see a well-written, superbly acting and good-looking movie.
