I've always been a big fan of "Omizid: Life on the Street" so when I heard there was a reunion movie coming up, I could not wait. <br /> Let me just say I was not disappointed at all. It was one of the most powerful 2-hour TVs I've ever seen. It was great to see everyone back, but the bigger fun at all was Andrew Braugher back, because the relationship between Pembleton and Bayliss was still most part of an all-along great show.
