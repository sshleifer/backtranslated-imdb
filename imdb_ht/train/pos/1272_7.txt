Enjoyable films although I think it was the potential to be even better if it had more depth. It's a half mystery of the movie as to know why Elly is like a loner. Then when we finally give an explanation going back to childhood it is still not much detail. Perhaps they showed flashlight or something. <br /> In any way, it's still a good movie that I would look again. 7/10 <br /> <br />
