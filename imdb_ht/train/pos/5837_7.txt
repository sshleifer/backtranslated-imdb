With Oliver Hardy intensified by the sound of horns, bells, phones and trombones, his physician Finlayson advises peace and quiet with a diet of goat milk. Stan Laurel's partners come up with a great solution, living on a docked boat for the salt sea air to help Ollie get the rest he needs. It's a great property for all the caps of the kidney hijinks enswitch, as the ship puts addicted to the hungry goat, and a condemned escape (Richard Cramer) arranged together for the ride. <br /> I got a kick from all the gags in the movie, starting with signing in the cone test factory - 'silent while male working'. The early history of the boys' apartments features a number of mix up plumbing and neglected devices, and Stan is making a banana in a bit banana. Laurel has a couple of great lines in the picture, such as "We Must Have Been Dis-Deactivated," but one of my rolling was his answer to the criminal on board boats - "Self Preservation is the latest average law" - precisely! <br /> I'm not like a big student in the Laurel and Hardy movie as much on this board, all I know is I enjoyed them as a kid and get them to be as fun today as they turned of my youth. In this regard, "Seafood in the Sea" provides a decent hour of cuffoob fun, well on its way to Hornomania.
