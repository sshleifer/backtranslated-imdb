This recreation of the infamous Misters 1959 in Kansas, based on the book Capote, is sharp filmed by Brooks and Cinematographer Hall of Black and White, giving it a documentary feel. There are good performances in Blake and Wilson as the Assassins and Forsythe as a captain who pursues them. Scenes leading up to killing, filmed at the current home where the crime occurred, with a cluster of wind whistles, are quite intense and refreshing. Brooks is headed with a lot of verve and uses many exciting transitions between scenes. Complaining only is that it is a bit off, and the denial moves out and a little preachy.
