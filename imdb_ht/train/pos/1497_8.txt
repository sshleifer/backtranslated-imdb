This movie is a well-known film animation film (along the lines of Tales from the Crypt) written by Robert Bloch (author of Psycho). It's good fun for horror fans and has an excellent cast. The movie should also ask to look for Doctor Who fans since Jon Pertwee (the third Doctor) has an entertainment role as a horror and obnoxious horror star!
