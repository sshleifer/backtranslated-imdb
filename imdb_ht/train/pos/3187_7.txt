A few years ago, I bought several $ 1 DVDs each with two cinemas. One of them had three Broadway girls (an alternate title for the Greeks being a Word for them) and this one, Happy Go Lovely. It is basically a backstage skid comedy that takes place in Scotland with anxiety mistakes involving one of the dancers launching a ride in a millionaire limousine. Vera-Ellen is that dancer and wow, what ever! Ceasar Romero is her producer who takes a chance to read after the original leading lady leaves because she thinks she's dating the millionaire with my car just mentioned. And David Niven is that wealthy who, looking for Vera-Ellen, is making mistakes for a reporter who is supposed to interview him but gets blocked by Romero. What I just mentioned might be confusing but (especially) make sense if you want to check your brain while watching this charmless screwball comedy and wonderful music number as performed by the ex-Vera-Ellen guys. Romero can be somewhat frantic here but Niven gets hilariously bemused at all. The print I've seen was actually pretty good considering its age and the fact that it's in public domain. And Vera-Ellen does well with her line since she's not really an actress. So, on this note, I highly recommend Happy Go Lovely for film manure that loves old-fashioned music comedy.
