I found this show really late at night, and gave it a try. It's a refreshing change in other things to show late at night, if you catch my drift. Its simplicity of value and sweetness in heart helps remind me of how friends were like children. It's something I appreciate at any time I get it on (which is rare, maybe I should actually check the listings! Haha) ..... and the tension between Joe and Nick is so nice. Like any good flick, you really get emotionally involved in the characters. Good ol 'Louisa May Alcott always inspires good stories :) So apparently I must complete 10 lines of text in order for my opinion to be valid, so I guess I'll tell you a bit more. Children are played by talented actors and actresses, and their environment is beautiful and full of nature - something you do not see much on TV. I hope everyone gives it a shot. I acknowledge and I am fully aware that it's draft but good heart. As I said before, it's worthwhile.
