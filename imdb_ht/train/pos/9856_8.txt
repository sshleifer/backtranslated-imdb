(athlete ??) <br /> <br /> I did not know what to think of the movie. Not too much of a movie child. Definitely should look with a parent because it includes death and death. But I was surprised that I was somewhat entertained by it. <br /> I was a bit disappointed by the 81 minutes of our time. (even less without the credits) And the trailer gets you think the rodent is the main creature. But alas, they tortured him. Right until the end of the movie. Those two influenza viruses 2 stars. But I recommend the movie. Even for an end. <br /> <br /> 8/10 <br /> <br /> Type: 9/10 Entertainment 7/10 Replayable: 7/10
