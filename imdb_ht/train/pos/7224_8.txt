When DEATHTRAP was first released, the poster - reproduced on the cover of this DVD - offered an analogical graphic of a Rubik's cube. It is an appropriate image: Originally written for this step by Ira Levin, who authors like memorable work as Baby Rosemarie and the STEPFORD WAY, the play was one of Broadway's most popular Twisters, and under the direction Sidney Lumet has translated the screen very well. DEATHTRAP is one of those films that it is very difficult to discuss, to do so in any detail giving away the very plot for which it is famous. But the open opening is very smart: Sidney Bruhl (Michael Caine) is the most famous author of mystery plays, but these days he seems to have lost his touch. After a particularly rude awakening night, a former student named Clifford Anderson (Christopher Reeve) sent him a script for a play written. It's called "Deathtrap," and Sidney acknowledges it as a surefire hit. Just the sort of hit that would revive his career ... indeed, a hit to death for. But when Clifford visits to discuss the play, events suddenly begin to twist in the most unexpected ways possible. <br /> Like Shaffer Equally Silly, DeathTrap is really a more history at home on the scene than the screen - To reach full power it needs immediately that a live performance offers. Still, under the guidance of the director of Sidney Lumet, he performed a more-than-respectable show on the screen. Many of this is due to the cast, which is remarkably fine. Michael Caine gives a truly brilliant performance, Dyan Cannon is funny and astonishing as Sidney's irresponsible wife, and Christopher Reeve gives what could be the finest performance of his regretfully short acting career. If you can not see it at a prime production theater, this will be more than done until one comes together. <br /> Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Review
