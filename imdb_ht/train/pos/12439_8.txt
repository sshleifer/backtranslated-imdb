While the main story is supposed to take place in Morocco, this film was shot in Romania's fog in 18 days on a very tight budget. However broken the cards, the actors and the crew play with remarkable skills and engagements, so that in the end I found the result both touch and graceful. Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau provides a horrific performance as the bad guy. The script and directions give some gems. Whether you will like the movie or not, however, will probably depend on taking you on Alexandra Staden in the title role. Other reviews have noted Stadlid's inability to modest Blaise. They may have a point, but I found the interpretation it succinctly and tightly. Modesty manages to overcome horrible chances of discipline, natural talent and courage. Staden seems to be doing the same here.
