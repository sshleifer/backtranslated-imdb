It starts slowly, showing the sad lives of the two menager who decided to rent a castle in Italy for April, but does not give up on it. There is nothing much happening, but the time is over exquisitely, and there are many sly jokes (my favorite is the carriage ride in the storm, which I get hilarious). The movie is beautifully romantic in many senses of the word, the scenery is beautiful (as is Polly Walker), and the resolutions of the film are very satisfying. The film took a couple of libraries and books, the biggest being with Arbuthnot / Briggs / Dester business, but I actually preferred the movie version of this (it may be more sentimental, but I felt it was more consistent with the tone of the story, and anyway I love feelings when it's fine). <br /> An excellent movie, especially as a movie date during disgusting weather.
