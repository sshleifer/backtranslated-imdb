I do not agree with previous comments on this movie. I think it was nice and fun and it brought a good message for girls like my daughter. You do not have to dress like a cheap hooker to be cool. You can be clever and beautiful and stylish all at once. <br /> I think the cast was good and the story was fine for the target audience. All-in-all my wife, daughter (10) and I each thought she was a good movie. I certainly recommend it. He also encouraged my daughter to start reading the original Nancy Drew mystery that I am sure she will love as I like the Hardy Boys. <br /> It was a struggle to make it to sleep tonight because he wanted to start reading right away. I can not think of a better result for that film than reindling interest in this classic series.
