Roman multi-layer novel Rohinton Mistry seemed impossible to adapt to the screen but the resulting film full of passion, emotion, humor and patio. The story is a bit slowing-moving, but it's always something on the screen to captivate the audience. The film perfectly captures a particular time and location with pinpoint accuracy. All actors are Indian - some if any known in the "western" audience - but they are a joy to look, especially the girl who acts very compelling. You must not include the title and summary of the draw - this is a movie to be seen on the big screen. We have a lot to learn from it.
