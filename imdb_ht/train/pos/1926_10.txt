In 1967 I visited the Lake Elsinore Balance-port and jumped a Yellow Pratt It sailplane. Back to Germany the highest severe above television and one segment was on the high altitude flight flights in California in the early 50ies. (The real life pilot was Bill Ivans, I do not know who played it in the series) It turned out that the seagull of the movie was the same (even N-number) as the one I was flying at Lake Elsinore. Ever since I've seen that segment I was looking for and asked if it is a place available. (The other serious segment was on the Exterior Baker chair; an instrument for obtaining avalanches and so on.
