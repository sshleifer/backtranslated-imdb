The first, I did not see the "Pate" since I was 7 or 8 and looked at it as an adult was an incredible experience. The pages can be written about its influence on today's horror movie. And even more can be written on his social subtext and the 50s "scary youth". But this simple little story of interplanetary horror is still a fine movie movie scary if you leave it. But the "Blob" pack in some moments really scary as a lot of kids follow the irresistible creature then adults do not believe them. In fact, there are even very weak moments in its colored candle world. And Steve McQueen provides much more than the worthy descriptive story that our viewers really get hold of at the moment and believe in it. <br /> <br /> For sum up, if you can get into your irritation postnatal filters, there is a lot more love here than meeting the eye.
