Before that, flawed "Five slaughter" was the best. But this screen adaptation of "Mother Night" is very true to the book and keeps comedy, mystery, and tragedy the intention. Fortunately it was not Hollywood-ized or idiotized the movie "The Champions of Breakfast." Another good thing about this movie is that you do not need to be familiar with the book following it (as I think you do for Slaughterhouses Five). This is probably true of the Champions Breakfast too, but they've done such a bad job that you are better just reading the book and not seeing the movie! Nick Nolte has done an excellent job in this movie.
