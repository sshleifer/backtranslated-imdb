A nice music movie early in Rene Clair, as fun and witty as its silence the "Hat Italian Hat". Using sounds in an expressive way and not only for dialogue and effect, Clair influenced early music in America (scenes from opera from a night of the Opera strongly influenced by Le Million, for example). Should (but will not) be seen by all cinephiles, and the DVD from criteria is exactly as good as you would expect. There's not a ton of extras, but most DVD spending I've seen is useless to surf, and the Clair interview on disk is one I've never seen. Get it while it's still around.
