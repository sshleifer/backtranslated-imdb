What surprised me most about this movie was the sheer audience he attracted. Similar films like Anita and I have never caused as much hype as this movie has, though I think this probably because of mentioning Beckham in the title more than anything else. <br /> It's a brilliant movie set across a brilliant message - you can do anything if you're determined enough and put yourself in it, which is such a positive message to anyone watching this movie. <br /> I think this is one of Keira Knightley's best films, and I think she's a brilliant actress, and she's excellent for the role. Parminder Nagra was also brilliant. Unfortunately, I can not say that for Jonathan Rhys-Meyers, because I do not think it was that much of a good actor, and to be honest, his eyes were a little scared. All in all, a brilliant film, and a brilliant story
