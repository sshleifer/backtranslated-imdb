Higher and higher was one of Rodgers & Hart's less Broadway musicals he had only had a run of 84 performances on Broadway in 1940. But he yielded one of the biggest hits He never entered my mind, . <br /> But except for a minor song, So Disgustingly Rich, the Broadway note was scratched when RKO bought the movie rights. Instead, a whole new note by Jimmy McHugh and Harold Adamson wrote, especially to accommodate one Francis Albert Sinatra who made his first feature film. <br /> <br /> Sinatra made some vocal cats in the movie before, taking a leaf from the page of rival Bing Crosby rival. When Bing made his first feature feature of the Big Broadcast, he played Bing Crosby. Frank Sinatra took the role of Frank Sinatra and I can not think of anyone who could do a better job. The chairman of the Board is billed to third companies here behind the star Jack Haley and Michele Morgan. She is the Butler and she's maid of Leon Errol's scullery. In fact, Errol is a millionaire who has not paid her aid for seven months. Mostly because it is about to go upstairs in chapter 11 or so it informs the employee. <br /> <br /> Errol's a delightful old soul to work for and none of the employee wants to lose a good thing. They are pooling resources and finding Michele Morgan imitating the daughter of Errol in Switzerland and her mother. The idea of ​​ripping a wealthy bankroll into the hope of rescuing family fortunes. Only Michele begins looking at another. <br /> It's a slight plot and certainly not much worse than a whole lot of musicals, but RKO invests this movie with a good cast of players. Barbara Hale and Elizabeth Risdon play another beggar with her mother who is suspicious of something is not good, Victor Borge is a fortune seeking no account, Dooley Wilson, Paul Hartman, Grace Hartman, Marcy McGuire, Mel Torme and Mary Wickes, play other people in the home Errol employee. Not a bunch of bad at all. <br /> <br /> Sinatra was singing three good ballads all of them had some kind of successful business, the music stopped, a nice way to spend an evening, and I could not sleep a Wink Yes. The last one was nominated for an Oscar for the best song, but lost to the Alice Faye You never know. <br /> <br /> 1943 was the year of the Union Musician strike against the recording industry. To get the materials out, Frank Sinatra recorded songs from above and above with a chorus for Columbia. Bing Crosby recorded songs in his Dixie film in the same way as Decca. Both of them were denounced by the president of the union, James C. Petrillo as strikebreakers and both did not cross the strike line again. The strike was not resolved completely until 1944 although Decca broke earlier rows of other record companies and stayed earlier than Columbia, Victor RCA and others. <br /> <br /> The strike gives some time to worry for Sinatra. He just left the Tommy Dorsey Orchestra when the strike called. He concludes a venue needed for his artwork when he was not sure whether Dorsey would prove to be a career move. <br /> <br /> Fortunately higher and higher got well a legend was launched.
