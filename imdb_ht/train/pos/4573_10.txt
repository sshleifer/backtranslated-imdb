Daniel Jou Lewis is one of the best actors in our time with one of my favorites. It's amazing how much he throws himself into each of the characters he plays make them real. <br /> I remember, many years ago, we had a part of our home - friends came up, we sat down, ate, drank wine, talked, laughing - there was a good time. The TV was over - there was a movie that we did not pay much attention. Then, suddenly, all of us stopped talking and laughing. The glasses did not cling, the forks did not move, the food became cold on the plates. We could not catch our eyes on the screen where young people who were disabled all the body were against it and had only a control on his left foot, pick up a piece of chalk and foot, and for that the eternity tried to write just a word on the floor. When he wrote a word, we all knew that we were witnessing not one but three triumphs - the triumph of a person's will and spirit, the triumph of the movie that could take the moment like this on the movie , and triumphs of an actor who did not act, but who became his character. Jim Sheridan in "My Left Foot" is a steady, insignificant bio-drama about Christy Brown, the man who was born with cerebral palsy in a Dublin slum; who became an artist and a writer and found a love in his life. <br /> I love every one of Lewis's day performance (I have mixed feelings about her performance in GONY) but I believe her biggest role was Christy Brown in my "Left Foot"
