And that was considered to be Harry Trilogie's official room and the Enforcer (1976) to be the final chapter of the series. Harry's room is back, older, more roomy and gritty than ever since the original 1971 classic. <br /> <br /> Harry's room in the past has killed a psychiatrist assassin, vigilant thief, and Vietnam veteran terrorist. But now it is after a new killer, a killer who wants to pay back, not gunning down his attacker. <br /> <br /> Sudden Impact brings a new meaning to darker dirty room. Callahan is about a new murder case that circulates back to a woman (played by Sondra Locke), who was brutally raped, along with her sister, who left the trumpet. Ten years later, it was out for revenge by gunning down its attackers. At the same if Callahan is on a heat problem caused by his superiors after sparking a mob boss in a heart attack, in which the mob will also hunt him. So, in order to let the heat die in the city, Harry is about to take a vacation on a seaside town, but at the same time the violent victim is in town as well, while hunting his attacker one by one one. Harry is on the investigation and finds the killings very similar, as he's home to the killer trail. <br /> <br /> Sudden Impact in my opinion, she was to be one of my top 10 movie revenues, as well as Harry's second Harry movie again, far better than both the Enforcer and Pool the death is combined. Often the impact that Harry's original room has, a dark tune and entertaining value. So do you feel lucky, punk?
