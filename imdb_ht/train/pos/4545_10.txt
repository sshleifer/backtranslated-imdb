I saw this film recently. 2 hours later, my head still wounded in laughter. The plot was too serious, the jokes were saved bad, but I did not count on being: <br /> <br /> 1. The scene 2 before and after the film that was pat and Jay posing caused more than enough laughing) <br /> <br /> 2. The kick of the fast-popping machine. <br /> This movie is about 20 times better than the Rush Rush series, and my copy even comes with a disclaimer saying if you did not like the movie, send HBO certificates. While I was considering it, the date you sent it in January 1991 (which also caused wackiness to happen).
