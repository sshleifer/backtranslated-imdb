Just joking about losing weight; Well, you could lose weight you never know. Anyway, what can I say, I love this movie. He had the same sense of genius and innocence found in films such as Stand By Me and Goonies. Jake's closet shows the beauty of the simple life and how often we neglected them. The film reminds us of what he likes to see the world in the eyes of the kids and all the magic, mystery, and horror to see. Jake's Closet presents a unique human story of his compassion that anyone who has a child can both deal with and fall in love. Watch it with friends; watch it with loved ones; Build a Fort Wine if you wish.
