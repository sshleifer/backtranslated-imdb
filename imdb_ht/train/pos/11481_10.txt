High School Friends Andrew Kriegman and Cal Gabriel declare war on their peers and plan a terrifying assault on high school. As they begin the dangerous countdown of the final acts of revenge, the start of a video journal to explain their feelings and chronical missions. <br /> There is another movie that looks like this, called "Elephant." Why do I carry this? To compare these two movies, of course. I said, though I liked "Elephant," this is a better movie. What are the differences, you ask? Well, for starters, this is to shoot differently, very much on the lines of "Cloverfield," "Blair Project Witch," and "The Dead Journal." This makes the film all the best because it's much more painful. <br /> But what won me about was how the movie wanted to show "the other side of the story." You get to know these two shooters, unlike "Elephant." I actually care for one of the shooters and can understand their actions and why they did what they did. This film actually makes you feel sympathetic to these people and is good because it's not always black and white. <br /> <br /> To be honest, that's why I'm almost crying in this movie. Characters are real human beings and logic and reason behind their actions. You get to know them. It's not like they want to kill people for attention. In general, this film is emotionally attractive and very haunting and better than "Elephant."
