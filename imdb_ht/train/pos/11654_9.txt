I agree with the comments above, I love the realism of this, and in many movies (not only movies about eating disorders) the producers seem to forget that. They take a daily issue and create a dramatic scene and then come to the end of the movie is perfect again, which I'm griping because it's not real. Not to say that things can not get better, and do not mean they say things are not in this movie, but it does not spend most of the film creating all the problems and they reach the end of everything Movie is perfect again. When people eat illness by just admitting it and wanting to get better, and then life is peachy, it takes time, and I love how in this movie we grow up with the characters we go through the difficulties with them, getting better and worse, because it is a very important part of the movie. It gets into the minds of people with food disorders, and it shows the pain and pain, in a very realistic way, and I liked it. I also like how it shows the secret and betrayal of people feeling when suffering from eating disorders, it is scary to see how people react when they get out, especially if they approve of it. I thought this movie was very touchy and beautifully and well said, and defiantly one of my favorites.
