Absolute masterpiece of a movie! Mr.Tom Goodnight has rapidly become one of my favorite films of all time. No one should miss out on seeing this movie, it's just too good! Mr.Tom is perfectly described by John Thaw as the old harsh man who becomes a soft-figure father when William Beech (Nick Robinson) is sent to evacuation, almost like the 'City Mouse and Mouse Country a '. A really wrenching movie. The director knew exactly how to turn books into films and he did so well. The film was so great to shoot that the emotions of the characters and what happened had made the audience feel a series of emotions from love fears, and these emotions can turn on a six-point. Set in a time of turmoil during the Second World War, this film also shows differences between cities and countries, they are almost like different countries. An absolute must see, people are not missing out on a really amazing and brilliant movie.
