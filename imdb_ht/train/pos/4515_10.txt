This movie is absolutely fantastic !! If you watch it with your friends can be a very nice day ... Obviously you must know that the movie is stupid and very badly directed and acting (Tomba / Unziker what a couple), and that is probably the most filmmaker evil in the world, but you can enjoy it very much. We watched it in 19 and it was a very nice evening. The best scenes are the first one, when the criminals kill Alex's friend, and he tries to act as a desperate, and the result is a funny scene in the first category ... then when he shows Leva (Antevleva , what a name) "Palassio di giusstissia", and then the crash of Leva, which once is going on his car from the road, and a second later, the car is completely empty! What a magic!
