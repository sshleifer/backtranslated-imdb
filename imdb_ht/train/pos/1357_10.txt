Wow this episode! After last week, Mellisa was still doing came on the friendship of Annie and Brandi I almost puked. But that was nothing until seeing Tirade Mellisa after being shot. Seeing him joining around he threw spewing out obscenities and screaming for someone finding his purse was absolutely the most hilarious thing ever on reality TV. She continues to call the person to wear clothes "all of them" as someone else would put one of her horrible outfits. Your Mellisa is like 40 years old and still temper temperamental? Then Joan began calling Annie and Brandie every name in the book, and came up and left the show! Both the brats brats rivers have only left on display at that time to keep their ratings. Mellisa cries and refuses to get an exit interview, just proving America that everyone thought, you are a spoiled baby. WAH WAH I can not find my way! I love how Annie told the cameras he could manipulate Mellisa think his way and then did exactly that. Mellisa is by far the smart and clearly competitor worthy to win the whole game.
