Never heard of this film, see it on DVD.Great movie, perfect example of a movie that takes each cast member to do it work.No overhyped movie Hollywood movie and even the old active overhyped.No now Quote "A" list of actors could have been pulling in any performance of this movie. Reflecting back memories of my own Vietnam War war experience. It focuses on the people who were sent to fight.As was described by the characters who had fears and emotions even though there are some volunteers for service. They were also regular people, some just did not cut out for military life, I remember a few of my experiences - to put it mildly could not adapt to military life either - but I never forgot them - would be stayed in touch. I highly recommend it and then think about those serving day present in Afghanistan.Basic training is a journey, noticing these drillter serials by morning and maybe they need "training sensitivity" HA! HA! HA!
