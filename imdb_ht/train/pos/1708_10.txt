Looking at some of the negative posts, you really need to ask what some people do for fun .... <br /> I was lucky enough to see the movie while all-too-short movie theater run. The audience laughs itself. I'm watching a tape of it as I typed and it still dang funny! <br /> It also got a sweet side, and turned unexpected to genuine genuine. Late, the Royal Dano is especially effective as the lonely, down-on-luck-farmer Wrenchmuller. Ariana Richards and J.J. Anderson is great as children lead. And the actors in the Martian costumes, although limited to mimic, do a great job <br /> <br /> Another thing to look for is the background details. This film is full of homage, pasty, and reference on other SF and Fantasy films. Take a look at the Martian costumes next time. One is wearing a costume Marty McFly, another is a ghostbuster, a third one in a unit of Atreides, and a fourth is to put a last starfighter flight.
