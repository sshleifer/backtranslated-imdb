I admit that I'm a vampire addict: I've seen many vampires movie I've lost counting with this one is definitely in the top ten. I was very impressed by John Carpenter's original vampire and when I had removed an end I went straight out and bought it. This movie does not obey the same rules as the first, and it is not quite so dark, but it is close enough and I felt that it was nicely built on the original. <br /> Jon Bon Jovi was very good as Derek Bliss: His performance was readable and yet hard enough for the viewer to believe he might actually be able to survive in the world in which he lives. One of my favorite parts was just after she met Zoey and wanders in the toilet's toilet to check to see if she is more than she looks. Its comments are extremely irreverent and yet eminent practice that contrast well with the rest of the scene as it unfolds. Other cast members were also well-chosen and knitted nicely to produce an entertaining and original movie. It is not simply a rehash of the movie first and has grown in a similar way to the road frightening Night from scary night. There are different elements that make it a cool movie with a similar theme. If you like vampire movies I would recommend this one. If you prefer your movie less blood then choose something else.
