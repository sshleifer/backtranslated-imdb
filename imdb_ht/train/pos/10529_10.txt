Does not mean my favorite Austen novel, and Paltrow is not by my favorite actress, but I found the movie almost totally fun. Paltrow does a good job, and Cummings, Stevenson and one who plays 'Miss Bates' are all absolutely terrific. Details of the period by alienation; The feeling of the film is just right, in fact. But the real find is Jeremy Northam as Mr Knightley. There might not be more perfect casting, IMO. I hated Mr K in the novel, but found him beautiful and human in the movie. Looks great with Northam's smile eyes, there is no hindrance to either! Very recommended. AnaR
