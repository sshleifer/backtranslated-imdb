I remember watching this as a kid in the UK, fascinating in the story and narration of Laurence Olivier. We would talk about anything at school the next day. I imagine the ratings for the first show were great. This is quite simply the best documentary most comprehensive despite the fact that they have cut the story down to the bone they managed to take a lot. What is interesting is that the battles in Britain and North Africa have been pivotal yet largely unexplored as those by the Americans. The series captures the rivalry between Mountbatten and the Americans, the German troops on the front of the East, the maltreatment of Japanese prisoners in war by US troops. The images of the burning made me, a non-Jewish European, feel forever guilty about the treatment of the Jewish people. I do not know why this is not the number one of the IMDb rankings. Perhaps they show their bias against their documentary. Spoiler - we have.
