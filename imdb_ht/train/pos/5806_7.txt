If you see this movie, you know you will see an extreme video of popular music. But you will find more. Incredible FX, great music and a nice time to enjoy with your kids. If you compare this movie, you have to remember it is a pop fantasy. Clips of "Man in the Mirror", "Let Me Alone", "Criminal List" and Beatles' "Come Together".
