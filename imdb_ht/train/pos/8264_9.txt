Based on a current mining disaster, this early German talkie (with English subtitles) still remains one of the most effective documents ever filmed. Featuring many non-professional actors, "Kameradschaft" provides a look at the friendship that ties my workers, regardless of the side of the French / German border. A deadly accident brings out the best of all, nullifying any superiors' order. A minor fellow in need will be getting help from his comrades, even in the threat of great loss, including life. <br /> This film reminds of the self-sacrificing heroic show in NYFD after the 9/11 attacks. Implementing any formal rules and regulations, these guys and women in uniform knew only one cause: to save their lives and find their fellow fighters. - More than 70 years later, "Kameradschaft" still has the strong and timeless message: A friend in need is a friend of deaf.
