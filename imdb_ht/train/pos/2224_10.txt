A female swingman (played by Jennifer Thomas II's sexy) has the fun job of completing all the imaginations of all men on their death row before they encounter the markers. And what a way to go. This film lucky is not real, or we would have a lot more people in this world on death row. <br /> It starts out real slows down. Low light and bad act, like most (B) films. It gets better as it moves together. And it ends with a bang. <br /> I would miss it very high on the low price, very sexy movies in the 90's. It's a must see once the kids are away or in the bed.
