Overall this film was excellent for its time and will be exciting for many generations to come. Although the scheme is not 100% accurate in the most everything book is correct. The movie jumps far further and it misses some important parts. I found the book ready and immediately wanted to make a movie (because I did not get out on the movie yet), but later I found the movie in a bargain bin at Wal Mart and decided to buy it, , and see if it was what I was hoping for. In addition, I give this movie a 7 out of 10 for its good part (relative accuracy and overall makes sense) and for its bad part (great time and small but incredibly noticeable).
