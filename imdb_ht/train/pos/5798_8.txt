I saw this first time when they showed this around Easter time 1993/4 and did not think so much of it then I bought this on DVD last summer when I started to catch in Michael Jackson (i likes her music first) and enjoyed her more now I'm older. It's a good movie but it will not be this classic movie like the sound of music, West Side Story, the Wizard of Oz etc. Michael Jackson as a good actor and thus has been casting others. There was a disturbing scene like Katie the girl getting slapped by Frankie Lideo's Gangster who played by Joe Pesci. The scene that scared me when I was younger was when Michael came in a robot. My favorite song on the movie was Smooth Criminal I think it was better than thrilling in my opinion.
