Often impact is 4th of the Harry Hall films and one of the best features of these films is that they do not really degrade in quality from a movie to the next. So, sudden effects give another thrill ride to the life of Harry Callahan's room. This time Harry tries to solve a series of mourning during vacation. Harry is still in his job. Clint Eastwood plays Harry as he plays everyone in action, slow, deliberate, and without fear. As the first of these films Harry Hall to be made in the 80's, Sudden Impact misses a bit of the 70's feeling that characterized the first three films. This does not mean that it's quality is any less. Bottom Line: Brimming with intensity and action, Sudden Impact is another worthy addition to the Harry Hall series.
