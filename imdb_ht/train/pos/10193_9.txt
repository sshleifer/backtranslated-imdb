This review is dedicated to the end of Keith Moon and John Entwistle. <br /> <br /> Original Drum and Bass. <br /> There seems to be very little early who feet around these days, if there is more then allowing them to 'alike, now-a-day it tends to be in a very kind different from that all along, a parody, a shadow of (the most) years better. To be fair, none of them have to prove anything for anyone else, they have earned the respect and supplement. <br /> This concert kick is one of the best. To order an audience of around a 400,000 more strong crowed take skill, charisma, wit and a whole lot of music without good. <br /> We all know of the other acts on the bill, the doors (the latest ever show weeks before Jim Morrison died), Moody Blues, Hendrix, Taste, free and many more. The point that anyone was there was Who the majority came to see. This show was one year after the Great Hippie Festival in the 1960s; Woodstock. The film and record were out and they had the greatest job who was to date, Tommy. The hungry people always wanted a taste, to be able to experience their own unique event, to be able to "grove and love" in the knowledge that this gig was their own. To do this, you needed the best of what Rock'n Roll was thrown into the hungry crowd baited. <br /> At two o'clock in the morning at the end of August 1970 M.C. announcement, "Ladies and Gentlemen, a Rock N Roll Band from Shepherds Bush London, OO." John Entwistle's body suit is in black leather, on the front is the line from a human skeleton from neck to toe, flowing, Keith in a white t-shirt and jeans, as Pete had his white pot suit and Doc Martins that he'd rather wear. <br /> Who has never stopped the onslaught of high energy rock for more than two hours, making them bigger with larger artists 'tracks like young blues, shaking' all over, and then as on Keu, Keith baiting the flow of "locked in a bleeding Opera" with Tommy, the Rock Opera. Crete goes wild. This is what they have heard, and Who did not disappoint, right in Ouverture and never come for hours until the final note of "Tommy you can hear me?" Amazing. <br /> To take a show of the magnitude of this band in the height of the peaks of a festival that should be the latest in its kind anywhere in the world was a fantastic piece of Cinematic History. <br /> <br /> The English DVD only comes to a soundtrack in English / Linear PCM Stereo, being like the United States, I think, you can get it at 5.1 at least, "Check Local Press For Details?" So, okay. <br /> <br /> The duration of the DVD is 85 minutes with no extra expense, which is a deception. Yes, for a slice of Rock and History This DVD would send you to a nostalgia trip down memory line the moment you press play, for some of the best Which concert kicks as it meant to be, Live, Raw and in your face! <br /> I would give this ten DVD if it was not for the lack of 5.1, and some extra costs would have been nice. <br /> Thanks Roger, Pete, John and Keith.
