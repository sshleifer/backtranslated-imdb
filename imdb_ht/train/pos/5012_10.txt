In April 1965, CBS hosted the first television series Barbra Streisand. The show is not just a successful evaluation save but wins 5 Emmy awards as well. This is one of the most memorable moments in the 1960s and (unfortunately) that the special TV shows are no longer produced. Filled with wonderful songs and a spectacular performance by Barbra, this special is a must look for any Streisand fans and anyone interested in TV early.
