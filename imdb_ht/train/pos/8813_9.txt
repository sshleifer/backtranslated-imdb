Even though the unequal pieces of this collection in 11 short films are truly a moving experience with people. There were some people, in the wake of the emotion on the anniversary of the bombings, took this to be anti-American. I do not think the case, though some parties can take this way if you do not look behind the obvious. Finally the movie is nothing except an attempt by people to express their confusion, empathy and feelings about what happened. These are stories of people in the world being shaken up by what happened on a Tuesday in September. As I said this film will move you, probably with tears. It's not always easy to watch, for example the movie from Mexico is little more than a black screen and sound, but its effects are like lying even most of those low. If you can be strong you really should see this movie. It will comfort you and shine you and affect you.
