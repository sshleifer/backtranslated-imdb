"Hole" is my favorite movie ever! So far I saw this movie three times in the theater and I'm looking forward to buying it on this upcoming September DVD. I read the book after seeing the movie and was amazed by how the book and movie were like. The director of this film has done an excellent job of re-creating the book in film form. Also, all the actors choose to play their role in performing the wonderful characters, especially Max Kasch as ZigZag. Proposals for everyone involved in making this movie were a real success! 10 out of 10 stars, I definitely recommend everyone to see!
