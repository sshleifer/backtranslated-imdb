If you as I have a very close and long relationship with the world of Tintin .... make yourself a favor and watch this beautiful documentary about Hergé and his life that creates Tintin. It's so brilliant and a very cool production. The whole story story about Hergé and the people and also many many different situations it has influenced by, for good and worse is amazing. There is a very good and obvious connection between the funny and just books. I'll be sure to have my basement dig up the Tintin albums again. Also, the movie itself is very well said and has a great sound ambulance in it. I really hope people will get this as intriguing as I did!
