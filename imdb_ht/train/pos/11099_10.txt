Chase created a true phenomenon with the Sopranos. Unfant performance, rock-solid writing, and some great music do what has become quite possibly the best ever ever. <br /> All of the cast are strong, but Falco and Gandolfini earn every inch of these Emmy. Anyone who doubts this needs only sample a few bits; particularly in the first few seasons. James Gandolfini is absolutely bad, absolutely terrifying, and you always find yourself love her - mesmerized by him. <br /> Many people that I talked about about the Sopranos (who have not seen it yet) will be "I'm just not a fan of mafia movies / show". Whatever. Run - do not walk - and get it. These people usually like "E.R", but I bet they are not much care for hospitals ... It's not the context.
