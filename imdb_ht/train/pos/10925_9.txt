I really love this movie. I can watch it on a regular basis and not tire it. I think it's one of my criteria for a big movie. <br /> <br /> The story is very interesting. It introduces us to 6 characters; Each has a unique kung fu style that is very secret and very dangerous. Each of these characters is trained by the same master but their identities are kept secret from each other. The master of the death sent the 6th, his latest student, to try to hurt the evil that he suspected some of his students had committed. <br /> <br /> How will the last student find the other venoms? How will he know who of them is bad? The answers to these questions are part of what makes this movie great. <br /> <br /> We also found to see the Venetians fight each other in each combination. It is fun to see how styles match up against each other. <br /> <br /> If you want to see if you love kung fu movies, this is a good movie to start with. It does not get any better than that.
