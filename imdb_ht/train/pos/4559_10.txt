My older sister was born in March 1985 and has cerebral palsy. In her 22 years of life, she saw nothing but the walls of our home and her school that is also busy with other disabled children. I've been in the jaw of everyone's joke because my sister is disabled, and I still think that day is nobody, or ever giving a curse on her and her condition. Then I saw this movie. <br /> I knew that Christy's family was going to attend. but they were lucky. Christy could speak, she could communicate, and she had artistic skills. My sister can walk, but she can not speak a word, and she can not use her hands to do anything but grab on things. but this movie made me realize there were other people in the world like my sister, and the finish (they said the truth) made me cry. AND I see SHAWSHANK !!! This film is seriously underrated, and it should not be. This movie tells someone something. that people should be proud of their own lives. Think you can not write well? This guy wrote with his feet. think you do not attract? This guy has turned down to many of girls, because of his condition. by the fastest runners? Christ did not stand up. <br /> My point: Parents toddlers, I suggest your children to watch this movie with you, so they will know next time to see someone in the street in a wheelchair, not staring at them like they are aliens. My sister had millions of stares, and she broke my heart to think that this is still happening to many. This film will teach people, that people who might not seem "normal" are people too. 10/10
