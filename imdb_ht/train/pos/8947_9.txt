Kim Novak is a witch on the prowl for a mortal lover, and her James Stewart choices. Scintillating comedy of behavior, from the Broadway stage; shot by James Wong Howe in Witch colors, and made by a Sterling cast. Ernie Kovacs is wonderful as the Redlitch writer of the turret. I love this movie, though some others look like. Kim alone makes it a winner in my book. Ha! My # 5 movie in 1958.
