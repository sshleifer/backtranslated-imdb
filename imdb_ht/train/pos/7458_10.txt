This game is the bomb and this is the game 007 of the year and should be about to hit older. When I got Agent under Fire, I thought it was a good game, but then Nightfire came around and that was the best, but now there is a new kind of James Bond game. This time it's a 3rd person shooter and there are more than 12 missions, the graphics in the game are out of this house. He even has all the big actors and actresses of this game like Pierce Bronsan once again James Bond, William Dafoe as the villain Nikolai Diavolo, and Judi Dench as M (forgive me all if I spell it wrong). This game should own as the greatest James Bond game. <br /> I give this a 10/10
