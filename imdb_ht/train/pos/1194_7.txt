The film largely focuses on a bullying Robert Taylor as a buffalo bunny hunter and the people who have set up with him. Set in the middle of a hunt to lower numbers in Buffalo, it shows at the end of a tragic era of dead bra and is filled with dramas and remorse for both the Buffalo and the American Indians. Taylor is blindly hated by the Indians and his naivete that the Buffalo cows will never disappear. In one scene, he launched animals after animals, while in another it kills Indians and then eats the foods on the fire. Under this innocent exterior lies an inexperienced person who reduced his request to his companions (Stewart Granger, Lloyd Nolan, and Russ Tamblyn). He is not the most beautiful of films and he has squeezed down into the drama he created, leading to a conclusion of involvement in a Blizzard.
