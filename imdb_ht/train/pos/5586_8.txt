Eva (Hedy Lamarr) had just been married to an older man and in the honeymoon, she realized that her husband did not want her. Her desires with the marriage and the private of love, make Eva return to her father's house in a farm, leaving her husband. One afternoon, while bathing in a lake, her horse escaped with her dress and a young worker recovering and returning to Eva. They fall in love with each other and become lovers. Later, her husband misses her and attempts to make her home back home. Eva refused, and the trio's driving force at the same place, ending the matter in a tragic way. I just looked at "extreme" for the first time, and the first remark I have is the relative high quality of the VHS released in Brazil by the Brazil Video Network Distributor: The film has only 75 minutes running time, and he seems to have used different coil in film. Some parts are totally damaged, and other parts are very damaging. Therefore, the beauty of the images is not realized by the Brazilian viewer, if it has a chance to get this rare VHS in a rental or sale. The film is practically a silent film, the story is very dating and has only a few lines. Consequently, the characters are badly developed. However, this movie is also very daring, with exposure to Hedy Lamarr breasts beautiful and nude body fat for the present standards of beauty. Another fantastic point is poetic and metaphorical used in flowers, symbolizing lying between Eva and her lover. The way the director makes the scenes show the needs and privacy of Eva is very clear. The non-conclusion end is also very strange for a movie 1933. I liked this movie, but I hope that one day has a chance to see a 87 minute restored version. My vote is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Cascade" ("Ecstasy")
