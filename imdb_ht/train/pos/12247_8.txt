I really love this version of Emma the best. Kate Beckinsale was scared like Emma and her strong mark was very good as knightly. The only complaint that I had on Mr. Woodhouse .. and can not believe that a man could shine so much or to be so selfish with his daughter's life .. was a smart girl at the end though. As always, I like the places in those Austin movies films being shot. The settings are so spectacular. it makes me want to visit England many 9as well as Ireland and Scotland) I think the actors chosen for this movie were a good choice as well as all the other lines interwhined and the most excellent story! I'm glad I got to see this one too.
