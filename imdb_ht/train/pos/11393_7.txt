Uggh! I really was not impressed by this movie, though I must admit that it is technically well done. It finds a 7 for high-value production, but as for entertainment value, it is rather poor. In fact, I consider this one of the most overrated films in the 50s. She won the Oscar for best photos, but the film is just boring at times and many dancing and dancing and dancing. This is because of some musicians who have a reasonable number of songs along with a strong story and act (like MEET ME in ST LOUIS), this movie is almost all singing and dancing. In fact, this movie has about the longer songs and dance in history and if you're not in this, the movie will quickly make you. Give me more history! As a result, with production blockade production and a weak history, this film is like a fixed diet in meringue - it just does not meet in the long run. <br /> <br /> To think ... this is the movie that beat out "A Streetcar Wanted Desire" and "A Place in the Sun" for Best Photos! And, doing worse, the "African Queen" and "Ace in the hole" were not even nominated in this category! Even more amazing for me is that "Ace in the hole" loses for Best Writing, Screenplay this movie - though "An American in Paris" was hardly any talk talk and was mainly driven by dance and song.
