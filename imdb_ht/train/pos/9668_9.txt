This is a small film, some characters, drama. And again he says something about Ireland that you will not find elsewhere. This movie is Ireland. In all that it grubiness, it's sadness, it's self-delusion.The men, lord Doyle, SP O'Donell, the cannon, daughter Doogan, Gar and above all Madge.I know them.I I'm in the pub with them or leaning to pray with them. They are our sad stories and are present to us.
