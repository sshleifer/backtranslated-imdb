This cartoon cartoon Bunny sees the return of Marvin's still known to Martini and his sidekick K-9 green dog. <br /> <br /> This time instead of trying to destroy the Marvin Earth is on a mission to land, take a beast and take it back to Mars. Of course the animal he chooses is Bugs Bunny. In first bugs think Marvin and K-9 are trick or treat, but this can not be right when Marvin drastically increases the Bug's Rabbit hole with a ray-gun. Bugs trying to stretch his way out of the situation in a couple of ways, including convincing Marvin that K-9 is planning a mutiny. Eventually he was captured by using a Bazooka called the existence of eyed draw-jacket. Amazingly, for a Acme product, it works as released and the Bug is forced to use his blood to get his K-9 release, the tables were soon turned and the two unpleasant marches trussed up with Bugs try to fly back to the earthquake. <br /> I really enjoyed this although the finish is a bit weak compared to the rest of the story. Marvin's voice changed slightly here and it becomes visible emotionally when he is upset, but that did not make me like him or the cartoon less.
