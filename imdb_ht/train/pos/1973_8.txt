I never believed anyone's opinion about a movie. It goes for criticism as well. Be sure, if it gets this positive review, it's ok with a plus, but most movies that get my ration critics hate. I enjoyed this movie for what it was, a fun movie. It takes you out of your life for a couple hours and in a fictional character ... being Catherine Trammell. Sharon Stone is scared of this role, just like he was in the first one. Anyone who says it is terrible in this film must have felt the same in the first ab / c it is back acting the same way he did in Basic Instinct 1. Catherine is himself and he plays it in perfection . Its one material is great, as much as in the first one. Who can forget about the movie first by saying the cops, "If you're going to arrest me to do it ... otherwise get the f ** k out here!" Great scene, and believe me, he does it again in this one. I was captivated by it. His team, the way he smokes his cigarettes, believes me, is worth the cost just to see the Stone's performance. I can not wait for this movie to be released on DVD, unknown, because I can only imagine how best it will be to be. And yes, there are lots of twists, as in the first one, including the finish!
