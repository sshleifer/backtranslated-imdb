May 2004, Wonderland is new to the UK. Brilliant movie in a real brital story. If you know that from the beginning of the 80's, you'll appreciate how it is captured. The use of the elements that makes up its courageous Cinemas style is original, amplifies the experience and brings the very near viewer actually being there. Use a non-Pulp Fiction line that allows uncertainty exploration regarding what really happens, while the direction and performance of the attention cast cast, especially Val Kilmer as John Holmes; an Oscar for sure if I was kicked out.
