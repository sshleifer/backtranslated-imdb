1.) This movie was amazing! I watched her while I was in town next to one where she grew up! I went and saw the buildings that the story took place. In general, I liked this movie, One of the best Jake Gyllenhaal! Also - my favorite part was just in science, and all the time with her dad. They were so sad, it seemed. Homer wanted to follow his dream and his father does not seem to care for one or the other. Tag tag is true. "Sometimes a dream is bright enough to light up the sky." 2.) This way this film was impeccable, it was all so credible that it could have been recorded during the 1950s. Dresses were accurate and they were jealous too. Definitely recommend this movie!
