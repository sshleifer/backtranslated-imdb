I found this movie very enjoyable. The plot is simple and easy to digestible, the humor is light and clean, and because the storyline involves the error of identity is quite common, I find myself looking forward to how this film this movie comes from. Turn out to be very nice. The performance of the female lead is admirable; Painting it into an innocent, naive girl trying to fabricate some white lies on David's sophisticated role was very good. I also found Vera's dance very, very well done. I found myself drawn in her toes while she was pronounced on the scene effectively and perfectly. <br /> For those who have had enough of the profanity-filled film of today, you will enjoy this movie well.
