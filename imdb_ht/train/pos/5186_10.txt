I was happy to finally see the release of amazing epic epic stories on DVD. I forgot just what a stellar cast of actors and directors worked on this series. For the longest time the only way you got to see this remarkable series was with the VHS 2 or 3 epic or episodes of Sci-Fi would re-run these episodes. However, when sci-fi would organize re-run, they are generally stuck in the same episodes. There was a few episodes in Season One such as the Mission that they did not repeat. Does anyone know exactly how long this series runs? He said the 1985 to 1987 at the top here at IMDb but I thought it ran longer than two years ago. If you liked the Twilight Zone, Night Gallery and Exterior Exterior, you will love this series and you will not be disappointed with your purchase.
