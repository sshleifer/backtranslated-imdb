I started watching the Apprentice about 4 years ago (maybe 5) and I really like it. The first thing that hit you about it is the refreshing format, which though even as a lot of other reality shows in its core, is still very fun. Donald Trump is wonderful as the host and the main judge of the show as well. The casting coupons and clever people who have good looks are being taken as competitors are appreciated as well. But the best part of the show is New York City. Mark Burnett could have made many mistakes in his time, but his touch in the cinematography is excellent as it makes NYC look like a character for himself. The jazz journals coupled with some great camera-works make New York look spectacular. The apprentice is always easy to make myself 3 reality shows ever (the amazing race is no 1, however). But just like the amazing race show this is always the best view of moderation. If you continue to watch it for a short time the originality of the show will be set in fast (the same case as TAR) .Star World, broadcast in this country, made a bang up task in the show. The first three seasons were shown in a row, then after 2 years the next season was shown, which kept the fresh concept. In conclusion, you will love this show, especially the first 2 seasons. However if you continue to watch the show continuously, then your charm will be put in with FAST.
