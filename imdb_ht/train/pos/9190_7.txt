With Tony's seriously injured in a coma induced, two things happened: Tony imagined himself leading the life of a seller going to a business convention, while his family and friends go to hell trying to cope with the possible loss of the big man. Sequences of the right dreams come from an old TWILIGHT episode, as Tony finds himself transformed into an average Joe trying to deal with a missing scholarship and mixed-up identity while on a business trip cross-country . His intonation as a blazer- and chaki-wear tuned is much more among Americans and less that of an Italian thug from Noo Joisey. A nice touch. The shocking long-haired AJ, hippy-dippy AJ (who Paulie calls "Van Helsing" at one point) has a beautiful scene with his old man committing. The best time to have the big boys trying to talk about life without Tony, which immediately breaks down into a territorial discussion. Vito gets off a line on New-Dead Gene's maybe they have a closet case, which is interesting in light of what we are learning about Vito.
