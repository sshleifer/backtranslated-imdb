I went to see rivers and tides again today. It is the second time in two days and yes, I see my movie my favorite times as needed. Yesterday I was hit by the brightness of the images and Goldsworthy's works. This morning when I dropped the coins I got the # 29 Abysmal (Water). Goldsworthy has an affinity with water, hence the title. I got the 5th change line that moved to the # 7 Army. Blake Art was a war. Anyway, I knew I had seen the movie again. <br /> I read one of the few online comments on the SF exam. The critic was liked the movie, but he said Goldsworthy's comments got in the way of his pleasure in the movie. It would rather have only the images and the wonderful soundtrack. So I was aware of this as I watched this second time. <br /> <br /> Yesterday I thought I would vote for Andy Goldsworthy as King of the World. Well today I was able to get a little beyond the images and listen to what he said. Can I enjoy the movie without commenting? What he does, what he says goes way beyond "art". His understanding of Water, Time, Stone, Change, and about them, and about making me think the man is the reincarnation of Lao Tsu or some Avatar. Some of his / Zen words are like. His knowledge ... <br /> <br /> Anyway, the movie is only (apparently) being shown here in the Bay Area. Have a treatment. Go to your local cinema and tell them, no insist that they have to book a movie you've heard about from the rear countries. It calls rivers and tides. <br /> <br />
