I like Jack's joke as 'Cliche's is ...' or 'Over guys to the top, black, oily skin, somehow spooky ...' It's just hilarious! The Daniel begins to catch up on it! Jack's stuff is not in the team yet (in a way) or else he would have sarcasm mania !!!! I just love all the cemeteries (season 8, a little less, I have to admit), the characters are great , the actors are great, I start collecting facial expressions (and more) from Jack, Daniel and Teal'c ... It's just all theoretically feasible and interesting ... oops! I go again !!! Sorry, i Also begin to pick up features from Carter, and all things are driving my parents NUTZ !!!!!!! Well, conclusion, I think it's good for another three seasons or so, especially if they keep on packing the episodes with all this humor, drama, action and so forth !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
