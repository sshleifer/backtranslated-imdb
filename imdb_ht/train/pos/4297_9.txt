Every now and then a movie maker brings to life a unique group of people and allows you inside to see the things that make us human. Lawrence Kasden does so again. I still felt TheBg Cill was humorous at his age and managed to do it again at Grand Canyon. Every so often we find ourselves at a point where we have the opportunity to choose life and so often we blow it. This is a movie about people who find the courage to choose and experience life because of this choice. The juxtaposition of little and great events allows us to see how fundamentally trivial the most we worry about is really genius. I watched this film a number of times and I was constantly surprised at how deep the emotions run in this movie. Danny Glover and Kevin Kline perform roles with great tenderness and Stever Martins painted in a movie executives are priceless. Thank you again Mr. Kasden
