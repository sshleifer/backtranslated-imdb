Once I looked at the tenant and interpreted it as a horror movie. It used many of the tropes in the genre: the disaster apartment, suspect neighbors, dreams, mysteries, hallucinations. The life of the hero, Trelkovsky, seemed surrounded by evil, secret force trying to drive him mad. Last time I looked at it I challenged the initial interpretation. If this film is a horror movie, it is only horror in the sense that a novel Kafka is horror. In fact, this film can be understood on a literal level as a lonely man slowly becoming crazy without external influences. <br /> <br /> Polanski made in his three career cinemas related to madness: reluctance, which I am not particularly as because the development of the madness of the heroine never convinced me; Baby Rosemary, in which the heroine is driving mad by evil forces; and the tenant, that would be the best study of paranoid ever made in movies. <br /> <br /> Trelkovsky is a young man who leases an apartment in which a woman kills herself. She becomes obsessed with her and slowly starts to become her: she wears clothes, puts on makeup, talks like her. But was he possessed by a spirit, or is he just leaving his wild imagination to get the best of him? It's this hesitation between what is real and imaginative, with which Polanski never settles, making this a movie movie. Many events in the film can be attributed to the supernatural as easily as they can in normal cause, and it's up to the viewer to decide what to believe in. Even if this is not my favorite movie Polanski, it is nevertheless a good example of his ability to create suspense and shows the very convincing madness. And technically speaking, it's a wonder too. Ase says she collaborated with Philippe Sarde composer and director of Sven Nykvist's legendary photographer (DP Bergman) in making this film. A slow down slowing and sometimes refreshing segment can make this film hard to enjoy, but it's a never-ending experience.
