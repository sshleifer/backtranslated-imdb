This movie is close to be my favorite piece of seluloid. There really is not much I need or mean here. Except maybe "Watch This Movie" and "Enjoy the Excellent Work by Daniel and Pascal", who brings you to this story, clean, funny and anxious about 'spending your eighth day' - your own day! <br /> See this movie made me think seriously about how I spent my eighth day = my life! It appears that some of us are wasting precious time doing things we think we need to do. Either if it's a fun career or just consume TV-shows and ballgames. What we tend to lack is satisfaction of being something for someone else - to make a difference. On taking room and time to be spontaneous and live - now! (on the eighth day) ... At least that was what I got in the 'Eighth Day'.
