Vampires, sexy guys, guns and some blood. Who can ask for more? Moon kids save it all in one nicely packed cakes! Gackt is the innocent Sho - who befriends a Keven Vampire (HYDE), their growing relationships with time, but as Sho age, Kei's immortality breaks his heart. It does not help that they both fall in love with the same woman. Special effects are very good at considering the budget. It is a story touching walls and human emotions. You will laugh, cry, laugh, then cry some more. Even if you're not a fan of music, watch this movie. It works great as a stand alone Vampire movie. <br /> 9 out of 10
