I must admit that Tsui Hark is one of a kind, you can not be someone who has a strong style in the movie presence. A Chinese fantasy image can not be easily presented at a hearing, the director tried to bring back the classic fantasy stories in Zu Mountain and this is what it looks like. <br /> <br /> The new leg of Zu has really improved from the one in 1983. From this new Muslim update, we could see Tsui Hark's vision in the Zuu Mountains. Spectacular visual designs, amazing action-fantasy episods have been done very well. Run me stuck in the whole picture. Great throw and just kindness. It's really a fun movie to look, but is it too weird? Now, the down side is the person who will definitely get confused with the river line shorter down to a 95 minute movie. Draw can not have many relationships among characters, but do not retrieve the movie, you'll have a better sense of companion oneself. Some may file complaints by too much physical combat, besides characters of supernatural powers to defeat enemies, fighting spirit by hand but would not really make sense at all. I appreciated this beautiful stylish photo. He may have a thin story, but hey looked at Tsui Hark's time & tide, "we were confused by the draw as well, but it was really something stylish and awesome. Tsui Hark always attracted something different from H.K. Cinema. American audiences, there may be some difficulty to understand while watching this movie, cause this is no Tiger Crouching, hidden dragon, this is a whole new genre. Although it can not be a masterpiece, but its the special effect is really better than storm rider. This is really worth checking out.
