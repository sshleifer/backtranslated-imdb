"Parade Parade" is just one of several wonderful mournful songs that Warner Bros. was produced in the early 1930s at the Depression Ward. "42nd Street" and Golddiggers have also produced during this era, and literally, millions of Americans forget their problems for a while, and enjoy themselves. While most of the films produced had the great talent Joan Blondell, Ruby Keeler, and Dick Powell, only Foolight Parad had James Cagney's incomparable. Nearly ten years before music is best known, "Yankee Doodle Dandy". Here he dances in the most original dance styles, and his arms usually lower to his side, and his legs are doing all kinds of onulations and kicks. It's easy to see that he is enjoying himself, and that we enjoy him all the more. While almost all of the music sequences appear at the end of the film, they are well worth the wait. I believe that this film was made just before the installation of the production code, so some of the costumes and scenes are slightly risky. But it's all fun. <br /> It does not matter that the plot of the film is, just knowing that there are many laughs and a supreme cast. In addition, already mentioned, Guy Kibbee is at his best in here. <br /> 7 out of 10
