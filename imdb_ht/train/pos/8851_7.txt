While the title "Before the Devil knows you are dead" comes from an Irish movie proverb to play out like a Greek tragedy. It all starts with a botched flight and continues to spiral out of control as two brothers try to save the mess they've gotten themselves off. Throw a well assembled with Philip Seymour Hoffman & Ethan Hawke playing the aforementioned brothers. Remarkable support includes Albert Finney as their father and Marisa Tomei as the wife of one brother and guy in the other. Farther that the acting directors are unremarkable. <br /> The story is compelling and it is said to be a certain degree of fiberglass. The narrative structure keeps things interesting by giving different points of view and time schedule frequently. That being said, the film's predictability is a bit muted since it becomes apparent early on that this story is a tragedy, in and out. All in all, a very impressive first time for the seniorist Kelly Masterson. Sidney Lumet's direction is quite busy but I'm more impressed by the fact that it has always been in more than eighty years. I was less impressed by the note by Carter Burwell but it is not a great distraction. <br /> In the end, the movie proves to be compelling look and while the story & presentation can have superficial similarities in this one movie remains a unique experience.
