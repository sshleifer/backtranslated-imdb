This movie is the best movie to watch for comic books. The compositions, costumes and colors are just to stay alive it's just like leaving in a comic book. This is the movie I think of when the crowd mentions, the costumes, hats and attitudes. Hoffman gives funny relief as Mumbles and you can not help but feel sorry for Madonna as she tries, and fails, to win Tracy on. This movie has all the classic mobility clich√©s - burying people in concrete, blowing up car cars, wrapping the good guy and trying to blow up his girlfriends home. This movie is a classic of all meanwhile the word, even angelic cameras called out comic books. It's so great to be able to go back to an older movie and see that someone knew how a comic should be done in a movie after seeing mistakes like Spawn and the Hulk. <br /> <br /> You've seen this PHOTO !!!!
