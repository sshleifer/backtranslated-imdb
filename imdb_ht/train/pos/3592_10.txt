Another powerful chick spicy. This time, it revolves around Diana Gusman who constantly gets into the fight at school. Instead of being expelled, he takes his anger elsewhere, in the boxing ring. It's dragged to be a boxer and has it satisfy Adrian's feathers and starts falling in love with her. This movie has a powerful message of taking your dreams and going with them even if someone does not believe in you (in this case, his father does not believe in it). That alone makes the film worth the price. Enjoy
