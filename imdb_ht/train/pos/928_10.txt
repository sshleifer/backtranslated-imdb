I watched as much of the series as I could manage to watch on TV, but unfortunately, started a job that got me working tonight. I managed to catch some recording of it, at least ... and, of course, buying the DVD recently released in the complete series. Watching the DVD, you can see that the animation was a bit more rude at first, but a fair number of flaws after the pilot did. Voices are well suited to the characters, and the writing is excellent. It's rather refreshing to see animation getting back to its root by reentride old adult. That is, and how society has come to the last century, you need a bit more blatant on it by today's standards in order to be recognized as an adult-oriented show. Characters have very realistic personality and are placed in parallel situations that we often face in real life. It is your typical sitcom in that regard, but the humor is more like what you would expect from late night TV as a talk show show or Saturday Night Live ... back when SNL was actually funny. Good job, Dreamworks. Maybe you need to work with one of the more liberal networks keeping this set going ... and also improving the merchandise marketing for the range to help defy its high costs. It's a challenge to do this for a mature nature cartoon though. Hmm ...
