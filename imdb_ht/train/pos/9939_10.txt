This is a cartoon series where most of the action takes place in the human body where the actors are vitamins, viruses, cells, etc. I will not try to explain it in more detail, you will simply have to see it for yourself you: You will not be disappointed. <br /> I remember watching this as a kid in the 80s (with Swedish voice). I talked to a few who were also kids in the 80s and loved it too! I must admit that part of education in the episodes did not get to me at a conscious level but the whole idea of ​​educating children while they have fun is wonderful. I recently saw some episodes; There is a humor and heart that is hard to find in other children's programs nowadays. <br /> <br /> 5/5
