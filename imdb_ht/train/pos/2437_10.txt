To say that this film is merely a demonization of Catholicism and a bad reputation in the story is true. This is not that movie. What this movie is a comment on the Church's abuses (although this could be substituted for any powerful body), this way affects people and families and the way many people choose to choose and often participate in The abuse without thinking for themselves. The fact that it is the Catholic Church that is in the wrong is simply because of the nature of the true story is the movie based. To label this as a Catholic propaganda seems to miss the truth about what the Catholic Church did at times; Its stories are often not great and it's a movie that is like this highlight and needs to be highlighted. Yes, we should comment on abuses committed in other organizations but not to repay this movie. <br /> It's an amazing movie that made me in tears and well worth watching - 'If we do not study past, we're bound to repeat it'
