This is one of those movies that are hard to review without giving away the scheme. Try to say there are strange things and unexpected twists go on, beyond the first superficial "Tom Cruise vice around with several women" scheme. <br /> <br /> Throw in this high quality video elevator above the norm, and all the cast are well suited to the parties: Cruise as the playboy unjustly skips that have it all - and then, losing it all, Diaz as the attractive lover, but a little disrupted to jilted, Cruz as the exotic girl new to the scene and Russell as the father psychologist. The story involves elements of romance, morality, murder-mystery, suspense and sci-fi and is generally a fun trip. <br /> <br /> I should add that the photography is also exactly exactly excellent and the insertion of various visual metaphors is beautiful once you realize what's going on. <br /> If you enjoy well-acting movies with twists and suspense, and are ready to accept a little fantastic Philip K Dick style resolution, then this is a must-see. <br /> 9/10
