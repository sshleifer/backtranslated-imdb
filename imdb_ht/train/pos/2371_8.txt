I suggest renting this movie to my friends and it is required since she has already seen the movie and she said she was okay. I thought the title was somehow since the version of our store was called "The Fear: Halloween Night". I hope this movie must be a bit of a Halloween Rip off with a wooden killer guy. But it was opened with a good scene and the assassin murdered two victims immediately and shining forward twenty years later where his son witnessed the murder of two (including his mother) and was even witnesses His ancestral suicide is going to be a secluded cabin in the woods and his friends and his girlfriend where he tries to cope with his fears until a wooden statue comes to life with his ancestral spirit. Pretty good for an end and I never even saw the first.
