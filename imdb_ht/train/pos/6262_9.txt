This was incredible, meaning it was hard to believe, that the "forgotten tribe" would make this migration surprising twice a year, and that the cinemas, Cooper and Schoedsack, did not step some of the scenes and vaccine. But what shots are! The cinematography, under extremely extreme conditions, is brilliant, and notes of Iranian music add to the video release to give this memorable document a wealth added. <br /> I had the pleasure of seeing this with "Koniki Turkey" at the same weekend, which was a thrill and certainly made me see how hard and hardy and brave people can be, whether primitive survival or the need for adventure or science name.
