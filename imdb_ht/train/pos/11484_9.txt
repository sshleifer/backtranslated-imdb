I just returned from the Montreal Premiere in Zero Day ... and I'm astounding as Hell find a negative comment on the movie. Basically the blame is about Coccio making a social message easy and overplayed ... well, Mr-I'm-a-revised, it's an easy criticism and overplayed in movies with a social charge. <br /> Not that I want to expose my life here, but I'm from a small town with a school that looks like these guys go. Registry & Ignorance in the Menu. The thing is ... I understand how children can drive to make these horrors. High schools have become field fights in compliance. It's a real ugly eye. You need to fight your way of being like the others. It's hard to explain, a lot of people dosen't realize that high schools are becoming cemeteries of human intelligence. Meanwhile, parents will close their eyes and smile about how their comfortable living subjects are perfect. The real motive of the film is not about what leads them. It's about this neighborhood death as calm and everyone close their eyes and trying to create this atmosphere in a perfect city. Cal expressed it well. It's a call up. Drama is everywhere and it can take all forms. In this case the play (like Andre called a paddock for wearing a shirt J. Penny) placed in the nightmare was worse in a whole city. Andrew & Cal took the most extreme way to express their pain. The discomfort of unconformity in an era where you need more than ever to be like others to be accepted. <br /> I like particularly the recent scenes where some guys burn the crosses of Andrew & Cal, as if with the pain they communicate, Cal & Andre communicated their blind rage to their community, the refusal of thinking on the causes of some acts. <br /> It might seem aggressive as a movie, but Coccio is meditating over jealousy or incompetence. What Andrew & Cal is living is a reality ... with a fearful one that might be found in other children. <br /> <br /> Movie Disorder ... Home made with strong feelings made by Ben Coccio to make a very disturbing movie.
