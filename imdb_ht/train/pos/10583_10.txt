The Stock Exchange Stock Market in 1929 and Depression almost destroyed the American musical theater, in fact he blew the final death of vaudeville. Those behind the curtains were as bad as those before. <br /> In an effort to promote the business economy displays with its own personal economy, from James Cagney's director of theater work come up with a brilliant idea. Stages live prologue that are important in the films that have been shown in the various movie theaters that spring up overnight from the old theaters. Some other competitors get wind in it and the competition is over. <br /> <br /> Parachute Parade is my favorite Busby Berkeley movie. He gives James Cagney a chance to show some of his versatility as a dancer as well as a tough guy. In his retirement Cagney he said that while he screened some and far between musical a lot, he could barely be bothered with some of her dramatic films. He wanted to make a few more music in his career and I wish he was there. In how these platforms in Busby Berkeley extravaganzas on the stage of a movie palace defy all logic and reason. But it's so creative and fun to look. <br /> <br /> Dick Powell gets singing three songs at Parade Parade, Ah Moon is Here, Honeymoon Hotel, and Not a Waterfall, the last two with Ruby Keeler more surely than the screen team. Ruby sings and dances with Powell at the last two and she's partner James Cagney in my favorite number from Parade Foot, Shanghai Lil. Joan Blondell is Cagney's no girlfriend's nonsense Friday in the theater. Like crazy blonde, it is one with the real brains of that duo and it's her quick thinking that loads her out of some domestic problems she has on her theater. One of Blondell's best screenshots. <br /> Look for Dorothy Lamour and Ann Sothern in the chorus as per IMDb pages for both of them. John Garfield has seen shortly the number of Lil Shanghai. And in a stage at the start of the movie, Guy Kibbee producer takes Cagney into a movie theater where a western show begins John Wayne. Duke's voice is unambiguous. But what's even more strange is that the short clip shows him in a scene with Frank McHugh who plays another Cagney assistant in Footlight Parade. I think Warner brothers have played a little joke. I had to believe that the clip was deliberate. <br /> <br /> Parent Parade is Busby Berkeley in her best true.
