This movie star Jay Leno as a Detroit cop, Tony Costas and Pat Morita as a Tokyo captain sent to Detroit to retrieve a thief prototype of a car engine. A Japanese man traveled to Detroit hoping to sell him to a company up and coming running car in a man named Derrick Jarryd. Unfortunately for him the guys who were supposed to negotiate the contract kill him and took the prototype. A madman Derek Jarryd tries to distance himself from Phillip Madras who led the guys. But Madras (played by Chris Sarandon) has none of it and threatens Jarryd forcing him to continue their partnership. Meanwhile in the junk yard even where the Japanese man died, a friend of Tony Costas was also killed by the same people. Tony's friend was watching the junk lake. Tony Tony sets out to find the killer against his superior order. Tony is on stealing while obviously homicide should investigate the case. While Tony is investigating the crime he runs off the Japanese cop and mistakingly arrested him. Eventually they finish working together on the case. They make an odd pair and some really fun parts as well as some ridiculous scenes like Pat Morita jumping and kicking right through a fast moving car in a moving car and kicking Madras at the top. But it ends up being a buddy movie buddy entertainment, at least in my opinion. Jay Leno is not actor, but it is unmatched in the role and Pat Morita is good as well. Still, they make for one of the easiest easy to copy the duo into a movie action. If you liked movie movie buddy, movie 80 movie or you want to see Jay Leno as an actor then I recommend this movie.
