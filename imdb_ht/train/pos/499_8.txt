The Pilot of Enterprise has one thing that has been missing since the Star Star cartoon: A dose of realistic, flawless personality. The utopian characters of the next generation were tedious, being so noble to be incredible. I also love the sub-sketch that people are bitter toward the Vulcans. It's funny to see them as pretentious snowboarders. It makes me look forward to seeing when people become the dominant race between the two, even though I do not think it would work in the time frame of the show. The only negative that flowed from me was "the rapid cut off the finish in 2 hours" feeling in the end, which is common among many of the trek shows. The second was searched cynically for evaluation by a couple of sinelessly sexy scenes. It was out of place, a good science fiction show should be able to stand on its own without attempting to pad the pre-teen audience with some skin. But it does not work to make the show profitable, so oh well. Allow to see how the next episode does.
