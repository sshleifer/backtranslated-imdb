I must vote this 10 out of 10 of the rare odds that it happens to see this review, take pity on me, whisk me Hollywood and involve me in his freak / funny world. But in all gravity, it was good. The first episode is obviously getting to foot, but it's got that Silverman weirdness runs all the way through it. It's not a laugh out loud sort of comedy, but that's the good thing, too much to have a laugh-track in it, and this should not be right and signal when they laugh, it's the audience hear jokes inside the street absurd it all. I can easily see this as bizarro Drew Carey shows with its unusual character and incredibly strong central character. Well worth a look, look forward to these episodes. A good good chance out of the usual comedy out there. <br /> <br /> ps, Sarah? Call me....
