As a former 2-time Okinawan karate world champion, I love film about sports sacrifice. But this movie is over much more. This movie is so good and so deep. I have recently been plagued by very serious injuries and pretty much a disaster lack of passion. Almost light for me. And this funny little movie touches me so deep-like from a maze he reminds me of what life is supposed to be about. This is a movie about living. Living your life for yourself and respect for others. Empowerment. God, blessed "Bend it like Beckham" I believe it is a true gem.
