This show is without a doubt one of the greatest shows ever to be on TV. I mean the act is great, suspense, drama, comedy, it has everything, and a story like a simple: An plane crashed on an island. The characters are great and Evangeline Lilly is HOT !!!!!! Matthew Fox once again shows us what a great actor she is, Josh Holloway is so great, Jorge Garcia is hilarious, I could go on and off. Also, the draw is unexpectedly drawn, the stories are back to the characters, the music that is at the end of every episode. J.J. Abrahms once again proved to be an excellent writer and his producer is. I mean this is better than ALIAS, and I loved ALIAS. Anyone who does not watch this show, should definitely consider getting the DVD and watching it, because they miss something big. Show this can possibly be the best show in TV history !!
