Aggie (Diane Keaton) is an accomplished and award-winning author with a beautiful face and an independent spirit. Hugh is hitting. She convinced Aggie to become her fianc√©. But Aggie will be sacrificing its principles of honesty in the world of politics, where things are not always what they seem to be? And, will he be able to withstand the rigors of a harsh media blitz? This is, especially, a beautiful romance for those who worship in affection. Hugh and Aggie are absolutely in love with gender and conversation are a good view. However, although the movie tries to show the political life of its reality, it's not quite successful. Nevermind. Their production value is high and the very chic script is written. With these advantages and the beautiful characters in Keaton and Harris, those who sit in the movie will find it to be fun entertainment.
