So much has been written about the film scheme, the wonderful acting act, the script, the melancholy, the bittersweet atmosphere, the superb direction - what can I add? Just look for one of the most heart-warming planet, very well-acting, striking scene ever filmed. It is Christmas Eve and Frank Morgan's character (the owner of the store - Mr. Matuschek) is recovering from his broken marriage with a suicide attempt. As each of her employees left her invited to a Christmas dinner. Each and all of them are politely turning it down. They all plan for the Christmas Eve. At this stage there is a deep sadness of this moving scene. Frank Morgan gives her career performance and this scene easily brings me to tears. Fortunately we have a happy devotion to this very special scene. The new employee, the boy in hand, is the latest to exit the shop in a beautiful snowy street scene. Despair Mr. Matuschek approached this boy and asked him how he would like to spend the evening with him and he will treat him to all the wonderful Christmas food that this boy's mistake has probably never seen! The chap is overwhelmed, it is also obviously as solitaire like Mr. Matuschek and together they can have a nice Christmas meal. Every time I see this scene it moves me. If you manage to find the delightful DVD look at the big trailer with Frank Morgan introducing himself as Mr. Matuschek and an appearance by the director of the film - talent Ernst Lubitsch. This movie is a joy from beginning to end.
