They did it. And, boy, did it fantastically or what! The BBC finally brought the doctor back to our screen on a Saturday evening where he belongs! And they did it with style! <br /> <br /> EPISODE One: "Rose" - One of the forces in the new series is Russel T Davies as a writer and executive producer. He is a fan of the show and knows what other fans want, but is also an experienced writer in his own right, so know what others want. Another force, as perfectly shown here in this first episode, is Billie Piper and her character at Rose Tyler. Finally the Doctor's companion gets a credible back story with a strong character. Also nice to see the return of the Autons - a classic nod to the Series. <br /> <br /> EPISODE TWO: "End of the World" - At the beginning of this double bill is shown in the TARDIS 'Force, we end up in a story where special effects are everything! They now have the technology to create real, credible environments and monsters - no more to suit the quality tires! Also the suggestions at the end of this episode regarding the past The new Doctor - very intriguing to kill all the Time Cows and make it the only one. <br /> <br /> Three episodes: "The Unquiet Dead" You've got the future, now allowed to have the past. The first non-Davies written episode is somewhat flat in some places, but this is made up by Charles Dickens Simon Dick and the sudden twist of the draw when it is revealed the pitiful gelf is not so pitiful after all. EPISODE FOUR: "Foreign in London" - The consequences of Dr.'s actions are fully explored in this series, not least with the effects of Rose running with him. Also, we have our first cliffhanger; not the best of admittedly. Slitheen are an interesting villain, though they can also look at CGI for their own good. <br /> <br /> EPISODE five: "The Three-World War" - The second part of this story about Slitheen suffers from the same problems in the first. Also, the clips from the next episode come to the end of the current episode to annoy and spoil it for people. <br /> <br /> EPISODE Six: "Dalek" - Yes! We had the future, past, and present (ISH), but now we get to the good thing - return to the doctor's enamel. But I think we can complement Christopher Ecclestone - it was brilliant as the doctor, and no more so then in this episode, where we see the pain on his face as he recalled the war of time and nature to the alien in his way as he almost came into a Dalek himself. <br /> <br /> Seven episodes: The "Long Game" - really only a story to act as a prologue for the final series. Saved by Simon Pegg as editor of Smarmy and Tamsin Grieg in a fun comedy. The media will control you - which never did before, it was ... <br /> <br /> Eight episode: "Father's Day" - this is a great episode. Full of human emotions and grief for Rose, and the true consequences of what happens when you really muck up history. Full Mark of Billie Piper here. <br /> <br /> NINE EPISODE: "The kid is empty" - I do not find this kid very scary. Sorry, but I do not. It's a good episode though, but the cliffhanger could still be best - it's those "next bits" spoiled bits. John Barrowman presented here as Captain Jack, the superbly conman - he is a good actor who has been around for a while, but only seemingly noticed right now. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />! An optimistic optimism is nice, though a little confusion maybe for younger viewers when the "Mummy" appears? <br /> <br /> EVENING EPISODE: "Boom Town" - probably the weakest of the series, but that does not mean its bad. A nice return for the Slitheen and also an interesting character study of the doctor and Rose. <br /> <br /> TWELVE EPISODE: "Bad Wolf" - this begins in quite funny, with some good-hearted humor and fun cheeky make of popular TV show on Blighty. Things are turning very dangerous quickly, though, with the revelation in the end is the best cliffhanger of the series! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />! A fantastic physician in many ways, David Tennant has to work hard on his socks for being good. The regeneration scene of the end is very well played. Oh, and the Daleks are back - in the extreme! God bless CGI, because they can never pull this in normally! <br /> <br /> In general - brilliant! 9/10
