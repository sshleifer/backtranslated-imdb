I just saw the "Door door doors," and this was the first flick softhead with a solid story behind it that I had seen in a while. <br /> We start with two neighbors - Vivian and James Fenway (Julia Kruis and Eric Carrington), and Lillian and Gabe Harris (Nicole Sheridan and Chris Gustafson). Vivian looks like a housewife, James is a lawyer who runs for the district attorney, Lillian is working in real estate, and Gabe is a successful plastic success. Got all this? Now let's get into it. <br /> <br /> Put Abby, played beautifully by porn star Chelsea Blue. It's renting the house across the street from the Fenways and all life by itself. In the beginning of the film, James looks out his window and sees Abby engaged in playtime with his girlfriend, Gigi (played by prolific pornstress Monique Alexander) and secretly begins wondering what he would like to be with him. The next day, Abby gets acquainted with all four of them, and appears to be a beautiful woman who just happens to be living an alternative life. She makes a pass to Vivian, which looks surprised and tells her, "Oh ... i ... by that way." Everything looks okay ... until the plan comes in motion <br /> First, Abby shows up at Gabe's office, naked, asks Gabe if he should get a boob job. This is where we get our quote from the movie: <br /> <br /> "Tell me about Gabe." "What do you want to know?" "Is Gabe happily married?" "I'm married." "There are problems ... let me guess. Your wife lives in the house and does everything you ask, but she's a good girl." "Yes." "It's not a bad girl?" "No" "Does this door have a lock on it?" <br /> You know what happens next .... Abby gets it on with Gabe, right there in the test room. And she put on a little show in her window for James, who comes up with waste no time to sex with her. What James does not know is that the teddy bear on the piano and the blind eye is really a camera stuck all the festivities (it's so obvious anyway). Abby had sex with Gabe again later, and this time Gigi joins and makes it a three way. Now that Abby has something on both men, she asks $ 100,000 in each in order to buy her silence. Not only did he have to break James in office, but he could destroy Gabe's practice. While Gabe and James fought with their guilt, Abby found time to seduce Lillian - who "experimented" with college women. This was a long time ago, but you would not know that seeing him in action with Abby - it looked like an old pro. While Gigi goes along with the plan, she seems jealous for all the gender of her girlfriend. "Only business," Abby says. Confessions and exhortations are sure to follow, as are some thrilling info about true abby's identity - it seems he did the same thing to different people in many different places. Gabe and James use this information in battle against Abby's blackmail. <br /> Now, in sex. The sex scenes were very good, and considering all the women involved in this movie except for Julia Kruis have a long pornography background, I would not expect anything less. Six scenes Nicole Sheridan were best in the movie, and three-way come in a second lock. Monique Alexander only got naked once, but he was a relatively minor character. Julia Kruis was a bigger character and was naked as long as she was. I suppose since she was surrounded by experienced hardcore pros, she did not have many sex scenes. <br /> <br /> To wrap up, "Behind Bedroom Bedroom" has a great storyline, which boosts the overall class of the movie. I considered it clay. <br /> <br /> Female: A- (Nicole Sheridan was good at this movie - better than her offering later in Fred Olen Ray's comedy .At least she can play drama somewhat. Stage scenes - she did not 'that's bad as the antagonist. I would give him a whole all by himself Julia Kruis was herself usual. I wish Monique Alexander had more time to figure out this movie, though.) <br /> <br /> Sex: B (solid scene, very solid sex ...). ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... .. ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ...) screen.) <br /> History: B + (I like the dialog with the main scenario Chelsea Blue's performance was good for the genre, and I was impressed with Nicole Sheridan's drama in drama.) <br /> Overall: B (This was a nice softcore flick. I'm glad I could watch one This, as I was pleasantly surprised.If Chelsea Blue ever wanted to do more of these, she should be welcomed anytime and that goes for Nicole Sheridan, too - even though she's probably better off doing comedy. hardcore girl idea that can act to make softcore movies.)
