I finally came around to see this after hearing big things about it. It actually exceeds my expectations. Considering the budget involved, this was an amazing and well-designed movie. The lack of funding actually helped this movie in many ways, especially to the scheme. Just Like The Blair Project Witch, this movie was all the best of being shot on video instead of movie. Another bonus: Even if the lowest-budget film (even better at the best) suffers from mediocre-to-safe hysteria, this film actually has a talent throw (save one or two characters) , particularly of driving. The only thing missing in the movie was an original storyline. She borrows the best-known films such as "Deliverance" and "Wrong Turn", but if you are like me, the film of this nature never ceases to be dire. Plus, the director keeps things interesting at all. I would be very interested to see what the director would do with a bigger budget and I have a feeling it will be just a matter of time before we get ...
