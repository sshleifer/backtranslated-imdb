I just watch this movie, not mistaken. What a little gem. This film was made in 1956 looks, and feels, as a late Seventies movie. And is in fact better, more restrained and correct than, say, Blue Soldier. The environment, subscriber anthropology is way ahead of its time. The understated cinematography is superb and extremely realistic. More than dances and wolves, the last Hunt managed to convey the look and feel of Buffalo's "killing fields" in the late 1800s. Probably because people in the movie were real killing fields. The film was shot while legal forest directed Buffalo kulls, so the animals you see are really shot, the real bones. In conclusion, a most under-rated masterpiece, superbly acting, directing and injecting.
