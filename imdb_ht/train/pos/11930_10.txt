This movie was very good. I'm not too big a fan of baseball, but this is a movie that made to help understand the meaning of love, determination, heart, etc. <br /> Danny Glover, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Brenda Fricker, Christopher Lloyd, Tony Danza , and Milton Davis Jr. were brought in with a variety of talented actors and understanding of the sport. The plot was credible, and I love the message. William Dear and the men put together a big movie. Most sports films revolve around true stories or events, and often do not work well. But this movie hit a 10 on the perfect scale, though there were some minor mistakes here and there. <br /> 10/10
