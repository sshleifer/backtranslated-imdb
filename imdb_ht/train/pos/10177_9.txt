'De Grot' is a Dutch thriller thriller, based on books written by Tim Krabbé. Another of his books, 'Gold Ei' made in the great thriller of the mystery musician named 'Spoorloos' ('Vanishing') in 1988. This one is not as good as thriller (although better than noticed The American also called the 'Disappearance') but there are times when it comes to closing. <br /> Mostly the opening moments are terrific. We see a man, later we learn his name is Egon Wagter (Fedja van Huêt), from an airline in Thailand. When choosing bags it is very clear that it is smuggling something across the border. These scenes are perfectly directed, photographed and acting. A kind of suspense created that you would normally not have in an opening scene like this. Later we see Egon making his deal in Thailand with a woman, both claiming that they never did anything like this. At this point the movie is still flashback and flash-forward. We see how Egon, always like a child (here played by Erik van der Horst), befriends a guy named Axel (like a kid playing by Benja Bruijning). We learn how to grow as friends, sort of, and how Axel (as an adult played by Marcel Hensema) became a criminal. Egon's meanwhile goes to college and settles with a woman. Around this time she sometimes meets Axel, but she does not really want anything to do with her. The film is chronologically in a way. It shows Egon and Axel as children, than students, young adults, and among the thirty. But from time to time, as I said, the movie went back to when they were kids and jumping forward again. Each time we see them as a child explains something that happens when grown old. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> So that gives the movie its happy ending, although it is in fact not that happy. Like the start, the finish is terrific. Part of the movie is fun and in a way to distract our attention to the first scenes, only to return to this point at the end. It is the correction that gives the movie its happy end, although we can say the dramatic ending to happiness in a way as well.
