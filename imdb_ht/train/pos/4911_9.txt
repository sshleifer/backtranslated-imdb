This film has, over the past ten years, has become one of my favorite pseudo experiences. Three threadsline provided by Kazan each have unique and separate fun. The domestic chitchat between Bel Geddes and Widmark, the movement between the rooms, the tiny gestures like Barbara's phone book placed on the chair under her son so he can reach the table, these small intimate exchange between husband and wife Wives, all are well-crafted and natural. More than anything else, I love porches, that second living room where it's clear they spend much of their summer time. The fabric is the second professional relationship between many of the films but especially between Widmark and Douglas' characters. It may not be totally original and get a bit louder but everyone at all, it comes across as real, respectable and effective. Third wires, the grungy story of Blackie and her little gang, it gets us closer to a black and dark black world cloud. The cloud is as cold as an ice block. This self-proclaimed business person, this self has made people clearly have a complexity of us only briefly. For me, this film continues to be a complete satisfying experience.
