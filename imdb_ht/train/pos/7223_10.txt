The comparison of Sleuth, the earlier-play-turn-movie scene, is obvious and on my first look, I'm too worried Sleuth was better, but Deathtrap has, at least for me, many more repeated views of it than Sleuth. > <br /> I bought the bargain bargain Deathrap at Wal Mart, who had figured out that he had Caine and Reeve melee and was worth 6 dollars. It was one of the best DVD purchases I could pick up. <br /> It's one of the best kept-secret that film enthusiasts still are always happy to discover. And it's totally worth repeating tonight. <br /> <br /> Even though Laurence Olivier and Michael Caine returned to Bravado's performance at Sleuth, I was doubly impressed with Christopher Reeve as Clifford Anderson. Reeve, just associating with his paintings now legendary Superman, stole the show of what should be a Oscar worthy performance. I always felt Reeve was a tip-cast actor who did not get much of a chance to shine out of the Superman movies and a few other but fun but fun pictures but somewhere in time, but this movie shows that Its potential was really tapped and set to use, thank God's kindness. <br /> I absolutely link Michael Caine's performance. It was glassy, ​​delightful manipulative and sadic. And watching her work with Reeve and Dyan Cannon was an absolute pleasure. In fact, it was thanks to this film that I received from a "Michael Caine Phase" and started leasing as much of her stuff as human as possible. <br /> As for Deathtrap, there are enough dialog dialogs here to fill up its "memorable" section. (Unfortunately, many of the dialogue would naturally spoil the very fun draw). It's really, really hard to talk about the movie without releasing important point points that are infinitely more fun to discover on your own. Needless to say, it's a must-see. But for me, he was the greatest and most rewarding buyer ever. <br /> <br /> Repeated View is a must. <br /> And she deserves to sit with Sleuth on your DVD rack. <br /> I'll leave you with this quote very well written in the movie: "I wonder if it would not be ... well ... just a trifle starry-eye in my way into a risky collaboration and exciting ... where I could count on no moral sense obligations ... too. "
