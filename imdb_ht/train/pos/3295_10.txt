Such a movie of beauty that it is difficult to describe. Perhaps it's in the absence of useless dialogue, or perhaps it's absolutely stellar, or perhaps it's just Meena Mumari's foot, but it's a joy to watch this movie again and again. I have never seen another American movie that comes close to it, and some come from any country to its perfection.
