I saw this in the theater during the initial release and it was disturbing then as I'm sure it would still be. It was the first part of '68 and this has always been the judges of towns throughout America and was recently a mass murder in my town where I saw this where a man went to a shooting rifle . The freshness of this close-to-home event combined with this dramatic storytelling event is made for a very disturbing theater experience. It really leads to life's excellent acting at Robert Blake and Scott Wilson. I was accustomed to the novel based on the true event by Truman Capote and the scenario and direction by Richard Brooks's wet event and Truman's interpretation of succinctly compelling Courageous cinemas. Music from Quincy Jones effectively scores his story. I've only seen this once couple since. It was too real. Almost as a witness to the crime itself and riding along with the killers. I would give this a 9.0 to a possible 10. Society is so desensitized in violence and crime today that this probably seems slow and tame and can be seen with less effect but to anyone over 50 this will be a characteristics of the test of the psyche criminal.
