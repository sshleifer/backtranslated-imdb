A smart script from the late SEBASTIAN JAPRISOT and smart performance from the two male leads - ALAIN DELON and CHARLES BRONSON (or it should be other way around) result in a fun and fun comedy. The highest skilled direction from JEAN HERMAN veteran with a sparse note, but effective by FRANCOIS DE ROUBAIX, it becomes easy why this film has an odd timeless quality. This is a friend friend or story liaison with two solitaire, both disarmed and weary world, returning, presumably from Algiers. Like the other colonial powers at that time (WW II post that led to the 60s), France was struggling to hold overseas emergencies. Losing Algiers was a bitter blow. <br /> <br /> ADIEU L'AMI (original title) History of our two (anti) hero as they struggle to make a go through it, after the discharge. / <br /> Something happens after another, and the viewer really has to pay attention, because JAPRISOT is lean and economical with his script: if it's, then there must be a reason. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Motivations are quite different, the different goals - the survival depends entirely on each other. That ALAIN DELON and CHARLES BRONSON are out for different - the former, arguably a beautiful boy, and the letter a ugly thug, add to the chemistry. <br /> <br /> This quest does for a great story, which in turn, makes for a great movie. <br /> <br /> If I forget the women in this movie, and the truths of Japrisot, they are also memorable, though not nearly as fleshed out; they say more should be spoiled by someone's pleasure to discover their true nature. <br /> <br /> Farewell, friends have been released in the UK; ANIMORFOR IMPORTS, 16.9 ENHANCED; In English only (not even subtitles for hard to hear); A time of 110 minutes; MONO SOUNDTRACK but the DE ROUBAIX music has lots of punch! <br /> <br /> Very recommended.
