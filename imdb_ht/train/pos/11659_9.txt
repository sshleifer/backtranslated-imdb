This animated feature (a co-production between Ireland, Belgium and France) deals with what is surely one of the oddest subjects ever for a movie: The Creation of the 9th Century of a Famous Illuminated Manuscript, the Book of Kells . In this fantastic story of this story, a prepubescent boy was named Brendan, living in a monastery led by his uncle, a sharply abbut who was worried to prepare the defenses of the Abbey from the attack Next by the Vikings were scared, must enter the forbidden surrounding forest found the materials that a master illuminator named Aidan needed to finish the book. To perform this task, in the jungle it is unexpectedly to get help in a friendly fairy named Aisling.Gorgeously and delicate draw in hand (there are some computer animations in a few key passages) in a way that looks like Celtic medieval and Traditional Art, with a very creative use of colors and all kinds of geometric shapes, this film is relentlessly weird, but is a good weird, not in the variety put off but in the eye opening sort. If one was in nitpick - beyond some anachronisms, like an African monk in 9th century Ireland ?? One should say that the mixture of mystical Catholicism and Celtic paganism in this film never really coalesce. And the funny rescue is sometimes a bit too big. That is why I can not give them the highest ranking. But these are minor issues with a fun movie and superbly imaginative movie.
