Parker and Stone transplants the explosive-torn humor transplants from the anime masterpieces to a live characteristic feature film live and generally good results. Many of the films are Trey and Matt running AMOK and new games boxes. The plot is simplicity itself: two middle men invented a new sport, a mix of basketball entrances and baseball notes that became a national craze. Along the way they meet many sporting clich√©s clips and send them up, along with any other bit of popular culture that comes to their sights. It runs as a South Park stretch episode, with the usual machine-gun dialogue, humor toilet and homilies from the heart. <br /> <br /> If this movie has a weakness it is the association with the team that has given us the "Aircraft" and the "naked gun" series. This influence is clearly with the heavy use of gage sight and the presence of a brilliant and rather Yasmine Bleeth role in the role usually given to Priscilla Presley. Robert Vaughn is doing a bit better playing the ** b ** rule that has been part of it ever since "Bullitt" and Ernest Borgnine releases as only he can, but one must admit it is perfect for the role of the team owner lunatic. /> <br /> For those who have not noticed again, Parker and Stone seem to be more comfortable as rock star wannabes than funny. This manifests the importance of providing the soundtrack in just about everything to create. As usual, they provide a good selection here including the compulsory track by their own ultra-non-PC DVDA. <br /> <br /> A special monsie must go to Dian Bachar, who deserves some sort of award for enduring hard work in Stan Parker and the Sell Stone of Cartmans. <br /> In summary, this is a fun comedy that is returning from its full potential not too much reliance on "nude weapon / plane" formula. Parker and Stone might do something really brilliant (or absolutely awful) if they give full control over a future movie. America, either locking these guys up or putting them in charge.
