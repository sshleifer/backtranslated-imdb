Since it has been some years since I reviewed this classic I decided to come back and review it further in dept, but first few notes initiated from a movie critic. <br /> <br /> This animated series is one of those I grew up and, having made my child happy, she made it awesome, missing some of this stuff today that we clearly do not see as much as we did back in the days, well on the review ... <br /> Talespin, or Airens Helte what's called in Denmark is a huge animated series, it is very much like chips and dales, ducktales and a lot of those old, so it has that unusual feeling that surrounds it, I can not remember this as much as I would like to remember it. But in my opinion it was very great, it came up with some kind of message, not sticking to a message, however it is one of the old people so that they can be forgiven. <br /> Now I do not want to sound old or nothing but I feel like time slipping out of my hands and these designs, today we see something like Ed E DD and Eddy or anything else weird As such, we have everything new or almost new like Hannah Montana or something like that, but I feel like we do not have the same spirit of drawing or real show as we did in early. <br /> <br /> Now maybe I'm wrong but I feel like time has changed so much, to conclude I should be thrilled to see the series like Talespin being released again in the TV screen instead of all the new ones to give me my cartoons, give them my kids a few days, give them again ...
