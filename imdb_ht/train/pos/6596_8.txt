Brazilian films often get more positive reviews than they actually deserve. Rather incredibly, Contra Todos (Tale of All) (original title, which producers abandoned: God against everyone) received very low GPA (grade point average) from this website. It seems to be forever scorned by big female spectators. Actually, it's not so brutal. I mean as far as graphic violence is concerned. Its brutality is intrinsic as it shows ta-lumpens, I mean abundant citizens who in fact possess high-tech equipment, which cold makes order killers in exchange of "grana gra√∫da". Is this post-modern man? Is it only anxious, almost impersonal, ultra-permeable to lie, among satiating foods? The picture is probably the best Brazilian film in 2004, so far. It brightens the image of the correction, through the Godard, its curious constraints, and more than efficiently cast in general and, above all, its original narratives, and subtle non-chronological concepts that only come to light in the epilogue, deserve at least one mark.
