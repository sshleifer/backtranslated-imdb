Sunny, a waitress restaurant in the D.C. area, is a bit tired, lightly set. He drives an old clunker and rents a small room from a gay male couple. However, he saved the life of an important Arab, not taking a bullet in the rear that was meant for the official. It's the national press with its remembrance and its sweet looks. Grab an opportunity, presidential aid to get it installed in the protocol department for the U.S. government. Even then, it releases things at times, but it tries hard and learn a lot. She even cares attention to a state-owned official. But is there another disaster plot in the making, which involves an Arab man who wants to take another wife? A blonde? LOL, LOL, LOL. This film features Goldie as beautiful as a picture and as dumb "like a fox", as they say. Sunny learns her way around the jungle of the U.S. government very, very well. It even has important things to say about honesty and lack of it in its protocol environment. Perhaps, the Arab community should be less thrilled than this work, but for those who love to laugh, this is today rent.
