I watched this every night on this week's VH1. This is an awesome portrait of the epidemic of drugs and how the drugs have appeared in the media for 60 years late and over through 70's.Woodstock's, Easy Rider, The Beatles, the Death of Morrison, Hendrix, Joplin are all Here. Vh1 was fashioned a complete complicated painting of life and liver during the "Drug Year". From the Sanfrancisco area to Studio Studio 54, this documentary shows the evolution and advancement of the drug business with the death and new life it breathes in American culture. From Marijuana LSD this documentary cocaine shows how the drugs entered the country, Movement hippies, conservative resistance, and how drugs have achieved art (music, cinema etc.) featuring tons of fascinating interviews with foot reel news. <br /> <br /> Movie Drugs: The Easy Trip Rider Up to Reeffer Smoke Smashing Body Boogie Nights
