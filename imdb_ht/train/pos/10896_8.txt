At first I did not think that Ben Affleck could really crawl on a funny Christmas movie, boy was wrong, my daughter invited me to watch this with him and I was not disappointed at all. James Gandolfini was funny, I really liked Christina Appelagate, and Catherine O 'Hara was good too, the storyline is what really sold me, I mean, too set up with family, on the table for those you only Hardly seen but once or twice a year, and probably do not get along with anyway, you really need as much alcohol as you system can stand to cope with Christmas, so I thought the quote was good There, to buy the family of 250000, was a little on the far side, but it turned out to be very good work, cause it was a riot all the way through, it shows the class struggle in families are different. It has lots of funny moments, including nasty things on the computer for a young boy. all of all I liked this movie and will watch it again next Christmas or earlier if my daughter also wants.
