Very enjoyable, very imaginative, and brunette movie all rolled into one, Stardust tells the story of a young man living outside a fantasy world going inside it to retrieve a bit of a falling star only to find the star is alive, young , and beautiful. A kingdom of kings dying on it said King unleashed a competition over his many sons to see who can retrieve a first Ruby to be king during a trio of witches wanting the star to carve and use to keep them young. These three wire plaques are woven together completely throughout the entire picture blended with current, dazzling effects, with some solid and humorous feelings as well. Stardust is a fun movie and has some fun performances in love of Claire Danes as the star (I could gaze at it for some time) to Michelle Pfeiffer (I could gaze at her in full magic powers again) play the awesome witch Robert Deniro plays a nancy-boy pirate when perfection. Charlie Cox as the tristan Lead is bland and credible and we get some pretty good work in a group of guys playing their son from being kings who are constantly and always trying to kill each other. Strong Mark, Jason Flemyng, and Ruppert Everett play their role well in both life and death (love this thread as well). Peter O'Toole plays Papa's bloodthirsty death and looks for Ricky Gervais's funny man who made me laugh more than anything in the movie all in his short minutes (beautiful feet). But the real power of the movie is the novel by Neil Gaiman and the script made from his creative and fertile spirit. Estel creates its own mythology and its own world and it works.
