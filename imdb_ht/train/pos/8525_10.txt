In order to evaluate this impartial movie you must think about the genre it's assumed: children. They had more guides to follow them in order to make this movie (meaning it could not get away with some of the humor and or tongue from the 1st) to take all that in this movie was fun and enjoyable to look. Sequels usually makes me nervous, however this one has done very well for herself. Knowing that he did not have the star power of Fraiser as George was capitalized on the humor and I believe showman did very well as the lead. The plot was easy to follow and maybe the lobbying campaign fits well for a younger audience, if you want to watch a movie and hope for this award honors academy is not it, but if you want to look a simple, fun, energy full movie you would make a good choice with this one.
