Kurosawa, fresh in color, loss of eyes in his usual terms of truth and perception of reality and opts for a depression on the Tokyo slum. Kurosawa stretches for a style that, in my opinion, her antithesis-that is, I feel as if Kurosawa wanted to make a picture of Ozu. Rhythm, poorly pregnant, this movie is a rare dude of this body of writer in excellent work. While Ikiru, while being mundane and depressing, was always interesting and quite rhythmic, and while stray dogs show slums and social pains in Japan without being too heavy or boring, to make it difficult to have all the somberness that one might expect with its content, and none of the qualities recreate in earlier Kurosawa photos. <br /> <br /> Be warned, this is not a movie that Kurosawa should judge by.
