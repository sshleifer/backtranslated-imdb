On the night of his undergraduate party, Paul Coleman (Jason Lee) meets Becky's gorgeous dancer (Julia Stiles) in the bar and drinks very well with the morning and wakes up with her on the bed. Her future mother asked her and informed that her fianc√© Karen (Selma Blair) might come to her apartment, and she desperately asked Becky to leave her place in a hurry. Earlier, she found that she had crab, and later, in the preparation of her wedding dinner party, she realized that Becky is the cousin of Karen. This is the beginning of a very funny comedy, and hilarious situations. The first attraction of this film is certainly the central trio of actresses and actors. Julia Stiles and Selma Blair, who is excellent and very gorgeous actress, and Jason Lee, who is amazingly funny, have good performances. I laugh very much about the story, but there are some really hilarious scenes. For example, when Paul finds Becky in his bed; when he finds his painting; His imagination in many situations; in the pharmacy, trying to buy and get explanation of the crab medicine; most of the scene of his neighbor, the minister; when Karen calls the department store; or when police get a suspicion of attacking Paul. I could count many other scenes, but the best reader rent or buy this movie and have lots of fun. My vote is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Louco Por Elas" ("Crazy for Them")
