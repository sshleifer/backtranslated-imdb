Yes, as incredible as it may, in 1968 a music won the Academy Award for Best Photos - and was the third music to win this award in a five-year period, the first being my Fair Lady 1964 and then the Sound of Music in 1965. The Difference Between My Fair Lady, the Sound of Music and Oliver! however is that Oliver! is infinitely better! By comparison. The first two cinemas are insuperated wet toys compared to Oliver's remarkably robust! The act is great; Their songs are great; The story is great and the dance is great. This film is dynamic, topical, relevant to the human experience and unlike the swollen gangs of New York, Oliver! offers a portrayal of poverty in 19th-century London, England that recalls sympathy without being condescending. Oliver Reed was a great actor and has proven it to Oliver! Other actors and actresses, especially Ron Moody and Shani Valais, are equally beautiful and offer powerful portraits of characters who evoke sympathy with warmth without being caricatures.
