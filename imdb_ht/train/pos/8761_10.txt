I like Claire Danes, and Kate Beckinsale looks amazingly immature in her role. The film is flawed only because it looks like the two of them seem in some monasteries, working like monks in the grass and under almost martial arts-like discipline. Acting with films and amazing colors of what is supposed to-to-be Thailand is eye-catching, but Claire Daines steals the movie all, and it is sudden outburst of learning to read the tough lesson in life itself at the very end of an act in the unselfishness amazing strange and completely unexpected in the real world. The minute flaws and I recommend the movie, which looks unfortunately buried in rare TVs. I want one to want the movie for my collection-a collection of only "10" movie rated. Look at it, you'll touch.
