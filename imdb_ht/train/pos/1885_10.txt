This was one of my favorite movies for a long time. Recently I was pleased to see it on DVD which is a relief to watch the old versions, VHS versions. <br /> I did not see it in years and watch it today to find myself surprised at how well film stands up to time. It's one of those rare, perfect storms in great comedy writings (truly funny line after truly funny line) frightening with great direction and outstanding performance all at the same time. Dudley Moore received an Oscar nomination for "Arthur" but lost (although John Gielgud was the best actor to support). If Moore's performance in "Arthur" does not have a better Oscar actor - proof that no actress comedy might ever have the title (another example is Gene Wilder's "Young Frankenstein"). <br /> The Steve Gordon Crafts Film very well kept true to each of the characters and the warm-hearted tone of the story. Quite simply, the IMHO movie is a rare gem. Only sad that Steve Gordon passed away just a year after "Arthur" was released. <br /> <br /> Regarding DVDs available as of 1/2007, it's so / so. Although the video quality is a leap over old VHS copies, there are still no panoramic versions available. <br /> <br /> The DVD has a few extras that are nice but it's just not enough. An example is the comment from the Director stating how much he wanted to know how to safely delete and scene could include (because of hysteria), but that he had to make difficult choices for a final edit. The DVD, the perfect format included the materials, certainly would have to offer it too. <br /> This, the original "Arthur", is a classic comedy that is one for the books.
