I read the book and I must say that this movie remains true in form. I think this is the beginning of the psychological thrillers of the same genre of Psycho. Cristina Raines gives an excellent performance as the lead, and Burgess Meredith gives an excellent actor to support as the next-door neighbor. I've seen this movie at least twice and I think I'll buy both the book and the movie for my collection. The suspension just keeps building up to the climatic end, the twist you will never come up. If you like movies such as Signs and the Village, the Sentinel will be a classic prelude. Also, what's interesting is the actors in the movie-you would not recognize them if you do not read the credits. The late Jerry Orbach is great as the commercial director and Jeff Goldblum is excellent as the photographer. Also there is Beverly D'Angelo, who is underground but great.
