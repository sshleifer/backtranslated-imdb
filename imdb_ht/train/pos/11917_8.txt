Yeah, the archetype of a simple but inspirational film. The end is so great when the whole crowd in the stadium gets up and the people are increasing but they give me a chill every time I see it. It's just brilliant. Joseph is wonderful as the lonely and sad kid who has so far been shamed by anyone and anything in his life. His way to interact with Danny Glover and try to make him believe in the magic and the angels are funny and exhilarating. A very beautiful family movie with - I concede - a rather delicious late end. But hey, it does not really matter, the movie maintains its basic core is not a good act of inspiration.
