My parents took me to this movie when I was nine years old. I never forgot it. I have never before been anything beautiful like Elizabeth Taylor. (It was twenty-two when she made Elephant Walk) Remember, I'm nine, so feelings are not sexual, I just could not see anything else on the screen. I just wanted to sit at his feet like a puppy and staring up at it. He began to show his age (It's almost seventy-four) but I still believe it to be one of the most beautiful and enchanting women ever lived. <br /> I've seen the film several times since, and it's a windmill. What saved her is, of course, Miss Taylor's beauty, beautiful landscape, the impressive elephant's defense, and a well-off point of human humiliation in the face of nature. <br /> In all, a couple of hours have watched the movie channel or a leaked video.
