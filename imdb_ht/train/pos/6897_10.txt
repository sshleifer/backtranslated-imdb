He was released in France on DVD several years ago - I wish he would re-release with English subtitles. Do not confuse this with a remake and Penelope Cruz that gets revised to the poor. Gerard Phillippe is a peasant who has been told by a fortune teller that he will marry the daughter of the king. He lay down to join the army and go to war. Her love, however, is Gina Lollabrigida in an early movie for her. I will not spoil the end. Gerard Phillippe died a few years later at a young age, a huge loss of moviedom.
