Perfect movies are scarce. Even my favorite movie tends to make flaws - behind windows looks like a little stagey at times, Chris Elliot's character at Groundhog Day does not work, the music note in our best years of our life is too cheese, at the beginning of Nights In Cabiria is a little too slow - but this movie is perfectly executed from start to finish. The script is brilliant, the act is superb all around (although Reese Witherspoon and Sam Waterston are amazing, the entire cast cast), the directing and the photography they are inspiring, and the music note touches without being intrusive (as some notes Miramax is too manipulative). Every sad moment is really moving, every moment of light makes me smile. That's truly one of the best films I have ever seen and I would like to have more movie love it. <br /> I am pleased that Reese Witherspoon went on the wardrobe after this movie, but I'm sorry to see that the recent cinemas are so much more escapist and funny than this serious film that is about real people, real feelings and issues real. Brilliant! A must-see.
