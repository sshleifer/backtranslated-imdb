When you typically watch a short movie you still fear that the person creating the movie is trying to throw too much of it. It's not the case with this one. A great story about a young girl who has had enough and other world's forces trying to help make things right. Eric Etebari does a wonderful thing in representing the spirit of twisting justice and helping to convey the complexities of the right and wrong line disturbances. <br /> <br /> Both the girl and the father give great performance in this wonderful short movie, but Eric's performance is definitely showing stealer in this story. I definitely recommend this movie for its complexity, performance, and great on all stories
