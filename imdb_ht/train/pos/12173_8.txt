First a quick 'lock!' to those who say this movie feel. You can not go to every movie waiting for 'Citizens Kane'. This was actually a fun movie. Jason Lee is good at all he does. The only flaw in this film is, I do not think there was enough heat between Lee and Julia Stiles. They should stay more. Otherwise, the movie is a great fun. Selma Blair needs something to eat. He worried me. But it always looks nice. So, yes, I recommend this movie for a date or night fun night party. Go see. <br /> RATING: ** 1/2 from ****
