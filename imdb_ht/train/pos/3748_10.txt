I watched it many times and I plan on buying the full feature. I love all the comedian Jason Steele. It's very different and unique and very enjoyable. I love this movie and this one is just great. The plot is strange, but very funny. This short movie is about a talk spatula called Edward. The order of events is a bit jumbled, making this movie very interesting to watch. At first you see Edward fighting the spoons, but then focuses on the earlier change in his life. This is a funny movie, but of course, it's still great. I highly recommend that you watch this movie at www.spatulamadness.com or www.filmcow.com. It's very funny. The mood can not match everyone's taste, but look anyway. It will only take 16 minutes of your time, and it's free. GO WATCH SOMEONE!
