This movie shows people among the 2 hotest days in Austria. It shows people outraging others and being cruel to other peoples. It shows people's inability to communicate or talk to others. <br /> At the screening I went to the people left in the middle because they could not watch the movie. And that's right. Because the movie is not with one easy to watch. It has a very depressive message and there is no moment of mercy in the movie. It's a very bad movie, not for everyone's taste. You can not talk about terms of fun in this movie. It flu in your throat and never let go and in the end you simply feel breathless because of its intensity. <br /> I can not "recommend" or "do not recommend" this movie. You should make yourself self based on what I said earlier. Just be aware that this is not a regular movie and not for everyone to taste.
