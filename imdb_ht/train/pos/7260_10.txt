Hi all my name Larisa I'm 13 years old when I was about 4 years old I look curly sued and she hits my socks in I've watched that movie for a long time in fact about 30 minutes ago just made it look it up. Alisa Porter is a really good actor and I like that movie It's so funny when she faces the cards. Every time I look at her end movie I'm crying to say that I know I'm only 13 years old but it's like her touching story really weird that Alisan is 25 years old now. Every time I watch a movie someone is still young and the movie out like a year after doing it and u watch it and find out how old the person in the movie really is wounder how they can go out at the next age. Like Harry Potter. This movie was great but still Daniel was about 12 years old in the first movie and I was about 11. So how can he go from 12 to 16 in about 4 years and I'm only 13. I'm not sure if it is 16 now I think it is almost 18 but this kind of unusual when u look at one movie and the next have about 4 year old then u when they were only 1 of the last.Im Not sure I have a great imagination and I like to rebuke it. I'm like a computer but I like to do a lot of things too. I'm very clever like curly stalking in the movie but one thing I do not like in the movie is when that guy calls the foster home and makes Curly call it took away I would kill that guy if he really did it in life real . Well, I'll stop writing I know a lot often sometimes but the kids have lots of heads that need to get out and if not kids will never get to learn. <br /> Larisa
