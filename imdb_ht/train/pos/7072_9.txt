Twelve Monkeys is a crazy time-traveling, streamlined movie star Bruce Willis who plays James Cole, a man who sent back in time to collect information about the devastating disaster that occurs in November of 1996. Unfortunately, it is also well away from the year 1990 where everyone believes it is crazy. This movie is thrilling and has great performance acting from Bruce Willis, Brad Pitt and Madeleine Stowe. Twelve monkeys are one of the biggest movies that traveled in time as I think anyone can enjoy. Terry Gilliam created a true masterpiece <br /> <br /> 10/10
