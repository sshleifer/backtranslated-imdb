When you come from Canada, I can not say if this movie is original in the context of Danish cinema - unfortunately, we, here, do not get to see many Danish films a year! I also can not comment on Clausen's acting in the context of her other role - I personally found her quite credible - a monstroz touched by a man, this Jorgen!
