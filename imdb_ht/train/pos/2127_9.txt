Calling this a romantic comedy is accurate, but nowadays misleading. The genre of sadly deteriorated in clips, also focused on making the main couple to get together with many small rooms for ambiance and other stories, making it formulated and overly predictable. The Shop Around the Corner does not suffer from these diseases: it manages to create a refined media / Eastern-European atmosphere and has a strong exclusive cast (also strong) nominal drive; I avoid using the words 'supported cast' as for example Mr. Matuschek (Frank Morgan) has a central role in the film and his story is though not more important than the romance. You received the Anonymous Money-Pen Puppet's idea idea from the movie and therefore was billed as a rumor. This is not correct and in fact unjust in the new movie - it shares the genre and borrows a trace element, but that's all.
