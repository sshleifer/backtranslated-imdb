I like this movie. He is well-written and acting and has good synhematics. The story mixes action, humor, mysticism, and tenderness and greatness and beautiful place of shots. Watch it, buy it, show it to your friends. The act is a good thing and Murphy specifically does a fine job that shows the hero hesitate and easy. I enjoyed all the characters and found them to be interesting and well developed and dynamic interactions. <br /> <br /> I handle what happened to these people and, while the result was pretty predictable (the good guys win, the amazing girl attracted to the holy child saved life - missing that comes?), it always makes me happy when everything worked out well in the end. Thanks to this dignity of the movie is never lost with a wicked end. Grab some popcorn, cuddle up on the couch, and watch this fun, happy and entertaining movie.
