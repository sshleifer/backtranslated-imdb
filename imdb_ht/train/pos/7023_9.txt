I liked that this film recognizes the intelligence of the viewer, allowing the layers to peel out of the characters in the interactions with each other on the unspoken loss that has so affected each of them. <br /> <br /> The cinematography is a beautiful, and is an inspirational reflection of the vision of someone I believe is a very talented new cinema with the maturity and artistic insight to tell a story that others have more experience has not failed to accomplish. I see a brilliant future for this writer / producer / director who has the ability to focus on a goal and to accomplish it with integrity. Kudos for this achievement.
