I love Lonely Lady's kind. Give Pia a break. It looks great and has really nice eyes. What Not to Love? The scene where it gets violated by Ray Liotta and a garden tire was kind of gross and cruel. Actually, a lot of things that happen in this movie are gross and cruel. But it's a waste film. A lot of trashy movies are not all bad. I loved this better than the Doll's Valley, which was not only trashy but boring as well. At least this was not boring. <br /> <br /> Pia gets naked and she looks miscast as a writer. Watching him talk about Pushkin and Byron and a guy three times his age is incredible flat. I'm sure Pia is a wonderful person in real life, it's just not the artist's art writer project. She looked happier when she worked as a hostess for that guy from Fever Saturday Saturday and wearing a glittery disco dress. <br /> <br /> A couple of scenes are funny. One of the places he tells the actor from the time that he's pregnant and he rolls his eyes and his master to "stop hanging around!", All while practicing fawning on every bimbo that flounces not. The pia nerve scene is good. It was probably a mistake so supernova on it (the whirlpool of floating faces and freeze-frame cry - whoa!) And its subsequent catatonic stupor is kind of late. <br /> <br /> The acceptance speech is a hoot, though. I want to see someone speak in a drama class. <br /> But again, this is our garbage we're talking about. You can get worried about any movie of the week back in the eighties.
