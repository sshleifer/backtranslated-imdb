OK. I'm partial. I live near Shrewsbury in England, where this beautiful movie was filmed. He always looks even now. I remember being filming here brightly, and the fake snow on the streets for the end of the day. Often, when I walk to Shrewsbury I see a street or house and it will remind me of this movie. George C. Scott's Scrooge is a more realistic character than many of the other screen versions. Its physical appearance is not the typical muffler. Scott is great and imposed. A man who finds people younger than himself should be inferior. <br /> We all know the story and the quotes. The book is one of the most reliable work in the English language. And I do not think there is much cynic that would say that people can not be changed with redemption. This movie version shows everything very well. George C. Scott can be American but plays part of the English misery and wonderful skills. <br /> I like this movie. If you have not seen this version I would strongly encourage you to do that. It is usually available for a small amount of money ... or do you also mean?
