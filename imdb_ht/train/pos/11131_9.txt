I went to a list of Oscar winners and was surprised to see that this movie hit Butch Cassidy and Kid at Sundance for the best photo of 1969. After actually seeing it, however, I'm not surprised again. It was way ahead of its time by considering its style, cinematography, and the use of flashbacks to help develop Joe Buck's character. <br /> <br /> My most amazing thing is the depth of Joe Buck's character in a short film. I think Voight has captured the naughty and vicious-air-inducing. The two scenes that really caught me were after getting into the theater and when older people asked him. I think when it looks in the mirror he's trying to see if he's really done-or is about doing something terrible. <br /> I think it was a brilliant decision by Hoffman to take that role. Otherwise it may have been typcast after graduation. Anyway, this is considered a major ever for a reason.
