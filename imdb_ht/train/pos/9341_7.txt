Sandler is amazing again ... I've already become a Sandler fan. This film is sad story Sandler. Its expression is fantastic. I called more to watch clicks but there are some similar points. To consider the value of the family before it loses it and to say 'I love you' is a few of the most impressive truths in life ... It is difficult, it is real ... and actually have a real owner Successful, Binder. I do not think another director could give these emotions in a way. <br /> Cheadle and Burrows are also amazing ... Cheadle is one of my favorites since crashing. Do not expect to laugh or very positive atmosphere ... If you are ready to face the facts of life, do not miss this movie.
