This can not be one of the best movies ever to do, but in general it is a very enjoyable, light-hearted piece of piece that everyone involved seems to have a good time. It's strongly recommended to feel good about it alone. OK, so Frank Sinatra's "acting" leaves a lot to be desired, but his singing is a great feature of catchers and songs to fit perfectly with the romantic atmosphere of the movie. Sinatra went on to make many more films where his sense of humor ability in this, his first venture in Hollywood, his voice, by his acting, is his main contribution to this movie. I just watched her again on TV and still lifts my mood as she did the first time I saw her many years ago.
