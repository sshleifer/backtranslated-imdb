Simon wrote their dialogue very closely by Matthau and Burns. You can literally hear the crack script. There are some outdoor movies that can develop as a relationship between the actors and the script. For example, the renowned scene scene could be a very duller and less-good actor involved. Mathew seems to have played Willie Clark (of course, Oscar Moreso of the Odd Couple), and all the little idiosyncracies and styles that Matthau inflated in the character (the line where he argues that he is with him since he lives in the city, while Lewis lives in Lewis that "out of touch" is this example of excellence) to make one of the best performances I have ever seen in any actor in any role, be it comedy or theater or whatever thing. Period. Matthau and Burns work closely together; The contrast is showing Simon's accent in creating comedy conflict. This movie is simply one of the ultimate "must-see" and he asks for a good prestigious place on the pages of movie history.
