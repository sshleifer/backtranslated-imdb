I thought that the film might be a bit more complex, in a psychological sense, perhaps but the action and voice acting headache. The animation was heavy CG in many scenes but very good at that. This is one of Batman / Forever's movies, including romance and conflict in Wayne and motifs for dating. 007 fans would like this, and so would the women, great theme songs! Wayne has been described very well in this movie, and Penquin has returned to his true form, there is no mutant gene in his time! I loved Robin in fact not being used too much, Tim Drake was just a good computer nerd, a bit of a Indigo child or idea of ​​the future. <br /> <br /> Throw in support made up of some soap opera stars, decent talent and characters are drawn in look like the actors also voice. Kelly Ripa was hilarious in this movie. <br /> I missed this under Phantasm, Return to the Joker, and Batman vs Dracula, but loved the smarter script better than I enjoyed Subzero. 7/10
