Alain Chabat is a fine actor, writer and director but maybe a lean trifle takes a 'idea' credit for a story that probably has to roll in the halls when Aristophanes have always learned that it's 'i' before 'and' except after 'c'. But, as I said, Chabat is a fine actor and can make charm when needed. I also gradually woke a gossip Charlotte Gainsbourg who also turned into a accomplished performance. If you absolutely insist on knowing, the 'plot' is the one about the guy well in his quarantine, and more than content to be single. This does not sit well with his mother and five sisters and get them on his back and make an 'arrangement' with the sister of a colleague pose - for fifteen thousand euros - as his new girlfriend, allow the romance to come to Fruit with a wedding and then lean it, so getting it into the hook. Of course they wind up together but along the way there are some sub-Benedek and Beatrice duels and everything to consider it in a very painful minute without pain and doing so well in the French box office that an end can not come out of the question .
