Carla works for a developer of the property where she excels in being unattractive, unappreciated and desperate. It is also deaf. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />! Help reaches the shape of Paul, a tattoo of fresh tattoos from prison and clearly without flaws in the usual routine in an office setting. <br /> <br /> A sexual impairment implication developed between two of them and Carla are determined to keep it on despite his reluctance to embrace the working week. When Carla comes from an important deal he has been negotiated by a colleague colleague and exploits Paul's crimes by making him stop the deal. The colleague quickly realizes that he's behind the flight, but when he meets, Paul's prep punch in the face is also handy - but this thuggery comes at a price. <br /> <br /> Paul is given a 'go on' by some movement friends as a reminder of a unpaid debt. She has formulated a plan that uses Carla's unique blend of reading ability to rip off a gang of robbery bank robbers. It is now turning Karla into a new scary world. <br /> <br /> The fourth feature from director Jacques Audiard, 'LI LIPS' begins as a well-engaged romantic drama between two marginalized perpetrators only in half gear gears in an ant thriller where the symbiosis of the symbiosis turns them of the winners. Driving is excellent; Easy to convince us that this odd couple could really connect. Carla's first meeting with Paul is an enjoyable masquerade in which he tried to circumnavigate his cleverness and jailbird behavior only to discover that he was, until recently, a jailbird. Emmanuelle Devos, who plays Carla, has that almost exclusive ability to go out of gorgeous dowdy and back again to a frame. Vincent Cassel plays Paul as a trapped dog who only really looks at the house when he gets a beat or concocting the rip-off that is likely to get him dead. As with many French films, 'MY READ' appears, first, to be about nothing in particular until you scrub beneath the surface and find that it's probably about everything. The only bomber note is a subplot of the missing wife of Paul's pre-eminent officer; A similar convincing device only helps to drag the main violence in the story of a little cool-de-bag feel. It was the French 'New Wave' in the 60's that first introduced the concept of 'genre' of films and I still felt that any medium is a bit compromised when you have to use a system of labels to help define it ; so it's always a pleasure to discover a movie that seems to be transmitting genre, or better yet, challenging it.
