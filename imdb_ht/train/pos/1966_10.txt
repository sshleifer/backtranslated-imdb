I'm not a usual comment on this website but see how to overlook this movie, I try to write some comments and remarks on it. I had fun watching this movie, perhaps because cats are all I wish I could, I'm not going to post to defectors or reveal cemetery, but there's the things that I really found amazing, how it manipulated people it's just for wine. this is a very underrated movie, I miss the argument here, I usually go enjoy and then talk little about it, when you go to the movies is fun, and I really enjoyed the 1h53 i stayed in the dark room. a must see over and over again until the fun disappears. Let's try not so much criticism about it. Thank you for reading.
