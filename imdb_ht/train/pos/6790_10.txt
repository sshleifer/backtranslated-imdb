This game is one of the best RPGs. Points, It is actually more fun than any other because of the battle system (or wrong the enemy depends on how to target the attack, you can transform into the dragon, the special attack, the magic ...). The script is very good. The characters are all beautiful and you have no time supported dialogues, as happened in several games in Final Fintasy series. I was bored of that dialogue over the past, when you just want to go on with the game's history. Ambientation is a jewel on this game and combines medium-sized science fiction science fiction. It is remarkable that animation effects are just incredible, and I love them more than any other modern game (we can not remember that the dragon legend is 8 years now). Then Map is great, there are all sorts of enemies. Finally, music is not the best muse of games I've heard, but it's perfect for a game like this.
