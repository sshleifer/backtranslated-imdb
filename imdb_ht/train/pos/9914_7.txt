Reviewed on the World Premiere Test September 9, 2006 at the Isabel Bader Theater during the Toronto International Film Festival (TIFF). <br /> <br /> This was an interesting site, but seemed to go over too long and too many shots of ewaste batteries (recyclable computers, keyboards, cables etc shipped on china by ton and then , classified and remade of new products to sell back) and other desolation. The creator tried to get more people interviews to reinforce the human element, but they often prevented them from doing so because of Chinese censorship. Still, what had been interesting. The bits of a large Shanghai real estate agent preening and strutting around showing off its luxurious castle and gardens, cutting off with the scenes of others living in medieval conditions were especially striking. The follow-up shot of a 480m factory rack was quite something as good. The scene of the three Gorges Dam project was also a complement to the Jia Khang-Eye film in TIFF (The Life Always / Sanxia Haoren & Dong Document) which was also built around this topic. /> Director of Jennifer Baichwal, Producer Nick de Pencier, Cinematographer Peter Mettler and topic Edward Burtynsky were all on stage for a Q & A after World premiere. Producer Noah Weinzweig was introduced to the audience and was thanked as the most key to helping in the land access to China itself.
