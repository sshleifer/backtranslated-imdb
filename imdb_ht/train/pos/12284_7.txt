Could not understand why Jeremy Irons felt it was necessary to show a most baffling accent, speaking in narrow teeth, and in the back of her throat. In fact it instead spoiled the movie for me, and distracted from what was probably a fine performance by him (very irritating). No other actor or actress seemed to have a pronounced accent and also I was still rated Jeremy Irons as a fine actor, I would not class this movie as being one of his best. The movie however was whetted my appetite, as some of the other comments made this film, which I found very interesting, and intends to now read the book.
