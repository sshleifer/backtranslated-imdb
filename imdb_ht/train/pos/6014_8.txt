All revisions are here on how many ZP missing scheme, the act is wooden, the orgy scene does not make any sense, etc., all miss the main point. <br /> Be honest. This is a movie that made in the hottest times in the late 1960s and early 1970s Los Angeles. It's a movie which means to look while you are H-i-G-H out of your mind about some psychedelic substance. <br /> Find some types of buds and smoke up, or get a serious hit in acid. Seriously, these straightforward and moderate reviews of ZP lack the point. You can not find anything out of this movie in a right frame of mind. Until you watch this movie on the big screen (which I'm lucky to do three times in the 1990s when ZP was quite rare) Tripping out, you have no idea what this movie is all about. <br /> <br /> If you insist on looking at it is not intoxicated, you can at least appreciate the finish when the crap flames up to the band of Floyd's beautiful pink re-working in "Attention to Ax, Eugene , "" Come to number 51, your time up.
