Fifteen years later and Paris are still burning. This is a classic of gay black films, right up there and other honorary black gay films, the Purple and Mahoganoy. This fundamental work captures underground and underclass (ie underserved) black and Latin gay cultures and communities like no other work before or since, including all sentiments of Harlem Rennaissance to gay and gorgeous ones. this is the best I say only the "real") movie you will find on the subject. Its relentlessly Cunty (the invention of the classic music music) comes to Hollywood, which does not stop, hilarious camps (like only we do it) and die-about social criticism All this is a female director (which obviously was to be a Sister Gurl or Mizz stuff in an ancient life.) I could go on but I think you get the point by now: I like this movie!
