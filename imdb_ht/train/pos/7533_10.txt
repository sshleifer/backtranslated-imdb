I liked this series when it was about Kids WB, I did not believe that a Batman turn on seeing as the original show ended in 1995 and this show came in 1997. First of all I liked the idea Robin left Batman to resolve the crime on his own. It was an interesting perspective in their relationships. I also liked the addition of Tim Drake in the series, and once again as his predecessor shows there were big story lines, big animations (best then the original), fantastic voice work and of course brilliant writing . The only thing that I did not like was that was when he was in the U.S. he would often run episodes in a 15 minute storyline. I just wish some of the episodes would be longer. My favorite episode of any cartoon Batman comes in this series, and it calls "Over the Edge", in my opinion as good if not the best then "heart of ice" and "Robin's rule. " Overall a wonderful follow up, and this Superman shows my childhood delighted.
