This film was open for poor provision in the first few weeks. Then Meena Kumari died and she just brought the crowd to the roll. Singing on all radio India, especially Inhi LogoN have often played that I was sick at them at the time, despite recognizing their beauty! <br /> Yes, it took all those years to do. This was because the wedding was one very happy with Kamal Amrohi also had difficulty getting the money to make the movie; Look at the rich sets and costumes, not surprising !! Not only Meena Kumari aged and sick, but listening carefully to Lata's voice. Inhi logoN has less than 50 voices while re-recorded songs like Chalo dildar chalo show clear development. I only want someone to get Ghulam Mohammad's songs that were not included in the movie, because of changing modes called for less if a little to sing and publish them. Lata in a recent interview (2007) rated Ghulam Mohammad as one of the best composers he ever worked with, apart from Madan Mohan (a great personal friend). Notice also that you hardly see the actors in all of the chalo dildar songs, very unusual. There is only one shot at Raj Kumar from the distance and you only see the back of the Meena Kumari. Kamal Amrohi made a virtue out of necessity and focus on the stars and the moon. Any other movie, this song would have been close-ups in both of them. As for this being the finest film ever, I would beg to different. This means you missed a lot of American movies, in no particular order, films like Barsaat (old), Devdas (older versions), Bandini, Bigha Zameen, Garam Hava, Dastak, Guddi, Aan , Pyasa, Kagaz, Phool, Sahib Bibi in Ghulam, Kabuliwallah, Abhimaan, Guides, Sujatha, Bombay Babu, Day, Parineeta (old), Umrao Jaan, etc. etc. But if you value music more than the list history Simply grow with beautiful notes from Barsat Ki Raat Naya Daur, Teesri Manzil, Mahal, Aag, Jugnu, Anand, Mera Naam Joker: The list is really endless! So enjoy Pakeezah, but do not miss out on any of the above ..
