Yokai Monsters: Spook War (Yokai daisenso, 2005) a movie about "yokai" or traditional "monsters" of tradition. It is alternately known as Big Monster War or as zombie on parade. <br /> <br /> The Yokai at the first installment includes freak of teapots, impatient impatient cats, a living brella, a woman whose text can grow very gigantic, a woman with a second face on the back himself, a dwarf priest and an enormous gourd-like wrist, and so on. These kinds of fantasy monsters denied not only from distressed feuds, but from a kind of summer entertainment in the Tokugawa era, comparable to Halloween today haunted houses, or the "freak shows" of passing hands and only fronts fronts. Zombies & Monsters Goldfish & Dancing Umbrella One headed have been trumped up to create the "warmth" summer warmth. The fatcheek woman & those are recreated by tricks or illusions, based on the monsters shown in medieval rolls; And if the design of the film is a bit simplistic and hoky, it makes them all the more representative of what is historically recreated for summer thrill .. These rather endearing monsters have to face & destroy an ancient Babylonian Warrior warrior came to Japan & disguised himself as a samurai master. Although some of the Japanese appearances are somewhat jumpy, and too many of the costumes are much more than masks without even moving their mouths as they speak, it is all played very poker-faced very good. He has some nice movies, as many should be given in a CGI movie in the same decade. Look at the right attitude or with the right friends, it is interesting, moving & touching. <br /> <br /> Yoshiyuki Kuroda also directs the Lone Wolf & Cub: White in Heaven & Hell (1974) & was the special FX director for Trilogy's excellent Daimajin. The Yokai Monsters series is not equal to Majin at its best, but Yokai are nevertheless great fun. The premier film is the most-oriented film in his family film, with the GOZU & IOOO consecutives more serious if not too serious for young viewers.
