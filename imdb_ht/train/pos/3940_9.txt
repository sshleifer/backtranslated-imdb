This film was not just one of John Ford's own personal favorites, but also counts director Sergei M. Eisenstein and Bertrand Tavernier among his high-profile admirers. Ironically, I just caught up with myself myself through the recent 2-Disc Criterion after missing out on a couple of original test languages ​​in it on Italian TVs many years ago and again a few times on TV while in Hollywood! <br /> <br /> The movie marks Ford's first nine collaboration with Henry Fonda and is also an example excellence in Ford's American folk veins. A very well-deserved piece of poetics at work, wage sequences (with eventual revelations) in the second half it still packs a box, without giving character character Donald Meek a memorable violent role as the lawyer prosecuted. <br /> Fonda is, of course, perfectly cast as an attorney, inexperienced, but solid and humanitarian who has been destined to become President; Fonda would go on to show other film affiliate politicians - most notably in the FAI-SAFE (1964) Franklin J. Schaffner (1964) and Sidney Lumet at FAIL-SAFE (1964) - and it is surprising to now learn that he was hesitant The moment about accepting Lincoln's role since, in his view, was "love to play God"! <br /> It is interesting to note here that Ford has already tackled Abraham Lincoln (tangentially) in the prisoner of SHARK ISLAND (1936), a superb great but perhaps little-known gem having, odds, just released as a Special DVD edition by the UK's true stand-alone Christian, the Eureka "Masters of Cinema" label. In addition, I also had two more Abraham Lincoln films in my DVD collection that were yet to look, and, incidentally, both were directed by DW Griffith - BETTER NATIONS (1915) and ABRAHAM LINCOLN (1930) - And, I'm not just getting a bunch of films I've never looked before just now, I would be happy to give them a turn based on my very satisfying experience and look at YOUNG MR. LINCOLN.
