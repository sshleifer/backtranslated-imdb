Before Cujo, there was a chance to be the devil dog. In 1978, on Halloween night movie "Devil Dog, Hound of Hell" premiered. A tale of a family will receive a new puppy (from a farmer who just came to the neighborhood to sell fruits and vegetables) because skippers dogs were killed.Cencidence? Everyone likes the new dog, but there is something weird about it. It's not long until dad Mike Barry (Richard Crenna, First Blood) begins to notice. Mrs. Betty (Yvette Mimieux, Boys' Location, Jackson County Jail, Snowbeast) and her children Charlie and Bonnie (Ike Eisenman, Witch Mountain and Fantastic Wonders with Kim Richards, Witch Mountain, Children and Teachers, Hello Larry, Tuff-Turf) has also changed. The dog has something to do with it? She was determined to find out and do whatever she took to save her family. <br /> <br /> This movie is great because it has Ike and Kim playing a dark side of their heads than we've seen on these witch mountains movies. This is one of the 70-year-made TV-TV movies that were actually scary for a movie-made movie-to-TV movie. The music has been crawling and even ending that I will not tell you to think. <br /> This movie also stars Ken Kercheval (Cliff Barnes of Dallas) and R.G. Armstrong (who could not stay away from devil movies remembers "Race with the Devil"?) <br /> It's worth watching.
