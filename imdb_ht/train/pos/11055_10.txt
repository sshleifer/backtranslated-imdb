Well, what I can say, other than those are super in every way. I'm fine like Sharon Mcreedy, I enjoy this best Nostalgic Series And I have the box set of 9 disks 30 episodes, I did not realize that they did a lot, I also think it's a great shame that they have not done any more. I wish that I received these powers, Imagine me, being hit in my sugar, somewhere and being knocked out cold, then waking up to a special hospital. And I discovered that my body had increased. Just like Richard Barrat. These stories are 50 minutes of pure action and suspense all the way, You can not fight these 3 people, as they would defeat you in all weapons. The music is well written, with me, putting a wonderful picture of 3 super beings in my mind, the sort of power that the champions have are the same as our domestic dog or cat, Improving eyes, improving hearing and touching . with the force of 10 people for Richard and Craig and the force of 3 women for Sharon. Who I thought was beautiful and intelligent. When I was a boy, I had a big break on it !!!! Now I can see why, on DVD I put. The box is very nice and it comes with a free booklet all over the series. I also thought Trymane was a good boss, firmly, but he got things done!
