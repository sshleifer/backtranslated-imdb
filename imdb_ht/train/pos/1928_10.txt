Some of the episodes I remember are one of the places where it takes the experimental drug that slows down action. Or one of the places it's the body of the big surfers, (I did that too!) Or one of the places where I had a cave in it and it meant how to use self-control there are those who blocked to slow down their breath They entered a trance-loving state. one shows that I wish I could see again. I got my wish with the original "Outstanding Limits" and "Sci-Fi Theater ... John
