This is a movie that was very well done. I've heard mixed reviews while it was in production and they were waiting for its release! Cheers director and all the actors. Throw in support gave Eva Mendez what he needed to take this to the top. As everyone else here states, the latter part of the movie is fixed. Katie Cassidy did an amazing job with his characters, and he was not doing a lot of work when this movie was done. She was very careful in front of her. I was amazed at her performance. I fully enjoyed the movie, questioning my value in life and priority, and I'm a better person for it! A great message lies in the movie. Release it for all to enjoy!
