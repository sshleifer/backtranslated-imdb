This is one of the best animated movies I've ever seen in my life. This is not just a fun movie, or a well-designed movie. This is a landmark in the art of animation and even though it was not, just the technical skill that came in to do it, would give it a place in the story of animation. <br /> <br /> Wladyslaw Starewicz created a movie motion stop on the secret life of beetles. He has imagined a coherent world of insects, and works, houses, boxes, movie houses, even tiny accessible as posters and bicycles and paintings. In this film he told a simple story of hypocrisy and revenge. Mr. Beetle has an affair with a dancing dragonfly, much of the grief of a grasshopper; but it is a cameraman and decides to shoot the throw. Mr Beetle returned home and found Mrs. Beetle has his own affair. Mr. Beetle chases the lover away, but he forgives his wife. The two make up and go out of the movies. And the movie to watch is Mr Beetle and the Dragonfly. Describing that it sounds bitter, but once sees it becoming a catchy job in movies. Together with Emile Cohl and Jury Trnka, Wladyslaw Starewicz is very much inventing everything that future animators would use in their work. That's why it should not be forgotten.
