Ernst Marischka, one of the most respected Australian directors at that time, has made full films in beautiful scenes, delicate love and related all the precious in life. <br /> <br /> Nowadays, if people should hear about it, they associate the name of Marischka and Sissi trilogy (1955,1956,1957). However, he performed other excellent films such as DREIMADERLHAUS (1958), EMBEZZLED SKY (1958) and definitely this one, MADE A EINER KONIGIN showing the youth of Queen Victoria. Although it deals with a slightly different theme than SISSI movie, I do not see much difference between this movie and SISSI. They hit the same. The movie is almost identical. The style, the music, the photography. In fact, the crew is almost the same. Anton Profes, Bruno Mondi! <br /> Throw ... Romy Schneider is one of the first major roles. It was a beautiful introduction to his role in Sissi since this film was made a year before the first part of the trilogy on the Australian empress. It is also a movie where Romy plays with her mother, Magda Schneider. But Ernst Marischka was not the first director who drove Romy to play with her mum. The first Romy, WHEN THE WHITE FLOWER RELATED BLUHN (1953) was his performance with his mother, too. Therefore, there was some voice that Romy started his Australian career on the basis of his mother's fame. Indeed, there are some truths in it. Again, as in SISSI, this movie shows dear slowly. Victoria meets Prince Albert at a little altar in Dover. The sympathy is based on most pure dance and smiles. And now ...? What would she have been like? Only sex ... But it's the only love-based thing? <br /> I'm grateful to Ernst Marischka for these movies. They had a soul and a message. Some people can call them kitschy, but I will never give these movie admirers. They are IMPRESSIVE !!! UNFORTUNATELY, HIGHLY UNDERRATED!
