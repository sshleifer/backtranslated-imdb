Famous for introducing the world to Hedy Lamarr and full of nudity before, but it's oh for more. In fact, this is one of the pinnacles of poetry cinemas, the up and some of the founding works of 1930 art cinema, in the same prestigious band as under the roofs of Paris, Tabu, Olympia, and even L'Atalante. It's almost a silence, relying mainly on its miraculous image, and also fantastic, symphony notes by Giuseppe Becce. He is a masterpiece of cinematography and music, yes, and also in correction, direction, writing, and acting. A good 90% of the movie moves together perfectly. Machat√Ω looks like an expert in using motifs. Maybe not as subtle as it could, and maybe a bit too much, but the appearances of objects such as insects, lights, and horses carry the story very well. The short snap of dialogue is, fortunately, unintrusive. They are not jar as much as one would imagine. The final bit is odd, to say the least. Reminiscent of Russian silence, we have a mounting of workers. This barely makes sense in the neck of the narrative, but it's so gorgeously done that I refute too much harp on that defect. Ecstasy is a film that desperately needs in reclamation. It is part of the best movies ever to do.
