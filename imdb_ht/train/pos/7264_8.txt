I have to agree with her Cal-37 in a big movie, especially for the family, Kelly Linch is beautiful, the little girl is really talented and beautiful, of course Jim Belushi has earned her band! But I really want to love this piano song, if you're a musician or you do not watch this movie just for that, you'll know who it is. <br /> <br /> "You're Not Nothing to Love You" Written by Russ Morgan, Larry Stock, and James Cavanaugh <br /> So have fun watching <br /> Al look at, <br /> Nelson
