I have read some awful things about this movie, so I was prepared for the worst. "Confusion While there may be merit in some of these charges, this movie was nowhere near as terrible as your average DVD programmer. The typical monster / slasher nonsense, and by God, some interesting things will be over. Barbeau is a miracle to see, and he is wearing the movie downright on his shoulder, which does not mean that he is a masterpiece. It's just too much (inexplicable) subplots trying to coexist. The empty scheme created by travel time is never really addressed: for example, if Hope knows that her mother is what Wrong and that he will ultimately kill his brother, then why not just kill Ma in the very first movie sequence? Seems like he would have to beat the hell from traveling in the future to do it. <br /> Still, I give UNHOLY points for trying. An ambition is not a bad thing.
