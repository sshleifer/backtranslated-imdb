This film has a lot of comedy, not black and Gordon Liu shines in this one. She shows her comic side and was really unusual to see her get beat. His training is "unorthodox" and who would have thought binding can be so dangerous ?? Many exhibitions and choreography. Very creative! <br /> Add Johnny Wang to the mix and you've got an awesome final showdown! Not messy and sick Manchu; they are without mercy!
