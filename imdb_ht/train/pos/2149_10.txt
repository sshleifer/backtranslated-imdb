All of the cast, from Sugiyama to Aoki and Toyoko, are people we know in everyday life. They were so natural, and Sugiyama's transformation is incredibly credible. The note is so moving and brought me to tears. The choreography was beautiful without similar athenics. Thanks to May's thanks and charm gave me goosebumps. Tamako is such a delightful character. You can almost see the candy schoolgirl in his face as he reminisces about seeing the "King and I". Aoki's characters are both hilarious and pitiful. Masako is so innocent as the disoriented wife, you almost want to hug her to reassure her that everything will be all right. <br /> This movie is really a keeper.
