Personally, I think Sayonara was the greatest movie he ever did. It touches all emotions from romance fiction to complete tragedy. And Brando should have the best actor. Anyway, the movie is awesome, the man is attractive for men and women and now you have no reason to miss it! Do this, and fall in love.
