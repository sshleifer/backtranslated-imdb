After seeing 'breaking a tree' in Vancouver at the party release I thought it was a very enjoyable movie. <br /> I had a few laughs outright outright and some of the cameos (Eric Roberts in particular) was a cry. I have not heard words about current release date although I've heard it closed. <br /> The story is simple but is mostly a machine for the characters and situations. The script is smooth and smooth, the draw develops effortlessly and the action is comfortable yet cool. This film won at least one award from ECHO in the movie designed to be in, which is around 10-15 or so. <br /> I highly recommend 'breaking a leg'.
