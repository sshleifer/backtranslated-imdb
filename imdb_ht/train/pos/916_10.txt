My Comment for VIVAH: - It's a good, idealistic love story begins Shahid Kapoor and Amrita Rao. The film takes you back to fun as the bride and family get married to sleep on the floor, play games together, friendly shelters and mutual respect. Vivah is about the welfare of marriage and the importance of engagement between two people. Yes, the central romance is virtually visualized. But sneaked-in romantic moments between the couple-to be-married and resilient to make themselves in modern toys to make you crave for the idealism. The advantageous film is concluded with the wedding and the groom, in the wedding night, telling her new bride who suffers from burning injuries: "Come let me do your dress" <br /> VIVAH - show a lot of Good thing - the beauty of wedding ranges, the beauty of American culture, the beauty of American women, last but not least a lovely IDEALISM in the over-the-wait couple getting married .... playing in the rules! Simple yet beautiful; Such a simple story .... there is no conspiracy ... no cruel - as is the case with most of Barjatya films. Mr. Slag is back to what he does best. He made the film with complete conviction. It is a very sweet film - which teaches the current generation a lot of good things to do. Arranged Marriage & Union of 2 Families. I think AMRITA RAO - looks very good and has acted very well. He has most of the good performances - although I thought the last half hour was completely Shahid Kapur - that for a change to give a awesomely cramped performance. I also love acting on behalf of others. The castle is Amrita Prakash, Alok Nath, Anupam Kher, Shahid's brother and six-in-law. It almost seemed as real and recognized as it could. Mr.Sharjag had another movie credit card family after Maine Pyar Kiya, HAHK & Hum Saath Saath Hain. The chemistry between Shahid & Amrita is AWESOME. Stuff Like Sanctity in a Marriage / Relationship, Avoid Couple, Mutual Respect, Care & Space, Waiting to Get Married "Officially", Praying / Sacrificing for Ur Welfare - All Things And More To Get SHOWCASED In Vivah. There are always some good audiences who will & enjoy this movie. Some of the folks / hearings are already excited after seeing, that they think bout Arranged-Marriage :) That Success If You Ask Me. It looks like AMRITA RAO - our actress-from-Vivah {results for a wonderful performance} that has given the prestigious DADSAHEB PHALKE Award for 2006 !! The hatchet for Chalo's achievement, though Vivah, Shahid or Amrita did not find any of the movie-fare and other awards; @ This is the latest news on CHEER !! Congrats to AMRITA RAO- to show us a visual of American bride-to-be in the shape of Barjatya and Bargaina Barrage to show it the best way :) Shudn't forget Shahid Kapur and others who make VIVAH as sweet and legend as it is today !! Imagine, sharing the same pedestal as the legendary Dilip Kumar .......... It does not mean success !! Congrats for Amrita Rao - to take his career to another level with this award .... I personally feel - he should keep doing movies only with Shahid Kapur !! They make a cute couple and chemistry on the screen remind me of {SRK-Kajol} or {Aamir Khan & Juhi Chawla} ................. <br /> <br /> There are some points that I observe, some of the components: - # 1 If u notice carefully, Amrita Rao looks good as always ches still wear traditional dresses. She gives every bit of American woman's sense - in this movie !! Perfect Fit # 2 Shahid Kapur is like most of us - not exactly ready for weddings or early weddings .... but PREM listens carefully to the step-by-step speech given in his DAD - with full faith of Anupam Kher. Eventually "Honesty" & "Trust" is the key word that he reflects in his first conversation with Amrita. Most people would think of a first meeting with a total stranger more for a limited time never enough to judge someone. But according to what I saw in this film, I have a feeling - that two people who have done for each other can be connected to a first encounter too, it's possible !!! # 3 In the entire movie - there are basically 4 or 5 sequences where Shahid & Amrita are together - or show to be together. Unlike most other romantic / wedding-based movies where Hero & Heroine are always singing / dancing or nowadays - doing cheap things. But the beauty of each of the 5 sequences: - Characterized by compassion, innocence and respect for the other! # 4 I really like the relationships shown between Chacha ALOK NATH & Amrita Rao. These films should emphasize the indifference shown by daughter / girl-children in some parts of India. # 5 romantic scenes between lead puppets are shooting very nicely - no cheap scenes, singing pretty good photos !! Words like "jal", "praarthana" e.t.c. they will do buzzwords for any girl who liked this movie :) Personally, I'm really romantic in many dialogues in this movie. # 6 Last but not least - The Hospital scene where Shahid puts "isthoor" in Amrita when shots life difficult - is terrific. Those dialogues between the couple are so touched and U feel the LOVE / I-kant-do-without-u; It's a dog-off feeling !!! <br /> <br /> *** In many ways, VIVAH reminded me of Maiya Pyar Kiya, DDLJ, Qayamat Sa Qayamat Tak, Hum Dil of Chic Sanam - for freshness / on screen screens in the LEAD pair:) :) *** IF AND MY ME: - Together with films like Rank De Basanti, Release Raho Munnabhai, DOR, CORPORATE and Kabul Express, VIV Hang among the Best Films Made in 2006. IN FACT - I Think Vivah deserve better look / business than Dhoom2 or Fanaa or Golmaal or everyone-time / soft / style / movie movies!
