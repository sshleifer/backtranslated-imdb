I think I really love this movie. The "Prix de Beaute" was originally a silent film but later the French armed in 1930. Despite having someone else's voice armed, it remains a stunning journey of strength for Louis Brooks. The fact that his singing voice is armed by Edith Piaf's legend helps our mollify purist on the dubbing deception. <br /> <br /> This is the story of Lulu and we first saw him in a resort with his macho companions, Andrew (Georges Charlia) and their friends Antonin (Augusto Bandini). Lulu enters the frame as a pair of feet: we see it inside the car changing in her bathing suits. Lulu is very free and shows her body and this does not sit well with Andrew's irk. When Lulu considered applying for the title of 'Miss Europe' we know that a happy ending will not be located at the Easy Street end. <br /> <br /> The movie seems to focus very much on men's beautiful women. We see a lot of nice bathing and the reactions of the guys staring at them. But in the center of it all is the beautiful Louise Brooks. <br /> <br /> If you do not mind watching movie from the vintage eras, then consider checking out this one. Louise Brooks is not a name that most medium movie makers can easily know but as soon as you see it you will be mesmerized and you'll want to know more. Also check it in the 'Pandora Box' if you can find it. <br /> <br /> Be cautious at the US Cinema DVD release. I do not know if projection speeds are correct. A lot of scenes appear to be showing too fast a speed. This could have been shot. I do not know. But since it's the only way to see this movie, it's worth swallowing that one small bitter tablet.
