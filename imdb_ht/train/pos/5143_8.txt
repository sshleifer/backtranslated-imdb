With rapid interaction in the mad scene of an asylum, and mounting / superimposing of images, with waves, narratives mentioned, this is a very difficult movie to follow. Apparently a man (Masu Inoue) took a job as a porter or janitor in an asylum to be near his wife in prison, and maybe he was saved. But it is clearly crazy, huddled on the floor, and a lot of empty expression of the time and fear, misery, and confusion write about his face the rest of the time. The film maker changes his point of view sometimes, and we see the wave image of it in the side of a pond drowning a baby, or clutching a child drowned. She suffers something. When the original viewpoint or other kind of crap, the movie uses distorted lens and things, showing us who is crazy to see and then how to react. And the place is floating and crazy, laughing, hidden, and in one can dance frenetically night and day. At one point the man tries to take his wife out, but the night outside the monster door and runs back to his cell. Slowly the man slipped into a nightmare in which he cut into another attempt to steal him away, and he killed the doctor and many people responsible, and while laughing at anger and applauding. When he wakes up he's relieved, with the floor cops. There are some fascinating shots in Japan's life, streets, buildings in the 1920s.
