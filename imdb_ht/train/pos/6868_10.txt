I saw this in Detroit in what had to be its original run. I literally roll in to the theater. It was funny. I have not seen it since, but would like. Where do you get a copy? Anyone saying anything about it being dating or exceeding them, for my money, just a bunch of poseur. Each skit is either cruel, erotic or perversely hilarious. Each tablet! No one is weak yet included. The opening sequence, for example, that parody 2001, features gorilla go-go-dancer and puppies breastfeeding. Felinni would have filmed the villainy ... If you come to this movie with an open mind and a sneaky heart, you will be his pencil right in your very best list.
