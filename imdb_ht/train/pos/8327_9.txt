This was a great romantic comedy! Historically incorrect (Einstein had no noises or nephews as noted elsewhere in IMDb), but he did a great matchmaker. It brought together two very beautiful people played by two of the best working actors. Throw in support (Lou Jacobi, Joseph Maher, Gene Saks, Stephen Fry, etc.) all click on screen and make this a great look experience. The fact he was driving a car get around looks like contradicting all the images and posters of him riding a bike to get around. And he puts socks on one scene ... reported, the teacher has never put socks! (Two new entries for the IMDb Goofs section.) Historical organs and inconsistencies aside, this was a great movie to watch with a great cast. I give it a 8!
