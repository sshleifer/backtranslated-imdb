Girlfight is using a well-known formula as someone pointed out, however, I've seen many movies that do not make this good or not credible. I believe it is the easiest end for a woman to empathize the character and this way feel touched by the movie. The movie also encourages both mentally and physically even if your life and environment are completely different and I think the viewer can still win a lot of this. although it took me 5 years to start boxing and sports in general, this is the movie that gave me the spark. <br /> <br /> so the draw is familiar / common. actors are good. but thinking that it can induce them is what makes it higher than average in my opinion. He made a great impression on me and I know I'm not the only one.
