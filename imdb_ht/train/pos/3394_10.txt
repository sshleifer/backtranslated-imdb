I watched this movie sort by accident, she bought it as the side B on the Omega Man DVD. The Omega Man was a bit of a disappointment - except for the start, which was clearly the inspiration for 28 Days later, the rest of it is just the thing in TV movies. But Soylent Green is in a whole other league. I bet this is one of the favorites Tarantino. There are at least 3 scenes in the movie that I have never seen anything like before. Heston relaxed in bed with the "furniture" while discussing something completely related! A whole crowd of people was scoped up by a fleet of mechanical shovels! A priest confessed and was shot by the confessor. Ok maybe this has been done since - but there are not many films that are so still original as this. And what the heck will be between Heston and Edward G. Robinson? Is this the most easy gay couple ever, or what? Luckily, I saw this movie without knowing the finish - which apparently is rare. Then I looked at her again, she enjoyed all the little clues that made the scenes happily ever refreshing. A very nice script - with some great sets too. Just when you thought you would see everything. . .
