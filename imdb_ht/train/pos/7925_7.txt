Funny movie is really, really funny. Yes, it had its dead moments, it may be a bit too obvious, it refuses somewhat in the second half and the story is a incoherent mess, but it laughs loudly funny all the way. And it's worth seeing just for Ed McMahon as a right wing kook. This movie is in the same class as Elvira, Mistress of the Darkness, another extremely funny movie, films incompetence.
