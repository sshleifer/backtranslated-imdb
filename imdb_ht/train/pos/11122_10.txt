When we started watching this series on cable, I had no idea how addictive it would be. Even if you hate a character, you hold back because they are very well developed, you can almost understand why they react in frustration, fear, greed or temptation to their way. It's almost as if the viewer is experiencing one of Christopher's learning curves. <br /> I can not understand why Adriana would put up with Christopher's abuse of it, verbally, physically and emotionally, but I just needed to read the newspaper to see how many women can and tolerate such behaviors. Carmella has a dream home, endless supply of expensive things, but I'm sure she would give it to a loving and loyal husband - or perhaps not. That's why I watch. <br /> It does not matter how often you watch an episode, you can find something you miss the first five times. We even watch episodes from sequences (see episode 1 at the end of the month with ads but all the language, A & E and censored languages, reruns on the Movie Network) - every time they are on, we are there. We were totally spoiled right now. <br /> I love the Malaprop. "An albacore around my neck" is my favorite of Johnny Boy. When these jewelry came into our family vocabulary, it's a sign that I should get a life. I'll be when the series ends, and I've picked up the DVD and put the collection on my will.
