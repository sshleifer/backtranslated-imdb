This has been animated and always is animated. Hardly dorky movie kids as they have noticed, I always came back to this 10 years after I first saw it. One of the best movies released. <br /> <br /> The animation while not perfect is good, camera tricks give it a 3D feel and the story is still as good today even after I grew up and saw caches like Neon Genesis Evangelion and RahXephon. He had nowhere near the depth obviously, but tried to see it from a lighthearted view. It's a story to entertain, not in question. <br /> Always one of my favorites I'm also back when I feel like a gay about more hellhearted animated. By telling a movie theater, there are amazing moments in this and you need a sense of humor to see it all.
