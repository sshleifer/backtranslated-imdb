I congratulate photos that try something different. Many films just seem like re-treads of old ideas, so that's my big reason I recommend Pimlico Passport. The movie is set just after WW2 and the lack of post-war and rationing seems to be driving Londoners "barmy". The center film on a small block in London called Pimlico. They, too, are sick of being unable to buy what they want but they can not see any way out of it. That is until they accidentally stumble on a hidden treasure and a charter that officially called this neighborhood as a sovereign nation hundreds hundred years ago! With this document, they are right, they can bypass all the rationing and coupons and live lives as they wish, since it turns out they are really NOT British subjects! Where the movie goes from there and how the crisis is finally solved is something you'll need to see for yourself. Let the brilliant spirits of Ealing Studios come with this gem!
