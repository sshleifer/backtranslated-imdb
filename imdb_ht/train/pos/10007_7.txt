LI NIGHT LISTENER (2006) ** 1/2 Robin Williams, Toni Collette, Bobby Cannavale, Rory Culkin, Joe Morton, Sandra Oh, John Cullum, Lisa Emery, Becky Ann Baker. (You: Patrick Stettner) <br /> <br /> Suspect Hitchcockian gives Williams a stand-up low-performance performance. <br /> <br /> What is it about celebrities and fans? What is the paranoia near one associated with the other and why is it almost the norm? <br /> <br /> In the latest fanage scenario fanatic, based on true events not less, Williams stars as a talk-radio personality called Gabriel No one, which reads stories he pervades the airwaves has accumulated an interesting fan in the form of a young boy named Pete Logand (Culkin) who has submitted a manuscript about the travails of his troubled youth No editor No one Ashe (Morton) who gives it to No who read for himself. It is not a person who naturally distracted but ultimately intrigued the existence of the nightmare of Pete being kidnapped and sexually abused for years until he was ultimately saved by a nurse named Donna (Collette awarded an excellent performance) that adopted boy but correspondence she and no one reveal that Pete is dying in AIDS. Of course no one wants to meet the fans, but suddenly in doubt the motive eventually devious their treachery when seed is planted by his lover Jess lover (Cannavale) whose sudden departure from New York City apartment does not have no one in an emotional tailspin has only now grown into a storm in a tumor when he decided to make some investigations into Donna and Pete's background discovering some truths that he did not anticipate. <br /> <br /> Written by Armistead Maupin (who co-wrote the scenario with his former lover Terry Anderson and Stettner's film novel director) and based on a true story about a fan's fake found out there some Hitchcockian moments that run on full tilt like any good old fashioned bucket-made booth. It helps Williams to give a stand-out, low-key performance as the good-hearted personality conflict that really wants to believe that his only fan's number in real reality and his love (one thing that has escaped his own reality) and it has some disturbing moments and the creepy column with one physical feature I will leave unmentioned, but underlines the despair of his character that can rattle you into the core. <br /> However the film runs out of fuel and eventually becomes a bit repetitive and predictable despite a finely chopped piece of hoodwink and mystery by Stettner, she pays your own voice list inside: be careful of what you are hoping for.
