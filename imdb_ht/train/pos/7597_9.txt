Objects keep something interesting for everyone. You can say a lot of expansive on this series, and a lot awfully said, so I will not be the one to spell it all out for you again. Just read someone who liked it, and you'll know why you want to watch it. The nice thing about this series is that its totally new. There are not many movies - and even less - series based on the theme of only suspense, but Objects live up to the theme with pride. It's all about the unexplained and if you combine that with an exotic location, twisting beautiful drawings, an excellent cast and a good format (present and past combined in single episodes) you will have a series of which every episode is a story about it they are clean but part of an older one. You want to have all the insights into the characters, you want to see the picture in general, and you'll want to know where the writers will take you. The result is that a series does not let you go. On a more skeptical note, the series went under a bit of season 2, probably due to its own success. It is well known that Lost was only written for an original season and when the overwhelming success followed, the writers were submerged too. In my opinion they made the mistake to add even more mysteries and at a higher speed in season 2, then they resolved them (or partially at least) those in season 1. At the end of season 2 you ended up with a great secret drift, twisting draw and unexplained phenomenon, but only a great viewer can take. The difference between season 2 and 3 however was great. Season 3 drops out a lot of insights, partially replacing them with new questions. And it's exactly how they should be written; Do you want to fall from one twist to the next draw, do not get a secret tsunami spread over you and then pick up a few explaining to their viewers. They got that in season 3 and brings us a promising future for epic 4. It's good to see that a different format in a set, they can be so hugely popular.
