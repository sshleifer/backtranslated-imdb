Thanks would be to Hong Kong VCD / DVD distributors that I only pay US $ 1.4 and I might have such a fun delightful enjoyment. <br /> <br /> Adult? How common in our modern day. Eva grabbed her two children and kidnapped Nick chase Luis and Charlotte in Italy. He wants his revenge but at the end, he also commits the same crime in Luis: he has sex with Nick. In this small independent production, Vivian Naefe faced with the teething issues of modern marriage and a light heart. How can anyone be able to treat marriage seriously in this fast-paced foodstuff where people are now in higher mobility in the physical, mental and tech areas? Engagement commitments require too high a price that most people choose to circumvent circumstances. Nick once trusted Charlotte but she dropped to Eva after that kidnapped trip forced her to experience numerous growth. <br /> <br /> Most viewers can feel happy about the finish because Eva and Nick come together, well, this would be the greatest settlement of the unreliable act of their spouses. However, I want an end, I want to see how the cards would develop after this exchange. Maybe they can change back, how one can be sure about the unhappy relationship. <br /> <br /> Good acting with good scenery. The little children-actors should not neglect especially the boy when he cries at the reception at the hotel in Venezia. And of course, how can we forget "Bella, bella" the scenery of the city.
