The Haunted World of Edward D. Wood, Jr. is not a particularly good documentary. Aesthetically, it's mediocre and cheap looking, the people in it go on tangent that makes it very unfocused and in itself, but that adds to his charms. I say this because it's a documentary about an oddball that has taken oddball pictures and surrounds itself with fellow oddballs and, as such, there's really no other way to document the life and career of the man and his crew in misfits. Some tips of insight into both the genius and inconvenience of wood, and the portrait of both types is a credit requirement of the documentary. In general, it's worth a watch for wooden fans and those of the general cinema, but do not expect to shine here. Expect a documentary made after Wood's own heart.
