IVAN (Marco Ricca) and GILBERTO (Alexandre Borges) are partners in a company with ESTEVÃO (George Freire), but the first contract of a professional assassin, ANISIO, to kill ESTEVÃO (the draw, at least at the beginning, explains very well why). The guy made it and after receiving his money he started blackmailing the partners, appearing in the companies and saying he wants a job (as supervisor or something ??). At the same time she meets MARINA (Mariana Ximenes), daughter ESTEVÃO, and starts dating with her! <br /> In a story like this, where crime, corruption, betrayal and blackmail go hand in hand, no one innocents or victims, exceptions made to MARINA, who are the only ones who do not know what happens on it and did not betray anyone ?? <br /> This film shows and sarcasm the sad and wicked reality that exists in major metropolis like São Paulo, where crime is daily presence. We can feel irony but also the veracity of characters like ANISIO (brilliantly played by Paulo Miklos), which makes blackmail the guys who paid him without any scruples, and even flirting with the girl the guy he killed! It really must be a monster to do something like that, but of course I know people like him out there, in Brazil or anywhere else ?? <br /> It's a very good, bad, but truthful movie, on a sad reality ?? Acting is great with the soundtrack too.
