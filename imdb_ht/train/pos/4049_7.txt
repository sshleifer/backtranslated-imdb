Erich Rohmer of "The English and the German" make a perfect companion piece for Peter Watkins "La Commune (Paris 1871)." Both film-screened at Toronto Film Festival this year-ironically illustrates how stories are shaped by the Tellers in the story. Ironic, given the tragic events that took place in the US during the festival. <br /> Set in Paris during the French Revolution, the film, based on Grace Elliott's (Lucy Russell) "Memoirs," is a first but unpleasant encounter of how he survived these days, but dangerous. She also details her relationship with Duke Orleans (played by Jean-Claude Dreyfus), who, unlike herself, is a supporter of the Revolution. <br /> <br /> True form, you do not know whose side of Rohmer's story is going down. One of the earliest French "New Wave" filmmakers, Rohmer was often criticized for being too conservative. After all, in the midst of the rebellious youth-Viet-Nam days in the late 60s and 70s, it was filming romantic little cohorts like "Claire's knee." But do not sell the old boy short, as it was always a student of human nature, not an ideologist, and "L'Anglaise et le duc" continued to carry this out. Rohmer's character is not the "bad guys" nor the "good guys", they are the first and the first human to show a full range of human potential - and limitations. That's why its movies are still provocative, and this movie is no exception .. Now for the technological nuts and bolts. <br /> <br /> Rohmer, though making his way through his 80s, is still on the cutting edge of the cinematic innovation look at "L'Anglaise" is such a thing you've never seen before. You guessed it, guy The old - like several of the festival's director this year - goes digital. <br /> All of the exterior stage scenes look as if they are taking place in their original 1780s Parisian setting. As a matter of fact, you can get so distracted from the foreclosure of the authenticity of watching the movie you are going to come back for a second screening to catch the psychological subtle film - and yes, I'll say it - political policy. as well as some of the oldest in the world. And the old masters are standing on the off-edge movies right along with the youth. <br /> <br /> Long live teens. Long lives old. And long live Erich Rohmer. <br /> <br />
