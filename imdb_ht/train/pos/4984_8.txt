"The Secret of the Lens" is perhaps a pleasant one ever my favorite. The best and funniest from Kajawari Yoshiaki, who is known for anime splatter and hentai-echchi anime puppies. I wish he had more campiness like this. <br /> <br /> My favorite scene is the sequel of CG psychedelic, part where Lord Helumis shakes up his failing henchmen, the party riots that Bill causes (one of the funniest scenes) and each time their favorite characters me, Worsle appears. <br /> <br /> Check out this. <br /> <br /> WARNING: This is not for fans of sophisticated Anime fans!
