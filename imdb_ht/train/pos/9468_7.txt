I saw a special screening today. I must let you know, I'm not a big fan of either Dane Cook or Steve Carell, so I really did not have any expectations going to this. I enjoyed it quite a bit. <br /> In real life is the story of a widow with 3 daughters who go to spend a weekend with her family. While in a bookstore, she meets the woman in her dreams, only to find out that she's going to be his girlfriend's girlfriend. <br /> <br /> This movie is very well done - the band, cinematography, and acting all-top notch, especially Steve Carell. My problem and it was mostly that there seemed to be a lack of character development, especially with Dane Cook's character. We never really got a close look at the relationship between Dane and Steve's character, and I felt that he could have helped a bit to show what the controversy inside the Dan was about to love with Dane's girlfriend like. Other than that though, Dan in Real Life is definitely a solid, sweet film-definitely a nice break from all the movies and movies we've been getting this year.
