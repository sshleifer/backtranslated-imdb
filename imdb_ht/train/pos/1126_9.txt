My interest has risen as I was flipping through and saw the name Iphigenia. My name is Eugenia so I thought OK, lets see what this is. I'm so happy I stayed on the canal. What a wonderful, wonderful story. Drama, sadness, some over the head but a wonderful time to be. I watch this and it makes me sad for all the drivel film industry wear out and these cute little gems get past. Give Iphigenia a try and hope you will enjoy it as much as I did. I even became my kids (27, 25, 20, and 17) to enjoy it. It begins to slow down, however, the drama builds and you will draw in the story. Watching this beautiful movie made me want to cover myself in more Greek and pathetic tragedies.
