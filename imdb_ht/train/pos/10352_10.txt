Religious mobs are rampant everywhere. Australia is not immunity to it. A dingo snatched a baby and the mother tried and sent to prison because she "killed" her baby. I do not mean to spoil the story for you, but you need to know the basics before finding the knee-deep of what caused this woman to find herself inside a prison. <br /> <br /> Buy or rent the movie and discover how deeply hated people who are different will continue to thrive in the world. Meryl Streep (and his famous Aussie accent) and Sam Neill, whose accent is his native pronunciation, are exceptional. People who support their role are also good. <br /> You will remember this movie for many years.
