What a delightful noise ?? a very completely filmed movie that has many charms and a feature that a lot of romantic comedy misses. Einstein is brilliantly acting by Walter Matthau, while Catherine Meg Ryan is unforgettable ?? better than I saw him in these opposing films Tom Hanks ?? as young mathematicians who have difficulty to be recognized. <br /> <br /> You do not need a young woman to understand Catherine's struggle and feel sympathetic to her immediately, and as a young man it's easy to understand what to go to head Ed (Tim Robbins) the idea of ​​running behind his true love. There are universal appeals to these emotions, though I.Q. keep it all light, fun and tidy nicely. <br /> Make sure it's not heavy, but if you look at some subtexts. People remember Albert Einstein as a scientist yet he was a great spiritual; His words like something on the lines of, 'If it's not impossible, then why do it?' suggests that he is a believer in completing higher goals beyond an immediate threat. In this movie, there are questions about what a crash really is ?? like whether Albert and whicky interview interviews him in pratters Catherine away from stiff-upper-lip, loveless James (Stephen Fry ?? that gives this character to other characters and you can not help but feel for lack of feelings) count . How many interventions happens in our lives that we do not see, and come across as serendipitous? <br /> And of course, we would like to think in real life, although we often observe the people we know, that our Edwards get the Catherines and James have to learn how to depress icewater into the veins. How nice to know that it might work out innocent I.Q's innocence (and disturbing, only White) Eisenhower-era of the country makes-believe.
