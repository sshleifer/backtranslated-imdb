This is an old fashioned movie, the wonderful child's fun and surely the most callous sly to everlasting. Unlike many modern stories that seem to swing in dark magic, this is simply a magic story of pocus hocus that is beautiful, light, light and spacious. The story is set back in 1940 in the English village of pepper eye, where three children of Coyotes, Charlie, Carrie, & Paul Rollins, were evicted from danger from attacks when World War II city. They are mistakenly sent to live with Eglantine Price, who is studying through correspondence courses to become a witch apprentice. Eglantine and Trio in children use a magic bed button in order to travel to London on their flying beds. Here they meet Emilius Browne, director of the false professional mayor of the Mississippi. Miss Price sets out to work on spells designed to bring unethical objects into life. Meanwhile, they must deal with a shady character called Bookman and his associate, Swinburne. Angela Lansbury is wonderfully surprised as the unique witch of training, Miss Price. David Tomlinson plays Mr. Browne, principal magistrate defenkt, who has now turned magic street. This actor has already been cast as the children's father in the movie Mari Poppins. In fact, this film is a well-marked reminder of the earliest Mari Poppins, both wonderful fantasy stories for children. Perhaps this film does not have quite such memorable music as Chim-Chim-Cheree, but it boasts some little tune appeals. Some have been critical, but the film features excellent special effects. All in all, the story is enchanting family entertainment. It's a pity if modern kids are too sophisticated for this beautiful story & hustle, which should appeal to the child of all of us.
