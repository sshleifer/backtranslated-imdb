This movie feels like a movie project. As if the filmmakers have chosen out a cross section of society with no experience and got to work. Characters are kind of uninvolved and naive though. Despite this amateur entertainment, the film is effective. It's like a cross section of life and neighborhood kids trying to realize or nurture their honesty feelings. They have been raised by a grand-parent, of course, from this generation there is shame associated with sexuality. This provides for some predictable conflicts, but well done. Probably more enjoyable was the way the main character grew slightly in her romantic relationship to achieve a greater depth of sexual feelings. A good look but nothing vibrant.
