A lonely depressed French boy Mathieu (Jeremie Elkaim) on vacation in the summer, satisfied with falling in love with Cedric (the gorgeous Stephane Rideau). Quiet and slow this is a very frustrating movie. On one hand, I was absorbed and really felt for the two boys. In the other I've been annoyed - the movie is still keeping glamor around from the present time with no rhyme or purpose. It's very confusing and pointless. <br /> <br /> Also there are tons of draw pin - Mathieu, at one point, doing something that ends him in the hospital. What it is - we have never said! Then she broke up with Cedric and told everyone else she was living with her. Why? We do not say. Then he hooks enexplicably with another guy at the end. Why? No explanation. It is clear Cedric loves Mathieu and Mathieu living in the same city so ... However it is a tribute to the movie that you really care about the many characters. If only things have been explained! <br /> <br /> Elkaim as Mathieu is not good. It is tall, beautiful and has a beautiful body - but it can not act. His idea of ​​acting sitting with an empty look on his face - all the time. Rideau, on the other hand, is great. She is very beautiful, has a very beautiful body and is one hell of an actor. Also it has a magnetic incredible magnetic effect on it. There are full nudity men before, lots of kisses and a clear sex scene in the movie which is great - most cinematic shy away from male-male sex scenes. This one does not and it helps to see how the characters care and feel for each other. <br /> So a movie is frustrated but somewhat worth seeing - especially for Rideau's nude scenes - that is, if you love good-looking young men!
