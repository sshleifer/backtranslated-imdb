An excellent film that describes the crosses of life in a multi-ethnic mix by the ordinary people in the rural Pacific Northwest. Solid direct and written along with good action, especially performance by Kwami Taha and Dan Stowe. Interestingly, this film was made in the same year as the "Accident" success, written and directed by Paul Haggis. The speed of the action may not be as frantic as in urban Los Angeles, and the characters may seem to be best known to each other in "Apart from that," but the personal relationships of the characters are as flawed and troubled history as resonant as any of those in "accident." For those viewers who appreciate "crash" this is a must see movie. Also, fans Jim Jarmusch and John Cassavetes will love this movie.
