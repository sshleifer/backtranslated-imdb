Well, I'm from Bulgaria where it's almost impossible to have a tornadoes but my imagination tells me to be "very, very scary" !!! This guy (Devon Sawa) did a great job with this movie! did not know exactly how old he was, but he did not act like a child (WELL DONE)! Now, on the tornado - it was not very realistic but angry! If you want to have a nice time in front of the telly - this is the movie!
