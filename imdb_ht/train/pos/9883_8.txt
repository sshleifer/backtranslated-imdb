It runs 8 seasons, but it's the first, at the beginning of 1959, and it's the last, in the autumn of 1965, being shorter than 2-7 season. CBS chief William Paley canceled Rawhide's production after watching the first show in season 8, in September 1965, because he was the ninth series without Eric Fleming as Gil Favor, who was part after Seven 7. The latest episode of the new revealed in November, 1965. Lone 1966 CBS Broadcast, January 4, 1966, was a radius. I have often wondered why Rawhide had not changed to filming for her in the last season? Most of the great Westerns of the 1960s have gone on color by 1965. CBS has been broadcasting in autumn colors, for many of the sitcom but westerns like Gunsmoke and Rawhide live in black and white. Gunsmoke was the last western (and the last-first set of network set-ups) on September 17, 1966, for the Snap episodes.
