If you went to this movie to see some great presentation award awards ... oh well .. but if you wanted to see a comfy delightful adaptation of an old classic, you'll love it..Jim Carey was incredible as dabitid. The storyline was great, a few parts added as the story of Grinch made it even better. Ron Howard never misses a beat .. But although there were a few ADULT comments and clevering added, this is supped to be a child or show the family. Try not to lose sight of that .. if you do what you really do not enjoy the movie ... and as commentary on Ron Howard, try to direct a great motion picture to see how you do .. not easy as it looks. ..
