Honestly, when I saw this film years ago I immediately wanted to turn it off. As I sat there for the next 10 minutes or so, I realized that the actor played Navin stole the show. His facial expression and comedian attitude led me to shake myself as to why he was not in more comedies. He has this "Marty Feldman" thing going for him but much, many talents ... take away from Marty. The movie really shocked me by how close it was to the original Jerk, but then again, it was SO much more. I really think if this movie was first released, and I saw Steve Martin the 2nd film, I'd think the 2nd was a good rip-off. I know it sounds like a BOLD statement, but it's true. I actually love Steve Martin a great deal, but his performance is the 2nd actor of Jerk too. I wish I could get a copy of it for my collection. I encourage you to see it if you can find it.
