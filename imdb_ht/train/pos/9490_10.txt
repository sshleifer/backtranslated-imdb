The first time I saw this movie was in the eighties, but now review this thriller is still current. Some new movies focus on similar topics, but they do not match this important French step. A president - obviously JF Kennedy - is shooting at an open car during a public appearance. The resulting incident big found "Lee Harvey Oswald" The figure in this film is guilty, but one member of the jury insists in further investigation. It reveals some surprising evidence ... Like the Oliver Stone JFK - a movie with the same plot - this one does not play with emotions, but focuses in an interesting description of a plot and how everything fits together, drawing a new photo of the murder. Even a real psychological experience is used for the explanation of the crime scene. Compared with JFK this movie is much more reasonable, intelligent and thrilling. The part of the scheme can be found in a lot of newer films, I've had a kind of already outfit sitting at the movie. <br /> <br /> "I ... like Icare" is a "must see". Its unparalleled and brilliant, and the music by Ennio Morricone is wonderful. This movie deserves a very good ranking, if it was a Hollywood production it would be more popular for sure. <br /> <br />
