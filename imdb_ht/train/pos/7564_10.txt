In my line of work, I occasionally get contacted by independent creators who are trying to publish their films. When I can, I take a look at these low-budget movies and often make me think that the future of Hollywood is going to be the dogs. Once in a while, though, there is a film made of pure passion and desire, as if created for the purpose of reminiscent of the movie industry that good movies are still possible. Broken movie BROKEN, directed by Alex Ferrari, is a genuine surprise and worth a second look. <br /> <br /> The review within a 20 minute minute, BROKEN tries to say a compelling (but surreal) story and almost no back story. The hearing is plopped down in the middle of the action that has no indication of what's happening. A young woman (Samantha Jane Polay) rose from a dream to hear a bullet and prevented her kidnapping from her home. When it comes up, it is surrounded by a group of mercenary thugs who seem to be at home in a comic book. These nasty men and girls are bigger than life. They are all weapons and knives. There is no way out. <br /> <br /> The Kicker here is that, despite being a low budget movie she does not play as one. From the very beginning, the feeling is that B R & D is shot, edited, and produced by professionals. It seems that something Quentin Tarantino might do in his days when he was blocked with the Wachowski brothers. The film is sharp and cool, it looks good and it feels like something big. Acting better than I usually see in the smaller films. Polay and Paul Gordon (who plays the top killer, Duncan) were well-chosen. As two of the roles speak some of the movie, it is up to bring the movie. No special effects, no matter how good, would have saved this movie from bad acting. Fortunately, Polay manages to convey true truths and Gordon manages to come as a real psychic. Some of the most limited roles seem to be completed by younger talent, but it hardly shows. <br /> <br /> The downside of the B & R is that it's only 20 minutes long. The story ends with a twilight twilight area that looks a bit offensive and is hardly subtle. Looking at her, I felt I was supposed to have some epiphany, but there was only one feeling that she was much more than I expected. The film tries hard to be one of those puzzles that leaves audience talking for hours in the local coffee shop, but it comes as satisfactory. I keep thinking that this is the first 20 minutes of a longer film. <br /> <br /> RATING ME: 8 out of 10.
