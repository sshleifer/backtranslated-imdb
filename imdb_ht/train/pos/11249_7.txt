I just watched all the 6 episodes on DVD. Acting at all is excellent - there is no question. There was not enough action for me to say. There is no real suspension as such, just a lot of first-class character development. There is nothing like Tailor Tailor in terms of "whodunnit". If you love a good story slowly carefully said then this is for you. Peter Egan as Magnus Pym's lead is excellent. The film describes the life of a treacherous. A man who would be a loyal member of the British Intelligence Service but who was so damaged psychologically by children pleased that disappointment had become his way into life in all of this. As a child she worshiped her father but her father had been exposed to time & times again as a thief and a con man. Pym betrays not for ideology or money but because he needs to deceive the closest person (wife, son, counselor). Pym is tired of damage to his father's influence - he ate his moral fiber away. He has no real love or loyalty to him. <br /> <br /> Heavy psychological stuff and not much light moments in the 6-hour range. Very well done though.
