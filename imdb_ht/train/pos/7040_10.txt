This film was excellent for the following reasons: 1) It was great exquisite and sleek. 2) He showed the difference in a war-torn environment with a techno. 3) The act of Jan Cusack was terrific. He showed great anger. 4) He showed the vulnerabilities of everyone in a war-torn situation. 5) He gave us a picture of what can happen in the future in much respect. I was also impressed and acting for the most part. Hilary's act was, I found, the most stilted. Morals and values ​​are all in a war-torn situation up to tram. The liberal journalist and the conservative business man can do anything in any situation with them as unpredictable. Great things. PSP
