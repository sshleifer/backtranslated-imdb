I really liked this movie I've seen the original classic a few times, but it can hardly remember any detail. I think this film is much better than the cartoon it's not so black and white as it's. I especially liked how they made the grinch as a complete character and gave a reason why it was the way it was, the villain of this movie did not grinch the current but the Great, much different than the cartoon to the original. Jim Carrey was perfect for the entire party in all a big movie made for both kids and adults alike.
