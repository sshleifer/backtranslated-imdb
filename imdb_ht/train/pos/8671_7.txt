Armageddon PPV <br /> <br /> The PPP last of 2006 <br /> <br /> Smackdown brand. <br /> Match Match Avant ******** <br /> <We start the show with the Inferno match. Kane v. MVP. This was an okay match. There is nothing about this struggle here. This was about the visuals. In general, that was not wrong. There were some spots close here with Kane getting too close to the fire, but in the end, Kane won and rammed the MVP into the fire back first. <br /> <br /> Nice box. Let's continue. <br /> Teddy Long announces a new match for the tag team titles: London and Kendrick are defending against: Regal and Taylor, Hardyz, and MNM in a memory match !!!! Let's get moving! <br /> Matching two: Fatal four-way ladder ladder. This was total carnage. Judging by three out of four teams here, you would expect mess. The spots were amazing. A total placebo-fest. A point Jeff went for Poetry in Movement with London moved and Jeff hit the ladder! Shortly after, Jeff put on top of the rope and two nearby ladders as the MNM went to kill Jeff, Matt makes the escape and Jeff hits the "see-seeing" Joey Mercury shot! Mercury is painful. His eyes closed quickly and he busted open hard way. Mercury is taken out of the game and Nitro is still there. It will fight alone for the titles! Shelves and Taylor then grab London and suplex him face-first in the ladder! Jeff climbs the ladder with Nitro in a killer spot, drops to Jeff's nail ladder! Awesome! In the end, London and Kendrick hold the tag team titles. What a Press Match <br /> <br /> This was crazy. I do not know why WWE did not announce this until now. The Buyrate would increase significantly. I'm sure the replay value will be good though. Mercury suffered a crushed nose and wounds in the eye. She is in the hospital now. Get the Kid's Well. <br /> There is no other thing here going to be that. <br /> <br /> Next Up: Miz in v. Boogeyman. (Ugh) This was a game of nothing. Does the Boogeyman struggle? The Miz sucks too. After a fool, this kill them. DUD. <br /> Chris Benoit v. Chavo. This was a strong match. I loved it. Chave hits a killer superplex at one point! Benoit hit UIT extra German too! Benoit wins the marker. Good stuff. <br /> Helms v. Yang-Cruiserweight Title Tournament Match. This was a good match. Unfortunately, the stupid fans did not care for this. WHY? Helms and Yang are very talented and well-fought. I agree with JBL. He came to the crowd. JBL is 100% correct. Learn to appreciate this or find out. <br /> <br /> Kennedy v. Undertaker-last match the ride. Not too much here. This was a slug fairy, with a few exceptions. Kennedy at one point launches Taker on top of the stage stage. The task was good. Reactions were disappointing. The late spot was Taker tomb-stone Kennedy on the sound and won the match. Real. Kennedy needs this win. They are both hard workers. Still, Kennedy needs this win. Undertaker should be lost. Creative vice again. <br /> Something stupid is diva next. I love women. Not that. At least Torrie was not here. This is refreshing. Judging from the crowd, Layla should have. The WWE wanted Ashley. Consider this to your rest break. Next. <br /> Main Event: Cena & Batista Finlay & Booker T. This was also a game of nothing. The focus was Cena v. Finlay and Batista v. Booker. Batista and Booker can not work well together. Finlay is trying to make Cena look good. Was finished botched. Finlay hit Batista's knee and a seat shot and Batista no-sell the shot and finish the match. Lame. It is not the main caliber event. <br /> In general, Armageddon would have less scores, but the match ladder was the main event here. That was enough money worth there. Another was solid. <br /> <br /> The Last Word: A good PPP and the match ladder were the savior. Smackdown is not a bad show just is not compelling enough. Smackdown needs to stop leaving Cena tag simultaneously. Let Smackdown stand on your own feet. Show this to prove Smackdown case.
