I saw this first movie when it came out in 1994 and just watch it lately and it is still funny. I do not know if you have hiphop in the 90's but it helps if you do. In the 90's when NWA and enemy enemies were at the top, there were internal accounts of groups and members when they separated (ice cubes, easy E, etc.). Also there are the b, accessible rappers that begin to make the scene (Vanilla Mirror, Libi Williams from C & C to music factories, etc.). This movie makes fun of all that's in a similar way like it's a documentary actually. Kasi Lemmons plays an interview that spends one year in the life of a rap group NSW. Members of the group are Ice Code (Rusty Condieff / Director), Delicious (Larry B Scott / Nervous Revenge, and Tone Def (Mark Christopher Lawrence). They are a rap group rising and becoming politically controversial. good on this movie is that it is so thourough in its painting in the hiphop industry in the 80s and how it pokes the pleasure of it. But if you know the 80's / 90's of rap, you know how many things This is true. Still, on its own, without hip hop knowledge, it's still a funny comic movie. And for everyone who asks, yes is Spin Tap first, but Sponge Tap is not The first parody movie is silk. That's, in my opinion, is always as funny and in some ways, better than Spinal Tap. As Spin Tap is heavy metal, scary of a Black planet is Rap .. And the songs are in hook too. The DVD is full of chore of extras to include music videos of NWH as a group and as solo artist. Brilliant performances by Rusty Condieff and Larry B Scott.
