I like bad movies. Not only, because they are often as fun as 'really' 'movie' (like pirates in the Caribbean series and other Pathos Hollywood), but they are often far better than those films. And that's the reason why I love Italian rhythm of movies in the 1970s and 1980s. So the reason I especially love this movie, Barbares and the Company. Director of Ruggero Deodato has made some movies really good, like House on Edge at the Park, and also its Atlantic interception and live as a cop, dying as someone is enjoyable action movies. But this is really bad. The barbarians are so exotic movie. Peter and David Paul as Kutchek's Barberian Brothers and Gore are very funny, because they lack charisma and acting skills. But if they can not act, they cry and call each time they do something important. In one scenario, try to break the Brothers Barber, and escape very extraordinary routes. Bad acting, bad effects, stupid stories, bad directions, actually everything is bad in this movie. I can not describe how much I laughed when I first looked. The Barbarians and the company are classical camps everybody should see once. If you thought plan 9 From outer space is fun camp, this will be a real killer.
