This is a good movie, a good family movie to watch if you have nothing else to do. If you expect this movie to be the word word out of the book, you will be very disappointed. I was a little disappointed because I read the book a few times when I was in elementary school. This is about a new urban kid named Billy. It makes a bet and intimidation to the school and the bet is not as much bet. Billy has to eat 10 glasses in one day or open the bully. <br /> <br /> The act is OK, probably the worst part of the movie. The kid actors are exaggerated on many things. They think it's Apocalypse if Billy does not eat the worms. Hallie Eisenberg did a great job, though. The plot line is good as a movie, but it sucks as a book adaptation. I could watch this movie without looking at the moment ... sometimes. In general, this was a good family movie with some weak points. I missed this movie 7/10.
