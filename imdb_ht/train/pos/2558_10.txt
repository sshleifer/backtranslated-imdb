I married a Japanese woman 14 years ago. We are always together. <br /> However in the 1950s it would never have been as easy. <br /> <br /> The life of the military was denied for action, drama, and comedy for years by this point. Mines of Death. The mixed relationships gave it new ground to cover. This is old hat today, but then ...? Marrying an Asian back then means you either be someone something or you've been a freak in some sort. This touches on both possibilities and the third. Maybe she likes? <br /> <br /> Brando has done his usual job. Garner did a better job than he usually did. It's good, but it shows how good it is. Umecki-chan had a first helluva here and while I thought he touched his statue, he did not really stretch. It was a role that no one who was not overseas was recognized and the newness was the corker. <br /> <br /> True galactic scene was Red Button. Red was the best thing in this film. Bank on it. And the Japanese lives were also shown in an admirable light. <br /> A classic.
