Malefic very beautiful has the viewer from beginning to end up with his or her atmosphere. Almost the entire film is placed in a prison cell revolving around 4 characters in which Marcus transvestites and his little boy delayed are way out. Soon the prisoners get a diary of a prisoner before behind a brick that deals with his obsession in obsession with black theme magic leading to his escape from the cell. From here on everything deals and uncover the secret of the book and its spells to run out of prison. This leads to some accidents along the way from the cell to the unknown light. <br /> <br /> Honestly I think the story is rather poor and the final twist is nice, but for me to finish they're very wound tied together. Anyway, I was thrilled until the last moment because the atmosphere of the film is unique and minimized and cast. The killers are raw and weird ... it does not take your spine chill gray and the themes are also done very well and remind me of the hell themes in hellraiser. Malexic has a claustrophobic and cold dye feel with green color Tine. At times you ask if the real world or the world is aware here is stranger ... when the boy lasts to drop his finger and is lulled to sleep sucking on Marcus's breasts it looks normal, so how strange can glowing gates freedom must be? With its budget film creates a unique atmosphere and thrill the viewer in a very different way than most of the genuine traumatic make. I just want the story to lead to a most consistent final. Several elements such as the visitor and the camera, the other manicured prisoners and books and dolls in the game vaguely show the end does not fit tight in the story. Anyway, I'll keep my eyes open for other movies from director Valette, although it's a turn-off to see it is making a Hollywood rumor of "One missed call" that has been torn off and useless already in version and Miike.
