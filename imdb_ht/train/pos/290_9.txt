Edmund Burke said that "all need evil is good for me to do nothing." Hollywood often gives us garbage because not enough family goes to see quality movie. This movie has relegated the history of the loss and faith restoration. He had no violence, no spell, and did not deserve a PG rating. The western landscape was filmed well, and some of the perspectives were simply enchanting. The actors were a bit young for parties, but otherwise credible and talented. The music notes were too loud, and in some places the whole dialog was removed. I'm rarely surprised by the movie no more, but I was surprised by this one. Sometimes good guys have, and they have no honest effort. We loved the movie and the message, and would recommend it to the whole family.
