I'm not sure how I missed this one when he first came out, but I'm glad to have finally seen it. This movie takes place in and around the 19th century red light district in Okabasho, Japan. It tells the story of prostitution, helmet system and women who are strong in a society based on the samurai code of Japan. <br /> It is uniquely Akira Kurosawa! Even though she died before she could direct this film, her adaptation to the show showcase. Viewing it in the Japanese world and helmet system is renowned with light sheds about how these systems interact with each other. Characters can revolve around each other, but the helmet system remains intact when each character goes back to the world to belong. Samurai's warrior who scattered the world well and joy back into his life, while he went on a different road with a man who is part of his helmet system .. lower in the bar. The world's priceless price of samurai is above all others, but again, it is the lowest ones who can support each other and who can love without constraints. The samurai of this movie turns out to be the weak one, while the classless lovers prove to be honorable. The movie deserves a higher rating. It is a history of surviving women in feudal Japan. During this time frame, men are thought to be survivors .. they are strong while women are thought to be just mindless and weak properties. This film highlights Japanese women's strengths and how they have done what they have to survive, and how their strengths allowed Japanese culture to continue on as it has. <br /> I recommend the "sea watching" for anyone who is a fan of Akira Kurosawa and though not a fan. It is a beautiful movie, quiet and soul sustained, with one to be scratched for any movie collection.
