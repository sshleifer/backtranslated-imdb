It was very hearty. As a French expat, I particularly liked this film "TV", which I think deserves a wider distribution. The act was good, and the bonds between every member of this rural French family seemed so strong and so natural. There is no doubt a great movie about the family concept and inclusion in the face of homosexuality and AIDS. One of the strongest aspects of this film is the privileged relationship between the eldest son (Leo), who has contracted HIV, and the youngest boy (Marcel), whom the rest of the family tries to hide situation . The two characters <br /> progressive explored each other as time runs out for Leo, who does not want to spend the rest of his life surviving under drugs.
