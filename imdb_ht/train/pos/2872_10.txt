In my opinion, this is an absolutely romantic Disney princess. If you ask me, the Miss (Lucille La Verne voice) was really demonic. You'll have to watch the movie if you want to know why. On the other hand, despite the fact that he did a lot of catch, Cinderella (the voice of Ilene Stanley) was a very beautiful lady. For me, the scenery was beautiful, was thrown into well-chosen, and the writing was strong. Before I wrap this, I would like to say that everyone involved in this movie did very well. Now, in conclusion, I highly recommend this absolutely romantic Disney masterpiece to all of you who have not seen it. You are in for a good time, so go to the video store, rent it or buy it, kick back with a friend, and watch it.
