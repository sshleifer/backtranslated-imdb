I had to see the film "On Thin Ice" on the TV in India .. I must tell the movie was really well done, and really sent a chill down my spine .. The core story made me meditate on it which makes certain addicts decide to move aside while others remain addicted ... <br /> However, I felt that Diane Keaton was at her best ... scene in which she was eager, and started rummaging her home for cocaine ... was the best ... the two boys are good, and Lynda Boyd also showed that a good actress she is .... the script well done as is the cinematography and direction .. and filed. A must watch movie ..... for everyone
