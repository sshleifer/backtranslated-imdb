I enjoyed this movie. I thought it was an excellent political thriller about something that never happened before - a secret service agent would be bad and involved in a murder plot. Unfortunately, for Michael Douglas's character, "Pete Garrison," they think it's the mole but it's not. <br /> It's just a morally-defective agent that has an affair with the First Lady! Since doing so, he can not accept an acceptable polygraph exam and make him suspect the number one when he reveals a conspiracy to kill the President. <br /> <br /> "Garrison" is forced to go on the Lam but at the same time it is always trying to do the right thing by protecting the President. Douglas does a great job in this role. I do not always care for her plays but she is an excellent actor. Keifer Sutherland ("David Breckinridge") is equally as good (at least here) as fellow SS boss who hunted down Douglas until convincing he was telling the truth. When it's done two of them work together in the final to discover and then stop, if they can, the plot. The cats are interesting, too, by the way. Also, I never - and never will, unfortunately - see a First Lady that looks great as Kim Basinger <br /> <br /> This is simply a flick of slick movie that amuses start-to-end. Is there hole in it? Of course; Probably a number of them, and one reason why you see many critical comments. However, it's unjustly bashed here. It just is not smart enough for the geniuses here on this website. My advice: chill, just go along for the ride and enjoy all the action and intrigue. Yes, it gets a little rambo-me at the end but otherwise it gets high mark for entertainment ... that is what the movies are all about.
