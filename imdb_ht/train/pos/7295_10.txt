I managed to see this at the New York International Film Festival in November 2005 with my boyfriend. We were both well impressed with the complexity of the plot and found it to be emotionally moving. He was very well directed with strong imagery. The visual effects were amazing - especially for a short one. He has an original fantasy approach to a very real and reliable topic: This film is about a young girl who was visited by a demon offering his situation with his abusive father. There's also a surprise twist at the end that keeps me off guard. This leaning towards the gothic feel. I would like to see this as a full movie feature. - Carrie
