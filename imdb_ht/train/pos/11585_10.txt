This movie is full of films: crazy chains, pre-mediate murder, a madman (vaguely lesbian) female scientist and a madder father even wearing a mask because of disfiguring his terrible soil, poisonous poisoning, shocking Spooky, werewolves, male and female, adulterers, kill lovers, Tibetan mystics, victims of half-people / half-plants in some unnamed experiences, stealing thieves, self-control, crawling up body, a car accident on a lonely road, electrocution , the gun rider - many, all topped with an incredibly terrible score and some of the worst Foley works ever done. <br /> <br /> The incomprehensible script (even by seriously armed Spanish movie movie film) and some of the editing is just scarce. In one scene where the female scientist lead goes wrong to visit our heroine in her bedroom for one of the seriously armed: "That's awesome I do not understand ... Tell me how this is ..." scene Exposure to this film, there is a sudden sudden cutaway of the girl's thighs as she gets out of bed for no apparent reason at all other than covering a cut in the bad Mwahaha bad scientist! All werewolf you belong to me! "speeches. Even though why they went to the disruption I do not know because there are many other jumps cut off all over the place - even allowing for the atrocator boiler and scan of the print I've seen. According to one interview with the star, drinking for most of the shooting and the movie looks like it's a incoherent mess. It has made even more incoherent by the inclusion of werewolf liquor feet from a different film to the Mark of the Wolf Man ( made 4 years earlier, featuring the same actor, but playing the party with more aggression with a different shirt and make - with a word in Spanish for "Continuity"?) and more padding to another actor of Wolfman to get -up ambling over in long shot. <br /> <br /> The music is incredibly badly varied almost at random in full house orchestral creepy music, bosannova, in the long piano and gong duet ever recorded. Thinking about it, it might not have been a Duet. It might have been a solo. Piano's party was so simple he could have chosen out and one hand while the player whacked away from the gong and the other.) /> <br /> This is one of the most unpleasant trance-states to induce bad movies in the year so far for me. Enjoy. <br /> Favorite line: "Ilona! This madness and pervertiness will turn against you!" How true. <br /> <br /> Favorite Shot: The lover, discovering his girlfriend dies, dropping the candle into a cartoon-like demonstration in surprise. Amateur rank directs the direction.
