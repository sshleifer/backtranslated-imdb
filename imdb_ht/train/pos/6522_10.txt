During the whole Pirates of the Caribbean Trilogy Paramount Pictures Crapon really dropped the ball to restore this Anthony Quinn to direct Cecil B. DeMille film supervised and found on DVD and Blu Ray with all the costs included. It is obvious to me that Paramount Pictures Execs are blindly as stubborn and ignorant of the fact that they have a really good movie boat in the arches on a real ship that actually lived in New Orleans, Louisiana that would help make City Crescent once yet famous for it in ship's connection. When the Execs of Paramount finally join the program and release this movie in digital format then I'm going to be a happy campaign. Paramount Pictures it is up to you to get into your duff and get this movie restored now!
