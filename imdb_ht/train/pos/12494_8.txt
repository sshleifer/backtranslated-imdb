Finally, an independent movie that actually delivers some great crises! I saw the films that came out ... Theater, Straight-to-DVD, Cables, etc. ... and most of them suck ... some are monitoring ... even less are actually good ... Dark Remains are one of the good ones. I hold a movie screening at the South Pad Festival Festival Festival ... The audience liked it ... and my wife and I loved it! Having no actor, I assume the budget on this movie was very low, but you would not know it ... the film looks fantastic ... the act totally works for the film ... The story is good ... and crises are great! While most movies focus exclusively on crises, they often forget about stories and character development, two things that help deliver more effectively effects. Brian Avenet-Bradley must know that characters and stories are important. It develops both at the point where you care about the characters, you know the characters, and that's why it's more scary when they are in danger. <br /> Look at horrors movie that cost anywhere from $ 80 million to $ 5000 to make, I get "dark stay" to be one of the gems out there. Check out this movie!
