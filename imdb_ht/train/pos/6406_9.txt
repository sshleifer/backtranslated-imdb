Although I gave a rating of "9", my expectation was higher than that of the movie saved. I would have been happier there was more deep dive since I'm a diver myself, but it was supposed to show the life of Carl Brashear and that's what he was about to do. This movie made me angry at the beginning but happy at the end.
