As a warning, I saw the film 5-6 times in the last 15 years, and I just just saw the music this week. This allowed me to judge the movie without being attached to what was or was not in the music (however, it stained me when I watched the music :)) <br /> I actually believe Michael Douglas worked well which role, along with Kasey. I think it 'Let me dance to you scene' is one of the best part of the movie, a refreshing addition to the music. Dancers and songs in the movie are the most superior music, as well as the cast that is at least 10 times larger (easier to make in the movie of course). The decors, lighting, dancing, and songs are also much superior to the film, which should be expected, and it has indeed been deliberately saved. <br /> <br /> The songs that were in common with the music are best done in the movie, the new ones are good, and the movie all just delivers more than the music in my opinion, especially comparing with a music that has some d√©cor. One bad point on the movie is the obvious cuts between actors to talk, and dubbed musicians while singing songs for some of the characters, but dancing is impeccable, and the finished product was more enjoyable than the music
