As a single-line summary, two cinemas left as a remark on me when I walked out of the theater. One was "Broken in echoes" and Kevin Bacon, and the second was "Vanilla Sky". <br /> One of these movies that you sit deep in the theater chair and stop thinking about anyone around you, stop asking what the end of the movie will and just leave the movie in your quick where it wants. .. Walking out of the movie was a bit strange, as it feels when you get sick and can not think of anything. One of these movies is that you become one with the guy, and feel that nothing else moves around you than things in the movie. <br /> One thing is certain. The actors are scared, the sound track is excellent, and everything in the movie is 9 +. <br /> Surely one of the best films I ever saw, and the movie that made the best and most shocking up of my life and purpose in this world.
