As a major part of British pop culture as Monty Python and James Bond, Doctor Who was a massive hit for 26 years (1963-1989), making it one of the longest TV shows running in the world (most serials are likely to have ten seasons). The plans to reboot the series were still on the BBC's agenda, and after a miscalculated (not mentioned American) film produced by Fox failed to capture the magic of the original version, another nine years (comic perfectly rescue and anime mini-series nonwithstanding) were required before the last time the Lord could return well, courtesy of famous writer Russell T. Davies. 'Davies' shine on reintroducting the character lies in his decision to do so in the eyes of an outsider: Rose Tyler (Billie Piper), a London-based girl who leads a very normal life until one night it is attacked by animals that are made from plastic living. It is delivered by an elusive stranger who introduces himself simply as the doctor (Christopher Eccleston) and then disappears after damping: "Nice to meet you, Rose ... Run for Your Life!". As he becomes more and more curious about this "man", he soon finds himself in a whole new world: aliens, invasions, traveling in time and space, and of course, the all-overcoming Boxard-shaped TARDIS. <br /> <The first 45 minutes of New Doctor's almost perfect (special effects could be used a bit more polishing) because Davies nails two things: the unique humor show and the two protagonists. The most sophisticated series' most appealing was its blend of spectacular sci-fi and the best British comedy, a hybrid that's hard, if not impossible, to export. Here laughs are all linked to the conversation between Rose and the doctor, who come in as completely balanced character after just one episode. Well, so technically Eccleston's doctor is the ninth to use this name, but it distances itself from the eight incarnations before speaking to a North accent (one of which is used on a daily basis) and justifying it a terrific line: "Many planets have a North!" <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />! Ever heard of the doctor before. Her portrait of an ordinary girl lost in a new, exciting universe, represents the reaction of the new generation to the return of a television icon, and chemistry that immediately form between her and Eccleston is a sign that indicates the new doctor who is just as good as the old one. <br /> First, fifth, ninth, it makes no difference: there may have been others before Eccleston (and Piper, for that matter), but together, William Hartnell, Peter Davison and the rest of the bunch is a Only single character, one so fresh does not even need a name: it is the doctor.
