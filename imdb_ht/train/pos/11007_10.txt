Jeremy Northam's characterization of Stuttering, moderately luxurious bookable Morgan Sullivan and watching her leaving loose bits and pieces of her real identity under the influence of sick headache and under the spell of Lucy Liu's presence is brilliantly fabricated with a joy look. It offers a cigarette in the bar an old habit, does without thinking or even requires and gets lost in his face, neck and mouth. No matter the brain, love has a way to persevere. Love also can not be "brainwashed in" with one of her two false wives. At gradual stage, she starts dispensing her glasses, walking and talking differently and even her face looks different as the movie progresses. The music is fantastic, hypnotic, sexy and adequately driven at times. The use of many tones of black and white and gray makes this almost a sci-fi "movie noir" in the tradition of many classic stairs. I would like to see more vulnerability in Lucy Liu's image, every time he sees it in its various states, loved ones and for which it is performing a mission based on blind faith, some immovable vulnerabilities and flashes Genuine sympathy and anxiety could make it a lesser extent of performance on its part. It is just no match for the Talent Northam, but all of my well enjoy this movie and would enjoy knowing about another scenario written by the same author.
