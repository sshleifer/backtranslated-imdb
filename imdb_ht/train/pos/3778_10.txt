The first movie was a bit tired of anything to beat the screen. It was a bad version of 'Back in the Future' with zero charm. Once they accept that Bill & Ted are nitwits, the joke can only get to the audience for long before it breaks down. <br /> <br /> This is a surprise. This is just your spoiler warning ... <br /> <br /> By today's standard, this is more fun. This was shunned on release, sadly considering that more talent is involved than the first time. We get the photographer of 'Face / Off', the editor of 'Fugitive', a production designer from Burton's early works, and the sound designer at 'Matris'. <br /> <br /> Writers have made up for the first three trips and a deep thing. Since this was shunned by the fanfare and the public, the director probably decided the style was too extreme. It does not, it fits the material. Like 'Death to Be It' and 'Catch-22', this oz must be clever, but we love our movies "simple" so we do not buy it. Probably since this courage has to be different is why it took 12 producers to pull it off. What's so good? <br /> - Never references towards Keanu; from heaven to Messiah. See also Arnold Schwarzenegger. <br /> - Joss hates its creations just as he hates their counterparts and makes his own hate. B in B & T males and "useful robots good" have the same vocabulary as their original: younger copy and depreciation of language. <br /> - "motif of duality". Nowhere else is this obvious evolution of the photography styles, many of the high and low angles. They even use Roy Brocksmith in 'Total Recall' to emphasize the point. <br /> <br /> - The "Choice" motif. I do not know where this started in the genre (maybe 'Ghostbusters'), but it used very well here. It even boils down to the 7 games against death - battleship and clubs. <br /> <br /> - Filemon self-references, even present in the game against Death (Clue). This is smarter than Tarantino or Brooks. Note the Premier magazine magazine in the end: "Bill and Ted: The Movie." Ironic also saw how death and Nomolos were bandits at the end of the 'Hard' and 'Lethal Weapon'. <br /> I still have some minor, but nothing compared to the original. Music and films are different medioms so it does not make any sense why scripts of gravity around the former - particularly in the teenage market. Carlin is a great comedy, but in these movies she was wasted. Also, for all the daring this effort shows, even split gay jokes, can not kill a cat? So, looking like a Nickelodeon production, this is incredibly interesting. From this movie we got Beavis and Butt-Head. "We're in the sky and we just mugged three people." <br /> <br /> Final Analysis = midrange material
