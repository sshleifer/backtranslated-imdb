Hope to see another movie Nunsploitation with a signature superior mother abusing and torturing her charges, Flavia turned out more than I was anticipating. <br /> It actually has a feminist storyline, though I do not think such a term exists in the era of which the film is set. He certainly did not practice. Women (and the Jews and the poor) are very disgusting and close to menus in society. Throughout the story, Sister Flavia (Florinda Bolkan) witnessed tyranny in his time until he just can not sit back and actually do something about it, albeit with disaster results. Sequence has Flavia as a young adult near a battlefield. He sees a wounded "evil" Muslim soldier (one of the few still alive) and try to help him. Before he can, his hate-filled father cuts off the head and waves himself in his face (great family dynamics, huh?). And his father forces him into a convent where he witnessed even more injustice. Though the scenes involve violence, rape and nuns, I would consider this more of a historical drama than Nunsploitation. <br /> <br /> Indeed, many of the ingredients for a garbage exploitation piece have, but the acting, camera-work, scenario and music are too good to keep it down to this level. Most "thin" films I've seen usually have the basic basic: A charming little girl somehow winds up into a convent, where the Super Mom is a supreme bitch who loves to whip people and / or make their lives a hell live. br> <br /> Flavia spent much of the first part of her film passively questioning all of the atrocities happening around her. Many of her passions are forgotten when she gets acquainted with the strong-spirited (but slightly loony-she likes to pee out like me, but it's a lot easier for guys) Sister Agatha. When a Muslim group attacks the Abbey, Flavia and Agatha do not cower in fear as other nuns. Attackers are currently operating as the liberators (in the abyss and pre-bondage of the Abbey). In fact, he is a Christian, not a Muslim occupant, who imparts love to Sister Agatha. <br /> It is Agatha death that sent Flavia over his violent crusade against those who oppressed him ... his father treated it like dirt. His Muslim lover deserts him in a very inopportune time. I do not want to give out too much of the rest of the story, but be prepared to be shocked, devastated and sad at the conclusion. This is a great movie, so should not be taken off by its reputation (ineserved) as a seasonal waste. Plus, how about Earth could a movie featuring Florinda Bolkan and Claudio Cassinelli go wrong? I'm not familiar with Mar√≠a Casares' work, but Sister Agatha is a hell of a character. <br /> I have read many great reviews of the Synapse (US) release, but I love my German X-Rated DVD copy DVD. It's not anamorphic / 16: 9, but actually has a little more photo information on all the edges than released Synapse. <br /> There are also many great, wise or funny lines of dialogue (Many from Sister Agatha) <br /> "Why is God the Man, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit? ! " -Flave <br /> <br /> "These men are scared- look at them, Sisters-Pair will take power from them!" -Sr. Agatha (regarding Christian survivors coming from Muslims) <br /> "Woman, where are you going? Muslims can do anything to you that Christians have not done! Ha Ha!" -Sr. Agatha (in a group of Christian women's rescues) <br /> <br /> "Lord bless these Moslems- To put the fear of Christian pompous ones." -Flavia <br /> "Does it take the only eye of a Muslim to make you h $ your underclothing?" -Sr. Agatha <br /> <br /> Close message: "Flavia Gaetani, not yet a Muslim - no longer a Christian - was punished as a little runaway. The idea for the film came from events that took place during invasion Muslims in Italy culminated in what even today is remembered as the 800 martyrs in the "
