I had the TV for a white noise companion and heard "$ 400 for a fully furnished apartment" so I ran into the TV room waiting to repeat another 70's and got a lot more. Luckily, I was able to fly at the start (DVR quietly) and hit the file button to watch it whole. (Cinemax unut and HD not less!) Aside from some holes in the history and intermediate dialogue / event, this is an effective thriller worthy of your time to watch. Pretty Creepy and Progressive At Once: Beverly D'Angelo's character masturbates in front of Alison Parker, playing adroitly by Cristina Raines, Parker Sew, in his very gory fashion, an explicit menu of a trio scene. (Do not let the kids look) The film is TOTALLY 70 full of bad clothing (polyester suit and denim taxi) and decorations, bad hair, on notes of music, and habitual cinematography. Throw is excellent, take a second on this movie home page to check it out. It was a surprise to see Christopher Walken, Jerry Orbach and Jeff Goldblum youth. Sylvia Miles - always nice to climb! ENJOY!
