Overall this is a delightful, light-hearted, romantic, comedy music. I suppose a little could be done for the movie being long. But I'm not sure what you would have to cut out. The song that Kelly and Sinatra do? No The Fabulous Dance That Kelly Does? No. The time taken to develop the story line and develop the relationships of the characters? No (which seems to have a common complaint many times that most recent movies do not develop the characters). Some comments by Iturbi did not bring much to the movie but gave us a chance to see and hear a great talent in the 1040s. So what if he was not an actor? It was an important part of the film as the basic draw found Grayson an audition with him. <br /> <br /> Originally Katherine Grayson wanted to be an opera star. Louis B. Mayer brought it to MGM for a screen test that included an aria. During her audition in this film, there is a shot of MGM chronic and smile. You can just imagine it was like when he did his real screen test before. <br /> <br /> This movie is so full of life it's hard to hit all of the highlights. Used great in color and lighting throughout the movie. You can see why Frank Sinatra became the star he did. A nice counter-point in the movie is how Sinatra (a lady lady same then) played the role of wanting to just get a date while on leave. You will feel good after seeing this movie. 7/10
