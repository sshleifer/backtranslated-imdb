I'm 14, so you probably thought I had never heard of George Burns or Walter Matthau or anyone like that. Your boy is wrong. I heard that George Burns was in this movie and that he had an Academy Award for him. I was a George Burns fan since I was ten. I saw the movie Oh, God lately and loved it. This one was also very scary. George Burns did a great job. So did Walter Matthau (this is the first time I ever saw him doing). And even though they were really small, Phyllis Diller and Steve Allen did a great job. That special filming was scary if he really did. Let me say this, if you are a fan of George Burns or Walter Matthau, you should see this movie right away!
