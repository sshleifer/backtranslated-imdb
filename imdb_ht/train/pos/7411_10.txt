The key to happiness and beauty, the pain and sadness of life is our ability to accept that life basically is that it is so we are not always fighting against convincing truths. In doing so, we find peace. Elegant in its simplicity, but so hard for most of us at hand. <br /> In this movie, the director shows us this truth, but allows us to discover it in our own way. This is a beautiful yet simple story, more of a fab, which is played very well. Watching the actors are more like being in a room with real people than it is just watching actors. <br /> I was struggling with how to write a review of this fine film for others would be motivated to see it. I'm in a loss. The story is about people in a bathing house. Sounds like a real close, right? But there is nothing that can be beyond the truth. The American title for this movie is the shower but that's almost a constraint to a key themed element in this movie, which is the bath. I'm still in a loss. Talk about the story or the characters will not make them justice. So I'll just tell you how much I enjoyed watching this movie and how touching and moving the experiment was. I was also well entertained. I care deeply for the characters and I care very much about what happened. For any history, that is the highest form of praise. If you have been moved by movies like the King of Masks or by One Less, then make sure to see the shower. Netflix has it and the DVD video and sound quality are excellent. I look at the original original and well done and properly set the English subscriber. <br /> <br />
