This was a very original movie decent, with a brave move for all those involved. I do not care if it's not best set-along movie ever, the fact that she has Eddie Murphy does something non-formal, and that I do not know what will happen next, making it a favorite of me. I wish more movies were as imaginative as this one, rather than the same old formula for entertainment.
