This was an excellent movie. I do not understand why many people do not like it. There was plenty of it connected with, many beautiful images, and much compassion of things that were not said. I was well entertained, and left with a feeling of joyful excitement, as I did when I finished any Tom Robbins story. Now, I have not read this particular book in the Robbin, so I'm not currently how this matches up, but I can not imagine this movie could have been a very bad interpretation. The movie leaves a lot for you to define yourself, which is the best part of any Tom Robbins novel, dreaming up the details. <br /> <br /> For all of you who said this was the worst movie ever, I have the little mercy to stay in the light of graduation in your heart. Far from the worst ever this movie was glorious. Long live the screaming technique.
