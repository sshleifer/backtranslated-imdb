I want to add to praise for the production of this movie, especially the glowing cinema. Firelight glistening off of smooth skin and muscled creates beautifully stunning imagery. The film was nominated for (and won) one Oscar - the first to give up for editing. Mala's performance is mean, penetrating and powerful.
