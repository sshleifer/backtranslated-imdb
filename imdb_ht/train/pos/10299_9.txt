I'm a big big Jim Carrey fan. I laughed my ass while lying lewd with Ace Ventura. I also love it in serious movies, especially Truman Show. This one is a cross between her very funny side, and her serious side. It is of course very funny in this movie, but there are very serious parts, and pull it off with a lot of ease. It is indeed a multi-function actor. As for the rest of the cast, I was pleased with Jennifer Aniston's act. I think it is more than just a couple of nice tits and big asses. Morgan Freeman makes a very cool God. As for Steven Carell, his limited scene is very funny, especially in the ink cast scene. <br /> <br /> In general, I should rate this one 9. Good acting, funny script, and some very serious situations make this a very good movie.
