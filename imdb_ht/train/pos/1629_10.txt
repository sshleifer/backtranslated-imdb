This movie is so cheap, it's endearing !!! With Ron Liebmann (Big Vaughn) that provides the most fun diatribes on screen in movie history. I own 2 copies of this video film ... on one, Ralph Macchio is holding actually split up in the background of Major Vaugn while she is ranting to "Hash". Obviously they forget to edit this error from the movie, but it's going to show just how funny the film is, when the actors themselves can not hold a right figure!
