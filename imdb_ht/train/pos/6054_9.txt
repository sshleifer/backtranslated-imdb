I saw a preview of the Freebird Isle of Man TT as I heard about it in a couple of mags. Although I was mostly on the race, lure to see Phil Daniels in a motorcycle movie (yes I like Quadrophenia like everyone else) proving enough to get me away from the beer and partying. At last! we did it! Our British have actually made a huge motorcycle movie (and no it's not like Torque) this is the stand with the best of British comedy. Mark my words, this Phil Daniels better screen performance, and as far as Geoff Bell is concerned, there is a new British legend that makes his name feel. I love Gary Stretch at Shane Meadows' Fantastic Dead Mans Shoes and here she gives a slowly touching performance that she can proudly add to his growing movie reputation. This is a movie not only for our cyclist, but I think for everyone (even my girlfriend liked it). I hope she gets the same brilliant answer on the mainland as she came to Isle of Man. I will not go into the details of certain classic scenes that this movie has, (look out for the shop), as it would spoil the fun, but I would say, go see, enjoy, and have one of the best The night at the cinema you had in a while. I really think this may well be a cult classic. As they say in the TT ... C'Mon Freebird!
