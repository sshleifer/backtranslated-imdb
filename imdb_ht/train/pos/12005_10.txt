This movie was the best movie I've ever seen. Being LDS I highly recommend this movie because you can feel a more understanding of Joseph Smith's life. Although the film has not been made with its acclaimed actor, it is a remarkable movie with changing lives that can be enjoyed and appreciated by everyone. I saw this movie with my family and I can witness that we all had a change of heart. This film allows people to really understand how hard life was for the Prophet and how much tribulation he faced. After I saw this movie, there was not one dark circle in the entire room. Everyone was touched by what they saw and I was not the same because I saw it. I highly recommend this movie to everyone.
