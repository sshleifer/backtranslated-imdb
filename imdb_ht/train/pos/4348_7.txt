Paul Reiser steps away from the comedy presentation stand up to write a warm, romantic and gentle touch to family - what we see and what we do not see, what we hope and what surprises us. THAT MY FOLKS do not include any new movie films, but it's a little story well said that reminds us of the significant obligations that families represent. Sam Kleinman (Peter Falk) has been a workaholic, at times pushing his wife Muriel (Olympia Dukakis), his daughter (Mackenzie Connolly and Lydia Jordan), and Ben, son her husband (Paul Reiser) in the background. One day Muriel leaves a note that after years of marriage she leaves! His daughter, along with Rach, Ben's wife (Elizabeth Perkins), immediately starts the search for where she is, leaving the confused and hurtful and unpleasant sam sorting things out on a road trip with Ben's son. Road trips become a time for the two men to learn that each other is with each of these situations such as father and son and family members. Sam determines for the first time in his life and introduces Ben's now workololic fun and fun of living. The trip comes to an end with a phone call on the location of Muriel and why she left and regrouping in the family to have the most intelligent plot to read the hot story. Everything is not what it looks like: it's best and, quite, different. Falk and Reiser play in each other as the pros, but in many ways the movie is due in the short moments when Olympia Dukakis is on screen, reminds us that it is one of our strongest matriarchs in film. Well worth seeing. Grady Harp
