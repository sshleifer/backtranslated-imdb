I try not to take IMDb ratings at heart, but I was flabbergasted when I saw the 5.4 rating of one of my kids' favorites. It does not wow me as much as 17, but as a family movie this is a sweet and meaningful film. Kids will definitely love it and will not mind their flaws, and the adults can guess the actor behind each character and admire the subliminal messaging of the movie. None of the film was preachy in any way, in fact it has a great message that adds to its sweetness. I'll admit if the story is on the thin side, and some scenes like Screweyes's death (which always freaks me out) can be a tad on the side. But the animation is quite above average and beautiful colors and good character animation. Music by James Horner is very beautiful, with this memorable song, entertaining and entertaining. I really loved the characters, Louie is probably the most profound of them all, but the dinosaurs were at least engaged. Martin Short's clown was both hilarious and bright, the party said Screweyes "I quit!" made me to point. My favorite is Screweyes though, an effective cruelty who is cracked and I'm supposed to be intelligent. If none, though, I wish the movie kept in the party when it explained how he had lost his eyes and why he was afraid of roaming because that way he could've been more developed in terms of depth. The script, while not Oscar-worthy, has its funny and heart-warming part, and should keep children and adults entertained. The voice to act for me is what made the movie. John Goodman, Martin Kout, Rhea Perlman, Felicity Kendall and Yeardley Smith all provided solid performances but special mention has to come to Kenneth Mars because it was absolutely superb as Screweyes and almost unmatched. All in all, this is a good movie. I do not get the rating, honestly I do not. Make sure this movie is not perfect, and it's not as good as a dinosaur movie like Earth before time, but it's fun. 7.5 / 10 Bethany Cox
