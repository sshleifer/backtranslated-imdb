And that goes specifically for the lawyers and cops. Puerto Rico, which has a lot of small farms, but powerful movie production firm, brings this multi-layered story of corruption, due to the cartel of the drug gone from South America, to a pit on the Commonwealth of the island , and then toward the north of North America. Steven Bauer, the most recognized figure on screen here, leads a cast of top actors, in a story of "can you spot the only respectable figure in the crowd?". Ricardo Mendez Matta moves out of directing primarily action ticket fare for the American television, in a scenario written by Matta, along with Poli Marichal. The rest of the cast (Elpidia Carrillo, Magda Rivera, Jose Herredia, Luz Maria Randon, mentioned a few) turn into this fine role, in a movie that will keep you asking "with respectable characters here?". Speaking in Spanish with English subtitles. Rated 'R' by the MPAA, this film has vulgar language crisis, flash short of stripping, adult content and violence, some of which are quite lurid.
