I bought black angel season 1 & 2 two weeks ago, after taking a couple of season 1 episodes on Channel 5. There is nothing that prepared me for how brilliant the show is. I did not enjoy anything as much since Firefly (also with amazing shows). I will admit Season 2 wqasn't well as good, but there are still some amazing episodes (refer to this Designate, Embrace, Berrisford Agency, Light Harbor, Freak Nation etc.) and Alec is great. I've heard some of the plans for the season-3, and I must say, I can not believe it has been canceled - I will not spoil it for you - but it would have launched! I think it has a lot of potential as a movie (although at the moment it looks pretty easy). As evidence of my obsession, Barcode Max's number is 332960073452, and in the two weeks I had it, I am 3 episodes away that looked at both seasonal times. It's just too good.
