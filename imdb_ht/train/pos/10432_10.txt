I must admit that at the beginning I was sort of reticent about watching this movie. I thought it was this stupid, little, romantic movie about a French woman who met at the train an American and decided to visit Vienna with him. I was not actually enchanted on this kind of script, since it continues to make me believe it is just a movie. Still, I look at her! And I was surprised ... "Before Sunrise" is one of the few films that dare to speak in a rather philosophical way, asking about the fact that at the time of our birth we are sentenced to death, or that it is a Middling ideas that the fact that a couple should rest together for eternity, or that, we, people, can sometimes pay to live in fairy-tale. They chose the wonderful (we do not know if they will meet again in six months, at six o'clock at Vienna's station) - in our optimism, we sincerely hope that. Actors act in a very good way, so, I started to believe that I, myself could live a love-like story like this.
