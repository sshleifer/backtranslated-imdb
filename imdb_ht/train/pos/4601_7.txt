Police History is a stunning series of set pieces for Jackie Chan to display his unique talent and courage. Some of the exhibits here are Jackie's best and most dangerous end-to-end commercial hackers are probably Jackie's greatest single-sided battlefield, more brutal and less cognitive then says Project A or Drunken's master End of the battle you can almost feel the pain of the impact. <br /> But unfortunately the rest of the movie does not hold up to this quality as it is a rather formulary thriller thriller and some comedy elements. I still prefer JC's movie as Project A where its natural talent is shining. In the serious limitations of some elements of police history it just does not work for me. Having said that even though this still got there and film movies better due to the incredible stunt work and absolute spectacle. As usual with Hong Kong film avoids the English envelope DVD version as it is really terribly wild with the subtitles. <br /> <br /> Great exhibition, OK movie a fine point start if you have not seen a JC movie before and well worth a look for any movie fan 7/10
