About a year ago I finally gave up on the American television. I thought of abandoning television completely until a friend who lived in England showed me some programs including Office, Extract, Blackadder, and the League of Gentlemen. It was then that I decided to switch to British television. Among all the shows listed above, the League of Gentlemen is unlikely to be the most obscure and twisting of them all, causing guilty and material not found in any other comedy I've seen yet. Character included are the most married couples couples, a butcher that puts ingredients in the meat that goes unsaid (probably for the better), a disturbing couple who look at a local store that is only welcome to local people, and vets The worst ever. This program is one of the best I've ever seen.
