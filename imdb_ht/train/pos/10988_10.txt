It does not read anything about this movie (especially nothing that might include any mobs). Just watch this awesome movie without knowing anything about it - and you'll have a really great experience. If you like to see a smart story, twist: Go, get the DVD and you will really not be disappointed. "Cypher" is not really a sci-fi movie, plus a thrilling thriller established in the environment of globalized business. It is about the corporate sector, how big spy companies each other research departments and methods used by them. The actors perform a great performance with the overall visual style of the movie to provide a perfect mode of coldness. Cypher is deeper, more complex and - what is part of the story and the finish - too much, much more satisfying than Vincenzo Natali's movies "Cube" and "Nothing". Actually it's one of the best movies I've ever seen (and that's something I really do not say about every fifth well-made movie). Sorry, can not tell you anything more about this movie without risking hurt your experience. Just give it a chance. ;-)
