Greetings, this little movie is especially interesting for an artist, movie-maker or music creator or visual artist, for: <br /> <br /> One can feel and examine David / style touch from a short piece of relative simplicity. <br /> You can see the rhythm of the shots, boilers and the sound components. <br /> Just as simple movie, this creation is multi-layered. For example, some sounds are hides all along, while others appear (though subtle), at certain points to support certain shots. One can also see many types of pan: some go up and down in a gentle return. There are diagonal boilers. Zooms also come back sometimes with ideas. The lightning and composition / disposition of elements of the space is, as usual and obviously, work in a painter / artist. This can feel even in this crazy room. This is to say: one can make exquisite art already by the simple art of putting the look / see and composition of the scene. Then come the peaks of the visuals: such as digonal, parallel, etc. degradiates the light and the colors, although without too much searching for textures such as in large production, they are also. This is an artist's plot of a sort ... <br /> <br /> All this is not calculated but iron and feel inside and this feeling gives David's touch / feel of it, as with any artist true.
