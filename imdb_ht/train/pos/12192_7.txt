This movie star 1947 and was directed and written by Orson Welles (with an Irish funky accent) and also Gita Hayworth's gorgeous star with less hair blonde calls. So I was hanging out with Orson before the wrong touch with Kane's citizens and third-party people but this was my first Rita Hayworth interaction. Our first meeting went well and performed a superb job playing the Elsa fear / cagey, marrying a disabled millionaire lawyer. Mike (Welles) and Elsa fell for each other. He wants to run with him and he does not know if he can live without money that they can buy. Her husband Elsa, and her partner bicker and bite, just like Mike's shark describes each other's assault and prediction it proves just too true. Several twists and turns follow in this mystery mystery as we come to the climax in the fun house. (Think of the shooting shooting of the man with the Golden Gun, which borrows heavily from this scene). I did not know who the murderer was until the end. This film is like clove of garlic and lemon. These flush centers on the ocean, it is subtle, back, and spicy, all great effects. These could not be the best, shrimp fresh, but quality quality shrimp shrubs from Costco. The flavorful sauce adds to the natural of the pink shrimp as you fill up on a healthy but filling alternatives to more mundane, common fare. 7/10 http://blog.myspace.com/locoformovies
