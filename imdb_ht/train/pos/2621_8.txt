Disney has done it again. Brilliant way to Timon and Pumbaa have come back to life again to tell us how they came to meet and help Simba when he needed them. I love this movie and watch it over and over again. It shows how Timone lived with his family and fellow meerkats before setting up to find his dream home and adventure. Then he meets Pumbaa and things are changing. Together, they search for the Timon home to want and repeat fails, which is funny as Timone gets more and more crazy. Then Simba turned up and we see more of her childhood than we did in the previous 2 films. The rest, you already know.
