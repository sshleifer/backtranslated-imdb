Great and unforgettable, stunningly atmospheric, and brilliant acting by all. <br /> I really can not understand what sort of people are swinging this prince and giving the preponderance of votes as 8 (and nine!) <brs /> <br /> This, along with grapes in anger, is most John Ford's great movie. I would say that Long journey home is next in line, though quite a way back. <br /> <br /> <br /> Rating: 10. She deserves a 12.
