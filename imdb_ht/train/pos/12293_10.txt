This is an excellent film, and it's sort of treasure that one can only catch in sporadic movies, as it is available on video / DVD. The way the movie begins with the two lovers arrives, and ends up leaving (although quite a bit come in between, and not staying in one place during that time), gives you a sense of closeness, with a feeling that really with the world. If you get a chance to see this movie, then do. I can not wait to see him again, and wish he could put them on general release.
