The biggest surprise of this movie was the performance of Daryl Hannah. Rather than playing the amazing blonde roles that he usually plays a street-smart, clever, world-weary character. He does not have a big role but does a great job describing Lois Harlan as a woman tired of, although used, covering up for her boss disrespect.
