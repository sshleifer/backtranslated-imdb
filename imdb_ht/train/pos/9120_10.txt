This film speaks a universal language; One can relate it to the self, community, society or the wider world. It has a way of not only opening several questions, but also putting one in pursuit of discovery and asking the right questions in order to get to this point of self-conviction / ownership. Stereotype portraits of the film address the archetypes around us that must be recognized as the cycle is repeated in destruction, the opposite force of innovation, creativity and growth. The factors that disrupt the natural flow of things must be apparent and tackled. The idea is definitely an experienced movie and it does not just see it as the internal voice / awareness taps of the one looking, and it's just as opposed to just watching.
