This very unusual movie is unlike what has been done in the west at the time. With its tumultuous emotions and utterances in visions, dreams, and imaginative typing, its effects are both beautiful and disturbing. The actors chore more like dance than acting. It has the only dream sequence I know of which actually looks like a real nightmare (sorry, fanatic Dali).
