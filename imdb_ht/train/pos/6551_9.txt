I arrived at Nancy Drew waiting for the worst ... because of all others in bad reviews. I thought: Even though I do not read the books, which does not look like Nancy Drew I've heard of. But I was wrong. Sure, it was not a carbon copy of the books, but when you made a movie out of something, you have to modify it to become big-screen entertainment. The draw was enjoyable and thrilling with a lot of real crises and I thought Emma Roberts was really credible in her own way to portray this classic character. There were many funny moments and on the contrary in many statements, at any point in this movie Nancy came on as a ditz. It was smart, conservative, polite and genuine. One of these films has also done well to balance everything out there with a mix of comedy, romance, suspense and stunning moments. I liked this movie. What a Flick Movie, What a Flick Movie! But if you are wise and decide to trust me and go see this, be prepared for some results as fortunate moments because I was, like, freaking out! Go see it or be a bum bomb and just let others decide what you think of this movie for you ... a mistake I've done almost. I like it, I want this movie to be! I love Emma Roberts now, too. It's like a mini-Bree Van De Kamp from DH. Love it, love it.
