I saw this first movie when he was released in the United States in 1984. I've seen it many, many times since. What struck me on the film is incorporation into the art of the repetition of the lives of the characters and visa versa. Throughout the movie from the stairwell and at once one is never too sure that one is watching the lives of the characters or a scene from a repetition. This continues to the highest point of the movie. All these years later my friends and I still love debating whether "Carmen" is really short at the end. From the reactions of the other characters, to the stylized murder, it is open to debate. The passion of dance, the quality of acting, the love of art, and the brightness of their performance all combine to create a superb film that, once again, mixes with twisting the line between life and art.
