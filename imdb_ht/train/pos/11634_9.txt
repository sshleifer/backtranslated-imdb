I also came back from an advanced screening of Redeye and I must say I did not have much fun in a movie in a long time. WES CRAVEN is at his best ever. It brings us an amazing end to my winter thrill was so desperately craving. This is thrilling in the year .. no doubt. <br /> <br /> All the actors are amazing and the action is realistic and fun. F / X was great. It builds suspension. I was on the edge of my place most of the movie. It has been a while since I heard a cheer cheerful audience and excited in a theater. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for emotions, actions and a good scheme this summer, REDEYE salvation. Go see it!
