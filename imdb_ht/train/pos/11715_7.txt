This is a little parody of parody / comedy presenting Cassandra Peterson aka Elvira: Mistress in the dark, the most infamous horror host ever. This was meant to be the pilot car for Elvira and was so successful that he was picked up by the NBC Network. They pilot a pilot for a TV series to present the black busty babe but unfortunately the site never made it past the pilot stage due to his sexual reference. This movie however, is very fun. Elvira is the modern-day Chesty Morgan and the Queen of One-Materials. This movie was followed up to a few years later by the "Elvira Hanted Hills" abysmal "which meant to be a take-off of the old Roger Corman movies, but falling flat on his face. instead of a much more fun experience!
