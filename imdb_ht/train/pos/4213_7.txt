Director of Fuller Samuel concocts a brilliant visual set-up: pickpocket cocky unwittingly lifts some microfilm into a woman's purse; It turns out it is a courier for the Communists, and now it's with the grafter being watched by the police. The movie noir formula is its glory - before the ingredients have become clich√©s - including locals waterfront, floozies, saxophones on the belt, and a hell of a fistfight climate. Performances by Richard Widmark and Jean Peters are right on target, and smart, the sharp script is quite colorful. Fabulous Thelma Ritter received an Oscar nomination for portrayed role as a "professional stoolie". Exciting, atmospheric, tough as nails. *** from ****
