An excellent periodic melodrama, and Fontaine effectively plays against her earlier na√Øve qualities, in a role that Olivia DeHavilland has turned down. That's fine, because Fontaine is wonderful. Scripted by Charles Bennett, who wrote for Hitchcock in the thirties and also later writes the excellent script for the classic British movie horror film of the devil. The opening scene, where Ivy visits a torture fortune teller played by the wonderful Una O'Connor (screecher of James Whale fame), is a journey of strength, and the film keeps interest in all the disaster machinery . I hope to see this movie on DVD a day, but despair of all time is happening, because it seems to be a dark obscure movie. Fortunately I got to see it on AMC some seven or eight years ago, but have not been seen since. Catch it if you can!
