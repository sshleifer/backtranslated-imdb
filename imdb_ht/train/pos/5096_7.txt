This is a sprawling (4-hour) remake of the Haggard Rider's story, and the usual added girl with a strange subplot and Russian soldiers seeking a "Stone of Power" buried along with King Solomon's treasures. It is beautifully shot, providing a sense of stay in the wide open spaces of Africa, and very well-acting. Patrick Swayze is an excellent Alan Quatermain, and Allison Doody is attractive as Elizabeth Maitland, who hired Quatermain to help save his father. Sid√©na like Umbopa, Gavin Hood as McNabb and leader of the Russian soldiers (by calling the IMDb list) are also memorable. For all that Hollywood can not leave a good story alone when adapted, this one is well said, and, except that it's too long, I enjoyed it. 6/10.
