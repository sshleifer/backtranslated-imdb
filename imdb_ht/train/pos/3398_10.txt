I saw Soylent Green back in 1973 when she first released and maybe another eight times over the years on T.V. or video. She has always been one of Sci-Fi's favorite and / or Charlton Heston films. Recently, the Egyptian theater of L.A. There was a dozen Charlton Heston movie retrospect. I flew in from the state to see six of these films over a two-day period. Soylent Green looks great on the big screen of Egypt with a perfect new print. From its opening mount to the home scene at the great end of the movie was fantastic. Charlton Heston as a cop who lives in a dog eating dog and some natural resources left and there is no understanding of how the world was used with Eddie Robinson as someone who remembers the past are both great. <br /> <br /> The chemistry together is wonderful. The film also looks much better at a large 35mm print. Fleisher really knows how to fill the screen, and the cinematoraphy, writing, music use, and everything on it works. The film is also very powerful in viewing it weak and very possible in the future. Just think how the world's population has grown, the rain forest has disappeared, the resources used, the green house effect has worsened since 1973. I just wonder why this movie has not been played in theaters all year. Its reputation would be best. <br /> Speaking of reputation, often speaking as if Charlton Heston is not a great actor. Seeing him in El-Cid, Soylent Green, Warlord, The Omega Man, Does Penny, and Big Dundee come back to my conviction he is one of our best actors. Of course he's done about a dozen other big movie and for those who care for you to know what they are. <br /> <br />
