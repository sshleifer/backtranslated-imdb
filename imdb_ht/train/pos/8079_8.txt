Not much review, hence thinking I would add one. <br /> <br /> Do not go to the other REVIEW! This was an excellent movie. <br /> <br /> RKS is one of the very Indian Indians who can actually put together a really good movie. <br /> <br /> AB and Akshay give yet another example of Big Aji, as well as bhoomika too, which was a little unexpected, but great to look. <br /> I'm surprised there was not much hype around to drop. <br /> Or filmfare / other award nominations, consider how good the movie was. <br /> <br /> Best then Khakee I thought and I thought Khakkee was also good movie. <br /> Is it a fairly long movie, but definitely worth it and while watching it, definitely looks long. <br /> <br /> Can not wait for RKS next film and the next AB, Akshay films always seem to be well together ... example Bhoomika also acted really well in the movie and should do really well it proceeds to the same in the future.
