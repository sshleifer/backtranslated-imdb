Before watching this movie, I thought this movie would be great as Flashpoint because before watching this movie Flashpoint was the last Jenna Jameson and Brad Armstrong movie I've ever seen. As far as sexual scenes are concerned I was disappointed, I thought sexual scenes in Dreamquest will be great as sexual flipping scenes but I was disappointed. Except for Asian Carrera's sexual scene, any sexual scene in this movie does not make me feel so much (you know what I mean). Jenna Jameson in great not doing these kind of sexual scenes at what she is capable of. Felecia and Stephanie Swift both of these beautiful girls avoid me as well as as sexual scenes are concerned. Although it's an adult movie, but if you're sexually arguing sexually, this movie is pretty good. If the typical normal adult film is concerned this movie definitely raised the norms of adult movies. History, act, direction, sex, makeup and other things in this movie are really great. The actors in this movie do really good act, they all do a great job. Dreamquest is definitely raised the bar of quality in adult movies.
