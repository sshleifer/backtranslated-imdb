Despite occasionally active acting and "seeing-it-all-before" history, this is a compelling justice movie. <br /> There are suspense, scenes and demons are actually pretty crap, some of the visual effects are superb and best of all, no ridiculously illuminated humor is set to detect from the film, as much too ( wannabe) horror movie there's now <br /> <br /> honestly, this is not the greatest movie ever made, but it actually draws you in and at least makes an attempt at character development <br /> I've been happy I watch it
