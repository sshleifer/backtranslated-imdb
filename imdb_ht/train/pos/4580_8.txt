Princess Tam Tam is without the trapings of racism, by the way, we think of racism in the United States, but there is more subtle (giving the American viewers) the affinity of ethnic identity during the time. Pay attention to Alwina's (Baker) assignment of shots, how it is addressed by the other characters, the surroundings around him that all describe it as a "wild" African, and ask yourself if Alwina has any worn agencies throughout the movie. I do not want to ruin anything but in the end pay attention very carefully, the dichotomy between "eastern" and "western" culture is to say the offensive is less, like dictionally thankfully disovowed these days. The French have a checkpoint as an imperial force in all of the show areas (see Les Meurent Aussi-1953), and pay attention to where European travelers are visiting while in Africa, and what is reflected on their attitude towards the "other". I'm giving this movie a 7 because I'm a cookie for Baker, much of what he did in his professional career, such as Princes Tam Tam, that's regressive is certainly covered by his effort towards integration, his work as a Spying freaking (I'm gushing, sorry.) However the movie for me is fascinating because of its performance, besides being a relic of mentality.
