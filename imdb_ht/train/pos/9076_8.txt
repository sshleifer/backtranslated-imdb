This would be one of the funniest television sitcoms from the United States since the break in "Everyone Loves Raymond". Warburton is still hilarious, and in this completes the rest of the cast of ensembles of perfection. David Spade continues to touch my humorous bone intensity with his quite unique delivery through his line. After ravaging the British series, "Coupling" I can see from just where the creators of the "Settlement of Engagement" got their original ideas, but not as a "brickbat" - the absolutely brilliant dialogue with the road in which it is aimed to put this particular set completely apart. But it takes more than a competent cast to bring success to a new set, particularly in the very difficult field of comedy. Having a part of a professional comedy television team for the best part of 7 years in Australia, I can appreciate particularly, the role of director and talented and creative director of the camera crew. One of the few complaints I have and the series is very obviously "in box" laughing. Surely a live audience could be used in the shooting of the series.
