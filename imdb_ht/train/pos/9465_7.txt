Steve Carell once again starred in a romantic film on choices, family and pressure. By judging about the plot and art covered in the movie I was hoping a flat-out comedy, lots of laughs and unrealistic elements, but I guess I was wrong. Make sure the movie was some comedy, but it felt more of a light drama with me and Steve Carell once again gave a great performance. The film itself really tackles true observations and that was a strong element I found. But the finish felt a bit running and predictable. Through-out, the cinematography was great, the act was great and the message it delivered was obvious but still very important. Though, he was down to the old, flat and predictable finish. I would rule if different choices were made at the end of the movie (perhaps for the bad, even) movie that would get better advertisements. Still a fun movie.
