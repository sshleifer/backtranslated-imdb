This is a brilliant political satire. Do not ask why it was largely ignored in the US: it exposed our mortal foreign policy to what it really is. <br /> Another good movie from this era, rendering, was also totally dismissed simply because it showed, accurately, that the U.S. is a bent war machine on tortured, killed, and maiming maiming in his quest to dominate the total world. <br /> A clever scheme, good acting, some great stars (John Cusack, Ben Kingsley, Marisa Tomei anyone?) And some scenes of hilarity should make this movie a hit. Unfortunately, Americans do not like to hear the truth about themselves, especially when they are accomplices of mass murder.
