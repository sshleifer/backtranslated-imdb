I can not add a lot of terrible to the positive comments already about here - great acting, writing swings, multi-faceted characters, a great anti-hero of Tony, great comment on American Millennial Life. The integral use of psychiatrists that is related to Tony's problems is especially fresh and funny. Several other characters add a lot in depth - Hesh's interesting story as a outsider muscling, the vicious Ralphie's total, double Chris's desire to life, and so on. <br /> I have searched some of the critics however, specifically, it 'glorifies Italian / American belittles' one. Most of the writers and the Italian-American actors, they would attack themselves? There are several positive Italian-American characters - Artie Bucco chef, Dr. Melfi and his family and Cusamanos door to the next Sopranos. In fact, formerly Dr Melfi's husband-husband, who was only a minority of Italian Americans, had ever had mobile connections (certainly less than African Americans' involvement in crime, dare to say it. In both cases poverty and lack of opportunity are the major causes). Most of the characters do not really choose the life they have; family backgrounds or circumstances largely the corners of it. Outsiders (even in Italian stocks) who try to integrate into it usually satisfy distressed finish - Matthew and his friends in season 2, for example. If you criticize this show, I suppose Frasier made you want a psychiatrist, or Will & Grace want you to go homosexual? Needless to say, will you not listen to rap music that discusses gangs or r'n'b discussing promiscuity, or rock music that discuss drugs (or any other combination)? People are not as stupid as some of us make out .... <br /> <br /> Not everything is perfect however. A lot of characters have only appeared once, when not every logic should be seen or at least mentioned in previous episodes - Tracee dancer, Ally Meadow's friend, Junior's uncle's girlfriend (supposedly for 20 years until the split season 1).
