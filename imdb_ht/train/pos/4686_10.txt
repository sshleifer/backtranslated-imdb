This is by far my favorite movie of all time. This is especially because he does not have to worry about some very politically correct topics (such as spitting and submissiveness) that other mainstream films are just too shy to touch. There is nothing that seems to be off-limits in this movie as the director frees to develop the story without any concern to possibly give the viewer's officer. However, I do not think anything was done here purely for shock or intentionally offending anyone. Sean Young turns into an excellent and courageous performance. Most established main actresses would not take on this role or would require some major script changes before they accepted it. Other cast members also do a good job. <br /> Have you noticed that this movie has not appeared on a paycheck since a short mandate runs one year after it hits theaters? Have you ever wondered why? The obvious reason is that it just does not fit today's political atmosphere. It seems quite ironic for me that some premium channels now carry softcore pornography (which is getting closer and closer to hardcore porn), but will not bring a mainstream movie like "Love Crime". Unfortunately, though this film is only 11 years old, it could not have been done today
