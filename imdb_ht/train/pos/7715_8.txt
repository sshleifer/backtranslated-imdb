First, consider that this film is almost fifty years old! But he still stands as one of the great films ever. I wonder how much of cellulose production today is still talking about in 2050? The story is simple, but solid enough and the effects are nothing short of the phenomenon for the day. I can always remember the first time I watched this as a kid, when the monster entered the field strength to protect the ship, and you got to see its plans for the first (and only) time. I was terrified in fear, I can tell you. Looking dated today, but still more than effective enough. <br /> The scene with the tiger shows the age now. You can see the description where the tiger was embraced in the shots and Altaira, but they are just just visible. <br /> However, the effect of how the animal dissolves its way through the Krell doors is beautiful to do. / <br /> It's also amazing to see Leslie Nielsen (best remembered for the plane and nude gun movies) as a young man, but still mature. It was 30 when this movie came out! Almost 80 now! <br /> All in all a good movie that is sure to continue being a favorite for years to come. Timeless.
