I'm glad someone made a movie about how difficult it would be for your heart for a second. Or third. This movie is exactly what it promises to be - beautiful, fun and it gives you this sweet feeling in your heart when it ends. The plot might not be very inventive, but there are millions of ways to tell the story and not being all used again. The cast is chosen perfectly although Scott Wolf does not look like a father in an eight year old by even having a lawsuit. So the sparks are all over the right place, casting support is lovably supported and although you might probably predict the movie all you would not want to change the channel. It is just the right sort of entertainment for a Sunday evening.
