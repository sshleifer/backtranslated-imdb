I can not fully understand why any of the "Revisors" gave this documentary "0" other than for political reasons. No, the film did not investigate both the "parties" of the story, but then surely one movie in favor of Chavez against the tides of propaganda against him should be seen as an attempt to swing out the narrative General (specifically provided A. The history of CIA involvement in Latin America encroaching civilian aggression - Google National security archives and B. Coverage in this country and elsewhere in the fierce false scenes of Chavez supporters who shot opponents non-existent). What is most surprising about this film is the fact that the movie makers lived in the presidential palace all the way though the coup - surely a first of the documentaries make - image of a coup from both sides!
