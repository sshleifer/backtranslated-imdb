In any number of films, you can find Nicholas Cage as a strong, heroic hero, Dennis Hopper as a homicide maniac, Lara Flynn Boyle as a vampire / tramp, and the end, plain J.T. Walsh as the heavy. These are the kind of roles that four can play in their sleep, and they often do enough to see them play again on the border. What a relief, therefore, John Dahl, a master of finding a lot of attitudes from a little action, directs this nuanced nuance. Hopper manages to keep from going to the top, cages show a little more profound than its hero-normal action action, Boyle is not hot, innocent, and quick turn, and one gets a sense of iron doing in the soul which is central to his character, Wayne. Dahl's direction provides a sense of vacancy in the Sky Sky country where the story takes place while being intimate enough to show how a fronts frame can indicate a radical change in the store plot. Twisting them are top-notch, and one of the other great torsion of this film is that some of the characters supported actually act as if they have brain. It is not often that minor characters like deputy sheriff have more brain than their headlining superiors. But with a clever director such as Dahl, you should not be surprised by the intelligence of anything connected with this movie. An excellent movie.
