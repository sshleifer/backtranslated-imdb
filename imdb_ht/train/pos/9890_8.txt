Unfortunately, this movie has never made it to DVD. I saw it when it was first released in theaters in 1983, and then again when the VHS was released in 1992. When I first saw a VHS copy of a flea market, I immediately bought it. I was not disappointed. First, the obvious: Claudia Ohana is beautiful and happy to see. But then, the movie takes you to a real world where you have to think about your value and decide what is really important to you. The film is about many things. It is about how the World Bank and large corporations exploit and enslave developed countries and rapid capitalists are forced into a debt that they can never repay. It's about how our economic system exhausts us by force us into debt and credit cards, mortgages, and car payments. It is about trying to save an innocent that maybe we never really had and maybe we can not really save. It is about good and evil and how difficult it is sometimes to say one to the other. It raises many questions, but does not give answers. I think sometimes this is a good thing. For this reason, this is a movie really worth saving and seeing.
