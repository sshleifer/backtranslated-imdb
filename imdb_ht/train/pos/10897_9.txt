What would you expect from a movie titled 'Christmas Survival' and presented as 'festive fun', something like Ghandi or English patient? There are many things I like about this movie, it's funny, it is very well thrown and it is superbly written. I came to the movie as a fan Kaplan / Elfort but it was dubious when I read the plot, it sounds ridiculous. But the movie does not come across as Affleck (like Drew Latham) plays its part perfectly, a minute of an adult-like child, next to a mature man who has achieved everything in life apart from what he really is want. In reality we see Latham grow in this movie, when he encountered the issues of what he enjoys and realizes that their lives are not so good, he sees that his very own is not so bad. The film is less weak or dude scene than many other cats I've seen. Comedy is so harder than any other type of drama, it either works or not and very few comedy writers find it correct every time.I particularly liked the drama scene, where the family takes in reading party written by Latham. The fun is in the reaction of Tom Valco (James Gandolfini) and the comments of Brian Valco (Josh Zuckerman). It is the dilemma of the vicious Tom Valco who has bite his tongue, wearing funny hat or Christmas tree singing in order to earn the price money that keeps the movie moving along well. The daughter of Alicia (Christina Applegate) in the story carries a delightful romantic angle, and why not in a Christmas movie? Of course its corneas and parrots; It is rich and beautiful, it's beautiful and salt, and so inevitably it and Afflect finishes falling off together in the snow and find themselves face to face. Great! One thing I would like to have used more in festive music boosts the atmosphere but I can not really complain. I got what I wanted.
