OK, so the music pieces were poorly written and generally wrong sung (though Walken and Marner, particularly Walken, sounded pretty good). So they broke the fourth wall in the end by the king and his master sang about the "battle" with the ogre, and praised the efforts of the Boots chariot when not right should not have even known about it. /> <br /> Who cares? It's Christopher Freakin 'Walken, making a movie based on a fairy tale, and singing and dancing. His current style fits the role very well as devious, jealous carriages that seem to get his master in deeper and deeper issues, but in fact there is a plan he thought about seven or eight moves in advance. But if you've ever seen Walken in any of his cruelty roles, * you * know the bitterness of the dirt bit hard at the end when Walken got it into his trap. <br /> A fun movie, with a must-see for anyone enjoying the unique style of Christopher Walken.
