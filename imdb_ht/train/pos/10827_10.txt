Still crazy was compared to Spinal Tap since both is comedy on washing-up R & R groups. Actually, here the similarity is over because still crazy is much better writing and acting out, whereas script script scanners deteriorate from the entertaining struggle first 10 mins in a drivel that makes Beavis and Butthead appear sophisticated in comparison. Still crazy is the favorable formality of the characters and the high quality unexpectedly of some music numbers so I managed to offset a predictive awards in the movie. Those who hope to have an attempt on European satire attempts should be disappointed by the light-hearted nature of the movie, but I would take a self-made ironic success in still crazy about a shot but shot, but failed in satire that is Spinal Tap .
