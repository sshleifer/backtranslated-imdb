I was disappointed, if not surprising, in the lack of appreciation of this film received. Again, Billy Zane proves she is more than just a lovely Hollywood boy in a silent performance that combines spastic slapstick and understated phero. Calling this silent film is incorrect, as there is a lot of music and sound. It has a manic speed and is all the jumping rod that Ed Wood is finally starting to be appreciated for. Look at the list, and realize that everyone shines. No one has just shown their faces. I believe they are all in the movie to show their appreciation to Wood, and make a great, physical kind of acting not many days. <br /> But today, reviewing trying to guess what will become a hit more than to show any kind of aesthetics appreciation for a movie. And IWUETDID has no target audience decayable. He did mostly out of love for Wood's script. Even after her death, the trendy social parody faced her another serious blow, and privately the world of a classic minor. This is a very fun and a truly experimental film that really deserves to live, at least on DVD.
