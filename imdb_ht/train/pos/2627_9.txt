Finally, Timon and Pumbaa in their own movie ... <br /> <br /> 'The Lion King 1 1/2: Hakuna Matata' is a new ireverance to take on a classic story. Which classic story do you ask? Why, the 'king lion' of course! <br /> <br /> Yes, if there's one thing that Disney is never short, it's narcissistic. <br /> But this does not mean that this is not a good movie. It's basically the events of the 'Lion King' as they say from Timon and Pumbaa's perspective. And that's because of this that you'll have to know the story of the 'Lion King' by heart to see where they are coming from .. Anyway, at a level I watched this and thinks "Oh my god is so lame ... "and on another level I had a ball. Many of the humor is predictable - I mean, when Pumbaa makes up two beds, one big for herself and a little for Timon, the first of all we know that Timon will take the big one. But that does not stop it from being hilarious, which, IMO, is 'Hakuna Matata' in a nutshell. It's not what happened, it's how. <br /> <br /> With a note of warning: there are also some fart jokes. Seriously, did you expect anything else in a movie where Pumbaa takes center stage? But as jokes fart away, these are mostly good, and should satisfy even the most particular connoisseur. Visiting the return voice is great. I'm quite surprised that some of the actors wanted to return, which and most of them only have two or three lines (if they're lucky). Whoopi Goldberg is particularly welcome. <br /> <br /> The music is also great. From 'Digga Tunnah' at the start of 'That's All I Need', an adaptation of 'Warthog Rhapsody' (a song that was cut out of the 'Lion King' and it is frankly enhanced by this incarnation), music let me and nothing to complain about. <br /> In the end, Timon and Pumbaa are awesome characters, and while it can be argued that 'Hakuna Matata' is simply an excuse to see them in various fun and associate compromising situations then so let's li. It's rare to find characters that you just want to spend time with. <br /> Do I start sounding crap? Either way, the 'Lion King 1 1/2' is great if you saw the 'Lion King' far too many times. Especially if you are now thinking "not be funny, there's no such thing as seeing the 'king lion' too many times!"
