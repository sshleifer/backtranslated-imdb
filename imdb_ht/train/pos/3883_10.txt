Until I saw this special on HBO, I never heard of Eddie Izzard. I'm sure I'm happy now! It's one of the funniest comedy I've ever seen! Rarely has a comedy bathing herself so completely in her craft then Eddie. I could not stop laughing for the entire show. If you like to laugh you will see this special!
