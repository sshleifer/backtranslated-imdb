I saw this great age when I was younger and could never remember the title, until one day I was scrolling through John Candy's movie on IMDb and noticed an entry called "Once upon a crime. .. ". Something rang a bell and I clicked on it, and after summarizing the plot it brought back a lot of memory. <br /> I found it was very well despite the fact that it is not by any means a "big" comedy. It is, however, rather enjoyable and is a good riff on a Hitchcock formula of identity errors and emotions worldwide. The film has a great cast of characters, among them an American couple who found a dog's dog while vacationing in Europe and decided to return it to her for a reward - only to get his dead body on arrival. From the plot has become crazier and sillier and go to the run after the police think of their killer. <br /> <br /> The kind of a mix between "It's a mad mad Mad World" with a lighter feature Hitchcock, this led by Eugene Levy and she managed to find some of her good friends - like John Candy - to the star of it. The film is mostly engaged due to its cast, and the finish has a comic twisting comic that is not totally unpredictable but also is unexpected.
