Before losing everything was shown on TV was predictable. You can predict who will die or who will find something, but in Objects you could predict NO. Everything was so surprisingly stunning and it really was a mystery not because it was very secret but because there was nothing like it before everything was so great. I literally became addicted to her. LOST is a classic work of art. It gives you something to look forward to every week. It is engineering. The surrounding is sparkling it is calm and warm to the beach and so frightening in the jungle. Characters are a work of engineering each one of them especially those already on the island. The Castaways are so dramatic again we can never predict their deaths because they have many more to do and more to say and have secrets affecting the other cast dead.
