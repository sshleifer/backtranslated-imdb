FREDDY has gone out into funny comics, in this 6th installment of the nightmare series. <br /> It was 2 years, quite actually 11 since this movie took place in 2001.And FREDDY killed every last kid on Elm street except one, John Doe (Jacobb from Part 5, even when filming in giving on hint that he is), in which he used to bring more kids to come to Elm Street .Not just FREDDY gets his will, but he also gets his daughter back to Street Elm. When he finds that passing, he and the other children decided to kill FREDDY once for all.We also get to see some FREDDY's strange backgrounds. Rachel Talalay, who was counting in the Nightmare series for a long time by now.Happy men hate this movie, but I loved it. He tried to carry out what FREDDY was do with his wisecrackes ... comedy and make the series more funny than scary .So this movie is really a painful Comdey talk. It's not the fault of the series, part 2 still holds it. <br /> <br />
