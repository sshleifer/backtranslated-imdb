The story-line was rather interesting, but the characters were rather flat and at times too extreme of thinking / behavior. More extreme than necessary. Also, I think something went wrong in the casting. Jan Turtorro does not really satisfy me playing a semi-autistic player, not speaking about the Italian player. Motifs did not much describe either. <br /> <br />
