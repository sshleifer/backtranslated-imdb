The film starts out very slowly, with the shape of Wallace Napalm, an assistant at a drop-off photo-service station. His wife was limited to her home with an ankle bracelet as a result of a firefighting sentence. Wallace is a member of the voluntary fire department, and he's caught fire from seriously. As we look to Wallace's wallet rather life, suddenly there is something new and jarring: a carnival is coming to town. One of its stars is Wallace's Wilder Napalm. It's a clown, but it has a special talent. So Wallace. They are both pyrokineticists or "pyrotechnics," those who can begin fire in mental energy. Wallace keeps his power secret; Wilder lets his friends know what he can do. <br /> <br /> Spoiler: Some of the differences go back to a child incident where they inadvertently caused a vagrant death. Wallace holds back from using his power; Wilder wants to go public on national television. <br /> <br /> Complain the problem, Wilder wants Wallace's wife, whom they both date dated earlier. It becomes a bone of contention, and becomes one of the reasons why the brothers finally have a literal firefighter. <br /> <br /> The movie is fun but not laugh-out-loud funny. I think that enough of it has a copy of my library. It's a good movie offbeat.
