Really, I love it. The first was good, the story fit where both the remaining series left, and here's my favorite part. Mary and Valerie are not bitter! They are not like others who become synonymous with a certain series and then refuse to talk about it, or to make possible meetings (An example first is Susan Dey, "The Patridge Family"). In fact, Valerie said she should be thrilled to make another film, and then Mary says the same thing later, so I should be on the look for another ... but if that does not work well out , then they can re-run this one.
