SPOILERS <br /> <br /> Tom and Jerry are a classic cartoon, with an impeccable idea, and almost every single short is a gem. While I must say that this is definitely an inferior short compared to other classic Tom and Jerry shorts, no way you can hate this cartoon. Sure, it is understood to say that this is one of the worst of the first episodes of Tom and Jerry, and I can say that I agree, but the reality of the problem is that all Tom and Jerry episodes are great, but some are just better than others. Well, this would fit into "others." <br /> Here is the plot of Fraidy Cat. Tom is listening to an old scary radio broadcast, and it's easy to scare. Jerry observes how scary it is, and try to make him frighten even more than he is already. He creates fear dilemmas for Tom, and Tom becomes frightened from his blood, and his life. Jerry then puts a leaf on a vacuum cleaner and controls it, so make it look like the vacuum is a ghost. Tom found that Jerry did everything, and chases him. Tom then accidentally bites the maid's home. However, by the end of Jerry's end, the one becomes frightened after seeing his reflection in a cup of flour. <br /> Overall, this is far from best Tom and Jerry short out there, but this is always a fun and fun piece of time. It made me want that there were more designs like this. The slapstick and gag of this make Tom and Jerry famous are as good as ever in this short, but it felt like something that was missing in this. It felt slower than most Tom and Jerry shorts. Anyway, this is a good short not quite live up to some Tom and Jerry cartoons, but it's always nice. <br /> 7/10
