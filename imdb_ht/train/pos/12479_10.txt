What are the chances of a mermaid helium balloon traveling from Yuba City, Ca (on Nov 8th, 1993) and landing 4 days later, (on Nov. 12) in MERMAID, Prince Edward Island, Canada. (Approximately 4000 miles). This is a great movie. It is based on a true story. This film helps not only children to deal with loss, but older ones as well. Hope everyone will enjoy it !!! Rhonda
