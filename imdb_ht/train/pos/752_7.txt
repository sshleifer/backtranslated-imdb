Four young girls in a suburb of Los Angeles get into all kinds of troubles: parties, drugs, cops, parenting mixed-up, older boyfriends. Jodie Foster, the mother of the mother of the pack, tries to keep everyone together as a "family" (like the family unit she never had), and the things that she believes about the film is that she can not. Slowly, everyone is growing and going. PRICE is precise, though inspected, is unfortunately prevented. Did you really need a long sequence with Scott Baio to extinguish a car full of thugs on his skateboard? Or another sequence again - also with Baio - where Foster has a strange soliloquy about "pain in illusion". Some of the dialogue in fact are downright butcher, and I did not much care for a late modification of the movie that is clumsy segred from a death at a marriage. But these are nitpicks in what basically a very tender story about the loss of a tight bond. And Jodie's figure ends up speaking merchants. If the viewers are strangled at the end, the film has touched that. It does not hang for tears or ask for sympathy. It shows us an example of friendship and hope we understand. *** from ****
