This has to be one of the best, if not the best movie I've seen for a very long, very long time. There was enough action to satisfy a fan, and yet the draw was very good. I really enjoyed the movie, and I was just starting out. <br /> <br /> Added blood and gore to the, but it brought the realistic nature of what's happening in front of the movie, and even had a jerker that ended up for many people I should think. <br /> It's a must look for anyone. Have seen many reviews, slating the movie, but to be fair, most films that get bad reviews, turn out to be some of the best. This proves it once again. <br /> Rent this movie, buy this movie, just go out and watch this movie. You will not be disappointed.
