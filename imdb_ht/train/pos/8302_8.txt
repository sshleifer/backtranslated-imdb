Explosive weapons, exploding buildings, crashing machines, and that's just the first ten minutes. <br /> This action-packed movie that involves a rogue former CIA mercenary who can not seem to die no matter how often he shot (hence the title) is very decent. <br /> <br /> Uphill and toothy Gary Busey, usually cast as a villain in these kind of flick, has its usual crazy charm but it is a bit more submissive: after all it has brought the whole show. That does not mean there is a lot of terrific support roles including William Smith, Luke Askew, Mills Watson, R.G. Armstrong, Henry Silva, Lincoln Kirkpatrick, Thalmus Rasulala, and several other "forgotten" character actors. <br /> <br /> There are enough sequence of smaller stocks to keep the whole story: Busey has released a group of "kidnapped" American military elites and returns a high-tech "supertank" (a normal tank with a cheesy add-on stick to head ) back to the United States. <br /> <br /> But America deserves this car to kill any more than the bad guys? This question asks, of course, as in any filming on the CIA ... but without getting preachy.
