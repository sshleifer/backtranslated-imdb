This movie is a wonderful movie based on the life of a man named Gray Owl in 1930 Canada. I found it to be as fixed and sincere as 'Rudy' and 'Awakenings'. She chooses to wait in Gray Gray's life and follow her in the most horrific and influential period. The film is about an American trapper campaign that finds itself promoting the Beaver combat over-stroke. It also predicts decrease in natural and overuse land resources. This is an outrageous concept in the 1930s and surprisingly well-received. He becomes a well-known speaker and masters are ready to listen. Casting Pierce Brosnan looks rather odd, but not outrageous. Anyone who wants to argue that point must first watch the movie to understand. Brosnan gives a wonderful performance like Annie Galipeau. Galipeau is a strong actress with the Brosnan side site that is fresher natural compared with the forced figures in the past Bond movie. I would recommend this movie to anyone interested in good drama, beautiful scenery, or environmental effects. It is a movie for families as well, however children under 10 (dependent on maturity) would have problems after the scheme.
