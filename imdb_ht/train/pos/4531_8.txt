This is a keyboard movie featuring love of the ages. The film consists of Keaton looking for a lady love in the stone age, in ancient Rome and in the present (1920s). In all three cases, he is the usual Wimpy Buster and he fights against Wallace Beery for his lady love. In the three periods of time, I think I liked the single best Roman though I admitted it might also be the cheesiest. I actually liked the scenes with the lion that was obviously a guy in a suit as well as the weird tram race in the snow - but that I really enjoyed the most was seeing all Keaton's amazing acrobatics. However, all three periods of time were good old fashioned fun with the movie, while not his best, is still an outstanding and enjoyable movie. Look at that!
