Other than the wooden delivery Susan Hayward throughout this film she was as good as any biblical movie made. Henry King manages this film with respect to a season of all the small scenes, and Peck is, as always, imperfect. Reasons to remember Alfred Newman sounds the note, and the third vibrant vibrant is unforgettable even after many years. The scene with Goliath is a bit on the hokey side, but not all wrong doing for the era in which this film was made. This goes well with the youngest Bibles spellings of the day, "Song of Rit" and "Esther and the King." It is worth seeing, and Raymond Massy is excellent as Nathan's prophet. The film is rounded out of justice James Robertson Justice as Abishai and Jayne Meadows as Michol, David's first wife.
