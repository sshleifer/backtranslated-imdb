A lovely store in London swept his feet by a millionaire plantation owner and soon found himself married and living with him in his Villa in British Ceylon. Although based on the book by Robert Standish, this initiation is very reminiscent of the "Rebecca" Hitchock, with leading lady Elizabeth Taylor bursting with the chief imposed by the mansion staff and (almost immediately) her own husband, which is still under the thumb-but-dominant father's thumb. Taylor, a last minute substitute for Vivien Leigh ill, looks creamy-smooth in her high fashion wardrobe, and her performance is loud; However, once Peter Finch's husband began to drink heavy and barking the order of it, one might think his dedication rather masochistic (this felt inferior to the finish as well). Still, the film offers a lot of soap for soap soap: romantic drama, a bit of travel, dance interpretation, demonstrating elephants, and an epidemic perfectly timed to cholera! *** from ****
