The story deals on Jet Li who has to fight old <br /> <br /> friends. But there is a problem, friends are superfighters. The movie is full of blood, super action and the best waterfalls forever. And Lau Ching-Wan is a great co-actor. Naturally the movie has typical HK-Fun.But I love it! In Germany "Black Mask" is uncut.
