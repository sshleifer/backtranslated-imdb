And somebody is me. And not only me, as I can see here at IMDb or when you leave the theater. Why did the people love it? Obviously, everyone knows zombies by now (at least the horror fans by heart and the others through the "Dawn of the Dead" or Resident movies wrong etc.) <br /> Or at least thought they knew all Things about zombies ... that is until this movie came together and you will see zombies in a new light (maybe). This is not a horror movie, although it has some violent scenes, but rather a comedy. A satir to be precise, and it never runs out of steam! That's why I rated it so high.Gather her wise wisdom in the incredible act is great and the script has no (obvious) mistakes. Well the contrary: It's a gem and if you're just a little interested in zombie you should see it! And even if you're flu, watch it! Because it's a great (comedy) movie!
