A loyal man in life alone after 45 years of marriage. It also has to solve the problem of the family moth cow, Tulip, which refuses to allow himself to be milk. Until, that's what, he visualized his wife who was one of those who had tulip milk. Tulip is based on a real story told by Griffith's family, in his grandparents' generation. The film is a nostalgic look back in a way of life, one where people still feel some sense of responsibility for each other, putting in the lush green victim (the Australian state, not the era). /> Writer and Griffiths director obviously have more ambitions in both areas, and this multiple 15-minute award-winning award is a fine start to reel it.
