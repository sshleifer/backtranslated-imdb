What is called "Free Call" like? It is simply great and unique experience on making in South Africa and how black people in this country have been repressed by white people. The main character of the story is Donald Woods (Kevin Kline), chief editor of the Daily Dispatch newspaper in South Africa. Woods writes several articles, where he speaks very much about Steve Biko's opinions (Denzel Washington). Soon Woods meets Biko and changed his views on it and also begins to understand what the authorities are doing to black people in South Africa (right from the top, even from the chief of police). When Biko died in police custody, Woods decided he had written books on it and no matter what he was publishing. But the woods must escape from his country to find that books are published and it must also put his family on second place, so worlds can find truth. Attenborough manages to make a good movie about people, and the main message that black and white are the same, causing us all. History leads us to South Africa and this (film) is a great way for the whole world to learn what happened in this country and I'm disappointed that only 3200 people rated this movie. This is the movie from which we all can learn something. Although it is short, this story might not be presented in any way shorter because the director wanted to show us how difficult was Woods to find books published after death in Biko. <br /> <br /> Also, the relationship between Woods and Biko has shown many, just like those families of these people and all the issues they are going through. But sometimes sacrifices must be done (bitten death) so the truth can be reveled (Woods book).
