You will notice by the stars I gave this GREAT movie that 'before you first saw it,' is implied. I've never heard of this movie and it's been going through it just because this week (and last) was a very slow experience (not so great). I'm not sure how this film slipped past me -I love Lucy Liu and Jeremy Northam is great too. Still, he did. This movie is an awesome example of what to do if you do not have a big budget. It was just the right amount of scheme and dialogue to make it very interesting and keep the viewer in the dark; just enough. The movie is all you (the viewer) tries to figure out many torsions and turns cemetery. I would give this movie 10/10, however some of the shots were very fake looking. I do not hold that against this movie too much, but I do not think it deserves a perfect score. Lucy Liu is beautiful and mysterious (as always). I think it is pretty underrated as a serious talent. Nevermind's beauty (which is difficult), it really takes its role seriously and does not rest on its appearance to drive it to sophisticated emotional scenes. And it may look like cold and even if necessary, as well. Jeremy Northam does really well, first, as well as a corporate directive leak, wanting to run in any maze to prove himself. However, as it changes throughout the film, it's like night and day. I know some fans of Clive Owen, Jude Law, or other hopes to become the next James Bond will hated me for this, but Northam would / would be able to fit that bill. It was dodging and cultivating. He had a great bondage and voice. I think it can be too cold if the situation requires it, and rather down-to-earth, as well. <br /> <br /> Great movie and definitely this movie-sheep recommends to see at least once if you like corporate spy movie.
