This will be a bit short. First, do not listen to the critics, as it is not as bad as most say it is !! Sniper uses a classic movie formula, which many postponed immediately as the movie defaulter. While sniper does not reflect 100% of the truth about how our country's military shooter works, it gives those who do not know anything about Professional Shooter a glimpse into the world of the shooter. And yes, the movie has many flaws, but what movie does not? There are many good and good performances performed by Tom Berenger. I told the worst scenes at the start of the film and Billy Zane of the helicopter followed by Zane at the scene of the Bar Marine. The best scene of shooter is with Berenger in the middle of a field with the opposite force sweeping it !! Also there are many good shots in the jungle with some classic shots using the camera as if you are looking through a riflescope. And yes, the shooter engine is 'one shot, one kill'. Judge shooter for yourself !! <br />
