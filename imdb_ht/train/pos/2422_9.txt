Yeah, it's low budget. Yeah, it's one of Candy's best films, but it's probably funky! John Candy was not far too far at his SCTV days in "Going Berserk" and it shows. If you do not crack up when candy trying to help a guy with his grocery while being hands-cuffed in a cowod escape from the process of having sex with his girlfriend and only the separate apartment door (huh?, See the movie !), or the Euguene Levy road (the creator of Kong Fu Yu) talking to her mother on the phone, or just the countless number of facial expression that only candy can save you better to check your heart rate! If you like John Candy at "The Only Lonely" this is not a movie I would advise you to see, but if you enjoy the SCTV days of John Candy, this movie is a must see!
