First and foremost, speaking as no fan of the genre, the "Bourne Ultimatum" is a film, enchanting, superb movie action. Secondly, it's a funny malarike in cartoonish super-hero stuff. <br /> Third, the movie brings a complex, crucial point, about crime-fighter turns into criminal ones. There are no references made to Abu Ghraib or executive branch of the Branch on Constitutional Rights, there is nothing needed. <br /> So, the last of the series "Bourne", in the hands of Paul Greengrass (in 2004 "Bourne Supremacy" and "United 93" last year), is a significant success, possibly held back, but not actually diminished by the inevitable excesses of the genre. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> There is no relentless force, globe-trotting, totally thrilling action. There are no bonds, no variation in the rhythm and pull of the movie, and yet it never becomes monotonous and tiring the way some family music videos do after just a couple of minutes. <br /> <br /> Oliver Wood's in-the-movie cinema you face to do in Tony Gilroy's movies from Robert Ludlum's novel 1990 (non-stacked against the "Identity Bourne," written a decade earlier ). Matt Damon is once again inevitable, irreplaceable Bourne, mortal of silver CIA whimsical, this time taken over the whole agency in search of his identity, his past, and the mysterious agency program that has turned him into a car killed. Nothing like Edward Gurrow's slowly heroic, David Strathairn still-wonderful is the embarrassing official official, stacked against Bourne in trying to hide some illegal "caught-no" prisoners and brutal procedures. /> Joan Allen plays what appears to be the good cop against the Bad One Strathairn. And, Julia Stiles as the agent once again came to Bourne's help; a combination of Greengrass 'and Stiles' direction acts in a surprising impact by a particularly silent character, its lack of communication and empty expressions more intriguing than a thousand in dialogue. So good is the "Bourne Ultimatum" that it gets away with one old one-man-versus-the-world bit, this time stretches beyond ridiculous, as Bourne defies constraints in geography, time, gravity ... and physics in general. (Can you fly backwards with a car from the top of a building? Why not - it looks great.) <br /> All this "real world" magic - leaked from land to country in seconds , occur in some places where exactly, when, and how need - outdoes special-effects and superhero design drawings. And yet, only a clueless pedal would allow "reality" to interfere with the fun-based ecstasy of the Bourne Fantasy.
