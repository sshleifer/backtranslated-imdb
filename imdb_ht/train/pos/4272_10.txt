This is what I call a big movie. He lived depression skills of fantastic actors with a simple, but human story. There are real characters that can be funny and dramatic. but the main theme is cruel, as live bus drivers and his sons are collecting people's trough (Yugoslavia) on the roads in the Bradford capital. The funny and cruel situations that happen along the way, connect people and pigs to travel together. <br /> <br /> You can see it and you will remember it for life ... it is filled with slavic humor and lifestyle. <br /> <br /> and another reason for its magic: it's hard to find!
