Theodore Rex is probably the biggest cinematic experience ever, and is certainly an important milestone in human culture, civilization and artistic expression !! In this compelling intellectual masterpiece, Jonathan R. Betuel aligns himself with the great film makers of the 20th century, such as Francis Ford Copola, Martin Scorcese, Orson Welles and Roman Polanski. The special effects are nothing less than breathtaking, and doing any work by Spielberg looks at elementary school. At that time liberated, Theodore Rex was such a revolutionary gem that he raised the bar of making the movie movie never anticipated by film makers. The concept of not just a motion picture presents a dinosaur, but adheres to an action packed, detective romantic detective, co-staring a "talk" dinosaur with a modern post such as "Theodore", and an existential police officer changing humanity as we know li. The world can never be the same after experiencing these magnificent beauty. Watching Theodore Rex is very analogous looking at God's face and hears him saying "you are my favorite creation." This is one of the few films that are simply dead for !!!
