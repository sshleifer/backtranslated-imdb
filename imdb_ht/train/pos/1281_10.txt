This movie is great as it's hard to find. The movie hero (and writer and director) is Simon Geist - a man "and an agenda." He created a fake magazine just to have the pig interview in Los Angeles - the actors, the models, the musicians- believe their own defenses are not smell. With intelligent dialogue, Zucovic succeeds in doing so. Sure, the budget for this movie was probably what he paid for a used car, but this movie is so solid and well written that it works very well. Anyone who can reenact 'Edward' in 'reflection of a silver trashbin at a local local caf√© should be nominated for some kind of awards. Give this movie a chance and listen to what it says ... because of the same machine since 1986 ... the so-called 'car.' Bravo, Zucovic, bravo!
