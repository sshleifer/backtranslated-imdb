One of my favorite films for a number of years was "Last Hero's Action"; Unfortunately, Arnold Schwarznegger decided to have fun not becoming a corrupt scumbag politician; So now I can not carry any movie she might have had a hand in. The Adventures of Jake fast actually games and some similar terms to the latest in heroes; So I was happy to find it on DVD, so I could watch these terms being played out well. <br /> Although the "draw-in-sketch" involving white slavery during an African civil war, this is not a movie action. The plot that "draw-in-a-the-plot" is in, is actually about a matter that the movie has no intention to solve: Is Jake a real person speeding that will help the heroine save his sister from the white trader -sklav; or is it actually a fictional character (which means that the heroine was somehow enters the universe that really only exists in a series of populas)? I suggest that this is not all that's clearly defined in the movie, and that Wayne Crawford and Andrew Lane are perfectly aware of this. The film thus becomes a presentation of what audiences may want to come from as a fictional "adventure-story" universe. This is actually a rich theme, the potential potential of being lightened by the film's sensational and stunning mood. <br /> <br /> There are weaknesses in the movie - especially in cinematography, making the movie look like a TV show. And the rhythm makes Sag on occasion. <br /> But I really love these characters, and I enjoy the adventure they live, however unusual. And I just get fascinated by the idea that this adventure is actually taking place in a novel. <br /> <br /> Hold up under multiple view -m shows good!
