The film starts out with a bunch of dying Dead Peeps market sit in individual cells, waiting for inevitable meetings and death represented by the electric chair. Then, our "hero", who is called Tenshu, is taken to the chair, he is zapped, and then .... he still "alive". AHA! It was given a choice by some military gray guys who looked really cool: either we got you until we did if you actually died or you can walk through that door and take whatever destiny could lie in front of you. say yes to option 2, and then the actual story begins. <br /> It wakes up in a different sort of cell (very high tech and very large), where it finds another cell-mate, who also managed to survive the boogie-electric electric.A voice of the speakers say that they are free to do whatever they want, as long as things happen in this room. Something a little suspicious, but the guys accept: What else can they be able to awaken an interior incentive to kill of them. Basically the unknown scientists in the background of the p ** s are cut until they decide that they should kill each other.Well it strange? Indeed, but there is a bigger goal in all of these things. That party should not be revealed, and so it must remain unrevealed. <br /> But do not be afraid, it is the unknown that attracts the viewer to look more in this pseudo-action movie, before it has an entirely different approach to the question: How long can you stand with a man in a SOB and would you kill him for freedom? <br /> The first hour is basically trying to wake your interest, it sneaks up without you actually knowing it. Then it gets a roller coaster ride with WILD matrix-like action-battling scene with a touch of individually honoring the comic book from which the movie is based. The movie is indeed very special, so special that normal movies will not see it under normal circumstances. However, the story is fascinating, the music is fantastic, and the actors do their bit (some more than others) make the movie really unique. <br /> <br /> If you should be so lucky that your movie or video store has it, watch it, and enjoy the fact that not everybody is trying to make mainstream movies to earn huge cash clips. <br /> <br />
