HUSBANDS is a remake of the BRIDELESS GROOM classic Shemp. The new film cooking scene at the beginning of the movie is great. Stooges are always funny when they cook. However after the first few minutes of cooking feet, we cut off the original footage of BRIDELESS GROOM. Something I noticed about 1953 these 1956 remarks are that they make fit with the new story. They make a shot if the old story line does not match. <br /> <br /> HUSBANDS warns to have a new end, but I will not give it to those who want to be amazed. > <br /> **** from 4 stars.
