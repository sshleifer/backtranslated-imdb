With this movie, it's all about style, atmosphere, and acting. True, I did not believe all the developments drawn, but it did not matter - the terrific act, the unexpected scheme twists, and the wonderful atmosphere sucked me right in, and brought me together for the ride and I had a good time. Kenneth Branagh is not only a great actor but a master of accent, and he proves it once again with an accusation of Georgia's accusations. It was surrounded by many talent in supporting roles (Robert Downey, Jr., Embeth Davidtz from Lis Schindler and Fallen, Tom Berenger, Daryl Hannah, and Robert Duvall) that I simply blown. I recently bought a copy of this movie, and I never looked down on it. Simply one of the best stairs of the year. If you've ignored this movie (and your chance), then I suggest you check it out.
