Almost every review of this movie I would see was pretty bad. It's not very bad, it's actually pretty good, but not great. The character Judy Garland could have gotten annoying, but he did not allow it. Somewhere along the line, I became a fan of brooding, overbearing, overacting Van Heflin, at least in the early 40's. Judy's song is great, but the movie missed a great chance not to show more of their relationships. I gave it a 7.
