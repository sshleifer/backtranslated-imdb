Many of the classic films in the late 60s have not doubled their ability to disrupt and confront the audience. "Cold blood" has not lost an ounce of its power. Exceptionally well he did again the viewer's strength thinking. Some have complained not only about the movie, but on Truman Capote's source of "non-fiction novel", which central message is reckless. This may be true, but this is definitely a case where the lack of ambiguity does not detect from the movie at all. It's worthwhile, especially considering the simplistic and manipulative newspaper drama today, seeing a movie and a political voice convincing unafraid to force the audience to consider its views. To be honest, I'm not sure if I agree with the central movie's message, but I admire its audacity however. Even if you do not agree with the anti-capital punishment message, many admire the movie. The act of conduct is terrific. Scott Wilson (still one of the most damaged actors ever) is cooled as a nihilist leader, who uses his charisma to hide his weakness. Robert Blake is also chilling as more submissive to the two and one with a consciousness. Her character obviously has a voice that is right, but it's scary to go against Wilson (there is a good amount of homoerotic subtext on her character's part). The cinematography is terrific, sweet yet fearless and really gives the impression of the viewer watching a documentary. Add another classic note to Quincey Jones, and you have a masterpiece. (9/10)
