I really love Tom Barman's AWTWB. You just need to let it come on you and enjoy it while it's time and you do not expect anything. It's like sitting on a coffee-terrace with a beer, in the summer sun, and watching the people go. It definitely will not keep you thinking afterwards, this is true, but that's not a prerequisite for a good movie. That's just the experience during the movie that's great. <br /> I felt that there was a little bit that could have worked out a little more, but being a lynch fan I did not care that much again :) <br /> <br /> , I * liked the style, or flair of this movie. It's slick, but cool, and the soundtrack is a beauty. Any music-lover gets kicks off from AWTWB, I can assure you. <br /> I'll give it 8 out 10. <br /> <br /> (music-wise 10 out of 10)
