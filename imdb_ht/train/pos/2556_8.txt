And one made for TV movie too, this movie was good. Acting in it and the draw was just so great. That's one of the only movies I've seen that I felt shocked my mind because after seeing it I was scared of Reaper coming to kill me in my computer screen. There were just a few minor things that were wrong with this movie, but it's pretty easy to look. Antonio Sabbato Jr has performed an excellent role in this film alongside Janine Turner and Robert Wagner. This movie just has so much suspense and it made me want more because I never thought a movie low budget television could be so powerful. After watching this I read the movie this movie was based on (four times) and it was too chase was great. If you ever saw this movie coming on TV, I would watch it. The effects of this film have been very well done, I honestly do not know what a live human sleepy would look like but the way the FX team made this movie I was impressed and all it showed is that all these bad ones Doing for TV movies out there and low budget should not be sucking bad. <br /> <br /> Look at it. It's really good, not really, it is!
