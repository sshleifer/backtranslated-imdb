Those of the "Instant Gratification" era of horror movie will no doubt complain about the movie's footsteps and lack of free effect and body count. The fact is, the "Acre is empty" is a good example of a movie for independent films that should be done. <br /> <br /> If you avoid the racks independently because you are tired of bitter teens or twenty somethings getting killed by some back-story baddie could come from the back of a box of Chocula Count, "Acre's empty "is the movie for you. Set in the returnees returning to the rural American dream, "Pour Acre" is the story of a young couple fighting with the disappearance of the six-month-old babies. As the fallover couple fell apart, a major story played out in the background. At night, a dark dark mask is seen in a baked oak bar on the farms and seems to devour anything in its path, leaving no sign that it was ever there. The film is packed with enigmatic visual and visual visuals on what's happening, and ends with a well-executed end that resonates with just enough to leave on the questions validated by the confident writer / director of an intellectual audience. <br /> There seems to be a sub-text regarding the death of the American dream, but I would hardly call the movie a allegory. Riveting, well-acting, and technically crafty, the "Acre is empty" is a fantastic little indie that think horror fans should love.
