<br /> <br /> Films just after the war, this story was made in order to emphasize the Anglo-American relations after the war. He ended up receiving the honor of being Royal Premiere after WWII. <br /> <br /> Structure of the film tangles along the Royal Air Force, Sigmund Freud The Psychology, fathers of fathers in America and various others climbing the long stairs (special effects of childhood) and beyond the gates of heaven without losing any of its integrity. <br /> <br /> Although remarkably absurd, this smart script is driving and dancing the viewer between the sky and the earth with the skill of a mountain village and presenting a good ease of relaxation in the movies since. <br /> You must prepare them for your heart to warm by this sweet, innocent and loving love story. Roger Livesey acts as a man owned by the flying show !!!! <br /> <br /> British Cinema would be crying when he remembers how good he used to be in those early years wars. <br /> <br />
