This was a wonderful movie. How did women try to save their husbands? I thought the performance of the actors was great. I thought about the film for a very long time. I think each student should see this film so they can think about war, relationships, friendship and love. I loved the movie because he said and showed me how strong love can be. I wish I could be as strong as a woman. I really love her because she tells me something about relationship and that's what I like to see in a movie. I think you can compare the movie with Der Untergang, the pianist. If you put these three films together, you have a great eye on what happened during the war. We should remember something like the war forever.
