The amount of time I had in my eyes when watching a movie are some. And there is one time when I really called and that was when I saw this movie. This movie has some clues but I really do not care. I cried as I wrote this and it was quite some time since I saw it. It is perfectly acting and all the production values ​​are good, but what's really important is the simple and wonderful message. We all know it in our hearts, but it is not always easy to remember that the only thing that really matters in life is love in all its forms. Only when we love that we are really alive. I know how sentimental I sound and I promise I do not usually like that. I'm quite a cynical. This movie has brought out strong feelings of both mourning and happiness in passing any other movies and it will probably still be the first movie I recommend for others to see.
