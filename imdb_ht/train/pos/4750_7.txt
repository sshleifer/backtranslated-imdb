In my mind, Vern and Teddy discuss who was hardest, Superman or Mighty Mouse. My friends and I often argue about who would win a fight too. Sometimes we get absurd and compare men like MacGyver and the Terminator or Rambo and Matrix. But now it seems that we discuss guys like Jackie Chan, Bruce Lee and Jet Li. It's a free comparison to see Lee is dead, but it's a pleasure one. But if you go by what we saw in Jet It's Lethal 4 and Dark Mask, you have at least said it would match up well against Chan. In this film it comes across as a martial arts of God. <br /> <br /> Black Mask is about a man who created along with many others, to be supreme car battle. The only goal is to win the wars that others lose. They are irresistible in some ways. Now that is the premise for the movie, but what is done is to set up the stage of amazingly choreographing battles. <br /> <br /> Jet It is a wonder. He can do things with his body that no one should be able to do. And that's what makes him look so fun. <br /> In addition to the martial arts of the movie, Black Mask is strong and humorous and that is due to the chemistry that Jet has with its co-star, the police officer. They are great together. But to be honest. If someone reads this review, they want to know if the movie is kick ass in the action department. And the answer to this is a breathing !!! Many and many of the top gory actions. You will love this movie.
