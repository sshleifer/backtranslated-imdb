This film was first seen while he was drunk in a motel in Canada. While flipping through channels has come across parts of Lube Easy. My friend kept flipping out but I told him to go back. Something about the lube's name just does not sound right. Watching the rest of the film it was pretty humorous. Jotted down a couple of names out of the credit and got home to look at her. Turned out to be the first Chevy Chase movie. I did not remember him in her. Did not remember so much about it, so I rent it and gave it a second veiw. It's very funny and graphical. It's just like Kentucky movie film except not as funny. Love their fingers, easy lube, and I'm f ** party chairman kin. Heating dealer is very cool too. I give it a 6.5 or 7 out of ten
