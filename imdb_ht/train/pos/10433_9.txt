When the train stopped in Vienna, Jesse asked Celine to accompany him to a tour on Vienna. Then the romantic story unfolds. <br /> <br /> At first they were cautious. The Funniest Scenes cost them CDs in music stores. They look at each other, even though their eyes did not contact. After the conversation depth, their relationship came close. Then I saw the most romantic scenes that they claim to call their respective friends. They expressed their deep love for each other completely by word. <br /> <br /> Love is something weird.
