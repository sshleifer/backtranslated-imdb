A few years ago, satellite channels U.K. Gold encourages repeatedly in 'Badly Behavior Men' with the Hype: "Here it is, the original flat-share sitcom!". This was indeed true. 'Man on the House' was also a flat-site sitcom and ran from 1973-76. It was the brainchild of Johnnie Mortimer and Brian Cooke, creator of the popular Papa Siti Father's sitkon. When it ended, they decided they wanted to do something more in harmony with the times. <br /> <br /> In the first episode, Chrissy (Paula Wilcox) and Jo (Sally Thomsett) are their own Myddleton Terrace dish after a wild party when they find a man in their bath. It is Robin Tripp (Richard O'Sullivan), a Southampton cooking student who has no fixed stay. While her clothes dry out, she put on a dress' s dress gown and prepare a meal. They are so impressed by its culinary skills that they invite him to stay. But there must be no naughty business. So, Robin has pretended to be gay ... <br /> <br /> On the BBC-2 'I Love 1973', shown in 2000, Julie Burchill claimed that 'House' showed her a way to his life served. It was not alone. One of the most iconic (for me, anyway) the 'British TV's 70' s image was Sally Thomsett from the London Underground, bringing a parrot, and a 'blind' person making a double take as a pallet under his past. <br /> A man living with two girls was a risky subject for the time, but Mrs.Mary Whitehouse had no need to get warm beneath the necklace, she was innocent, good-natured fun. Mortimer and Cooke scripts have gone as close as they could in the corner without crossing it. <br /> <br /> Richard O'Sullivan has always been playing 'Bingham' at Doctor 'Charge' I.T.V. then began. In fact, the second running of 'Charge' overlaps with the first in 'House'. He was designed to play the sex-crazy Robin. Paulsy Wilcox 'Chrissy' was more streetwise than 'Beryl', her character she played in the 'Lovers', while Sally Thomsett 'Jo' was a blond blond celebrity. As time went on, he became almost like an older brother. <br /> <br /> For many viewers, Brian Murphy and Yootha Joyce stole the show as the war ropers. George has lost interest in sex, but Mildred was not. They went to their own show - aptitude titled 'George & Mildred'. Douglas Fisher late was good value as Robin's friend Robbie Vebbi. He worked so well he did in a regular one. <br /> In one year at its first, there was the inevitable turn-off movie. I'm not a big fan of the movie 'Man on the House' because I think he's stretched to fit the big screen. Most of its characters have never appeared in the series. <br /> <br /> The format was sold in America, where he became the three-run three-run company at Rita's late John and Suzanne Somers. She was far from suggesting the British original, and Somers often see in sexy clothes. <br /> <br /> After six seasons, 'House' ended up with Chrissy married Norman Norman Norman Norman (Norman Eshley). Fans were devastated to see Robin fail to find the girl he liked, but there was some incentive to the fact that he had also landed his own show - 'Robin's Nest'.
