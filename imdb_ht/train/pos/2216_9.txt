Historical drama and coming to great history involving free people in color in the pre-New Orleans civil war. Start to slow down, but pick up steam once you've learned about the main characters and the real action can begin. This is not just a story about the exploitation of black women, because these were free people. They may not have all the rights in white but they certainly had more control over the destiny than the slaves of their ancestors. Young men and women in this story must each make their own choices about how to live their lives, if they are disadvantaged in the system or live up with optimism and contributing to their communities. I enjoyed all of the characters but my favorites were Christophe, Anna Bella, and Marcel.
