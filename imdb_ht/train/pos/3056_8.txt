Was put this on my TIVO for a rainy day due to the throw, some people really hard working in the industry, and when I finally looked I was not disappointed. This film has some Altman-likes (it was mentioned in the end credits as a "thank you" person) using seemingly self-contained behaviors that interrelate as the movie draws to its largest . Macy is clean, clean, and honest as a man who can not seem to escape his "destiny", playing Sutherland and shows as few cases, Nep adds splash to a deliberately tone setting, adding Tracy Ullman, Barbara Bain ( remember the Mission Impossible on TV?), Not the Fixed Jan Ritter Fixed and you have all the ingredients for a good movie. The script is decomposed, the free dialogue in clich√© and thoughtful (especially between Macy and David Dorfman). Stop believing and enjoy, that's really time out.
