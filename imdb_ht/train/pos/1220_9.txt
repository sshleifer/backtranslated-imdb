Origin of the Bears Care & Cousins. If you've seen the original movie you will notice an error. The cousins ​​are raised with the Care Bears, rather than later meetings. However I have no problem with that, prefers to treat these films as separate interpretations. Baby are adorable and fun to watch and play. My favorite is Heart Swift Rabbit. The villain is a superb suicidal shapeshifter. I could empathize with the three kids since I was never good at sports either. Summer Cree is excellent as Christy. The songs are sweet and memorable. If you have an open heart, love the toys or enjoy the original, this should not be missed. 9/10
