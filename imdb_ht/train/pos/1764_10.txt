Steve Carell comes to his own role in his first starting role in the 40th Ancient Virgin, which has only had the support role in the films as Bewitched, Bruce Almighty, Anchorman, and his work on the Daily Show , we've only gotten a taste in the comedy that Carell really does his own. You can say that Will Ferrell influences her "comedy time" but Carell takes her to another level, all she does is innocent, lovable, and hilarious. I would not hesitate to say that Steve Carell is one of the next great comedians in our time. The 40-year-old is two hours of non-stop laughing (or 4 hours if you see it twice as I did), a perfect support cast and drive great audience charm to the entire movie. The script was perfect with lots of great lines that you will want to see the movie again just try to remember them all. The music fit the tone of the big movie, and you can tell the director knew what he was doing. <br /> <br /> Full of jokes, some nude, and a lot of languages, this movie is not for everyone, but if you liked the wedding crashers, you will absolutely love the 40-year-old.
