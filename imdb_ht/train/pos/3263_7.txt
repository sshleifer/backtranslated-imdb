I usually enjoy movies like "The Luck", but I was not quite satisfied with this one for a few reasons. The first half was very well done in general, and Alex Finch died and was reincarnated into a new body (played by Robert Downey Jr.). She met with his wife (Cybill Shepherd) and friend (Ryan O'Neal) and her daughter, who is now growing. The scenes with their meetings again with rediscovering downey that he once had been well done, and there was a good amount of emotion and happiness once Shepherd finally believed he really was her husband reincarnated, but from having the movie gone down. There are several sex related to scenes that turn me completely, especially Downey and Shepherd want to get together again despite the difference in age now. And, however, the movie manages to end the most fulfilling possible way, considering the circumstances of the plot. I was disappointed because I did not expect the movie to become so immoral to the end. There was great potential with this story, and the scene in the sky was well done. There is a good song singing by Peter Cetera and Cher, but finally the movie is not great. For a better, just as movie, try "Heaven Can Wait." Decent, but I really kind of want I did not see it because of the scenes in the second half. <br /> <br /> *** from ****
