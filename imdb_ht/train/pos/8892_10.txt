Great, great, great! That's all I can say about that movie, but IMDB wants at least four lines of text so I'll elaborate. The cast was great (Jerry O'Connel is soooo cute!), The music was great (the sixties had the best music ever, imho), the historic material was interesting, and so was the way they did the actors in the '90s seems like they actually have in the' 60s. And most of all - the stories of the main characters bring tears in my eyes, and that's magnitude of any drama. But in one word: GREAT!
