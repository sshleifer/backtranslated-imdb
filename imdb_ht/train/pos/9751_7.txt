Trying on time, there were different types of movies. These films differ coexisted though each person has something different to offer .... <br /> <br /> This seems obvious at first, but I thought I would point out it during this review because it Looks like some people might have forgotten. This is just a fun movie for Pavarotti fans. That's all it is. It does not claim to be anything else or anything grander. People bother him as something that falls short of a promise they do not see the whole picture literally. After all, Hollywood makes movies all the time that cynical cars for people (The Guardian's Guardian / Whitney Houston are 2 examples of spring in mind.) <br /> First I'd like to address film as a car for Pavarotti. There are things worse in this world - and worst movies. The song is fabulous and the selection of arias is fun. The film begins with Maria Schubert's Ave and then the Matcatta Leoncavallo. Pav sang arias from La Gioconda, Manon Lescaut, and Turandot, but also popular music songs such as "I left my heart in San Francisco" with the song nominated for an Oscar & Golden Globe, "If we were in Love "w / music by John Williams & lyrics by Alan & Marilyn Bergman- All 3 previous Oscar winners. The story is not that bad. It's built for Pavarotti so of course it will not do anything that's deep or universal applicable to average movie viewer. It's a story of a popular opera singer who was traumatized by a bad night of opera years ago. When asked to sing again at the same place, "Met" in NYC, he lost his voice out of fear. Doctor Pamela (or Pah-Mai-lah in Italian :)) played by Kathryn Harrold- give him a healing shot of his psychosomatic reaction. She offered her the chance to have a fling with her and her reluctance to accept. <br /> They embark on an affair, he knows he is married and promises not to fall in love with him, and thinks he'll just be another woman. Despite all of this, they fell in love (so the song "IF YOU WAS LOVED") with his help, he overcomes his fear & goes back to the MET where he triumphed. I will not say how it ends, but it's fairly predictable. That is not always a bad thing. <br /> <br /> The performance of this is not that bad. Pavarotti (who plays Giorgio Fini) is not an actor, so if you are waiting for a Spencer Tracy or Tom Hanks performance, YOU are lured, not Pavarotti. He knows it's not a thespian. What it is beautiful, good & charisma. He has fun himself, and if you can just let yourself be fun, it's not so bad. A funny line is by saying Pamela (Harrold) that it is a "thirsty plant, Finishing your water!" and of course, he said, "I do not want to water on Finish!" Kathryn Harrold is very sweet and does a wonderful job as a semi-uptight woman who learns this morning man living a little. One of my favorite lines in the movie is: "Life never has to be life size." And Eddie Albert has done his normal job as the Finish Manager. There are several "self" camcorders by real conductors, musicians, etc. and are filmed aside from the Metropolitan Opera at Lincoln Center. <br /> If you love opera, if you like Pavarotti, or if you can just let yourself go and enjoy a "little fling" just as it's proposed in the movie - then you can enjoy this movie for that he is. I know I do-every time. :) <br /> <br />
