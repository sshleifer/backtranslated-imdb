I was prepared for a comic roulette comic roulette, but he was pleased to find a fast-paced script, a hidden moral, excellent portrait from all the actors, especially Peter Finch, amazing special effects, suspicions, and pretty movies - there's even a shot in the Buddha Majestic rocks recently destroyed by the Taliban. Not to mention Elizabeth Taylor in her most beautiful and sympathetic, before giving in to the hyperics hyperics that her shorts later worked. All players support it round, and I wonder who trains all the elephants. <br /> <br /> Speaking of the stone-Budd seam, you really can discover that it's Vivien Leigh in the long shots. Her form and style of departure are different from Taylor. The only thing marring that the sequences are the wrong shots to make processes, where the background moves not too fast for horses in a walk. <br /> <br /> If you want a thought-provoking movie that's nice to look and never boring, spend a few hours with Elephant Walk.
