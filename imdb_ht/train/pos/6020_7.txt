A beautiful new printing of "Zabriskie Point" is playing in Paris and seems to be doing well in the Latin Quarter. It's time for a full review of the movie. Let's hope the new print means that a DVD and some "extras" perspicaces will come out in the near future. <br /> I remember watching ZP when it came out and thought it was a crash. This time around I was totally awadward and would classify it as a "near-miss" masterpiece. The first part of the movie is a long time capsule in Los Angeles '60 in Los Angeles, I stayed there, and Antonioni did a mastery work to capture the essence of the place. Kudos and designer producer Dean Tavoularis found some incredible places and performed exceptionally. The print I saw running 1 hour 50 minutes. It is forbidden to those under 16 (or 18, I can not remember). I suspect having quite a bit of restoring footage of this print. SPOILER - I wonder how many of the scenes of desert sex were originally cut. What appears today looks rather tame by the current standards. <br /> No band music until nearly 1 hour in the movie. Before we heard strange sounds like radio broadcasts, Antonioni was very daring to do that. I remember how much was done at the time of lack of acting skills by non-actor Mark Frechette and Daria Halprin. This time Frechette did not bother me. Halprin is weaker, but steadily improves as the film continues. Many <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> An injection is in a different aspect ratio & distorted by the wide screen. Of course, there are current foot scenes, but not all that much. <br /> I'm still trying to figure out how Antonioni did some of the shots at Frechette flying the plane. It seems that it really did some of the fly - there's no blue or dual screen in some shots. <br /> I hope to get back to seeing the movie a second time. Recommended much of all fans of Antonioni.
