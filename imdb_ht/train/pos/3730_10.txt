If you want to watch a movie and feel good about watching it, then Tigerland is the movie for you. I like this movie from top to bottom. This photo-perfect movie scene looks so real; It's almost like a documentary of something that happened in real life but with drama. Boy, I tell you ... REAL Dramas are actually real "fight" in one of the scenes (get the DVD to listen to comments it's not obvious). I see this movie as a bunch of desperate young men trying to escape a sick-unhappy dude, after watching My Ryan Private Saving I have an appreciation of what a "sick-needy destination" is and knows exactly how the guys are the movie feels. I see this movie as a cross between "Stand by Me" and "Private Ryan Saving." What do people do when they are in a "difficult pressed" situation in real life? Some men go crazy, some men cry, some men in point, others make drugs, some sleep randomly and pity hookers trying to eliminate the meaning of love in their lives, some try to drink the pain away, some jumps buildings or bridges, some feel guilty and others feel a lot of agony and make them sick - physically. This movie has all those desperate emotions rolling into one ball. But do not get me wrong movie by its depressing, its realistic, it's a very very funny movie, the comic and comic Bozz (Collin's character) its light all up, and on top of which there are about 5 female actress in the movie in; I'll let you know what's in for! With dialogue, war / action sequences, perfect picture scenes along with proper music; This movie has it all, as I said: from top to bottom. I'm not why Tigerland is heavily under-credited. The best thing about the movie is that on the cover he says in the big bold writing "The Best Movie of the Year," and it absolutely does not fall short of that. Keeping the rare gems coming Hollywood, 10/10.
