VIVAH is in my best PHOTO book of 2006! PERIOD !!. In my book it is one of the best 100 movies made in Bollywood. Its sad that this movie does not have much review and it does not have that much popularity. <br /> <br /> VIVAH is once again a true success of a director who makes it again. After HAHK and Maine Pyar Kiya Haze once again pulled on a brilliant one VIVAH. <br /> This is the simplest and beautiful movie that I saw this year. After seeing Don 2 that was CRAP and later Dhoom 2 who even beat Don in this matter, I finally saw a movie that is so close to my heart and my culture. <br /> I do not know why Bollywood is moving away from the beautiful culture that we have and making Hollywood style noticed style noticed as Dhoom 2 and Don. <br /> The story is beautiful and relates to many of the American system of wedding arrangements that I myself would like to be part of. Our system that teaches us to obey the elders, follow them and of course obey their thoughts is so brilliantly shown in this movie! Of course there is no strength to choose your life partner and it would be a short meeting between the couple and her up to decide how she's brilliant in this movie. <br /> <br /> Come back to the movie ..... VIVAH is a story of Journey between the beautiful period of Engagement and Wedding. The stage where the guy meets the girl .... .... Both understand each other .. And try to figure out if they could love each other for seven generations (as our system says) and the diversity of happenings during marriage. <br /> Amrita Rao is brilliant in the movie ....... Shahid is OK ..... and Alok Nath and Anupam Kher are awesome !! The songs are brilliant. ! I especially like HAMARI SHAADI MAIN HAFTE REY CHAAR and Anjaane Ajnabi ...... <br /> <br /> In general a MUST see for anyone who still believes in the Indian culture and tradition and I certainly do !. <br /> <br /> Go see this movie ...... I just have to say a word ....... <br /> <br /> BLISS !.
