Both visually and stunning music. A treat for both the eye and the ear. Victoria Victorian's excellence in the opening sequences was quite enchanting, helping to create a Christmas scene in which Dickens himself would have been proud to be proud. Technically the production is visually interesting with the special effects both imaginatively invented and creatively realized in a traditional stage setting. The very dance of the lead artists is breathtakingly good. Photography and lighting are the first-class and sound recording admirable matches in general high levels of skill technique skills. A great movie for the whole family in Christmas time with a delightful breakthrough that will withstand multiple look.
