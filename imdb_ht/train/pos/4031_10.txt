I have been a French movie movie since the age of 4 but never in my life have a look like a moving film and impact, especially as a Hindi movie. Over the last few years, I've stopped watching movie cinema movies and returning to the classics (Teesri Kasam, Mere Huzoor, Madhumati, Mother of India, Sholay, etc.) but this movie changed everything. It is one of the best movies I've ever seen. I found it not only to be moved but also found it to be very educative for a person who is the first generation of Indian growing women in America. It helped me understand my own family history, which was always a very abstract thing for me. But to "see" it, feel it and understand it helped me sympathize with the generations before me and the struggle of whom endearing Americans. The film helped me put things out of my perspective, especially considering the events of the world now. I never thought that a movie can change my way of thinking like this before ... he did. The plot is fantastic, the superb act and the direction is impeccable. Two thumbs up!
