I picked up at least a few people who watched it on Sept.2 on TCM. If you told you that Hedy had to change his name to avoid being associated with this movie when he came to the US It was a big scandal and I gathered that the original release of the United States was so cut off by censorship that it was practically unintelligible. I watched because I was just seeing a documentary about "bad women", the US film actress pre-movie cinema set up in the early '30s. She looked at me as if they were getting away with a lot more than Hedy's most "sensational" vaccine in "Ecstasy". In fact Hedy looked positively innocent in this, not today's standards, and it was nice to see her early intact beauty. It was a lovely, lyric movie to relax. I loved it for what it was: a simple romance. I watched it after pre-register it during a bleaching early A.M. I would like to see the first version released in the U.S. for the sake of.
