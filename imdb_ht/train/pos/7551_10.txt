Best animated film ever made. This film explores not only the vast world of modern animation and absolutely boggling effects, but the branches of the mind, soul, and philosophy. The story features a family of cats, where the big sister dies, the younger brother sees this and delivers himself, but when he wakes up he stays without a soul. So, two sibling cats are embarking on a journey to get it. I have been reporting this trip to many things. The history of the world, the Bible, the cycle of life, and every time I look at it, I discover more and more hidden terms and metaphors. If you are not so physiological aspect then you will always adore it. The animation is superb, and the creative scenes will have you attached to the screen. For example, the ocean freeze in time, God eats soup from the ground, a strange explanation and a little SNM of Hansel and Gretel. To conclude, Cat Soup is an absolute treat for anyone. <br /> PS - Not for children, free violence included.
