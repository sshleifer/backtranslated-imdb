I grew up home as a child. I stopped watching it for years, but about two weeks ago I started back watching it again. Now my kids watch the show and enjoy watching it too. My kids can not believe that DJ, on the show, and I'm the same age. <br /> I really like the show, because it's a show you can watch with your family. It has good teaching that you can learn from. There is also no drug and violence on it. Also, when children, on the show, there is a problem they can always open up to their families for help. This message children should be getting out of TV now a day, going to your family for help, not drugs. Kids should watch more shows like Full House instead of half the chaos on television now a day. <br /> I love the show because it makes you laugh and it's down to earth. It talks about real-life issues and family issues. There is always a lesson you can learn from the show. <br /> I vote in a 10.
