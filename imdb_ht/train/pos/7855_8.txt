Tess of the Storm was a Mary Pickford car I had intended to get for some time. I finally found a VHS copy for a reasonable price and enjoyed it. <br /> <br /> Mary gives her typical spunky, innocently sexy painted to a wrong-side-of-the-train girl who wins the heart of a rich heir. Only this time wagering is higher: a burden of fraudulent felons, an illegitimate child (and ensuing case of maternity error) and suicide recordings. One can see why Pickford wanted to recover this one. The story is a real moral reality, the kind that he loves stars in. Controversial subjects are not always spelled out squares; A viewer has to pay attention and pick up on suggestions to catch everything being implied on first glance ?? although everything is more or less explained at the end. <br /> On the only negative I can do should be regarding Jean Hersholt and the dog. Hersholt, whose character, Ben Letts, seems to be about 6-2, 200 pounds (bigger next to Mary, of course!), Is sent to panic when a 60-pound bank chocolate packs up toward him! Then at his head cut off (or perhaps justify his frightful fear of the dog), he managed to comb him in the ground and somehow injure him so badly that he is still struggling to get up later. , such a bad weather! This is the same adorable lab that sleeps with Frederick (Lloyd Hughes) and hatch with Mary! But Mary later throws boiling water into Ben's face, which barely slows it up! Ok, I've ventilated on Ben and the chocolate lab! Other than that, the film was well touched and certainly held my attention. Pickford's cast support was strong and credible. This is certainly among its best films.
