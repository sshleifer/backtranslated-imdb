Romantic comedy can really go either way, do you know? You will see one that's really burning, and you'll think you want something more realistic. Then you'll see one that's realistic, but it might be too dirty to keep you interested. Or maybe you'll see one that does everything right, but just fails to make you smile. Romantic comedy movies are hard. You go in with a lot of expectations, and usually if you like it is simply a matter of whether the filmmakes have anticipated your expectations or those of the guy or girl next to you. <br /> Of course, if you had a girl next to you, and you're a guy like me, it probably does not matter all so much if the movie any good, you've got something about yourself. For you, I say, "go get it, Tiger!" For the rest of us, I say, "Look _A Guy Thing_." It's a lot of fun. <br /> Because _A Guy Thing_ knows you're going to this movie with expectations, so it does not pretend that its "Guy about to marry meets the woman in her dream, and she's not his wife!" draws that will do all happy people. Sure, maybe you like it, but maybe it's not true rings, or you think it's cruel. _A Guy Thing_ covers that. What _A Guy Thing_ do is fill out the screen and throw in better support I've seen in a long time, so if you do not mind the main, you've always got something to make you smile. /> If we're talking about the seasoned veterans in large and small screens, like Larry Miller (Pretty Woman, Best of Show), James Brolin (Traffic), Julie Hagerty (Airplane!), David Koechner (Saturday Night Live and Conan O'Brien Regular, Working Room, Austin Powers II) or Thomas Lennon (State and Viva Varieties), or new faces such as Shawn Hatosy (Faculty), or Colin Foo (Saving Silverman), we are talking about a bunch of people very active and talented actor who knows exactly how to take advantage of the inspiring film's features, steal the show, time after time, and still framed the piece with an energy and a joyfully rarely seen in romantic comedy these days. <br /> And that's not detected from the current actual romantic and the stars that bring it together, because it's very sweet and horrible It's well done. Jason Lee (Mallrats, Chasing Amy, Dogma, etc.) is handling as young professionals whose lives can be turned out of control, and Selma Blair shows a discreet shine in the social aspirations of sophisticated sophisticated sophisticated sessions every guy wants to marry except for the guy who actually is. <br /> A lot of success in the movie, though, falls on Julia Stiles, the girl right in the right place at the wrong time, and put it well. Not since, gosh, I do not know when, I saw an actress in a romantic comedy that fell in love with it so easy. Of course, it's all the tight, the voice, and the subtle smiles, but it's magic, and it's one of the great reasons why we go to the movies in the first place. <br /> But Julie Stiles's slightly sophisticated oppressive should be lost was not for the fact that the rest of the cast is so incredibly dead-over in classical simplicity. This is a movie that painted a broken world of unrelenting stocks, making them fall on each other to make you laugh, and then come in with a great deal of heart. <br /> A thing Guy is a movie you've definitely seen before, and the filmmakers clearly knew that when they put down to do it. We have not really seen any new romantic comedy since Shakespeare; The relative success of this one or that one is entirely dependent on the execution of the classic story of boy satisfying girls. Something Guy embraced that with a bit of a metacinematic corner, often takes the scenes of the absurd in order to give the audience a chance to recognize the powerful emotions and ancient drawings of play. The record, he also managed to keenly enjoy the rather traditional structural notions of sex and sex that form the center of every romantic comedy, so even the feminists out could get a kick out of it. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I will not spoil it for you, but when you try to explain to your girlfriend why the pharmacist and clothing store clerk are among the coolest dudes in the movies, I suggest you just say "It's Guy," and let it .
