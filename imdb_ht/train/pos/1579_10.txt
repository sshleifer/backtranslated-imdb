I saw this film at Film Festival Film Toronto, where she received a standing ovation! This film tells a story that I have never said in advance - namely on the Rosenstrasse (a street in Berlin) uprising of Gentile German women who were married to Jews at the end of the Second World War. So it's a unique story, and what's more, is the only movie about the Holocaust that I've ever seen showing that there was good German (family help in "Anne Frank" for example was Dutch) non did support the Nazis and, in fact, had the strength to rise against immorality of countries and brutality during the Nazi regime, at risk of many lives. The act is great across the board, the story framing in New York interesting and complicated, direction from Trotta to mastery in every scene, and the production values, including the gorgeous, outstanding movie. Of course the family in New York can speak German. Many immigrants in this country choose to speak in their native language and their families - a common incident. So criticism is unwarranted. To say more would spoil the experience. The film is long, but I do not look at me once. I hope this movie gets some distribution is North America, because not only is this movie a masterpiece, but it can actually help heal any animosity people have towards the Germans because of the support of Hitler. If this movie is playing in your area, I GET you see it! You will be happy to have done!
