Tintin was one of my favorite heroes as a kid. I rented the books in the school library every chance I got. My favorite one was the "Red Shark Sharks" - lots of action and humor. <br /> <br /> This documentary was a brilliant exhibit in the background of Herge's background and its development in Tintin. The film-maker's personal experience in Herge interview with the story of his relationship with the artist was the inspiration for the Chan character was very moved. A great documentary of a very talented and well-liked artist. A great example of a person who has become internationally renowned, and has brought joy to millions of children (and youth at heart) all over the world.
