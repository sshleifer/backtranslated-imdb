I did not live in the 60's, so I can not guarantee that this movie was a completely accurate representation of the period, but it is certainly a moving and fulfilling experience. There are some excellent performances, most notably by Josh Hamilton (in Honors), Jerry O'Connell (sliders), who play fees divided by the war. Bill Smitrovich, a character actor who has long been ignored by many, provides a heart-filled performance as their strict father, who is forced to lay his own beliefs and values ​​as one of his sons made him proud to go in Vietnam, but returns empty inside, while the other is exactly the opposite. All in all, this is a powerful and happy movie that I hope everyone gets a chance to experiment.
