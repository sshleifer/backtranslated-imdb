This is a language of film films from the very beginning and a voice-over that pokes fun in all French and then produces a rather naughty but very brave hero of Fanfan La Tulipe. Portrait by Gerard Philippe's surprise, this superbly young man completely believes in the curvaceous fate of Lollobrigida foretells - notably that he will marry King Louis XV's daughter! The problem is, La Lollo will soon find his outsiders too in love with fanfan ... <br /> Try not to fight good swords, cavalcades, and other bad section sequences moving through an animated pace and lots of funny moments. The direction is perhaps the weakest aspect but the movie is so light and persuaded it so un-seriously that I could not give these imperfections a second thought. Watch out for Noel Roquevert, a traditional heavyweight French film, trying to steal La Lollo, making himself a nuisance, and eating the script in the fortune teller that reads the La Lollo! And what a Marcel Herrand jelly is as the megalomaniac and lion-drive King Louis XV! That's not all: so many beautiful women in one movie make me want I was in France and on the back series in 1952! The film may have come out this year but its greener, cheek, superb narratives, Immaculate photography and memorable Gerard Philippe ensures it remains modern and a pleasure to watch. I would not hesitate to recommend it to my grandchildren alone for everyone who loves the movie overall and swashbucklers in particular! Look at it!
