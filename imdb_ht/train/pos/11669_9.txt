They were the prototype of the classic Errol Flynn movie adventure and has a good story as well as two more brilliant co-stars in Maureen O'Hara (what an exquisite beauty!) And Anthony Quinn, I can recommend this movie only all those who have the same slightest sympathy for romance and adventure. <br /> Hollywood at its best!
