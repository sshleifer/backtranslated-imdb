The Internet Database is listed as a TV show. And yes, it was a series of MTVs shown in the program "Oddities", after the "top" and before "Aeon Flux" if I remember correctly. But the version I watched this time was a VHS tapes and all the episodes were running together in a movie without annoying credit in between you have to wait a week for the next fifteen minutes. <br /> You have the story of Maxx, Julie Winters, Sarah and Mr. Gone. Maxx is a super-hero or bomber, Julie a social worker or a leopard queen, Sarah a little girl who should cost less at Smiths and Mr. Gone a guy who can not seem to resist herself. Then there's strange creatures ... <br /> I used "or" with Maxx and Julie, because part of the fun tries to figure out which part of the story is real and is dreaming. Maybe they're all real or dreamy. Perhaps one of the characters does not exist. Maybe only one exists and dreams of others. You will have to wait and find out. <br /> I had the comic books before the show out, and it was one of my favorites. The artwork was spectacular and the story was originally - unlike anything you'll find in Superman or Batman. It will bend your mind, and it has great adult content without obscene or offensive. And the show basically uses the same artwork (only now it moves) and the same story ... guarantees that the intrinsically beauty found in the comic should be faithfully reproduced. This was the best show to appear on "Oddities", but down. If you love comics in a darker nature or need a good tour, this is a show to check out. It's "Donnie Darko" before there was everything like something. <br /> <br /> The most amazing thing is that this never goes to become another movie set or TV, but I'm not saying this in disappointment. By keeping it simple, this film was sealed and kept free from the blemishes carried over by successive failures.
