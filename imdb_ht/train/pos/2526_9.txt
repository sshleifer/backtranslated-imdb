It's awesome! In History History, you will be out of punk pro. You have to complete goals involving skating, driving, and walking. You create your own skater and give it a name, and you can make it look stupid or realistic. You are with Eric your friend throughout the game until he betrays you and it gets you to step into the skateboard team (you can choose a team to be on) and you then start your own team! There are many levels such as New Jersey, Manhattan, and even School II (not part of story mode though) from Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2. You can unlock secret skaters like Iron Man, Gene Simmons, and another skater. You can create your own goals like SKATE letter, COMBO, Tricktris, Gap, and more. You can create the target pedestal and write these words. If you get bored of doing so, you can make the premiere goals in premat park. The only thing I did not like about this game was that sometimes it was difficult to drive cars. 9/10.
