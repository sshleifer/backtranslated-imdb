For years I thought this comedy comedy knockabout was a product of John Ford, especially with Victor McLaglen as one of the drivers. It certainly has the same humorous home humor that Ford films its films with. <br /> <br /> For my surprise I learned it was George Stevens who actually led it. Still I refused to believe that this film was not offered to John Ford, but it was probably cut off at Monument Valley making Stagecoach. Victor McLaglen along with Cary Grant and Douglas Fairbanks, Jr., play three serials in the U.S. Army with a good friend / friend / friend comrades away. But the old gang is breaking up because Fairbanks is engaged in married Joan Fontaine. Not sure his pals can help him, assisted and abetted by Gunga Din animals like animals played by Sam Jaffe. <br /> <br /> The Rudyard Kipling poem served as the inspiration for this RKO film about life barriers in the British Raj. The funny game of driving is so good that it covers the incredibly racial message of the movie. Not that the makers were racists, but this was the assumption of the British at the time, including our drive and Gunga Din show this most effectively. The British has taken India by increasing, making deals here and having local leaders under a weak Emperor Mogul who did away with the middle of the 19th century. They have led many little India outright, which would be impossible. The rules depend on the authentic troops you see here. Note that soldiers can not rise above the bodily rank and Gunga Din is considerably lower in status than that. <br /> <br /> Note here that the rebels are in reality Hindu, not Muslim. There are many tensions in this religion as there are Christian circles and this strange creature was quite real. Of course, they were surprised that they might not even look at them as liberators. But until India organized its independence movement, until the Congressman joined them, these people voiced a free India. <br /> But, however, you slice it, typing people is not a wonderful thing to do with the British also having the points here too. When I look at Gunga Din, I think of Star Trek and the reason first prime entered. Cary Grant has had her real cock herself here instead of urbane cary we're used to seeing. Fairbanks and McLaglen do very well with their fully adapted personality. <br /> <br /> The best role in the film however is Eduard Ciannelli as the Guru, the head of the strangler cult. Note the fire and passion in its performance, it blows everyone else on the screen when it's over. <br /> <br /> Favorite Gunga Din scene is Ciannelli excited its troops in the hills of temples. Note how Stevens progressively darkens the background around Ciannelli until all that you see are eye and tooth like a Halloween Halloween March. Haunted, scary and ineffective. <br /> It was right after this action in the nineteenth-century film that more and more to the British public began to question the assumptions hiding the rage. But this is the subject of Gandhi. <br /> <br /> Gunga Din is always a great, fun and funny movie. It should show a passage to India and Gandhi and you can chart how the Indian independence movement has evolved.
