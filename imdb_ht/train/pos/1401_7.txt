Well, we had extreme violent Verhoeven (although not as extreme as other Verhoeven flicks), we had lots of sex and nudity, but something was missing ... Oh, yes, he missed the intelligence that Paul Verhoeven is known for his sci-fi movies. I admire the Way Verhoeven introduces the characters and how they have a humorous sense, but unlike most Verhoeven films, the film itself does not have enough humor to fall into the comedy genre. Acting in general was higher than average compared with the most slasher movie. <br /> <br /> What makes Man Man a good movie is not the story, not the cast or character, but the amazing amazing special effects that would make a movie like this impossible. The team really made an invisible man, without the use of such things as a floating hat suspended on piano wires and other practical effects (effects on set). The most stunning scenes are not seen while Kevin Bacon is invisible, when Kevin Bacon becomes invisible and visible. The problem is that this invisible man story deserves to be more imaginative. Here, it takes place in a laboratory for the most part. I would like to see Kevin Bacon's visually robbed a bank and getting away with it, or let's say thief something in the person's pocket, or something like that. But what shows is decent enough to make Hollow Man a fun movie. Grade: B
