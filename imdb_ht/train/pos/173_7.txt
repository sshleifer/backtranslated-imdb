Actually, Goldie Hawn is from Washington (Takoma Park, Maryland), but I digress. This is sort of a Smith to go to Washington's kind of movie, with some variations but even the quotes. I was recording this movie in cable year ago because I had a big break on Goldie Hawn. The story is interesting, but it's pretty easy that some restroom waitresses will get an important job of the government just because it saves some of the big shotgun's life. He makes me laugh, it makes me angry at the same time. She made me laugh because some of the situations she found herself were so ridiculous, I had to laugh. (NO PROBLEMS CAN). It made me angry thinking that our government would set up an average citizen in the way it was set up. And the speech he did in the end ... nice. Too bad by many people have intestines like that in real life.
