This cartoon was strangely, but the story actually had a little more depth and emotions than other cartoon movies. We have a girl in a camp with self esteem and hardly any other friend, except a brother and sister who is just a miserable as it is. It reaches the ultimate low point and when the opportunity reaches it literally makes a park with a devil-like devil. I found this movie to be very true in life and just when things might not get worse, the girl sees what she's doing, feels sorry and then changes and then helps her The dark, mysterious creatures learn the human quality of love. The twins also improve, do not help the little bears and then get a sense of self too. A very positive message for children, though some elements of the movie were strange, it was and still is a rather enjoyable movie. Music from Stephen Bishop (Tootsie Song) made the movie even better
