It took me time to really appreciate the Halloween Carpenter Halloween. As a kid, I remember I really enjoyed the suites, especially the Return of Michael Myers, which I still think is the best Halloween sequel. But I thought the first one was slow and took too much time to get to the point. I watch her a couple of times lately and I know now I was wrong. Today I really understand this movie, the meaning it has, the whole feeling of this horrific pride. It's not about blood and gore. It's not about nude chicks and blame jokes. It's about the worst night in Laurie Strode's short life. It's over night beats depressed him back home to finish what he started 15 years ago. This movie means they are scared and I think it succeeds pretty well. It is also one of the first slasher movies, a sub-genre horror that I still love. Halloween has a very dark atmosphere, climbing music and talented young actors, like Jamie Lee Curtis in her first role. Need I say more? Anyone who has never seen him, horror fans or not, should make his movies now homework. Very highly recommended!
