* Wonderland SPOILERS * <br /> July 1, 1981: five people, Ron Launius (Josh Lucas), Susan Launius (Christina Applegate), Billy Deverell (Tim Blake Nelson), Barbara Richardson (Natasha Gregson Wagner) and Joy Miller (Janeane Garofalo ) are attacked while they are asleep and brutally hit on the head and steel pipes at their homes at 8763 Wonderland Avenue, Laurel Canyon, LA. Only Susan survives. <br /> <br /> Main suspect: John Holmes (Val Kilmer), former king of pornography, owner of a thick 30 cm long, and now a hopeless addict. Investigators, Luis (Frankie G.) and Sam Nico (Ted Levine), investigate the case and try to crack it with the help of a witness who claims that John at least was involved in the crimes, David Lind (Dylan McDermott), Barbara's companion, and tried to find a report from Dawn Schiller (Kate Bosworth), 19-year-old girlfriend Holmes and Susan, who sadly does not remember anything more than the night shadow. bashed in and he almost suffered the same fate, with the name of Eddie Nash (Eric Bogosian), a great drug trap (which is still around ladies like Barbie (Paris Hilton)), comes to light as a suspect planner of massacre in Wonderland. <br /> But what happened this night? And could Sharon (Lisa Kudrow), Jan's wife, know something about her? 'Wonderland' is a taught, intelligent thriller, a desperate love story and a story of a man's decline at all in one; There is a clever use of the 'Rashomon' technique (we see the events of this fateful night and night from David, John, Dawn, Susan (albeit very short) and Sharon), a beautiful direction with a great script but is especially compelling for their performance, especially Kilmer, who takes center stage with her hopeless, tormented, sometimes toddler Holmes, Lucas', whose Launius is oddly enticing, Sharon Kudrow's strong and Bosworth's innocent Dawn . Meservey: 9/10.
