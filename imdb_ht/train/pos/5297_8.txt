I went to see this movie with my brother and his girlfriend. The nice place was packed with us all laughing so hard it was easy to miss lines. I knew it looked like it would be good, but it was much funnier than I thought it would be. I liked both Edward Furlong and Christina Ricci, they seemed really strange just like normal people, if that makes sense. I get sick of movies that show adolescents like being candy knives, such as "jock" or "geek" or "cheerleader" ... etc. Both characters were unique, but still very humane and normal enough to relate. I'll recommend this movie to all my friends and are waiting very quickly for it to be out on DVD, Go see this movie with your friends who can laugh at the funniest parts of life! I plan to see it again in the theater and I do not see things happening very often.
