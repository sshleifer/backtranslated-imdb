This movie was on my wish list for ten years and I only recently found it on DVD when my partner's grandson gave it. She looked at her and was thrilled to learn that she was about my generation - born in 1930 and evacuated in 1939 and she wanted to know more about her - and I. My luck I borrowed from her and looked at her and I called all of her. Not only did it capture the emotions, class distinctions, the difficulty and warmth of human relationships in those years (as well as their wickedness (talk and unspoken); but it was accurate! I also a bit of anorexia when it comes to ARP uniform, ambulance (LCC) in the right color (white) and all the impedimenta in the management of bomb sites and the work of the heavy rescue brigade. I could not blame any of this from memory I, with the sabbagged Anderson shelter and the WV cancer brought it all back. The difference between this relatively untouched life in the village and war-worn London was also sharply introduced to my re-lived 1939/40 with its own evacuation I'm in London with this production! I know Jack's working gold, of course, and one would expect no more from him than this meticulous detail, but he went beyond the exact representation of the facts and Earn deep chords on human responses and only the half-pronounced judgments of these years. The highlights of John Thaw's actors career and toward the Gold and deserve to be best known. It's a magnificent movie and I've already ordered a couple of copies to send to friends.
