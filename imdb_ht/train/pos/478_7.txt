I'm rather surprised that no review has so far commented on blonde in elementary debugging in the game Luzhin as white against an unknown opponent immediately before the final. Although used in Jonathan Speelman as expert chess consultant, Luzhin shows the game with an illegal move. In the midst of the quick back and back of the board it's not hard to spot that after Luzhin's combination resulted in a queen's offering, his rook on D1 was still estimated by the black rook of c1 against his king in the corner of h1. So he is able to play the bad mature Rd1-d8 math that would be illegal - but he has shown to do these fantastic applause from the audience.
