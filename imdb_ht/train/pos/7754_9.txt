Either way that the winds are Tom Barmans (who also knows as front of the film 'dEUS' film) first movie. Entirely shot in Antwerp (Belgium), the film starts in a sunny Friday morning and jumps rather supersaffingly between the events that fill the day to a dozen of the main character. When the movie ends, you have a lot to think about, because many of the different story-lines leave open wide. The movie has a (purely instrumental) sound sound that will rock you the sock. In most scenes, the music really improves the general atmosphere and feels, really makes the film alisinate to look at certain points in time. The main scene of the film, the party, is very well shot. The director did not hesitate to use video video techniques, having his main character dancing on one of the best soundtracks I've heard lately. <br /> <br /> The scenario is great. Camera and color angles are very well selected. 'Costumes' are very hot and very 'sixty' too. And I loved (most of) acting .. <br /> <br /> The things I love most about the movie are the subtle touches of absurd, surreal, very dry or even cynical interleave humor. <br /> <If you do not claim to be a comedy (this movie certainly is not a comedy but rather an alternative piece of art), it still manages to have its audience giggling and even broke into laughs at some times. This <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I hope to see more Tom Barman movies in the future because I had a good time. Cheers.
