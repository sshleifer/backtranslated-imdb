This game is fun and it has a plot that you might actually expect to see in the comics. Spider-man was framed by a mysterious enchanted. The city will be overlooked by a strange gas, and symbiotic like those of Venom and Carnage are displayed throughout the city. Who is behind these crimes? Should it be Doc Ock? Well it seems to have turned on a new sheet. Venom also does not seem to be involved as it is just ticking in that spider-man was apparently listening to it a rather good photo opportunity. Well cameos from other heroes and many bandits later Spidey will unravel the mystery. The battle is basic, not difficult to pick up, the battles and bosses are rather fun. You get to collect funny, you run out of internet and it's a bit fun to cross the city. However, it is also a weak point. The swing is not all that great as all you have to do is hover around the city as Spider man is lost to his tackle in the sky. You also do not have many web-slinging manifolds either specifically compared to a Spider-Man 2 movie video game. Still, it makes up for the rather bad swinging and other elements especially the story. So ready to see Scorpion, Rhino, Venom, Mysterio, Octopus Doctor, and Carnage for one ride action ride ride.
