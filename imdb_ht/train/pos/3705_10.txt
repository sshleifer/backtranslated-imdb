I do not understand the rating rating 5.7 on this movie. It is a pleasure for those who love a strong and atmospheric black suspension. The tone is reminiscent of midnight in the Garden of good and evil, down the locale (Savannah). Acting strong, and I was amazed at the verisimilitude of South Kenneth Branagh's accent. Famke Jansen is great, Robert Duval is effective in a small part, and Embeth Davitz is the BOMB. Great scene full of nude in it, too. The plot is fairly standard but is effectively executed.
