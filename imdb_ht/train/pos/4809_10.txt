With all of the recent films, dealing with the British monarchy, is it really time for another? Answer: YOU BET! The Young Victoria is another contributor to waves of movies from Britain related to the Royal Family. In this case, she deals with the early life of Princess Victoria, and events leading up to the Coronation of her becoming Queen of England, as well as her romance & eventually Prince Albert's wedding. The film also faced the storm and career lives of Queen and Prince England, as well as several other transient events (political turmoil, etc.). Emily Blunt plays a brilliant Victoria in her youth, while Rupert Friends is her beloved & best friend, Prince Albert. The rest of the cast is rounded out with the likes of Miranda Richardson, as the Dutchess of Kent, and always welcome to screen, Jim Broadbent as King William, as well as a cast of others who shine on screen. Jean Marc Vallee (C.R.A.Z.Y., Loser Love), directed from a scenario won by Jullian Fellowes (Fairness Fair, Gosford Park, Separate Lies). I absolutely came from myself on the visual viewing film (by Hagen Bogdansker), which provided every frame of a painted film (with the help of designer producer, Patrice Vermette), as well as some editable edits (by Jill Bilcock & Matt Garner). What I am indulging in Fellowes' script is the use of a game of Chess, as a metaphor for some of the political film motivation (the characters in the movie motion on the pieces on a chess board). This is smart, well written, directed, filmed, edited & entertainment (with Enlightenment) that makes for a well spent evening in the movie theater. PPA reports by the MPAA for a few scenes of sensuality, some short violence (slightly bloody, although there is nothing too gore), a gross explosion of language, and some on smoking screens
