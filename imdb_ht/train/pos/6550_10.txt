See if I was interested in a book by Nancy Drew, what I would do is pick up a book and read it. I'm not. Ever since I can remember I read those movies because he did not like the book. I'm sorry - in the digital age we can not watch movies on flip books, but I'm sure you can still find a few short silent film formats. When the Lord comes out of the rings, people complain. When the third was an Oscar - "The Book was Best." When I looked to kill a mockingbird, "the book was better." Now a bunch of people are upset, again, because Nancy Drew did not like the book. I'm not telling Nancy Drew who is going to win any Oscars - if anything he's going to be one of these Nickelodeon Blinds or Kids Choice Awards. I say a movie a break. It's film, not paperwork. As a movie, I found Nancy Drew quite enjoyable - featuring cameos from Bruce Willis and Adam Goldberg (the European Hammer) and the role supported by Tate Donovan (Jimmy Cooper on O.C.) and Rachel Leigh Cook (It's All That). This is the first time I saw Emma Roberts in a movie and, frankly, I enjoy her work more than most of Julia and Eric; Her character remains consistent in the movie and reacts well with conflicts. A lighthearted film in the spirit of Harriet The Spy is beautiful now and again. <br /> I give him ten stars because I enjoy the movie, would like to see it again, and will probably buy it on DVD release.
