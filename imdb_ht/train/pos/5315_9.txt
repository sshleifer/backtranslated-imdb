This movie was very, very strange and very, very funny. All of the actors are quite real and very odd. All the "look" of the movie was different, too, the sort of enchantment rarely and whitewashed, which only adds to the spacious, fumbling, oddly amazing of everything. <br /> It's not for everyone, I mean, that's not what you would call "mainstream" but that's what I love about it. It's unlike anything I've ever seen before. . . unpredictable, with a weird rhythm and punch lines in strange places. The kids are so heartbreakingly jumping (and pimply) that you can not help but feel for them. In other words, these are far from the "hollywoodized" version of adolescents. Everyone, to me, does it a good thing.
