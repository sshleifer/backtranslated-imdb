I loved this masterpiece and quite frankly, too, found Mary Poppins (although I love Julie Andrews and Dick VanDyke) to be funny and sacrificing-sweet. Angela Lansbury plays her character in perfection and I do not know why people think of this movie as distorted. It was magic and it was a lot of fun to watch. Each scene held a certain charm as you knew the best characters. You really see how this little cast together family learn to bond each other, despite their age and gap. I thought the characters were well developed, especially Charles who was in the "Age by Faith". Mary Poppins can be famous and cared for by others but this small piece will be one that I will always love and care for.
