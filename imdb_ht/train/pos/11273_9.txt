One year after losing Jane Parker gorgeous (Maureen O'Sullivan) loves Tarzan rival, hunter Harry Holt (Neil Hamilton) returns to the jungle to have another hit in winning the brunette heart. Mixing business and pleasure, she also plans to grab some ivory ivory cemeteries that lie behind Mutia's, Tarzan's stomping ground. <br /> <br /> Accompanied by his slimy, cheesy Martin Arlington with a group of expendable organizing, Harry finally reached his destination (he narrowly avoided the death of native wild and rock-hurling ones) Only to find that Jane is still infamous with her musclebound yodeller, and worse still, Tarzan refuses to let the hunters take any ivory from the graveyard. Nasty Arlington decided to settle matters by racking and man-man shooting and then telling Jane and Holt that Tarzan was attacked by food by a crocodile. Of course, Tarzan does not die only wounded; After being nursed back to health by Cheetah (!), she swing back to action just in time to rescue Jane from a tribe of vicious lions-foods that attacked Holt's expulsion. Tarzan and his Mate, the second Weismuller star as the jungle man in some words, is often cited by fans as the best of the series; Although I slightly prefer the original, I can definitely understand the movie's popularity: it's sexy humor and there are some great action sequences! Chemistry that can not be denied between Weismuller and O'Sullivan is fabulous and leads to some very sweet scenes, with both stars wearing one-weensy team at all, having eyes-candy aplenty for viewers of both gender enjoys (despite O'Sullivan's many-alled underwater nude scene actually being made by a double body, the lovely couple still shows lots of skin, even threatening to make a 'Sharon Stone' at one point as her flattened flap on one side! ) <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />! her palm, her brand, and a load of elephants in all-lion-cropped mode (once again, the violence is amazingly nasty at times, although as far as I'm concerned, there is nothing quite as shocking as the greedy pygmies and the gorels prefer from the first movie). Cheetah also has its fair share of excitement, rocket rhinoceros, crocs, and big cats, riding on tarzan as it crosses a river, and even jumps on an ostrich for a ride. <br /> <br /> Like it's predecessor, Tarzan and his Mate suffer a little bit of some bad effects and inconvincing accessories? Projected back, a few mocking monkeys costumes, more Indian elephant masquerading as African cousins, and poorly crafted whale catch, but these should not spoil your fun in this very fun movie. If anything, they make it even more fun! <br /> 8.5 out of 10 rounds up to 9 for IMDb.
