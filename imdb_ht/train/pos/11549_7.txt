There is nothing really wrong about the "odd couple," and it's no surprise that Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau have a great comedy team. But there is something so underdeveloped about Neil Simon's adaptation of stage hit plays like making it look more like a skit on a comedy show draw than a full-bodied movie. I have not seen the game but must assume that the screen version is fairly faithful, since Simon writes it, so the damage can not be blamed on a stage-to-screen adaptation. There are some interesting ideas in this story - two recently divorced men who immediately fall into the traditional role of marriage when they become colloquial because they know no different - that Simon never completely carries out. Still, there are many ways worse to kill a couple of hours.
