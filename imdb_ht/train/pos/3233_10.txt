This is a Finnish film movie this year, although Tango Kabaree comes off. Director Lampela made a couple of years back another nice little movie called rakastin epativoivoista naista (I was in love with a desperate woman) .Joki is truly true-to-life beautiful movie in one afternoon saturday in a village / town .The actors may not be so beautiful or beautiful but they act very well. I certainly hope that many of them get JUSSI status (Finnish OSCAR) next spring.I think that this movie might make it abroad as well.
