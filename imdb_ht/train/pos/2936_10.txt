If only Eddie Murphy was born 10 years later. Then we would all remember it. But even I was only 4 when it came out. If you did not see it again, rent Dr Dolittle, Showtime, My Spying, Pluto Nash and Eddie's family comedy movies - then watch this. Hands down, you'll be laughing 90% of the time. Other 10% will be wiping your tears. <br /> It really needs to look more then once they understand all the jokes. From humor to bullies in a joke for kids! (If you've seen it you'll laugh here) - you'll love its stuff. If you can, (or you're a big fan) try downloading clips from Eddie's acts. Allot in the different shows as you would imagine and it was even more funny. <br /> But this is like the "best" Eddie Murphy 'X-rated' if you want. > <br /> And all I can say is please do not look Delirious if you do not like comedy, no sense of humor or not fun hang out with. You will only put down this great Eddie Murphy classic and possibly make someone miss out on it. <br /> If you want to know how Eddie was Beverly Hills cop and got famous in it - Delirious is it.
