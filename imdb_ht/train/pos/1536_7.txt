Tightening of the drama, the best movie of rivalite sister! This little gem was mainly encouraged as a comedy about its release in Sweden, so I am glad to find that which was not the whole case. Funny bits on small town-tinkering have to enjoy, surely, but the drama performs scent, as the story progresses. And not only family drama, it also raises poignant issues on respecting the differences in people's choices. <br /> <br /> Great character and many superb characters and moving dramatic scenes that score point credibility; and not just scattershot, but keep everything in place. It just made me assumed that if Ingmar Bergman did this (the drama would suit him!), The international attention would probably be immediate. <br /> 7 out of 10 from Ozjeppe.
