I watched the movie today and it just blown my mind away. It's a real masterpiece of art and I do not understand why most of the people think it's garbage. The main idea of ​​the movie - take your time to go and then you will have true power! This was the main battle at the end of the movie and Guy Ritchie has shown that in a magnificent way. "The greatest enemy will hide in the last place you'll ever watch" - do you remember this from the movie? Because our true enemy is in us - it is our month ... That voice always tells us that we are important, that gives us our pride, which says we do not give, but only take, which creates our aggression they want to be in control, which creates all the negative feelings and thoughts. GR expressed this idea in an amazing way and showed that the only way to gain control is when you drop control and you just let go of your personal importance. A superb movie!
