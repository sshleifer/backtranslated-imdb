Family problems have plenty of real life and that's what this film is about. Love can keep members together in out court and trial and that's what this film is about. One person, Daddy, is mature and strong to support the family in facing adversity. Children grow up, one is for her, in difficult ways, realizes that no matter how old or a parent is, the parent always loves their children and wants to give them a cushion when they fall. ALL actors that show the characters performed exceptionally. Yes, I shed a water on the road knowing I had similar experiences as a young adult and later as a parent. That's true in life is one that every young adult, and parents, would do well to see, although some will not achieve it until they are also parents. A must see for those who care for their families.
