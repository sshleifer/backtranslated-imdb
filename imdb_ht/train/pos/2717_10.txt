I can not remember much about the show, but I remember how passionately I was about it and how I was determined not to miss any episodes. Unfortunately at the time we had no VCR, so I never saw the series again. However, I can remember how much I felt while watching it and how I was so happy every time he came. Sam Waterstone was my favorite actor these days (I think I was almost in love) and remains one of my favorite actors in the day, mainly due to his appearance in the series. I would be happy to buy / steal / download this series, I think I would go to great lengths in order to see it again and review a child long ago ... Any ideas? Does anyone know of a site devoted to the series or have episodes on tapes from their first waves?
