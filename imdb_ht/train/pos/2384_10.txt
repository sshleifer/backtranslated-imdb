It is a well-known fact when Gene Roddenberry first woke Star NBC, the original pilot episode, the cage, was rejected for being "too cerebral". When the series gave another chance, Roddenberry thought it would be fun to set up the events in the episode to reject as Canon, and did so by writing the menagerie, which had unique distinctions to be the end of what was always , at the moment, a grappling result. <br /> <br /> This time, rather than exploring a new planet, Kirk and his crew are on Starbase 11, paying a visit to the former commander of the Enterprise, Christopher Pike (Sean Kenney), now horribly disfigured and paralyzed because of an accident. Pike joins his successor on the spaceship, where an unpleasant surprise awaits: Spock, who used to serve under pike, was effectively plane the vessel and set the course for Talos IV, a planet that is off-limits (punishment is death) since Spock's latest spike and visit, 13 years earlier. Of course, being a logical creature, Spock turned his head into and arranged a court-martial so that he could justify his actions. <br /> There is no need to say more about the plot, since the rest is playing out from Part 2. What really impresses is how Roddenberry creates the connection between the cage and the rest of the Universe Star Trek, by come up with a particular type of flashback (they say more would be too much) allowing everyone, on screen and off, to see what could be in trek, NBC has not turned down the original project. In particular, it's fun to see Jeffrey Hunter (who could return to the menagerie) playing Pike as a more serious commander than Kirk is usually with Nimoy's early days as Spock, whose personality has not been fully established again: The only time in the entire series that Vulcan's favorite all of the naturally grins. <br /> <br /> In short, not just a great "mystery" episode, but also a treat for those who can not be bothered to dig under the cage in its original form (it's available as part of the season 3 series boxes).
