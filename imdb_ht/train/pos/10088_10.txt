Elephant Walk (1954) Starting an early Peter Finch as master of the Manor in some abandoned plantations where there is still the danger of elephant or Angry Angle, staying out of the midday sun and going to Berserk. Well, eventually they do, after the typhoid or cholera epidemic, of course, with much of their breakthrough. Taylor replaced a Vivien Leigh ill in this boiler pot / flicker adventure. When the elephant storms the house and the Liz Liz on the stairs I still get bumped goose. Thanks to Dana Andrews is around to save the day. One of my favorite gems is guilty. In color too!
