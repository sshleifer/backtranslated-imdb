Reese Witherspoon first outing on the big screen was a memorable one. It looks like a cool face "ant" slight and spit, but endenyable Reese. <br /> I always loved it as an actor, and there was no idea he started this young and his career, going face. I actually had some respect for Reese to know who he was so early on. I say that because every time I watched her do, the characters so far, in every painting it also seemed to have its own character who lived with that character, quite nicely in reality. <br /> <br /> Anyway, my first movie experience with Reese was the Little Red Riding Hood Parody Reese made with Kiefer Sutherland, somehow I suppose that it was the first time she got up "to stick" So well done Reese
