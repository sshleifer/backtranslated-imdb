I like this movie. Marcus, my friend and I, captured local hastings because we had an incentive to rent something we never saw before and stumbled in this movie. We had no idea what he was going to do about, but it turned out spectacular. 2 thumbs up. I liked how the film was shot, and the actors were very funny. If you are looking for a comic movie that also makes you think I highly suggest you quickly run to your local video store and find this movie. I would tell you some of my favorite parts, but that would ruin the movie for you and I will not. This film is definitely on my top 10 list of good movies. Do you really think nothing is bouncy?
