Someone claiming this is another "malicious language" of the ultra-violent Mexican film. They are right, but much more than that movie is a call to create awareness of what we have become. The terrible truth is painful, or opening when you already accept the paradigm of living the third world as the only possible goal. One of the most important things in the "Cero y van cuatro" is the invitation to open in deep reflection on our current identity. Are we all? Are all we want to be? I'm abroad and I realize how spoiled is the Mexican society when the Tlahuac incident came to light. I still can not understand viewers witnessing a mass murder of broadcasting. I almost puked when I saw some of the images. It was not Iraq or Rwanda, just a small village near Mexico City when rampage was carried out with the tolerance of media and government. The recreation of a similar situation in this film shocked me deeply. The other stories were good to present other situations of corruption, dishonesty, betrayal and violence, but I consider the "Tamales de Chivo" one the best. The film is deeper than some "cabr√≥n" and "pendejo" screams. These people are meaningless compared to the actions of the people. With a few exceptions are all perfect examples of human waste. Just like in real life honesty is becoming more exceptional than the rule of our country. In addition, honesty is merely rewarding miraculously.
