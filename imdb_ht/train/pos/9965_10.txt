Perfect for families with little children who are looking for lighthearted films that have no violence and are enthralling for the child with fun, albeit, completely corny, and adult. Not a bad movie for a low-budget work. Children will be amazed at Santa's workshop and the "magic" that allows him to enter home in fireplace that appears too small, or home with no fireplace at all! <br /> <br /> Kids are thrilled about Santa's success in the nasty devil's cave named Pitch (filling in classic red fitted with cone and tail!). They will be sympathy with the poor girl that's the biggest desire to have a little doll in love. And the poor rich man who only wants to spend time with parents forever absent. And who does not know someone in school who are just like the nasty boys who have been mobilized by Pitch to help capture Santa and ruin Christmas? In the end, all, including the nasty boys, get just what they deserve for Christmas! The movie will give children both Santa and the message of love he delivers to people around the world. /> <br />
