Read Eric's review again. It perfectly describes feeling clean for this movie so much eloquently than I ever could. I'm just writing here to encourage you to look and see it. <br /> I've seen it many years ago on TV, IFC I think. It's like a unique movie I'm reluctant to do comparisons. He was filmed in northern Mexico, somewhere in the unlucky badlands of Coahuila / Zacatecas / San Luis Potosi. This is not the Durango Sedona-like, Mexico (in John Wayne's movie) but a really staggering and wild place. I have to find the novel now to check the original location of the story. Like this, this movie is strange and wild and beautiful and strange and absolutely not for everyone. It is the kind of production that almost motivates me to study film. <br /> <br /> I have not actually forgotten this movie, it is ineligible. But over the years I forgot about her existence. I know nobody who saw it, never read it, nor see any references to it. Erendira is such a strange name, I would even forget the title. Well, I'm going to buy a copy now. <br /> ** I have since posted the post to become a big fan of Gabriel Garcia Marquez and so sorry to have it before. <br /> <br /> Relative and MsMyth comment below; The film was filmed in Mexico, but the author is Colombian and has not commented on Mexico or Mexican history in any way, although Marquez now lives in Mexico for "political" purposes. This story is universal. <br /> I'm still trying to desperately get a copy of this movie for my library. Liked the movie? You must read the story and then everything else Garcia Marquz wrote. And, by the way, the original site of the story was Colombia.
