A Life Bugs is a great movie that is not only for children, but for growns too. The story is set around a colony of ants and struggles against the evil Grasshoppers that come back each year and stealing their foods (A mirror of the Magnificent Seven). Some wonderfull computer animations and their voice are great too. You will love it !! 8 out of 10
