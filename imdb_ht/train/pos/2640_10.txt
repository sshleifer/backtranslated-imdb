Obviously, not many people have seen this movie, because no one posted any more comments. This is not a movie to be missed. After all, he won the George Peabody award as well as the Humanitas Award. Paul Winfield should have a premium for her awesome performance in this film. Eugene Logan has been a co-writer on this film for TV movie as well as being part of another movie about humanity, or loss, by being a technical adviser to Truman Capote's film The Glass House. This movie is now available on DVD. If anyone is interested, I'll post another letter saying how it was that Eugene Logan became the technician's adviser to a movie of an amazing person as Truman Capote. Thank you for reading this and I hope you will find a way to see these two movies.
