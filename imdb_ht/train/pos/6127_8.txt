Jack Frost is on a serial killer who is sentenced to death. On the way to his death sentence the prison truck that he rides to collide with a chemical tanker filled with a chemical that turns his molecules and the snow on the ground turning it into a snowman. Being a killer himself that would turn him into a killer snowman. Jack now wants revenge on the sheriff who holds it. Jack now starts his rampage all over again kill in a small town. <br /> I do not think Jack Frost has a chance to become a classic horror but it's a fun frying. Just put your brain on hold and have fun, but just do not take it too seriously.
