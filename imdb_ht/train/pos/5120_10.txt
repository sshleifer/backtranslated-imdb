Quick and simple, I love this movie. As some others mentioned, I too, I'm not from the south, do not really care for land music and never worn a cowboy hat. (I never drove around in a car with a dead body in my trunk either, but I love "Goodfellas.") This is just great movie making. Shot in an aspect ratio 2.35 and very well transferred to DVD. (The VHS was 1.33 full screen). And yes, a solid 5.1 mixes for your viewing pleasure. What can you say about this movie? <br /> It's just a great love / hatred story set in Texas, with great performance. Travolta is fantastic. The next "pulp fiction", it's the best thing she did. It was in my mind 5 for 25 years !! <br /> Check this one out !!! It's a 10 !!!!
