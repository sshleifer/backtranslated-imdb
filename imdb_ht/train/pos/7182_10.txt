I thought that for a first episode in a first series he did really well. It was really fun and I thought the actors were brilliant. I think it's a crime for anyone saying it was wrong because it looked the right time. I find it really annoying when people say it was not historically correct because it is supposed to be a Saturday night demonstration show by a boring story document so I think the costumes and settings are just right. A brilliant start and I'll love what will come next !! I talked to many in my school and they liked the show! We all think it is brilliant entertainment and has great stories going with it.
