Some commentaries on this film say it is one bad and funny and as an excellent actor as Pierre Fresnay should not have accepted the act of it. <br /> I think, just the opposite, that, even when the movie is strange and there are some weaknesses, the performance of Pierre Fresnay is so horrible that it converts the movie into something excellent. <br /> <br /> Its performance is probably the best of history. <br /> The movie itself has a very polemic scene about the divine consecration of the cabaret. <br /> For someone who does not believe a priest ?? even a single slit ?? can convert it into the blood of Christ, the scene is perhaps scarce. But for someone who has risen from a Catholic foundation, it is very emotions even though quite unpleasant. The scene of the death of the greater priest is very shocking. But it is very good to act. Pierre Fresnay turned the crazy act of murder into something that understood the temporal frenzy of his character, Morgan's tortured defret that, in this terrible way, returned to his homework.
