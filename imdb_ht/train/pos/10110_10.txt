Any story understands a site, character and conflict. Plotting characters play their own triumphal promises, and a militant character easily gives himself this. Most Ardh Satya is summarized by the same poem scripted by Dilip Chitre. The line goes - "Can I tell myself you can tell me paurush, why could you get it?" A rough translation - "The delicate balance of right & wrong (often seen on blind justice in the courts) has helplessness on one plate with great ability on another .. Is the needle in the center of a half truth?" <Bdr /> <br /> The poem is recited by Midway in the film by Smita Patil of Om Puri in a resturant. It has a great impact on the protagonist & lays the foundation for many of the later events that follow. At the end of the film, Om Puri ends up in exactly the same situation described as aptly in the poem. The film is trying hard warriors to make one-up on the poem. However, the words Chitre are too powerful, and at best, the film matches up to the poem in every aspect. <br /> <br />
