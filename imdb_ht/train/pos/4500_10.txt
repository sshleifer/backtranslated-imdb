Hunky Geordie Robson Green is Owen Springer, a young doctor who moves home to Manchester to be close to her father. Along the way, she falls for Anna, a 20-year-old woman, and who's going to be the wife of her new boss, Richard Crane. Despite the warning of his new colleagues, Owen continued to get Anna for himself, going as far as Anna's sabotage and Richard's marriage cheating. This is a romantic and luxurious romantic drama with a quick wit. The actors are superb: The Green "Prince of Students" and "Evil Evil" smolders on the screen as the craftsman, but warm-hearted Owen; Annis of "Dune" fame was alive and proved a good Green match; Kitchen, from "To Play the King" is the right threat as Richard, whose humorous missteps and snobbers underlined his mastery, building hatred for Owen. This is a perfect love triangle, and despite the foibles and blunders of our three characters, you become better acquainted with their look.
