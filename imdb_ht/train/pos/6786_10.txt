Ronald Colman provides a power performance as Tony John, a Broadway actor who can not separate his life from the Othello Shakespeare, the character he plays on stage .... Two important scenes illustrate Tony's dilemma. The first take place at Max Lasker's producer's office. Acting is a matter of talent for the practice-minded Lasker. But Donlan, Tony's friend, agrees: "No, no .. When you do it like Tony does it, and more .. This way he became someone else every night ... So completely No, do not tell me the whole system is not affected by it. "... The other scene took place in Pat Kroll's apartment apartment. Tony says his name is Martin. Thanks him. When Tony begins to repeat Othello, we learn that if he tries to keep his real life separate from his stage life, "The party begins to swing in your life, and the battle begins." Reality is not the end of the imagination. Separate: By himself Pat is Desdemona and he is Othello, and he does not believe he has turned away from him. He killed him .... Colman's brave performance, in a complex and difficult role, earns his 1947 Academy Award for best actors. Oscar nomination was attended by Ruth Gordon and Kanon Garson for Best Original Screenplay. Do not neglect Milton Krasner's atomography cinema.
