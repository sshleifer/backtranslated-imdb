<br /> <br /> Artistic shot, actors show exactly the roles. You get a real feeling watching Lucienne's rise to poverty in the most beautiful girl around. A sense of tragedy is traumatizing again. All in all I saw this film at least 10 times. And it may be very well said that the Price of the Fog '(Beauty Prize, Miss Europe) is a favorite MAJOR in my silent collection collection. The expression of Louise Brooks is perfect and I recommend this movie to anyone who appreciates artistic beauty coupled with a tragic story line.
