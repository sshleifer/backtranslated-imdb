From the first stage you are given clues about what can go on here. It becomes more and more obvious as the story rolls over. The act is excellent at all and these actors touch your soul. Even though I knew what would happen I was very skeptical of the motive. I always wondered why Ben did what he did. We could see in his face "second thoughts", but the ultimate sacrifice seemed to go against his emotions and feelings. It was a very interesting and touching story but left me confused. Perhaps that was the point in the movie. I did like the movie and Wil Smith can wrack up another good movie choice. This guy knows how to entertain a audience!
