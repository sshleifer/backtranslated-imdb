I just sit at a very enjoyable fast paced 45 min in ROLL. <br /> <br /> Roll is on a land boy, Mat (Toby Malone) whose dream has become a Sports Star. Martha travels to the city and is to be picked up by George Cousin (Damien Robertson). Well, that was the plan anyway. George is involved in a gangster, Tiny (John Batchelor) and is making a delivery for him. Needless to say, Martha gets dragged into George's world. <br /> I think it was great how Martha taught George some morals and respect while George taught Mat how to relax and enjoy life a little. Toby and Damien were thoroughly dropping together and doing an exceptional job. Each character in the movie compliments each other with beautifully, the two cops were great. David Ngoombujarra brought some great relief in the movie. Little played a likable gangster who reminded me of one of my favorite characters Pando from hand. One of the other things I liked about Roll was that it featured the cities that I grew up and lived in for 20 years, Perth and Fremantle. It was good to see clearly and landmarks that I grew up with, especially the old Ferris Wheel. <br /> <br /> Rolls this 'n' Rolls
