How does someone like this movie? I think it's a hilarious parody of all the old gangster movies; If you have never seen them, look at this instead. Michael Keaton has a ball in this role as anything to go. An English guy's guy whenever he talks to Griffin Dunn plays a clueless D.A., but my favorite role was to be Joe Piscopo. It has all the best lines. Danny DeVito, Alan Hale, Ray Walston in this star-studded movie that gangsters lamps a lot funnier than "Mafia" made for the underground criminals.
