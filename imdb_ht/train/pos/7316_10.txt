This film is one of the best of all time, certainly in the genre of terror. The claustrophobic atmosphere is exceptional, the music is just as good as the movie and the killer is as creepy as can! The actors are fantastic, RIP Donald Pleasure you were fantastic as Dr. Loomis, she made the movie even better. Without it the movie should miss a very important ingredient. Jamie Lee Curtis is also superb as our dear Queen queen! His innocence tells him of the real evil that is after him until he finds his friends brutally murdered at home, which of course is one of the best scenes films. It provides a tremendous performance. I loved this movie since it scared me like hell back when I saw it in the early 80s and I always looked it to that day as it is a wonderful movie that just brings you into this world of yours would cook like a fish at every turn! The fact that it is a simple format of a fool man in a mask of people escaping from a mental asylum and ready to kill everyone in sight without having any idea that it is there, just shocking to fool and indulge you even more in films as events even if fiction could easily come true. We all know that unfortunately evil does exist in this world and a fool man with a knife is certainly not uncommon, a very disturbing a fear fund for all of this. Death of any turn. Halloween of course shows this in the most fashionable way. Horror should be credible, and that's what makes the movie enjoyable. It's just a simple story that's made in an excellent and terrifying atmosphere. As well as the gorgeous Psycho Psycho, both of which I worship, I believe the format is the best horror being offered. For me Halloween and psychics are the best films I've ever seen and I'll watch them all my life and never grow tired of them. Halloween is undoubtedly one of the best movies ever.
