First let me tell the director to have some wonderful titles in his established shots. I really love them. I really enjoyed this movie but I came to say next to Pierce Brosnan, Greg Kinear is pretty subtle. Brosnan dissolves into this character so well, that it is really hard to remember that this is the same guy who has played bail. It also shows its series and depth as an actor. It's kind of an indie flick and it's really nice to see mostly with all mainstream movies that flooded the films at this time of the year. I found the characters to be well crafted. The twist in the middle I felt was especially good. I also love how the characters come from realistically. So many times we have the films of caricatures of people who are not really character but walk-stereotypes ... I love these different different films. I think of aside when I think of this movie but I think this is more watchable and a better movie overall ...
