I got this movie from Netflix after a long time waiting, so I anticipated it very much when it happened. My worst fears were that it would plodding, as well as ... well, you know what all the fan screaming girls were scared about? GACKTnHYDE = Is yaoi like? That sort of thing? Hungry it. I was very, very jolly surprised. The film was amazing to look, even though filming and the music made it feel like someone who was going to bust out a pair of now-each-two layers, and acting on Gackt's party was quite good. Hyde, being, around, Hyde, acted as a member of Kasi-Romantic friends / gang members that anyone who saw him on stage would hardly be surprised by. It is one of my biggest beef and the movie itself. But the rest of the cast (including the children's actors at the opening stage) were very good at doing what they did - that was, mostly, to get injected with the call. But my second problem was very minor, it had to do with the goriness. It seemed too much suspension-my horror as every scene where someone shot them either slumped, really sincerely dead, or lying there grabbing for a time instead. But just ... get the shots, repeat, chicks, bubbles a lot while talking and make Hyde crying. All in all, if you're a fan of any of the actors or just a j-movie fan, it's definitely worth a look.
