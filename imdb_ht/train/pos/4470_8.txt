Like the "city," this sailing music on riverside side falls short of the classic later in terms of rhythm and the quality of the songs but has its own charm. Kelly has three fabulous dance routines: one with Jerry the cartoon mouse of "Tom and Jerry" fame, one with a girl, and a fantasy sequence where he is a Spanish lover determined to reach lady him on a high balcony. Shyness, Kelly's shy play, inexperienced friends, and Grayson, the woman who serves as the love interest for both men, makes most of the song. Iturbi gives some fine piano plays. In almost two and a half hours, it is a bit too long for a light music but it does not drag.
