I spent the past week watching John Cassavetes film - starting with 'a woman under the influence' and ending on 'night opening'. I am completely and completely hauled, in particular by the two films. From the first minute to the last of 'night opening' I was completely and completely absorbed. I only experienced her on a few occasions but felt that this movie was perfect lasting two-thirds, the right until the credit came. Everything about this movie, in its way of shooting, incredible performance at Gena Rowlands, the credits, the opening, the music, the plot, the essence of the depth, the pace, the tenderness, the originality, the characters, the small clay moment .... for me, it's really sublime. I could not agree more with the previous comment on taking it to a desert island because the sheer depth of this movie is something to see. If you are unlucky enough to have a fire house, I guarantee that instead of making a past attempt attempts to rescue that catcher of money under your bed, you will salvage copy of this movie instead.
