In general I should say that I liked the movie. Some of the battle scenes are really good. Especially fighting against Leung Ka-Yan. One point that really bothered me was the fact that they used an Asian to play a black man. I mean really. Talk about bad taste. During a battle scene, you see one of the fighters on the floor is laughing. Otherwise, Bruce Lee's sampling copy will move perfectly. 5 out of 10 Stars.
