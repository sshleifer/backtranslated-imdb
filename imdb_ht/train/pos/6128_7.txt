Yes this is a horror class B-. But at least the producers, directors, and cast does not pretend to flick the film is manna from the sky. The plot is corny, a serial psychotic killer on his way to execution is projection and genetic genetics turning it into a snow man. The Snowman a.k.a Jack Frost then goes on a rampage killing to find the small town sheriff who finally arrested him. With a budget that limits the crew had to do with special special effects, most of the money appeared to pass on the snowman's suit. Particullary hard shots are managed by animated cartons or boiler vaccine (vaccines where the camera moves to back up the details). <br /> <br /> This is film by the kid and should not be confused with Disney movie at the same title. If you do not let your child watch pg-13 movies alone than parents should not let the children watch this movie. This movie has two claims to fame. 1. The Beatiful Shannon Elizabeth (American Pie) made his first film role. The scene where Jack Frost attacked Shannon Elizabeth is worth watching a few times. 2. This movie has the worst butter ever. The joke is so bad that the credit directors spot the joke in the credit list.
