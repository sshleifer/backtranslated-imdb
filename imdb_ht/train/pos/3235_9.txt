Excellent film, a realistic picture of contemporary Finland, touching and deepening. One of the best Finnish films ever made. Capture wonderful daily life in a small town center of Finland, human desires and weaknesses, joys and sorrows. The bright sun early earlier creates a cool atmosphere of this sane quiz of people in a welfare society. Lampela is one of the most promising Finnish cremers. It shows that it is possible to make movies cinema without machine gun and blood flow. His next film Eila is also worth seeing although the story of cleaning women battle for their work is not quite as universal appeal as the destinies of Joki.
