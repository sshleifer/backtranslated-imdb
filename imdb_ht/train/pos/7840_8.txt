BOOGIE is a real 'get' - though a stone fan for nearly thirty years, I only first saw the movie a few days ago, and ran through the top rock movie of all time; The awesome music (T. Rex's cream) and visuals are always interesting and strange, leaving this viewer craving any more than directing efforts of Ringo Starr, who did a fine job here. If you like the music, you will be in T. Rextasy everywhere, as Marc Bolan really is the star of the piece, front and center. Even the fact that some songs are repeated does not matter a bit: different venues, costumes, music arrangements, and rare visual concepts are all used to lend different textures and a great deal of optimism humor to what might have ended as' only 'a concert movie from the other hand. As rich and full of charging as occurred in BOOGIE, the movie is only about an hour long, but what is totally satisfied. Then my only criticism lies - the video package is something like 71 minutes, and at least one online source claiming the movie to be 67 minutes, but apparently it's more like 61 minutes of fun.
