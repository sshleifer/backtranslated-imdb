Rudy did it again with this hot street strolling up to Dolemite. This entry is filled with victims of Rudy Ray Moore raunch, humorous and martial. Rudy eludes a sophisticated wheel-neck sulfur in this movie which also features a sad scene where Rudy dives down a steep hill. See it for laughs and for a brain-explosive hit of Blaxploitation magic.
