My girlfriend and I have something for robots. So I try to find movies with robots. And this movie has robots. Great people. They swore the oath and bang out of each other, and the fate of nations hung in the balance. It's really cool. You have to pardon this movie of its many shortcomings and just try to appreciate what the director and his crew of technicians could put on the screen while working and that was obviously a tight budget. It is very difficult for this film to flu. Because of these great robots. They looked like transformers and fight like stomach! She made my girlfriend smile. And that's right for me. And special mention must be made of character veteran character Paul Koslo: as the Russian maniacal, if he is pity stomping on his discouraging opponents after being already handed over or complaining being close to his proximity to a bar that caused vodka It's flavored "like blood" (a line he delivers with an unforgiving accentuing sub-Bela Lugosi camp) it is clearly there is a ball and movie of great benefits whenever it is on screen. This is a nifty little flip that deserves its cult reputation.
