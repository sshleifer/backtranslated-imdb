I know a lot of people do not like this movie, but I just think it is adorable. There's not much I can say, but the movie is a feel-good movie I guess. The songs are beautiful, the beautiful costumes, the beautiful voices, and there are many funny lines in the movie, especially as Briggitta learns about the making and not in society. If you like music, I would say you would like this one!
