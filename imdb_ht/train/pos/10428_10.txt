Amazing movie that, in theory, should be boring but is deliberate and acting subtlety and incredible that I have long desperate to ever find. Instead of relying on clich√© and overly dramatizing the time scheme unfolds in a series of incredible realistic moments. Lead characters are not perfect, and so related to them as those you might know is unlikely. The movie is not trying to crack, or push an ideal to the audience, but simply shows us the possibility of true love in any circumstance. <br /> I'm now restless waiting for the weekend so I can see the end. A moving, spooky thought, funny look at love that I think should be an absolute classic romantic up with Casablanca and Breakfast in Tiffany's. Will soften the same toughest heart.
