Finally a thriller that removes cars from chases, explosions and other eye catching effects. The film combines a simple scheme (assassination of a French president) and an excellent background. He takes a look at the behavior and authority, and explains why we would obey almost all the orders (even killers) that would give us. <br /> <br /> In addition it shows us how secret services can manipulate running in history and how they can be controlled. The best thing about this movie is, that there is no classic "Hollywood end" that can easily be predicted.
