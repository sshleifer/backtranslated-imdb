One winter day, December 28, 1986, two 14 year old bored to hire a movie. "Hmmmm, Police History, looks interesting", "who's Jackie Chan?", "Never heard about it." Two hours later after watching the movie, in a maze, we wanted to know more. 16 years later (and serious out of pocket from collecting JC movies!) The movie still grabs me like no other. Ok, maybe I have a soft spot for it as it was "my first" (Cannonball Run does not count !!) JC movie, but it's an excellent movie. It has all the JC Classic components, Action, Humor, Action, Heart and Action! Some comments say he dated, he did in 1985, of course he's dating! But then so be jaws, casablanca, singin 'in the rain and the godfather !!!!!! Without movies like police history where would Hollywood actions be today? PS set standards, many staged a scene stolen for use in other movies. To really fully appreciate it you must see it in widespread, you miss a lot of the otherwise movie (yes, it really falls the bus will round the corner!). If you have not already, watch this movie now !!!! <br /> <br />
