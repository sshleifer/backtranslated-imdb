This is not 'Bonnie and Clyde' or 'Thelma and Louise' but it is a fine road film. It sets its two main characters slowly and easily. viewers learn the hidden tension quickly, which is a tribute to the principal. The French-speaking young man (and English) wants to do well in France, has a French and alcoholic girlfriend, party as a young man. And he is Moroccan Arabic (and French) father who devoutly follows his Muslim faith, with generosity and the wisdom of the elders and rejects the new culture surrounding him (such as mobile phones). The film was able to explore extremely powerful policies - driving in odd couples to the former Yugoslavia, to Turkey and then in the Middle East to get to Mecca. these are areas where Muslim population was involved in war, repression, ethnic cleansing; where dictators have been pursuing torture and resume executions to maintain power and place of religious communities in constant harm to each other. Again the movie moves through the sides with the possibilities and only suggestions in these agendas. The relationship between the two is the key to this movie, and faith, politics are the series. It seems to be saying that we are all, and need to understand and care for each other in order to manage assets in this world. It certainly is not 'natural killer' and is all the best for it.
