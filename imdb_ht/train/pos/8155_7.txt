I'm too familiar (or care) exactly what the difference between rap and hip-hop is. And, being Canadian, it's possible that I've never seen MTV, but I'm not sure. <br /> But I thought this movie was very funny when I saw it, a bright little satire. Hip-hop culture is so ubiquitous these days that it's hard not to hear about it on and off. (If only we could say the same about wide music.) I got most of the jokes (at least I think I did). Sure, it was derived from Tap Spinach, but there are many of the targets that could stand a pipeline treatment. Just by the woodwork, they are sacred.
