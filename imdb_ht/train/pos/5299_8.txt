Once you can get past the movie title, "Pecker" is a great movie, perhaps one of John Waters' best. A wonderful cast, led by strong performances by Edward Furlong and Christina Ricci, makes the story very funny, and very real. Some shocking scenes are definitely not suitable for small children, but are for a reason. Unfortunately this film was not mass produced, and most of the public will deny the opportunity to see it. If the opportunity hits, then go see this movie.
