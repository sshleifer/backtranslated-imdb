Definitely one of the most witty and twisted-men I have ever seen. Christopher Reeve and Micheal Caine were brilliant and kept me going to the whole affair. <br /> <br /> Very stylish set pieces and accessories are really borrowing a sense of atmosphere in the procedures. The minimalist feel it works for the whole picture. <br /> <br /> I only complain is not with the movie itself, but the lack of a decent and decent edition of the movie on DVD. I own the fullscreen version (which proves I love the movie enough to hold fullscreen presentation firm) but a deluxe edition or 'special' would most probably get my cash.
