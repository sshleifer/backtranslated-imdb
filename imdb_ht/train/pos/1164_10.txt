I saw this movie when it first came out. It was an official selection for the Temecula Valley International Film Festival and I voted for her for the best photos. <br /> <br /> Justine Priestley is warm as psychotic, but Amanda's complex. This is not your ordinary psycho movie. Many of the interesting and original slopes on the genre. The sort of "Fatal Attack" for the youngest and some great musical music mixed in as the object of Amanda's affection is marrying a singer up and coming blues with less time for her husband as his career. <br />
