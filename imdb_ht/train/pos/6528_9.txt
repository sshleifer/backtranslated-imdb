I saw this documentary at the Film Festival Cannes, in a small 200-seat Cinema at the top of the main building at Cannes Film Festival. I was absolutely in it. I love the blend of awesomely made fictional scene. It is amazing set-design. The scenes look really like being filmed in 1920ies or 1930ies. <br /> <br /> And the music is so beautiful. <br /> I evaluate this 9/10 experience. / / * Front Deposit * <br /> <br /> The documentary tells about fabulous blues-man, and black-and-white old-looking scene of the black man playing the guitar with songs. It is really amazing. But this mixes into new ones and that is perhaps one thing I might be influencing in this documentary. It is used too abundant in the link to modern rock-rock playing these Blues songs in a modern way. I did not really appreciate how trashed them into playing like scary singing blues. This is the same type of un-perfect music music I found when watching Wim Wenders Buena Vista Social Club. <br /> <br /> The documentary was such a stand-up in the first screening of the little cinema, which the next day this documentary showed for everyone and the usual tourist on the Croisette's beach in the open- time. Even though the sand, quality of the projection and the bad quality of the sound probably made it a tough experience to enjoy for thousands of people who were sitting in the sand that night.
