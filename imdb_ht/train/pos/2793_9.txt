It is such a shame that because of this title films will be avoided by those who hate football. Folding it like Beckham is more than a cheese sports sticker. Lines of the touch and intelligent story without sopot, the jokes laughed loudly, and the characters are well-acting. Parminder Nagra and Keira Knightley are brilliant as teenagers Jess and Jules, wearing great performance both on and off the pitch. Anupam Kher is wonderful as Jess's father's concerns, and Jonathan Rhys-Meyers, who was so amazingly wrong at 'Ride with the Devil,' coming to all well as the guy handsome for once, making all the use of accents her gorgeous Irish! Even if you do not like football, go to this movie. If anything it will make you smile.
