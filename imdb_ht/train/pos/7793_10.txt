My brother brought this movie to the venue store and I remember expecting it to be like a do. I think the title specifically puts me there. I can never remember starting a movie with these low expectations and being so completely over. I watched the movie twice before I left my brother taking it back to the store. It's often a movie that tells me the way the one did. I was completely caught up in Ruby's situation as she tries to make his way into her life. The bad thing about this movie is that it seems to end so quickly. I could keep watching for hours. Another concern is that I have been dissatisfied with everything Ashley Judd has been doing since. She is so perfect in this movie. This movie is easy in my top ten favorites of all time.
