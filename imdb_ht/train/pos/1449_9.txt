This is one of the best crime-drama movies during the late 1990s. It was filled with a great cast, a powerful storyline, and many of the players involved gave great performance. Pacino was great; it should be named for something. John Cusack was good too, as long as the viewer did not mind his Louuu-Siana accent. It may come as annoying if you can not stop this dialect. The way Pacino's characters interact with Cusack's character were credible, dramatic, and slightly comical at times. Danny Aiello was superb as always. David Paymer was great in a support role. Bridget Fonda was good but not memorable. There were times when this picture mentioned many characters, probably too many. It can take a second look to remember, "what Zapatti was that?" After many cross-references, one stopped and thoughtfully just reminded. The finish did not have a lot of sting. It was built up for long and then was a bit of a deception. This was one of the few issues with the movie. Since the movie has not been billed as a "big, blockbuster" big hit screen, he made some forget that this movie itself existed. Pacino and Aiello were great but the movie's lack of "splash" in theaters could count for no nomination. It was semi-success in the home market, and viewers are still learning that the title is here. Made in 1996, he still stands up today and will remain popular for many years to come. So make yourself some lemon pudding (you'll see) and see this movie!
