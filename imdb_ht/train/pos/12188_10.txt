Most genius engineering wells make one of the largest in movies. Welles are drawn to a murderous plot only to be set up as the guy falls, which is what he refers to with the sarcastic comment "my great egg." Draws so complex that I still do not know if the victim knew that his life was about to be lost. The shooting scene of the carnival hall of mirrors is one of the most amazing amazing films. That alone is worth the cost of admission. This is the only time that Rita Hayworth has ever played a complex yet credible character. No one, but Welles would have had the nerve off his hair and his brassy brassy ink. No one should miss this picture.
