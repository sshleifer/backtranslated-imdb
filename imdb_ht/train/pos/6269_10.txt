A wonderful surprise! I expect a further slope on the line: The Rock (9) -> Con Air (7) -> Armaggeddon (4). Especially for an unplanned film. Maybe this is the reason why some approve this new type of Bruckheimer fare. Intelligent dialog instead of snappy one-material, decent background / motivation instead of shaking stereotypes shake-n-cook and when the chase came you really thirst for it. Fanboys awaits Armageddon rouser: stay away. This is one for the more intelligent action fans. He did not even bother me Jolie appeared for little.
