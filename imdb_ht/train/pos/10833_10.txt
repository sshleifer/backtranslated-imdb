This movie makes me cry in the end! I watch at least 3-4 movies a week. I saw loads of great movies, even more crap - they themselves. But when ending the scene - catharsic in his core - I was crying! But if you did not - you have serious problems! The story is archetypal - nothing new or original. But it's real - because that sort of things really happened and that people really exist. Glam is not my sort of music, but I really admire all that goes in the early 70's ... At some point this led me toward Velvet Goldmine! Docudramas never really work very well. But this movie really meked we believe it all ... Because they do not try to make it as a full path to glorious concerts, presenters who are superheroes, girls who are stupid and emotionally numb, do not praise drugs and alcohol, they promote rehabilitation and redemption that comes even 20 late ... Once again great movie. Since "leaving Las Vegas" I have never been so moved by a movie.
