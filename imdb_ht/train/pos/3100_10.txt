At the end of the first hour, my jaw was nestled comfortably between my feet. The movie is never, and I mean never, lets up the action. It may be a serious action but his actions. Once again every member of the cast fits perfectly. The explosions were realistic, the pursuit scenes were possible, and the fight was incredible. Matt Damon will be forever Jason Bourne. <br /> All I really said is that every Bourne film gets better and this is no exception. The action, the stakes, the plot. How to do it I will never know. I applaud the person who wrote the screen to play in each of these movies. Because if he did not do such a great job with the first movie, we would not have this one to talk about. <br /> So do not go to the theater, go to his experience in the theater if it's still out of place, but if it's not December 11, Bourne comes home!
