No waste - no place even near garbage. Not an original? what is the last thing that could be said in "2.4 kids" .Predizable? certainly not! Although it was a bit of a weird series for the BBC, it was hilarious, funny, and witty. I particularly liked Belinda Lang and John Pickard - who I believe preformed wonderfully.Gary olsen was also very good and that all the members were thrown away .. I was never quite new why she could be shaded until reading here today on Gary Olsen's death at a relatively young age. I want them to make more of the comedy of this type, the more they (and show them here in Israel) .Over way!
