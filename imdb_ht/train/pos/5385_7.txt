I have never seen the 'Next Action Hero' show, and until the other comments are here, did not know that this movie was 'priced' in this competition. I just fluttered channels and came across this, and found myself watching, dare, all the way to the end. <br /> Yes, the draw was made (the most dangerous game, etc.), but I was hoping for, and almost got, the 'gotcha' - how the protagonist was going to beat the hunter in the end. I think the high tech was overdone (GPS) and gave me fridge-sweat to recover at night rider, but it was not too overstated. The basic problem I had with this movie was the degree of SOD (Suspension of Disbelief) that required the viewer. Do we really think that someone flying to a helicopter can proclaim countless incense grenades at a public bridge and NO COPS show up to investigate? Could a limousine make countless donuts at a Las Vegas intersection with NO COPS show up? Pleitease. Way too much of that kind of thing - fun to watch, but keep it at least compelling, thank you very much. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The final solution was good, but the finish was disappointing, At least now I understand why the act was so cheesy - except for Zane, who does not get close to many jobs as she deserved IMHO - being winners from a reality show. <br /> <br /> Raising me out.
