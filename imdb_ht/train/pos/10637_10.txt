Harem Suare is the best movie I've seen in the year 2000. Bravo Ferzan Ozpetek. Sensually injection and stunningly described, Harem Suare is a bold film that tackles intermittent romance, which is such a taboo in Hollywood. Women in all shapes, sizes, and colors, populate the movie. Cut out to the outside world, women entertain each other by telling stories about intriguing rivalry, and jealous of the ranks.
