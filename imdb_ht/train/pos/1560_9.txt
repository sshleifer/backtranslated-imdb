This is a meeting, a team, and a great episode of Justice. From the resolve to resolve, Clark has made a significant growth from a troubled teenager who was scared of a destined controller, in a superman that, like Green Arrow, sets aside his emotions in some of his loved ones, ready to save the entire planet. This is not just a thrilling story of teamwork, loyalty, and friendship; This is also about deciding what's most important in life, a lesson for Clark. I do not want the series to finish, but I hope that the episodes that will be strictly stick to what Justice shows without any "rewind" push and put a good end here in Smallville --- with a wonderful start at Superman. <br /> In this episode, however, we should have seen more contrasts between Lex and the Team. Nine stars should provide enough credit.
