This is a movie about deep and unspoken people. <br /> <br /> Eventually they come to talk, but there is a chance to change anything about the situation. <br /> <br /> Originally made in Shanghai 1948 and quite free from the movie propagation introduce us to the Dai family. There are still some weight on the story surrounding the family. History usually has the weight of Chinese literature and serious films. A young couple married - Liyan, an invalid, and his wife, Yuwen, lives in a large family compound that is partially ruined. <br /> <A bright contrast is Liyan's younger sister who can not really remember the past of the family but to accept everything in a natural way. Her mind is as bright as the other two are reserved. <br /> In this apparently stable world comes an unexpected visitor ... <br /> I ended up feeling sad but definitely a superior movie.
