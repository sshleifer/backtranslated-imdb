This is one of the great movies in the 80s MY collection that I think about all the time. <br /> <br /> The Running Man is one of the best and most different films Arnold even to this day and when I saw the first runner I was so excited to see a movie like this. I just worship all of the battles and this is really a special movie. She also had Jesse Ventura, legendary teacher Toru Tanaka, Sven-Ole Thorsen, the beautiful Maria Conchita Alonso, Yaphet Kotto, Kurt Fuller, Richard Dawson, and Thomas Rosales Jr. which seems to still love death in his movies because he was killed in the films as Universal Thread, the Lost World, Robot Cop 2, Predator 2, and among others. All Arnold fans should love this movie from the beginning to the end because its action is packed, full stars, and its one one of Arnold`s best to date!
