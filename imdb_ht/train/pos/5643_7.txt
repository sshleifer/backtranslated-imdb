Mary Pickford ("Born in the Fourth July" as Angela Moore) is the "Little American" (in French heritage); He fell in love with Jack Holt (like Karl Von Austreim), who had moved to America with his German father and Indian mother. French-American Raymond Hatton (as Count Jules of Destin's "Destiny Fighting") fell in love with Mrs. Pickford. Triangles like triangles eventually wind up in France, and the Great War (World War I, in retrospect) complicated their lives considerably. A particularly fun, if propagandistically flawed, Cecil B. DeMille movie. Torpedo, and sinking, to a pickling pickup ship is "Titanic" -like. The war intrigue gets dramatically as Pickford slowly gets an infiltrate spy for France, while the Germans occupy his ancestral home. Of course, Holt German lover came. It was hard to believe that they had long been recognizing each other as he moved in for the rape, but it was dark; and, previous events believed to each other to die. The movie goes WAY on-the-top of its symbolism. Pickford was, by the way, Canadians - though, some could deny it was not a "Little American", for all intentions and purposes. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />! The more memorable movie: Pickford and the wounded soldier salute each other as it is taken by him on a bed. Novarro even came to Mary Pickford to write a letter for her; Obviously, having a future in the pictures. Also future-bound is Ben Alexander, who plays the boy "Bobby"; he became a dependable child actor and grew up to become a partner of Jack Webb on "Dragnet". The Little American (7/12/17) Cecil B.
