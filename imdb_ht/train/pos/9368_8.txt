I just returned from a screening couple a couple of hours ago, and I was very happy with the movie when I left it. It's very intense, and the closer I came to cry in a movie in quite some time. This is a credit Adam Sandler, who delivers a magnificent performance at various levels, and who probably deserves an Oscar nominee for her, has not come out early in the year. Don Cheadle provides his superb performance to play the straight man in Adam's destitution. Here are some humor, but most of it is really just funny in comparison to moments of tearjerking, as Adam deals with his losses and Don wrestling to help him. Adam plays two levels very well ... when it is mentally stable it is funny and likable, but when it is, well, less stable it's powerful and dark. <br /> I recommend it to anyone who loves intense mental drama about hard friendship and loss.
