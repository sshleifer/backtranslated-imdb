I was all ready to lean this episode, seeing that 'Master' really does not have any horror movie under his belt .. but this is the easiest episode of the season. good !! I do not know how he complained, but we had some real talent in this episode! And while you could see things from a mile away from wise scheme, at least it was fun and managed to keep me engaged for the full 56 mins, something that was missing up to this point in the series. /> I especially liked the bit of the end, not a twist for every say, but just a little funny where it gets, like ever, the mother-pecked cow. <br /> <br /> really good effort. As I said in other reviews - these are not true masters doing so much of the episodes .. but they can be a final day of being in the future.
