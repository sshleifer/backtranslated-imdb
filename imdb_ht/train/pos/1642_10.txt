Do not see the movie since first released, but it was memorable. Performance by Rip Torn and Conchata Farrell was superb, excellent photography, moving story lines and anything else about it in the highest standards. But it seems they were pretty much forgotten <br /> Maybe because UK is an odd market for it but I have not seen the movie on TV or video, which is sad. Was he more successful in the US where he could be right to see as a quite accurate historical drama? <br /> Always rule out that 50% of a good movie is the music and though I'm not sure I think the title title was a simple but moving solo clarinet in "What a friend we have in Jesus". The movie then went on to misunderstand it! Am I right or wrong?
