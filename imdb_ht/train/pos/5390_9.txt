Life begins is a nice pre-cinema movie starting some of the best in the era. She puts her in the maternity ward in a hospital, particularly in the bedroom for women to expect problems. In it is an older woman, a single unmarried mother (Glenda Farrell), a young female sentence, an Italian woman, and the main character (Loretta Young) who spent 20 years in prison for murder. Her husband (Eric Linden) is in the hospital at every second painful to know that everything will be okay. Aline MacMahone plays the nurse who is great at her job. <br /> <br /> This movie is very interesting and fun. It is not very shocking in any way, but it is interesting to see such a neglected topic on the silver screen. The act is brilliant all around. Loretta Young is gorgeous here in his prime. Eric Linden from nowhere and is sincere as he can. Her innocence is reminiscent of Michael J. Fox. Glenda Farrell is great as always, a staple of pre-code and for good reason.
