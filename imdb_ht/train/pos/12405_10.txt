Taken this movie in over 1990 on video by chance and without knowing what I was in for. Many horror fans might miss this thought it was a typical practice movie and those who found it did not like it as it did not want to see. The above mentioned factors are probably the reason it's rated, but just ignore it and give it a whirlpool if you're a fan of the genre. <br /> It has strong costumes in all departments from script and atmosphere to act on the prison itself. <br /> An absolute diamond, a movie I still have on video that day. Look at that.
