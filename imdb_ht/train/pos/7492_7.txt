Though not a horror movie in traditional sense, this movie climbs little to deliver goods. It looks like a loose vampire in a small German town spreading its victims in their blood. Police officer Karl Brettschneider, Melvyn Douglas in one of his early roles, is skeptical to believe a crazy killer by a vampire running amok. The only one who believes it is Ruth Bertin (Faye Wray) the Inspector's girlfriend and assistant laboratory of Dr. Otto von Niemann (Lionel Atwill) who though apparently an eminent scientist goes along with the vampire theory. The townspeople suspiciously weirdo Herman Gleib, played with his usual frenzy by Dwight Frye who seems to be very fun with his role. The film has quite a bit of humor that helps to alleviate some of the intensity involved and all the murders committed. A funny party has Gussie Schnappmann (Maude Eburne), Ruth Bertin's aunt, thinking bizarre Herman was turned away from a stick, but in a dog. Maude Eburne and Dwight Frye make a good comedy team. This budget film brings to the element from the "Cabinet of Dr Caligari" and Dr. Niemann using the power of suggestions to make a somnambulist carry out his orders, from "Frankenstein" using without human in helping create life in the laboratory, and "Dracula" since the dead are believed by everyone except the inspector and his girl to be the work of a bloodsucker. Thses elements are mixed well by director Frank R. Strayer and a little comedy thrown in for good measurements. Concerns are working. The restored version I see it uses tint to increase the spooky atmosphere. So try to see this version if possible.
