I said despite revisiting Angels at the Outfield was a very good movie. I love the fact that it teaches children to always have faith and never give up because yes miracles can happen. Unlike the other baseball movies this one particular film stood out because of striking amazing special effects and quite worst sounds that were very interesting. Though I liked this movie, it had some flaws like some petrol (meaning that when Ray Mitchell struck a homer he did not step on the plate and therefore would not be a note. But that's just nitpicking.) I said I was really impressed with this film and moral presence: Just have faith, do not give up.
