I must agree with MR. Caruso Jr. Lanza, was the voice of God that voice was offered if only he could get courage to leave for Hollywood leaving headlong to the opera he could all Americans Caruso say he could but in any case he is A fantastic introduction to the art form has no bone on it and if this way it will be for it. watch the movie you will see why Mr Lanza still comes to discussions even in my house. Someone says Pavarotti I say MARIO LANZA.As for the movie itself when it will be on DVD to have it restored and VHS is not good enough but this should also be the only Lanza movie put on other DVDs down right bad and boring.
