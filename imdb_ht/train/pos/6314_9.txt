I went to the movies with two of my friends, and choosing this movie out of hat, totally does not know what to expect. And it turns out to be a very enjoyable, dead-laughing experience! It is an excellent film with very unexpected stories, very good dialogue and crazy humor. All the characters obviously made of "Alan Ford" (Italian satirical comic) style, but this was not bothered me for the second time. In fact this kind of loser-bums line-up made a quite unique and interesting movie. Sam Rockwell has given very good and convincing role, Willian Macy also, Clooney is hardly recognizable and brilliant. But real stars are actually Guzman. He has a role in his life in this movie! The scene when his character Cosimo died in the movie, so hilarious that he made me choke and almost died with him! Highly recommended for all "Alan Ford" fans!
