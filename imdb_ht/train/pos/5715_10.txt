Karen goes to a Japanese home as a nurse to replace Emma, ​​a strange woman who sleeps in the day and wakes up at night. Karen goes upstairs after hearing noise when he meets a scary ghost. It will learn the secrets of the house. <br /> It is very scary! The scenes are shocking and scary! Characters are good. Setting is crawling. I love the whole plot! The end was shocking! I stayed in a scene where the boy was so tired that the man get over his sister, and I was shocked. This is the scary movie I watched. I did not see the Japanese version. I recommend this horror fanatic. 10/10 and 5 stars!
