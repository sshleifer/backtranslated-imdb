Richard Linklater's mix of youthful romance and Paris Horses is one of the 90 best movies in movies. Julie Delpy turns into one of the most committed performances of the next decade as the Parisian couple who spend a day with a strange-on-a-train Ethan Hawke. The dialogue (and many of it) is sometimes shorter and very precious, but this portrait of young wannabe-lovers makes a romantic, intellectual, and spiritual connection to each other is full of beautiful, fun, touch and perspicaces moments.
