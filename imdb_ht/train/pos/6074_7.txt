Laurence Fishburne is a fine actor, and deserves to try this, but not in a class with the great Shakespeareans like Olivier and Welles; and it suffers from Kenneth Branagh. This Irishman, still brilliant, is the thief of the show. Olivier acknowledged that the potential of his production and cast Iago and someone he knew he was able to stand. I did not almost realize the possibilities of Iago, Shakespeare's worst character, but Branagh shows us the depths. Nice to see their views in Venice, too.
