Every time I see most of the reviews called 'a firefight for Eddie Murphy'. These critics want to take a look at some of the things they are doing these days, and maybe soften their positions in retrospect ... "The Golden Child" is not highbrow entertainment, but thanks to some of the cast it breathes new life in Old Clichees, and gave Murphy one of his best roles. I do not understand the lack of irritation of 'love' for its efforts at all. Perhaps it was released at a time when the facility grew weary of knockout, thrill-a-minute adventures? Steven Spielberg started her with Indiana Jones; it's unfair to make this one a scapegoat when most of its major sins are also completely harmless. There is nothing wrong with trying to capitalize on trends. <br /> It's funny, but even an occasional observer should be able to understand that 'ridiculous' is where Hollywood's idea of ​​mystic begins and ends. What's more important than credibility and a story like this is that the audience has fun travel guides but they show up the mysterious sights. Michael Ritchie and Eddie Murphy fit the bill for this fine just fine. My advice is to buy the ticket and take the ride.
