I swear, that zombie has killed twice, and keep coming back. I gave this movie an 8th. Let's face it folks, this is exactly what other reviews are saying, so a "handy-cam," film was shot. Hey, hey, hey, welcome to the movie Indy Make Up. The fact that Todd Sheet had over 700 zombies appeared in this film is a tribute to his talent. Yes, the story has gaps, yes, we see the same zombies over and over again, but who really cares? Take it for what it is, a fun movie movie superstar, one to share with your bud, or gross out the people you really care about LOL. Lean out people, I suppose you all love dogs in trash like "Titanic" or "Twister" instead. Peace, and independent film support to do !!!
