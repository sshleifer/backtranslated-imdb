Ten from the 11 short films in this film is masterpiece (I found only the Egyptian irresponsible person). Very, all but Mexican teachers have chosen to show people or groups in connection with 9-11: Afghan refugees, deaf, Palestinian, Srebrenica, AIDS widows and poverty and corruption in Africa, Pinochets coup and ensuing blood, bomb release suicide attacks in Israel, paranoid-hit and state-persecuted Muslim Americans in the USA, old people living alone, and the consequences of WWII at the heart of Asian soldiers. This would be a sad thing about the boundaries of sympathy, in both ways: the directors might feel that Americans ignore their pain in the rest of the world and only take care of their own tragedy, while effectively doing the same and short films. br> <br /> Surprise myself, I found Sean Penn piece of one of the best of the collection, and *** SPOILER AHEAD *** I also guess her portrait of Ernest Borgnine as a half- crazy old man vegetation in a New York flat whose life lives most widow when the Sun shines through his window after the WTC "dropped out of the way light", I guess this might be one of the most offensive as The American general hearing would see it.
