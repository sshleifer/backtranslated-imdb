A powerful movie is wonderful. You are born into a flu death once you let yourself get involved in the story. A successful dentist, Alan Johnson (Don Cheadle), tore into a life-long crisis swinging career with his family. He remarks his former colonel Charlie Fineman (Adam Sandler) and wants to touch the base. He finds that Charlie, who lost his wife and family in the 9-11 attack on America, is not in touch with reality ... chooses to involve his mind with his favorite music in the past and video games. The old colonies recanted their friends and strengthened their old bond. Johnson has his friend Angela Oakhurts (Book Tyler), a psychiatrist, to try and bring Charlie out of sorrow ... but Alan is accomplished in finding his friends from his deep darkness. Jada Pinkett Smith plays Johnson's wife. Writer and director Mike Binder play Charlie's attorney / guardian role. Also at the disposal: Safran Burrows, Donald Sutherland, Adell Model and Robert Klein. Outstanding soundtrack presents love of Bruce Springsteen, Graham Nash, Pear Jam and Pretenders. <br /> <br /> NOTE: I've never been a Sandler fan; but I found it outstanding in this role. In some of the scenes, I was thinking loudly ... why he never approached playing singer / songwriter Bob Dylan in a biopic.
