Speaking about an explosion opening, "Trampa Enfernal" has the coolest openings ever! Guided by the tone of music that maybe a little inspired by the theme "Friday 13th" theme (Tsh-Tsh-Ha-Ha-Ha), the names of the lead players appear on the screen scroll up into giant syllables. Interior promotion of a totally bleak slasher / backwood sane survives and it only gets cooler and every minute. Two highly competitive and testosterone-over-loaded enemy paintballs challenge each other in the ultimate confrontation in a slaughtered bar. According to a newspaper article, there is a loose wild bear in the woods nearby and has already killed multiple of the hunters who tried to catch it. The challenge includes that anyone who kills the bear will declare the ultimate jigsaw hero with the largest set of balls. When they arrive, however, it quickly becomes evident they are not up against a bear, but a veteran war vicious and really maniacal and quite an arsenal of weapons in his cache and tricks many combs up his sleeve. After a whole decade of bleeding and indiscriminate bleeding Americans, the Mexican early 90's looks resemble feeling very refreshing and vivid. The formula is simplistic but effective, the lead characters are possible enough and the building up towards the confrontation with the sadistic killer is reasonably suspense. The Maniac must have been a fan of Freddy Krueger and Michael Myers, as it also uses a self-made glove and sharp knife attached to it with a white mask to cover his face. The killers are nasty and barbarous fun, which I really hope for since awesome awesome opening sequences, and garbage a whole lot of blood free. The forest environment and particularly the spectacular jungle camouflage traps. "Internal Trampa" is a hit Mexican slasher / survivor who comes in romantic recommendations to the fans of the genre.
