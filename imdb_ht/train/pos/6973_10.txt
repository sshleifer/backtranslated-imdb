BSG is one of my favorite TV series. I was lucky enough to start watching it as the series reached its final season. It was a marathon of start to finish for me and that an incredible ride it was! <br /> <br /> As soon as I noticed the pilot on Hulu I knew exactly what I was in for just by the title - Caprica! Although, some things do not add up when you compare both series it is still very well executed. There was no mention of the holobands of Battlestar Galactica or mentioned in virtual world but maybe I had not far enough in the series to explain why. <br /> I recommend this show to anyone who loves the universe, technology, and alternate imagination of our world. This show is very interesting and will have you want to look more!
