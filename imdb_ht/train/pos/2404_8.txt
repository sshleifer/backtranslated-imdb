I'm a big M Lillard fan so I ended up watching this movie. Honestly I doubt that if it was not in the movie I would like it as much or even look it but once I did look it realized the story was pretty decent. A bad end I must say but I saw it coming. It's a low budget film and some of the actors were not really good, but all of that I rated this movie 7/10. <br /> <br /> The suspense of wondering what Lillard was actually up to was really keeping me interested in this movie. <br /> It's a good location! <br /> 7/10
