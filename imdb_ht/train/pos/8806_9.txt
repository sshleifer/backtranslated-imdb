I chose to see this movie on the day it was opened nationally in France, as a personal way for myself to reflect on what happened a year earlier; The collection works as intended: it sparked a whirlwind of thinking and emotions, working as a collective intellectual, never stooping cheap sentimental or reactionary knee. <br /> <br /> There have been many accusations that the film is anti-American: while I can not speak for everyone in this regard, I'm one American who found the statements to be completely true. People make a lot of noise in the Egyptian segment, not Chahine, because it voices the perspective of early Palestinian suicide stating that civilians in a democracy are "fair goals" to elect government bombs they are seeking to attack to ignore many others in pieces: several perspectives are discussed, no one who keeps up the truth, and critics - if they even saw the piece - seem to forget the dearness and hot dialogue that takes place between the director and ghosts in the American dialogue, with the intense sadness of the director on hearing the tragedy. <br /> <br /> Very beautiful of all the films are beautiful, thoughtful & inspiring, in particular the brilliant work by Mahkmalbaf, Tanovic, Loach & Inarritu.

Again this is a sort of impressionistic piece, because we know that if the towers were really blocking the light in the flat man, then there would be nothing but smoke and ash, not light, flooding through his window them.
