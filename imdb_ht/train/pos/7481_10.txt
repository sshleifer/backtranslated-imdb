I could not agree more with the quote "this is one of the best films ever done." If you think Vanilla Sky is simply a "re-done," you might not worry. There is tremendous depth in this film: visually, musical, and emotional. <br /> <br /> Vision, because the movie is soft and delicate at times (early stage and Sofia) and in other powerful and intense time (Times Square, post-climactic scenes). <br /> <br /> Music and sound tied to this movie so perfectly. Without the music, the story is only half told. Nancy Wilson created an emotional, yet eclectic, film screening that could not be more suitable for such a dream as theme (although never released, I could get my hands on the original score for about $ 60. you look hard, you can get a copy of yourself). Crowe's other choices, such as Beach Boys, Josh Rouse, Spiritualized, Sigur Ros, Monkeys, etc etca, are perfect for the movie (Crowe has a great musical ear). Most importantly, the emotional terms of this film (meaning love, sadness, regret) are very powerful, and they are tenplaced by the visual and music experience, as well as the ingenious dialogue; I admit, the elevator scene brings tears to my eyes and time again. <br /> <br /> The best part of this movie however (as if it could get any better) is that it is so smart to fabricate those that every time you see the movie, you'll catch something new - so look good, and be prepared to think! Sure, a term becomes obvious after the first or second look, but there is always more of the story than you think. <br /> <br /> This is Cameron Crowe's easy task, and altogether a brilliant job. Many of my film's inspiration and music come from this work alone. He has honestly touched my life, as true art has a tendency to do. He always surprises me that many people can not appreciate this film for what it is (I guess they understand true art is an art itself). Below the line: Vanilla Sky is in a league of its own.
