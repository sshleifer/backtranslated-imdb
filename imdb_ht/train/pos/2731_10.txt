Sorry, I do not have much time to write. I'm not a psychologist but was known only for 25 years. It was said that Scott Wilson described a sociopath (no conscience) extraordinary assets. I agree! He also said that Robert Blake described an angry person with impulse control that had a conscience but could not control himself superbly. I agree! What a thoughtful and tremendous movie. I've seen more than 2000 films and would rank this at the top 100. My whole life friends deal with clients like these regularly. My only criticism was the preaching narrative at the end of the movie. Many people grow in less than ideal circumstances but only one in one million will behave as the two losers do.
