This is the Magnum opus from the Swedish King of Crap, Mats-Helge Olsson. Rarely had a movie of this magnitude made in Sweden and it really stands out as one of the most accomplished in Swedish films on the most amazing date. Who pays for these things? <br /> <br /> The Russian nuclear scientist Markov wants flaws in Sweden. But his plan was ruined by the Russian military who kidnapped him and told him that he had come to Sweden. This mob is the way to see which Markov continues to work in nuclear physics that will revolutionize the energy supply for the entire planet. The CIA however lowers on catching Markov on the west and throwing the ninja to free him. <br /> <br /> The practice of Swedish speaking actors is something that Mats-Helge has been perfected in his later work. The cheap b-film feel that creates is probably unmatched for performance. But besides this? Well the action is standard direct-to-video style. Gun Machine shooting smoke clouds. Thousands of Russians die. Those who run around in black ninja suit, trying to hide in the snow. <br /> <br /> What really stands out even though the way insanely poor scenes are fighting choreography. When they say "Ninja" in the title I hope martial, I expect close combat. But there are perhaps two or three scenes of current martial arts in this movie. And they are hilarious. It's so bad I miss the words it describes. If the ninjas moved any slower heart would stop. And of course the whole movie ends in a bang that indicates a special-effect budget consisting of four food stamps and a good McDonald's. <br /> So what's the verdict? Instant classic of course. Never before had a movie done so so obviously meant to be consumed with large amounts of alcohol. The ultimate party movie. Enter video and laugh. One just has to realize that movies like these have not made any more. This is film story. <br /> Therefore, the rating is 8/10 for entertainment, 1/10 for quality and 10/10 for emphasis.
