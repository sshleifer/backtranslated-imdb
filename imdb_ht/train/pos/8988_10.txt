To suggest Anton Newcombe in the massacre of Brian Jonestown could also be used by some therapists to put it mildly. In dig! who won the Grand Prix jury at Sundance, we watched him with his self-saber banding over seven years, while former friends and contemporaries Warhols are upgraded to Grand Rapids (a mobile phone ad, anyway). /> What is elevation digging! Higher than its contemporaries is the immense, near-biblical comic-tragedy that has been played out: an honest deprivation treat on art against trading and compromise. For all "look at me, I'm a blood genius" posturing, Newcombe is in fact revealed to be a singularly gifted, if extremely troubled, musician - far more talented than his rival, Courtney Taylor Dandy who tells the picture . If Newcombe is Dennis Hopper, Peter Fonda Taylor. <br /> <br /> Even sad, Taylor looks like this, evident by his tired, head-sting voice-over: he knows his band won the battle - but at what price? In fact, they sold out, made Indie-Lite records, kept the beautiful and clean teeth, and probably rubbed their hair twice before sleeping - thus having record deals and a great travel bus. And jettisoning all credibility of the process. Newcombe, on the other hand, lives in greed, is still busted, beats up fellow band members on stage, kicks hecklers to the top - and is the last glimpsed to dig! being searched away by the police, she lost the right to see her child. <br /> <br /> Two of the best films on the rock subculture are led by women: Penelope Spheeris in the decline of Western civilization and this one ?? An instant classic was the moment he was released.
