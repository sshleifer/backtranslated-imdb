A young cat tries to steal his brother's soul from death but only gets half of it and then went adventurous to find the other half ... or maybe not. <br /> Frankly I'm not sure what's happening in this film is all very strange, pretty surreal images some of which parents might get disturbing, ie.the cat sliced ​​off part of a pig is traveling with them and frying it like bacon that all three meals). <br /> This is a very unusual movie that some have looked like with Hello Kitty on acid, I think more like Hello Kitty as done by Dali. (Certainly this is more alive than Destino's was directly based on his work). <br /> <br /> If you woke up for a very cut movie movie that will challenge your perception of these things then watch this movie. Just be ready for some very unusual images that will burn in your memory forever. <br /> <br />
