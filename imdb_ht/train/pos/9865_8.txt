I saw the movie with two kids growing up. Although it was not as intelligent as Shrek, I thought it was rather good. In a movie theater surrounded by children who were in spring breaks, there was no sound for me to know the kids all loved it. Parents have also been engaged. The death and apparent death of characters brought about the proper gaps and comments. We hope that people achieve this movie made for the kids. As such, he was successful although I liked it too. I personally liked the Scrat !!
