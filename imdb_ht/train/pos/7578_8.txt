Shintar√¥ Katsu, who plays the blind "Zatoichi" blind in a total of 27 movies, finishes the Hanzo Trilogy with this excellent film in which he came to love in a ghost, Mako Midori (blind animal). / Katsu was usual himself himself as he pursues those who would steal from the treasury borrowing in incredibly amounts to those who could not afford to pay. <br /> <br /> The usual amazing swordplay and skill of the great guy was present, along with the blood. <br /> I'll miss him.
