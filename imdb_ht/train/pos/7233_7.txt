I have not read all the comments, but at least one poster mentioned that the 30 minute version might have to be abbreviated. I'm curious about that myself because the later parts of the movie just did not make much sense to me even when I rejuvenate them. 30 minutes seems quite short for a movie in 1917 too. "Poor Little Rich Girl" that the next movie tournament is 65 minutes long and "Pride of the Clan" has been his previous feature of 84 minutes in length. So I relieved them to see that I was not crazy, there must be a part of this movie missing and that's why the resolution did not make much sense. <br /> It's hard to review or comment on a movie that you are just able to see half of ... but I would recommend this movie anyway because of the really fascinating look that it gives us in the bowels of a studio movie East Coast at the time. It's the earliest movie I've personally seen this based on the film industry itself. The main character is a movie star played by Robert Warwick, who later became a Hollywood actor's main character and appeared in almost all Preston Sturges' films. He plays a western actor perhaps vaguely modeled on William S. Hart, which Warwick looks like a bit. After the sequences are really captivating in the studio we see them in a shooting place where they discover a girl (Doris Kenyon) and convince her to come to New Jersey for a screening screen that goes very wrong. After that point the film seems to be missing bigger pieces in the form we currently have. <br /> <br /> Again, I would recommend it to anyone who is interested in film history for the documentary value, but in the form we have it does not hold much as a movie and not a particularly good example of Maurice Tourneur's work.
