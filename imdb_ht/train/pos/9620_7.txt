There are many "Hollywood" movies doing now that not only the turtles look, but also no bring about anyone's life, too. Granted, movies do not always have deep meaning, but it's good to know that there are still movie-makers out there who care for the "human" storytelling. I will not give away the home of this brilliant film, however, the scenario is surely one of the most complex and memorable ones I've ever seen in my life, and I'm a 32-year-old movie hit! Bugs rank top ten on my list of favorites, including: On the Waterfront, Sunset Boulevard, and Black Narcissus, to name just a few. This "moving" movie should become one of your favorites - that is, if you have a heart!
