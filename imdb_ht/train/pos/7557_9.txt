The sex bender Limerick: <br /> A man or woman? Who knows? <br /> It seems that 'it' is both. <br /> <br /> Sleep in clay <br /> <br /> Then they all go <br /> <In one of the UFOs. <br /> <br /> Sex Bender is another great episode 1 episode. I love this one because the story is the kind of place you never really assured that this will happen next. It is entirely the original. Col is very fun and close to the eye with the reflection of the disco lights. I really need to learn from me this trick genderbender heshe doing. I really love the atmosphere of Kindred's small village with Mulder and Scully sneaking around in the middle of the night. It's very interesting. This is one of my favorite season episodes 1 in reality. I think things I love about it so much are how to turn out to be foreign to the end and crop circles left. Many people see this as a non-mythology related to episode episode like "Unnatural" or "Space" but I think this could easily be seen as mythological related. Perhaps the genderbender was just like the alien bounty hunter and may appear to seem like anyone. Huh? Anyway I give the episode an 9 out of 10.
