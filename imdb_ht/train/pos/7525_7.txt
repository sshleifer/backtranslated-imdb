Bettie Page is an icon of the 1950s reprimanded, when it represents the sexual liberty that has always been a decade away, but high in the hopes and dreams of many adolescents and adolescents. Gretchen Mol performed a superb job of Bettie's scandalous portraits, who was a small town and acting ambitious with a great body. His acting career has gone now, but his body has brought him to the peak of fame in a rugged garden admitted. Photographs of black and white with color interludes when it comes out of the world of exploitation in New York, this made-to-TV movie (HBO) has good production value and a very credible backlash. The problem is, it's emotionally rather flat. It's hard to form an attachment of the character, since Bettie is described as a deep and naive person to give the business it was in. Self-government investigations provide a lot of time screens, which slow down the movie towards the end. But it definitely worth looking for the story of the time, and saw the government's heavy-handed repression that was a fifty characteristic of soldiers. 7/10
