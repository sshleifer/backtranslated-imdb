I watched this movie a few times in the 90's and almost cracked where I laughed every time. I love Eddie Murphy as an actor, but this is something else. It's so funny. Even P.C. brigad would get this hilarious. It's a must look, and even better if you've had the guys or girls in for a drink. Removing from Michael Jackson is so like him, if you close your eyes believe he's singing. The things he described are true in life and you would seriously have to have a humor bypass if you thought this was not funny. My local video store does not stock this video anymore, but I would like to get my hand on a copy to show my husband and boy when they are old enough to appreciate the humor. Anyway, highly recommended, hope you enjoy.
