First and foremost I would like to say that I'm a big fan of Silver Silverman, and who else say that and then shabby on the pilot is beyond me. Everything in the pilot was in the typical Sara Silverman form, perhaps not directly funny, but the situation with the delivery is what counts. <br /> <br /> If you loved Jesus is magic then I do not see how you would not like that. It had the same flow and that same rhythm. True it's only for the true fans, but if you are you'll be happy. <br /> <br /> Again, just for the true fans, there is no way around. If you do not use her style then you would not find why this is funny. However, it is, and I hope you think so too.
