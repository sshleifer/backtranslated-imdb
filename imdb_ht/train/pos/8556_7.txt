This film is plain fun.I have nothing to do with the pie pie America, but it is fun to watch. Another try, but better than Band Band and the Naked Miles, at least funnier. br >> <br /> Just after the first five minutes I was laughing my ass out, so I decided to call my friends and we would look it together. We had a few beers and we had fun. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> You will not find a deep message in this movie, but it's worth to look. <br /> So go back and just enjoy.
