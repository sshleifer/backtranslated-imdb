I recently found a copy of $ 5 in a video store, and broke it. While the music and (obviously) graphics are not up to the standards of my favorite in the series, Beyond the Eye, I'm still keen on one segment: <br /> Stanley and Stella's "Ice Break". The music is brilliant, and the emotions feel real. The clip on Odyssey's website does not have the story nor the music, unfortunately.
