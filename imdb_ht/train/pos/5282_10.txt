I do not know ... Maybe it's just because it's an impressive pay tribute to some Muslim religious actions (hajj) but I just felt the movie so underrated. I just can not believe that the film has just voted not only 223 people so far that the film was produced in 2004 and has won many awards since then. Regarding the movie ... it's one of those well-liked actress kinema.Reda, a French teenager due to sitting for Baccalauréat, asked not to patronize her elderly father to take him to Mecca.Etz as it may look like (if someone does not know much about Islam) the father wants his son to drive them from their home to France Saudia Arabia on a once-in-a-lifetime religious pilgrimage. The generation gap between the father and the son is based on simple terms ('you can know how to read and write, but you do not know anything about life, 'the father is unknown to his son, but some sort of bromidic literature gap literature avoids. The bots are affectionate in frustration. Never speak in French even though Reda understands Arabic but can only seem to respond in French. Even though they encounter many people on the road: "There is fear of the woman old men gather at the Bosnian border on the road to Belgrade, with Mustafa in bavard (Jacky Neressian), who helps them from the borders of Turkey, the reticent and shy women carrying burqas on the road to Damascus "concentration is still on the mismatched father and son .There is not much of a conversation in the movie that makes it enjoyable in your eyes. You see magnificent views in every city away. The director shows you even the blue mosque and the Hagia Sophia though the film is not relatively long. <br /> <br /> Generally I do not like movies that do not have enough dialogue and that take the powers of camera intentions but this one was really great. Despite some unparalleled details (like Reda's unseen French girlfriend) film appeal in essence. Great work of art and remember this film is Ismaël Ferroukhi's first.
