I became quite fond of Laurence Olivier in the past few weeks, and being thrilled when I discovered this gem. I've always found it nice when I run through a movie where I do not have to have my finger on the remote control in case of stripping its ugly head. <br /> <br /> The divorce of Lady X is good until final stage, and must have been a real pleasure for viewers back in 1938. I only wish people today can accept with true humor love instead of people Angry talk garbage now called funny. <br /> <br /> The divorce of Lady X is well worth anyone in time.
