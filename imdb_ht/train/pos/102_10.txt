I've heard about this film about 20 years ago when I was a kid in school class (!), It just happened that I thumbing into the encyclopedias in the classroom one day, and underneath For movies (or movies, I do not remember), they were plenty of different films for different movies from experimental mainstream, and the one shown on the page was still a for OffOn. He really intrigued me, since he stood out the most on the page (it was a still out of film in the scene with the eye and other elements superimposed on it). <br /> About 18 or so years later, the public library here where I was living was available for checking all 4 DVD series checks in the "American Treasury Treasury" released by the National Film Preservation Foundation. So when I read the notes on the DVD cases for the series, I was quite surprised to see OffOn was on one of the disks. After all these years, I could finally see the movie! After watching it, it's a little I did not expect it to be (it tends to be a more organic-looking movie, not that of a bad thing, but I was hoping to have a plus more aesthetic ), but it was still an impressive movie, IMHO, consider Scott Bartlett's technique used to make the movie, including hand-tinting the movie itself, and using some video footage of the movie scene (filming off of a monitor video), give it a more distressed, look-around look. <br /> <br /> Do not get me wrong, the techniques used in this film were quite ground-breaking for 1972. That's why it's still one of my favorite movie / experimental films, with a creative inspiration for me too ...
