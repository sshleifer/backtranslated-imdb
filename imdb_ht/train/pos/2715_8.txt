Q.E.D. It was a brilliant TV series and it really was one of the very few schedules for! I suspect that in that era of TIVO and recording devices that he would cost better than he did in 1982. I'm expecting its availability on DVD! <br /> While it is true that it has some of the common and other TV shows like Wild, Wild West, Bearcats and Adventures in Brisco County, Jr, all of which I'm a big fan, QED has a quality intellectuals in it. He did not suffer for that, however - the dialogue was witty and the action was high. The show runs in the UK as a Master, and he does have something in the BBC to feel it, but with better production value than BBC has typically been in that era. <br /> I was an old year old year when this series ran initially, and it was too much to do in my life to make time for TV. I remember my dear mother, however, calling me to remind me that Q.E.D. was over, and we would sit on the phone and watch it together. Beautiful memories. <br /> Surely, Q.E.D. is a sad loss and, if it can do with the same type of value today, I would like to see it make a return.
