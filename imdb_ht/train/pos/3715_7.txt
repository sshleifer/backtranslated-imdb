Ultimately this was quite a little sensitive but I can not help thinking I've seen it before. Remind me of another VCA movie I saw in Poitier called the "OTHER LESSONS IN RAVES" Also there were specks of "Welcome to Dollhouse" and "Ratcatcher" and Lynne Ramsay in her execution. That does not mean that they are tasteless references ... just that they feel very modern and very fashionable ... that makes me feel like this is closer to advertising (such as a style of style and story) than the work of an original and authentic author comes. <br /> <br /> The cinematography is just ... too perfect for my liking. Too coral filter (or charcoal) for my taste ... too archly framed 12mm. Therefore, the whole impression left me a little far - beware of art that proclaims itself too readily! The French (they are a bunch of conservative) seemed to buy it as did the jury however ... but Cannes short film selection is notoriously conservative compared to its features selection although I wonder what happened in the past few years them.
