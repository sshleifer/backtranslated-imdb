There are moments in the movie that are so obnoxious, your teeth. But knowing that there were only weeks left before the Code had made movies innocuous and bold, Paramount runs this production before innuendo and leering came out of style. Vanities are so incredibly anti-girls that it's delicious. As Kitty Carlisle songs, women will appear with price tags that would insult a Bronx Hooker. They emerge from clams (nudge, nudge, wink, wink) in the sheathed submissive posture. Minions of the law, so stupid they can not find the door, get the look of the skirts and snicker. Breastfeeding girls sit comfortably in the giant cactus (can they be an alusinogenic source, perhaps?) As we listen to "sweet marijuana" and look at the chlorine breasts. <br /> <br /> Sure, Carl Brisson has learned his line phonetically and does not seem to have a sign of what he is saying. But it's all worth it as Norma steals the show while there is no one looking. <br /> <br /> When taking a moment of this too fragile fragile seriously missing the point of the whole exercise. Look at this with a chartered member now and prepare to justify all the Hollywood tick tactics between body strokes. <br /> <br /> Toby wings, by the way, is the icing on the cake. And Duke Ellington does not hurt either. <br /> A must tour down Memoria Lane.
