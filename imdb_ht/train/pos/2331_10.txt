At first I was weirded out that the main character shows a TV can bring the dead back to life, but then I thought I would give it a shot. Guess what? I love "Pushing Daisies" and look forward to Wednesday night only to watch her, then for the next week I watch her a few times more on my DVR. Colorful characters, intriguing, fast-paced dialogues, and new unique situations draw me in and fascinating from beginning to end. Ned and Chuck Charles' relationships are interesting to watch as they work their romance around the fact that they can not have physical contact. Even the Detective Emerson Cod character continues to grow in complexity. With Olive Snook! Jiminy Crispies! She craves me! The narrower voice is fun to listen to and the movie gives me the impression that I'm watching a movie instead of a TV show. I recommend my family and friends to turn on "Pushing Daisies" and kick off too !!! The show is well worth awaiting a week for a new episode and if you have not seen "P.D.", I highly recommend watching it!
