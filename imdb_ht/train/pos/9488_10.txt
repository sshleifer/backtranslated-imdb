Very memorable, intelligent and suspense films from one of France's true films, Henri Grande's formidable Verneuil. The plot is an exact parallel to the JFK assassination, and takes place in a non-descriptive, fictional country. The film, visually as well as draw-wise, is razor-sharp. Precautionary meticulous injection, he followed Henry Volnay, the Procuror who took over himself to unravel the coup. In many ways, it is a very disturbing movie, not the least for the cold and analytical accuracy of its comments on a so-called inner state of work. The atmosphere and the characters are all completely credible, and Verneuil leaves nothing to luck in its tight scheme. On another level, this relatively small-known movie just had a 15-year-old start on Oliver Stone, who was acclaimed for the film "JFK", an inferior film in many areas, the youngest of which was not credibility ... <br /> It's a prince, any movie lover should see it, preferably in its original French version and either.
