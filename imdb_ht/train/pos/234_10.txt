I've always known Anne DeSalvo was a great character actor, now I know he's a great writer / director too. I was a fan of my first to see her in the movie "Perfect", "My Favorite Year", "DC Cab" and "Memories of Stardust". <br /> It's so rare to see Lee Grant these days at anything. He was missing from the screen for far too long. It is also wonderful to see Cloris Leachman in something else than a site-com. This is her best work since the "Last Show". If you grew up in an Italian American family you will love this movie. I did not wait a lot when I started watching this movie, so I was pleasantly surprised when I fell in love with this movie. If you get the chance, look at it.
