I absolutely love this show. I watched it since it was first revealed in late 90's of the last episode. In my honest opinion it was a wonderful family drama that is so rare these days. Definitely a show you can watch with a friend or your children. Yes, things have changed a bit with Jo since our last view in the books, but it's still happening with great stories and good lessons. Actress shows that Jo Bhaer (Michelle Burke) performs well as the actress who plays Nick Riley (Spencer Rochfort) Throughout the series we find the romance developed between Jo and Nick, with daily stories and lesson to children and students to learn. I recommend showing this to anyone.
