When a fan of the first Lion King, I was definitely looking forward to this movie, but I knew there was really no way he might be as good as the original. I know that many Disney fans are cautious in direct-to-video movies, as I have mixed feelings in them as well. <br /> While watching the Lion King 1½, I tried to figure out what my own opinion was about this movie. Am I going to be so dedicated to the Lion King that I will nitpick in certain scenes, or will I just accept this movie as just another look at the Lion King history? Most of the time, I found myself embracing the letter. <br /> <br /> The Lion King 1½ definitely has its beautiful and funny moments. Timon and Pumbaa stole the show of the movie first and definitely deserve a movie that is centered around them. People just love these characters! My favorite part of the movie includes the timeline of Timon & Pumbaa taking care of young Simba and the surprise finish featuring some great cameras. <br /> I could do without much of the bathroom jokes though, like the real reason that everyone bowed themselves to baby Simba at the beginning of Lion King 1. I guess these types of jokes for The smaller series (which after all is the target audience. I do not think many kids are really concerned about Disney's profit margin on direct-movie movies.) However, I'll say I was a bit annoyed when They are directly tied to the original film scene in this movie. I'm just too familiar with the original that these scenes just stuck out like thumb insects with me. Something different would be with the music or voice that he would just distract me. <br /> As for the music, it was not too bad, but does not expect any classic from this movie. At least LK2 had the beautiful ballad, "Love will find a way." As for the voicework, he was well done in this movie. Nathan Lane and Ernie Sabella did a good job as always, and even members cast new, classic comedic actor Jerry Stiller and Julie Kavner (best known as Marge Simpson) did a great job too. You can even enjoy those great voices even more by checking out the Virtual Safari on Disc 2 in the DVD. That feature is definitely a lot of fun !! <br /> So everyone in the king 1½ king is not a perfect movie, but it's nice and fun. I think many Lion King fans will enjoy it and appreciate it for what it is - a pleasure, look at the poverty of the King Lion King from our friendly friends perspective. <br /> <br /> My IMDb Rating 7/10. My Yahoo Grade: B (Good)
