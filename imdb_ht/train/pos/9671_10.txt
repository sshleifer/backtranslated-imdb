Paulie is a fantasy of a littler girl or perhaps her recollection of what her teens were like growing up. Tony Shaloub executes an impeccable performance as a Russian scientist (PhD) who can not get decent job in America. He befriends an isolated parrot while doing homework usually in a janitor in a science science lab. The chief doctor is a bitter man, as Paulie, who can speak to understand the language and learn, embarrass the Doctor, who later banishses him to the lower level of the building, where Mikail (Tony S.) get it. <br /> <br /> Paulie recounts his life with Marie and how to lose each other. The demand begins to meet Paulie and Marie, only over 20 years ago. <br /> <br /> The movie ends, some people will tell adventure, and Mikay assembles Paulie and Marie. The story closes with three three entering Marie, where you can make the final your own choice. <br /> <br /> Great movie family!
