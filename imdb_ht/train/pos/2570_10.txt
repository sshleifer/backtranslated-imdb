Well, this is probably one of the best movies I've seen and I love it so much that I've memorized most of the script (especially the scene of the storage unit when Jerry Lee broke wind) and even with the script in my My head still loves to watch it for Jerry Lee, which German Shepherd is hysterical and really put in the test to see who's smarter. Tag tag holds true as well. Not to mention the act is great, though Christine Tucci sounds different in a whisper (cinema check below CSI if you do not know what I mean). It's too bad that this movie has only won Dooley's sole problem and Jerry Lee worked with, it would have been very cool to see the tricks that Zeus and Welles were wearing their sleeves.
