All of the people reviewed this movie, and probably many professional movie reviews, just do not get it. This film was made with dull and artistic artwork as well as the works of the great filmist scoutman, Karel Zeman. If you want to know what I'm talking about, I suggest you find any of Zeman's films, such as the Fabulous World of Jules Verne, Baron Munchausen, Journey at the Beginning of Time, or about the Comet. If you can not get a movie, then read the reviews of AMG. They will explain the processes they use. If one had to look at Zeman's work and try to compare it to any of the other sci-fi films of the time, viewers probably would not have gotten it then either. It is unfair to compare either in the style of the creamer in the standard technology of the day, because both Zemen and Hines do not "calculate". They have a unique style of them and should be judged for their creativity only. If you look at this movie from a perspective where you know that it was intentionally attempting to create a pasty collage of mixed mix with live action, you could easily come to the conclusion that he did a mastery job. It's not easy to make a lot of people running in computer. I thought that the animals were also good, also consider how they did. Hines has taken a great player, and I think his movie will not justify judging for years to come. A person who promotes the film should move the audience over what should be seen, rather than let them blindly go to the theater to expect the usual CG work. Regarding the actors, I think Hines also took a page from Zemen's book, in which many of Zemen's actors were somewhat expressive at first, but became more engaged as the movie and action went on. It is totally worthwhile to have this movie in my library. I'll watch it for years to come, all three hours of it.
