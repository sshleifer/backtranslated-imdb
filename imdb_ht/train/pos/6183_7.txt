Financial Attachment Paramount pulls out all the stops for this step step adaptation: big budget, great cast, morning production and Mitch Leisen to attain as the director. What happened? Two things: Busby Berkeley did not work for the stone to focus out with a murder mystery script that did not deserve to be in the same trash can be as the worst Charlie Chan first draft down the street. I must believe that the cut was out of the Leisen since the great number of Duke Ellington is violence off, but that does not mean that it's not worth a look: the 'Sweet Marihuana' number featuring topless choral girl is a fan idea, consider the production code to appear and it also has the Toby Ravishing wing (which unfortunately feeds horrible lines and plays the mute prototype blonde) as a hot chorion for an otherwise busy Jack Oakie. Acting Carl Brisson is bitter as Melba Bread but he is a competent singer. MacLaglen arrives for new charts as a dummy detective stereo. And try to place Lucy in the chorus. That's a 7.0 percentage as a curiosity. Feb 2010 re-thinking: I recently gave the movie another look and now feel I was wrong to berate the lack of Busby Berkeley production number. I can understand Leisen's argument for more realistic production in the context of the scheme. I always have an enormous problem with the correction however. Paramount, raciest the largest studio in town, faced major issues with the Production Code in the worst possible time of its history, financially speaking, and pulling out all the stops on this one (also check out search for the 1934 beauty). A must see for pre-code enthusiasts.
