Judy Davis shows us here why he is one of Australia's most respected and loved actors - painting it in a lonely, nomadic direction is the first-rate. An adolescent Claudia Karvan also gives us a glimpse of what would make her one of the most famous actors in this country in the coming years, with the future role of the boulder, the HEARTBREAK, the DATING enemy, RISK and the TV series acclaimed the US LIFE SEKRET. (Incidentally, Karvan, as a kid, was a young girl whose panda game stole outside a store's store in 1983 the drama goes down with Tracey Mann.) If this movie comes your way, make sure you see it !!
