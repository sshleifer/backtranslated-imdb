As a great fan of the original I avoided this movie as the epidemic when the bad reviews started coming in eight years ago, but I just finished watching this movie and found it to be a really wonderful surprise . Okay, if you're looking for an original reader, you're in for a great disappointment, but if you're looking for something quite different, a bit crazy and politic, then , this is the movie for you. Gregory is now thirty-four and works as a teacher in his old school, where she was pursued by a fellow teacher and having sexual dreams on one of her students. When the student insists on meeting with Gregory, a series of misunderstandings include torture, breaking and entering with all kinds of unexpected twists and turns that let me feel elated and moving. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for something original, then I highly recommend this movie. I only hope that more people have seen it when it's released and seen it for what it really is.
