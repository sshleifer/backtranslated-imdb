Maybe the movie itself is not one of Jackie Chan's best movies, but I think everyone will agree with me that the mall battle was one of the best fights ever performed. There were also some memorable exhibits, which were so impressive that this film was a classic action. This film influenced many other action films and I think that actually movie makers should learn from this movie (as might be noted that scenes drifted, my stuff and modern technology could make it even better). There were also some funny scenes that made this movie enjoyable even when Jackie did not fight. Althou I think they could put more scenes in this film.
