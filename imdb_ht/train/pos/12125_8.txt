I've seen this movie again and notice how close it is the novel if we ignore the party on Cary's children's [Leslie Howard]. Considering that at the time not so much can be shown on the screen [not that many of the novels] the mania of the character and Mildred [Bette Davis] are very well transmitted to the audience. I recommend this movie to anyone who ever falls to another person and the other side tried to take advantage of him or her. I read that Maugham was asked to make a recording of the novel for sale, but when he started in the studio he began to cry and could not finish more than a few lines and whole projects were chucked. One can say that the novel is written in the heart and the movie is a good one <br /> <br /> adaptation to a part of it at least.
