That was great fun! I never read these chester-gould-comics but it is not necessary to know them. Maybe there were some jokes inside I did not know but what the eye does not see the heart can not mourn. This is like an ironic, colorful movie and the actors are charming all along. The environment is similar to this in ?? Batman` movies, but not as dark and gray. Well, the story is not so original but there is a plot (not self-evident) with a more or less surprising finish. With this movie, you could play an exciting game, if you watch it with friends. Do not watch the credit from the beginning and then look who's the fastest to find out who the famous actors under their make-up!
