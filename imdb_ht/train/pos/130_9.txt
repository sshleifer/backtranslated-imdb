In October 1945, American German American Leopold Kessler (Jean-Marc Barr) reached a post-war Frankfurt and his bitter Tonton Kessler (Ernst-Hugo Järegård) gets a job for him at the Centropa train line as a sleeping car driver . As she traveled to the train to learn his profession, she saw Germany's destitute and satisfied Katharina Hartmann (Barbara Sukowa), the senior entrepreneur of the powerful business entrepreneur and owner of Zentropa, Max Hartmann (Jørgen Reenberg). Leopold remained neutral between the German and German forces, and came to the conclusion that a terrorist group called "Werewolves" killed the sympathizers of the ally and doing the subversive actions against the forces of the allies. She fell in love for Catherine, and earlier she disclosed that she was a "werewolf". When Max commits suicide, Leopold also presses on the "Werewolves" and needs to take a position and decision. <br /> <br /> "Europa" is an impressive story with Kafkanian's scandal in the great Danish director Lars von Trier. Using an expressive style that reminds Fritz Lang and alternates a beautiful black and white cinematography with some colored details, this film releases a tough period in Germany and some of the big nation issues faced after being defeated in the war. The very impressive action of occupation forces is destroying resources that would allow a faster reconstruction of a land to destroy, and the corruption with the Jew that should identify Max. Jean-Marc Barr has a stunning performance in the role of people who want to stay neutral, but manipulated everywhere. The hypnosis story of Max Von Sydow is another touch of class in this film provided. My vote is nine. <br /> Title (Brazil): "Europe"
