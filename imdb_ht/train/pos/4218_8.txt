I have not really seen too many of the Columbo movies ... actually, I think I've just watched one or two, apart from this one. I've always loved Columbo, though, somehow without even seeing so much of it. Peter Falk is and has always been the perfect choice for the character, because of his looks, his voice and his charm. The perfect proof is that if the series started all the way back in 1968, the last (and probably not recent) of the movie was made in 2003. This 35 years. And Falk was 40 back when he did the first. The series consists of 68 films (unless my count is off), all of which are made for TV. Everyone knows the character, though no one ever sees a movie presenting him in the cinema. That's quite an accomplishment, if you ask me. The plot is very good. The only problem I have with it is that the killer and killings revealed at the very beginning (though that may be the same for all of the Columbo movies), leaving no mystery but how Columbo resolved it, making it a bit mat (since there's not much to look forward to the end of the movie). The gathering is good, there is hardly a scene where you're bored. The act is very good, especially those of Falk and Ruth Gordon. They have some great exchanges in dialogue in the movie. Characters are well written and credible. The dialogue with script is very good for a TV movie. All in all, the movie is, yes, amazingly good for a TV movie, and definitely worth looking for any fan of Columbo and / or crime / mystery flicks. 8/10
