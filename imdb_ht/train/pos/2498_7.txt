I chose this up in the box 'Danger After Dark', and watch it only because of my interest in the Hyde and Gackt performance. I was hoping a movie horror meeting was a great Gore-Fest and very bad dialogue. Which is exactly what it would have been if she was born in America. Instead I found myself intrigued by the good development of the characters, and the way that Sho (Gackt) developed in the movie as someone. The skills to act in both stars were surprisingly good, considered by professional actors, and the director did a nice job with it all, putting it in the near future less flying machines and hologram bulletin boards. On a side note, Taro Yamamoto's performance was very surprising. The only other movie I saw in fighting Royale, where she plays Shogo Kawada, and in this film she seems to be the exact opposite of Shogo. Toshi is bright, exuberant and hyper, serving as a sort of funny rescue and his antics. Shogo was the big guy hard on the island that was killed without thinking anything of it. So, look out for his performance, if you're familiar with fighting Royale, you'll be very surprised for him. But do not throw it off in the summary on the back of the box, because this is not really a vampire movie. It's just a movie and a vampire in it. That character Hyde is a vampire is almost a background reality and what really will be on the foreground, and you guys will love the last stage. It's a really moving picture at some point, the photography is really well done. It's definitely something to pick up your future in Blockbuster.
