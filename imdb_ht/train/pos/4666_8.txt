She is very sly for all to watch the 60's in the movie. The humor is quite gentle, but it has grown over me much more than I hope. Throw is the first-rate and they appear to be a wonderful time. Ustinov wanders into the movie muttering some funny things unusual under his breath, and it's all very inconvenient; I'll buy the movie as soon as it comes out on DVD. The plot is that Ustinov as an embezzler released from prison to emerge as a computer whip and embeszzling money from an American company that has an office in London. Maggie Smith is his secretary for a while, and watching her get shot in many different tasks is part of the fun. Bob Newhart is his usual self, and Karl Malden has fun as the chief executive dancer and slaughtered the London office. The finish is funny and nicely cynical.
