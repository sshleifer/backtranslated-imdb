Oh my, from the box desk I thought it would be LA-crazy like 2 days in the Valley or Hugo Pool. Ulrich Seidl must be a very strong man. Most, after that, would drive on a cliff or at least commit a massacre of mass. I confess only first half hour (for now). Reading all the comments here, I have a lot to look forward to. Professional reviews often mention the Swedish film songs from the Second Floor as a parallel but this graced with humor and fantasy and this is unrelenting in its astringent realism. What has the Marshall Plan and the EU been forced to? Seeing this in a theater and anyone I know would have only been in a departure boost after much less minutes than I got into on DVD. There's a more annoying creature in the universe than Jar Jar Binks - The Hitchhiker comes from Hell. Whatever happens to him, it's not enough! Suburbia Soulless that I thought only existed in Arizona and Florida thriving in Lower Austria. Oh no! I thought that sex clubs had ceased to exist even in New York and San Francisco, and here are the suburban suburban centers? Was it Mahatma Gandhi or Jawaharlal Nehru who said when asked about Western civilization, 'why this might be a nice idea'? If the world was really like this movie, bring on black holes, we're ready.
