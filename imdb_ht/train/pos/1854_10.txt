Having developed a crucial eye for film, and a love for good movies, I went to see the Fisher and my breath of symbolic birth. While I'm an unabashed fan of Denzel Washington - both in his skills as an actor and public public; I'm an honest enough admirer (very few) times when he's not quite hit the mark in a movie or two. And I would be wrong about that - after all, I'm not an actor. But this was different - Denzel would pour out his career experience, and guide, a movie touching one of the most sensitive subjects known to the people - the abuse of a child. As its first director, no less. And develop the movie at points that he would successfully present the triumph of a man. I did not want to be disappointed. <br /> <br /> And I did not. <br /> What I saw is a film full of promises that connects various audiences, and gives the inexperienced viewer a brief eye, but the truthfulness of the life of a young man who has childhood was a living hell, but that triumphs despite it all. This movie has made it - and nary a dry eye of any color in the theater has proven it. She takes someone to know the subject in this movie to know if the truth is presented. He takes a talented cinema telling you the compelling story when you have not experienced it. But if he can more plot an audience, and cause an emotional reaction hearing, without mercy, the cinema did his job. In any movie. Black, white, purple or polka charged. That's a good movie. Bravo, Denzel Washington, Derek Luke, Joy Bryant and most of all, Celebrate Fisher - you've really won.
