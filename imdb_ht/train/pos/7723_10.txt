A number of factors make it easy for me to say that I still think this is the most important movie science fiction ever made, despite some of the acting, outdated dialogs <br /> <br /> First, there is the scale of imagination in which describing the Krell, a native native race of the planet, now all dead, was 1 million years more advanced than Earth (us), and technology, particularly vehicles of 8,000 cubic miles. /> Second, there are music and sound effects, which are inseparable from each other. It creates a weird, unpopular feel, unlike "2001", which has traditional classical music. Third, its "monster" is not only the most powerful and deadly legs ever contemplated, it's also based on real science and does not break the laws of physics and biology. <br /> Finally, and most importantly, forbidden planet is the only movie ever to make attempts and, more incredibly, succeed in making an honest, clever and gracious logical statement on limits or human ceilings (or any other biological entity), no matter how long we survive as a species. In other words, it predicts our inevitable destiny.
