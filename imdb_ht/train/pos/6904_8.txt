This is one of the few movies I can watch over and over. If you have never seen it, give it a shot. Richard Dreyfus and Raoul Julia are wonderful along with although the movie amusing me so much, she reminded me of Julia's wrong break. It is a great opportunity to sit back and laugh at the international intrigue that is too much with us in those times of fear and fear.
