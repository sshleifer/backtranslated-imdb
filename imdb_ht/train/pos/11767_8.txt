What a good movie! Made Man is a great action movie with many twists and turns. James Belushi is very good as an exceptional hood who has stolen 12 million from the boss who has to fend off the gangs, his wife hillbillies and the local sheriff (Timothy Dalton) .You will not be disappointed, jumping on board and enjoying the ride . 8 out of 10
