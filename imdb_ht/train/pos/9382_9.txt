The Red Rock West is one of the tight naked people we rarely see again. It is quite rhythmic, well-acting and does not leave us with loose tip or unanswered questions typical of this genre. <br /> <br /> Nicolas Cage star as Michael, a Texas occupying unemployment, desperate enough for a job to drive along the way to Wyoming for potential work. It is honest in a fault but still on the dark side of fate. After falling to work profitable, Michael breaks into the Red Rock bar where the owner of Wayne (JTWalsh) mistakes him for a bloody deal he has called from Dallas, hiring to his beloved Suzanne (Lara Flynn Boyle) . <br /> <br /> Wayne gives Michael the necessary details and a down payment for the hit on the adult Suzie. There is no intention on the following, Michael accepts the money and then sets out to warn Suzanne's next break. He also sent a letter to the local sheriff to expose the scheme and divide. <br /> As fate would dictate, Michael will not be able to get rid of the situation easily. While leaving in a violent violent rains, she runs down Suzanne lover. Naturally Michael was Michael and took him to the local hospital where he discovered that he was also shot. <br /> <br /> The Sheriff is calling and as likely to have it, Wayne is also the local law. Michael managed to escape while taking on that last ride and is immediately picked up by the real "Lyle from Dallas" played with Glee murder in the original Quirky Hopper. After discovering that they are fellow navy, Lyle insists that Michael enters him for a drink at, where else, the Red Rock bar. Wayne has realized his mistake, and soon he and Lyle are in hot pursuit of Michael who falls wanting to Suzann waiting arm. <br /> <br /> As the pick pace we learn that Wayne and Suzanne really wanted to steal armed, on the Blade for a multi million dollar dollar. Finding the money now gets the central film focused with a series of betrayal, double crosses and murder. <br /> <br /> The movie was very well thrown. Nicolas Cage was usually low key, Dennis Hopper and Lara Flynn Bolye assumed their respective roles and more than enough capacity. The best performance was the end of J.T. Walsh was threatening without appearing. Walsh was a great character actor who left us too early. <br /> <br /> Marc Reshoskys photography uses many unique angles that add to the suspension and drawing development. The film was further enhanced by John Dahl's stylish style style and Morris Chestnut's rapid correction.
