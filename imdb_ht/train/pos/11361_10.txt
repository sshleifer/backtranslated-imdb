Though I've seen this movie this year, its impact never left me. Stephen Rea's explanation of an invetigator is deep and moving. His brother in not being able to stop their death is obvious. Everyone at the disposal is amazing at Sutherland who tries to accommodate him and provides way for the police to coordinate the efforts of the troubled citizen x. Every day when we are bombarded with the mass murder story, I think in this film and the tiring task of the people who try to find the killers.
