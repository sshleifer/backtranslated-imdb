A full passenger bus stuck during a snowstorm. The police closed the bridge - saying it is not safe and stuck in a little coffee until the road was cleared. However, after a while, the boredom turned into anxiety, as it turns out that one of the passengers was NOT original on the bus and can just be an alien! This leads to a conclusion that is ironic, but also rather funny in a low-fronts manner. This is another of the fun episodes of the Twilight Zone. Instead of typical torsion or social comment, this one has no lasting message. However, it's too much and look, so that's worrying! Exactly what you'll just have to see for yourself. <br /> <br /> By the way, this one star John Hoyt - a figure most of you will recognize from many old TV shows and movies. In almost every case, she plays a real horror (like Charles Lane during the same era), but my boy liked to see her - as she perfected the scary character and was kind of funny at the same time.
