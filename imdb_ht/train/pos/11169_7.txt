when I saw the movie at first I thought it was boring because nothing happened, but when all this scary started to happen as when church died and was brought back to life and also gageed to her mother Death and the father of fools brought them back to life even though it warned them and ignored Jud. This is not Steven King's best work. I thought that her best work was shining. I do not think people who see this movie and comment on how horrible it was they are wrong because all they think is what they thought. as if this person can do a better job in making a movie flick. I mean to make the bad gage and how it kills today is engineering. make the most innocent characters most mistrust of one of the killers is cool. Those who did not like the movie are dumb because all it is a scary film and nothing is all about. Do not expect something in a movie that it does not. it's still in a general area was not that good. I always recommend people to watch the movie
