I really enjoyed this movie. The act was terrific as it was drawn. Jeff Combs is more talented than he recognizes for her. The only part of this movie I would change ended. The death of the animal was too nicer to the Sci Fi Channel. There were some interesting religious messages in this movie. Jeff Combs obviously played a face of Messiah and the Beast (or shark if you prefer) representing the anti-Chirst. There were some awesome scenes that had 'the end of the world feel'. I only notice this after my third view of this classic animal character. I know that many people will not find their references to Christianity, but if you look close you will find it.
