I liked Cliffhanger, at the beginning when this woman (Sarah) was full of fear when she slipped, I thought it was a stressful scene as I thought when you saw that your nerves were in your body because it makes you full of fright and your heart beat faster. I liked watching Cliffhanger, I think Silvestar Stallone is a great actor and I think he'll be known as Rambo and Rocky.
