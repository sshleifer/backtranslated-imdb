Not a bad word to say about this movie really. I was not initially impressed by her but she grew up to me quickly. I love it very much and I think it's a shame that many people can not see past the fact that it was banned in some territories, I was one of them. The film delivers from the shock, gore and atmosphere atmosphere. The note is a beautiful piece of suspension delivering supplies. It only looks just like Chris Young was going to be one of the best composers in the business. Acting in this movie is a very high standard, if a little wooden in some spots, and the effects are very real and frustrating. All of this is great praise for a good slasher movie in my book. I noted in some reviews that the film has gotten seriously with the P.O.V shotgun's famous shotgun. And I ask: What's wrong with that ??? It's a classic shot that awakes reminder of any good fan of the genre and is a big hold of the killer's identity a secret. The only thing that stop this movie getting the top mark in my book is that the surprise twist (killer reveals) does not handle more care, I mean it just reaches kind of quickly, even though the big performances make it just about credible. In addition to that PRANKS is a great movie (though I prefer the original title) and its a shame that many people hit it off as just a cheap piece of crap. It's more than that, but only a few know that as it seems they've gotten lost in the maze of early 80s slasher. What a shame .... It's a really good movie man! Believe me!
