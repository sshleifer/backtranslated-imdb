I understand this movie must be a first feature and as such, it's very impressive. He has the feeling and rhythm of a "true indie," but director Todd Yellin clearly possesses the photographic and editorial, order and judgment vision of a mature and seasoned professional. The vaccines are well framed and thought out and are used to move forward the story. He, and Senator Ivan Salomon delivered a much more profound and lyrical history than typical "paint by number" style scripts. It's a story that needs skilled character Judd Hirsch to have a shot at work. Judd is fantastic as usual; as are Scott Cohen and Susan Floyd's beautiful. The real surprise though is Elliot Bard that plays Adam Groden. Yellin could nuanse nuances from the young actor in a role that might have been easily devalued by stereotypes or surmounting. Anyway, I found the movie refreshing and entertaining.
