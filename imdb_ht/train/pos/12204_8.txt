One can imagine the movie Mr Welles might end without interference in the studio! This film is a flawed Welles, but worth every minute of it because one can see the greatness of perhaps America's best motion picture director ever! <br /> We can see the toll that she took on Orson Welles the movie in this movie. The story has a lot of holes in it, perhaps because of the demands of the studio executives who did not trust the director. <br /> It is curious not to read some of the submission views of IMDB that compare Orson Welles and the Coen Brothers, Roman Polanski, even Woody Allen, when it should be all those directors who must be considered followers of the great master his head. No one was more original and creative in the history of American cinema than Mr. Welles. The lucky we still have her legacy in Retrospective looks like the One New York Forum just ended, or her movie either on tapes or DVDs. <br /> <br /> Rita Hayworth has never been favorite photo than here. If it was a beauty and red hair, like a blonde, it is just too stunning for words. Everett Sloan and Glenn Anders made an excellent contribution to the movie. <br /> <br /> The only thing that could make this movie another masterpiece to be added to Orson Welles's body at work, was his own appearance in it. Had he focused on directing and had another actor interpreting Michael O'Hara, a different film could be achieved altogether. Orson Welles had to be credited to being a pioneer in taking the camera away from the studio on the street. The visuals of this film are so amazing that we left the theater after seeing this film really impressed for the work, the vision and talent it has given us.
