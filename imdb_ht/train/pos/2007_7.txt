My personal opinion is that this movie had no real story line with John the first tree but I do not care I love it. Jon Bon Jovi (Derek) was great in this movie. It really crazy me to believe it was the person you would never think was a famous ROCKSTAR. There were some bad things about this movie. Like the story line, there should be more of the movie.there would be a sequel to the movie that follows the movie history line and should have kept the same main characters of all three movie cameras. I really liked the clothes that the people were wearing and the environment they chose in Mexico. I liked how it was old Mexico and not new Mexico. and the clay houses and old fashioned churches. I was a little confused with the vampires and how they could walk in church but it was cool how they did not follow Dracula vampire rules.
