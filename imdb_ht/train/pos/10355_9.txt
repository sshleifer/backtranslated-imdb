Fascinating film, based on a true story, about an Australian woman, Lindy Chamberlain (Meryl Streep) accused her of killing her daughter. He stressed that a dingo took his baby, but the story is very suspicious. The film is actually about circus media held in the case, the Australian way interprets what was presented in the media, and the lynch lynch mentality that ultimately led condemnation of the woman, based on barely any hard evidence. I love films that question the media, and also films that take a hard look on how people train through the justice system. I always thought that juries would have to show 12 Angry Men before going to their homework. It's not, as often said, a liberal film, but a clinical look at how we human beings interpret events based on much about our prejudice and a desire for revenge. A crisis in the dark is as well as in clinics. Schepisi is careful not to make the film in all melodramatic. Some may find the boring or dry movie, but I found it engaged.
