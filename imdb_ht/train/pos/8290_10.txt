This is just one more example of Absolute Genur Gene Genius. It was written and starred in this terrific mystery. No one could do it better. The suspension was palpable at all. I wish Mr. Wilder would favor us with another of these. I enjoyed everything I had ever seen Mr. Wilder but I had no idea how truly his talent was until I saw "murder in a small town," with this follow-on. He really has a threat to that unwanted audience and how to deliver it in his writing, and of course, to his brilliant act. Her subtle honey comes in shovels. I would recommend this movie to anyone who loves mystery and / or genre Wilder work genre. His star just gets brighter and bright.
