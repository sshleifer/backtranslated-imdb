I enjoyed this movie and I had great expectations due to all the negative reviews I read before going. I went because I was curious as to what all this fuss was about because some of the posters were so upset with this movie and the Koreans. Oh and he's from Korea who has put out some of my favorite movies. I love the army, but not my absolute favorite. Some of your favorite sci / fi / fantasy movies have a sense of my taste: Mirrormask, Esteler, Serenite, Gattaca, Willow, Matris, Resident Evil series, LOTR, Stargate, Black City. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It was not confusing as everyone was told and the monsters looked good and the big battles. There are some holes in the story but did not really matter. I sort of tune out things like that and stop wondering why so much time ago when I saw summer blockbuster. The Korean legend was interesting, the reincarnation was different, and I thought the main characters were supposed to dress like Korean actors in other shows. Ethan (Behr) hair looks so Asian .. Yes, it might be better and I hope in the future that Korea, with its weird sense of life, intense emotions, and unexpected humor, can bring some diversity in the blockbuster genre. Maybe a combination of army and dragon wars in the future?
