Transient tension is set in the city's disruption in São Paulo, the largest and ugliest third world nightmares in Brazilian urbania. For the sake of making it easy for anyone who is curious about this intriguing and really well-done film, he has the graft of Mexican feature "Amores Perros" with a character not far from Max Cady, from both fear pairs , although this is not, by any means, a movie about a psychopath. Two partners (Alexandre Borges and Marco Ricca) at a construction company paid Hitman Anisio (Miklos) to third-party partners (and majority share distributors) said construction equip. The murder is blamed in the city, but things start to look very upset when animated and charismatic walking Anisio nightmare decides he wants to be around their partner ever so nervous in crime, not only trespassing but important, deconstructing the strict social code that makes up Brazilian society. Anisio turns poverty into an attitude and wants to in. Look at almost entirely portable, gracious, performances are exceptional at all, especially as first actors (and members of classic Brazilian pop Brazilian), Paulo Miklos, dazzles and baffles the viewer and cute funny social scary. <br /> I saw the film Brasília Film Festival in November 2001. It has since done very well in Sundance and Berlin. Glue Mendonça Filho
