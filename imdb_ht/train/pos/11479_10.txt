This movie was excellent, a bit scary, but excellent in that. For those of you who have heard about Kolumbin and know the story, it gives you an idea of ​​what and why these kids did what they did. In the back of your mind you know that people think about this thing, but you never realize just how bad it is, and this movie makes you realize. It's badly good. It also makes you think twice before making fun of someone who's in for sure. I read a book about the hacking and he made me think, this film made me worried and scared me to death. On the downside is such a how to kill someone guides for serial killer. Recently, I got a threat, and I prevented it from thinking of it, but after that movie I think you should take everything seriously. Some people are crazy and you never really know who they are, so take it seriously and not under an estimate of someone.
