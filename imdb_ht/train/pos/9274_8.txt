Another fantastic film from a country, where due to decades of asthma from the fundamentalist regime, there is no problem in creating passionate subjects. Panahi takes a different approach to this time around with a mix of ironic comedies and an endearing, non-professional cast. While constantly getting through his message to what he sees being naturally wrong with his country, he does without the need of a heavy storyline. It is a positive take on a country, in particular its people, that the Iranian population desperately needs. The greatest pity is it will not drop domestic. Insulan, the Iranian paranoid assert that this fine maker film is only overseas success because it is part of a global embarrassing plot. After growing amid revolutions and watching their academics, artists and educating 'disappear' over the last 25 years it shows great courage to continue to put his work out. The realistic accomplished by the world's actual shooting calendar truly carries you into the event. The fact he shot it about 35mm is amazing as most would only try this project using a digital format. It looks fantastic. His insistence on only using non-professional actors also really works in this movie. Fine performance all round. After watching many films showing the issues Iran has and also the news media reported the facts we may tend to demonize the people as well as the government. This movie makes the opposite. It shows us they always love the same things and do not laugh at themselves and the absurd rules of charia law that maybe a change for the better not so far. Some call Panahi a feminist film brand but I think it's just the battle for the most oppressive demographics in Iran. Young, independent woman.
