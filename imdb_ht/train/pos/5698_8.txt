Val Kilmer ... Love or ill, sometimes it gets under the skin of a character and pulls a performance that makes you go 'Hey! This guy is a GREAT actor! 'He did in the Leather Pants at Jim in the Door and he did it again to the leather caster in Jan. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />! in a brutal Manson-style massacre. <br /> <br /> Which Kilmer does that scramble to express the low-life of the celebrity, doing nothing to anyone who crap over anyone who has it and then loses it. Going to see her, you'll know what I mean.
