The year was 1964. Ernesto "Che" Guevara, a Cuban citizen for the last five years, disappeared from Earth's face, leaving a glider Fidel Castro announcing that he is probably dead, then in truth, he left Cuba to get to Bolivia for living an assumed identity. While living in La Paz, Guevara aims to reverse corruption, the bourgeois government. Again, Steven Soderberg takes the place 'Che: Part One' to leave on (only the best time this time). The rally is more on target, the work of acting is always so fine (including a spin by a sick of seeking Del Toro Benefits, as Che Guevara). Try it to say, it's most likely if you see both films, they can find the true story of Guevara & what kind of man he (I've had rare windows open to the opportunity to see both the movie one test screening ---- talk about a long haul!). Like the 'Che-Part 1: Argentina', this film has no MPAA rating, but there is enough salty language & violence to easily catch up a 'R'.
