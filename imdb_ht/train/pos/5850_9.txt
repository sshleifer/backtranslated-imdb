It has been 16 years since it's originally running, I hope that now some "wizard marketing" would have prompted a live actor version live in this classic by now, or at least sought to re-release the original 65 episodes. I can not understand why the sci-fi network or cartoon has not broken this up. Galaxy Rangers has actually been well thought out of plots, and even better scripts. The animation was higher than average quality for it's time, and excellent when compared to the Japanese slide show slide show today. He predicted the heavy toon-to-tie tie in the market, this could also be sealed in bankruptcy. I would like to spend cash on a DVD gr if available.
