Vincent's follow-up home price at WAX (1953), the movie that cemented his reputation as a horror icon, similarly revolves around a bitterness? albeit resource showman. Though a rumor, the former (shotgun in Technicolor) remains the superior effort; which, aside from some religious relief, the resort is compulsory for Gimmickry cheap (it was another 3-D showcase) and occasional negative inconvenience (all that happened to the missing bag that supposedly turned into some police stations which has a top off?), this offers more than enough Grand Guignol-emotions quality and overall value camp (Price hamming it up in a variety of disguises as an inventor of illusion unknowingly 'disappeared' stars that took advantage of genius him) stand on its own two feet. Incidentally, Brahm Director's involvement here proves no coincidence only ?? Since the narrative incorporates elements from two horror titles (both Laird Cregar), it has already accelerated the lodger (1944) and HANGOVER SQUARE (1945). The young drives are played by Mary Murphy (as soldered ash Price) and Patrick O'Neal (as his companion detective police ?? curiously enough, he would himself take the lead in a similar piece, CHAMBER OF HORRORS [ 1966], which I have acquired just in time to serve as one yet). An interesting sideline here is the adoption of the letter of a novel detection technique, fingerprinting, which is crucial in bringing about the falling price (in a closer predictable, but rather left leaf) though the persistent snooping of amateur crime workshop owners He has at least as much to do with it in the long run! Watching the star in a made-to-measure role, the movie results a good thing in fun ?? particularly in a compact minute 73 minutes.
