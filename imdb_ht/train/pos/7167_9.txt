I could not keep out of comment after it's very short "bad name" comment. This movie is better than just not bad. The act is stellar, even in children at the cast, who does not play nice or anything else but acts just like my son's friends. The movie is smart and expects its audience to be as well. The double back flash story line imagines and contributes to the story rather than acting as time filler. I watched this movie with my kids and then I watch it again by myself a few days later. If you have children and sick of death in movies that inspire a diabetic comedy and sweet syrup, then check out "holes." My 6-year-old enjoyed as much as my 11-year-old, and my husband and I loved it as much as two of them. How many movies can you say about?
