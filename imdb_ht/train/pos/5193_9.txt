The sword battle came out of this world, the spectacular battles scene without flying on a wireless technique (until the end) that way too common today. The scene with Chan and Prayer was probably the highlight of the movie. The characters of the attack on the bad guys mansion were cliche, but the movie is comfortable with it. An injection from humor from Woo. The draw with its twists and turns was unpredictable and interesting and you could not tell who was good or bad or around where they were on. <br /> A good sense of suspense and well timed surprises. Depth of the story is quite intense for a movie thief in this genre and comes in the way the most kung-fu flicks do not.
