This is not a good movie but I still love it. Clovis of cats is gold in a jar as well as the premise of the cats themselves - intensively opposed to the evil Sleepwalkers. I think that this movie has more than just achieved, basically it's very hard, but this brusqueness can sometimes be good. He got the reindeer line, the abrupt end and a comedy component aimed by the bumbling policemen. Can anyone find elements of insestinal a bit disturbing? Finally this movie is relaxed and randomly, which is quite effective, I compared it to Psycho - the relationship between mother and son, switching to protagonists. I think both of them also work, this is not a movie that you want them to stretch, it only works if it's short. <br /> I still do not know whether the director was lacking in depth, or if he did these things and goals, we know Stephen King has the ability, but I do not even read books, just see some of his movies them. <br /> Anyway, I like it. If you love movies movies with 80's overtones just watch it. but do not expect too much. It's really so bad.
