Oh love we do not like it when our love-our-love-interest interests develop our brain? <br /> <br /> Something happened to people, they lost the ability to enjoy, a simple feel-good, love story / comedy? Kirsten Dunst is a revelation - funny, sexy and real. I laughed loudly ooh at least five times and I'm not ashamed to say that there was a tear in my eyes a couple of times too. Casting, acting with script is great, I watch a lot of movies right across the board and I have not seen one of this genre of success. Those who agree please tell me where I can get some! I'm sure the book is good too but I think you must judge it on its own basis.
