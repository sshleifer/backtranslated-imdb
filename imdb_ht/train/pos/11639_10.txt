I saw an advanced screening for this movie tonight. I absolutely love it. The movie caught me on the corner of my chair all night. Cillian Murphy is very creepy as the villain. For those of us who saw Batman Start, his character was very scarier in this movie. He plays his character very well. The most frightening of "bad guys," I saw in a moment. Rachel McAdams was great. All of the audience was laughing, gasped and brave at the same time, as if we were on cue. The suspension is made in the movie out. This amazing part is that the end was not anti-climatic. I was not disappointed at the end. I felt satisfied. The trailer does not do justice to films. This movie is better than the trailer indicated. Do not wait for this movie out on video. Go see it. Although I did not have to pay for this film, I would be happy to give 10.75 to see it. Enjoy!
