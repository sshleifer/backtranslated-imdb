This movie was rather terrible movie Vipul Shah at last was good one this was just bad although it's a good story and it is busy in a great way Aatish Kapadia that fits this movie from another gujarati play "Avjo Wahala Fari Malishu "made a good pianful but slowly 2 and a half hours to look has a lot of flaw in this movie but it's still a song to attract them rather blue to do out and not work well but still good overall not a movie you would like to watch it is always a story to take into account and it's good if you're kind of very good movie relationships with loads of flaws and humor that really does not need even one bit
