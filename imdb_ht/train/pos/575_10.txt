Great drama and cover areas except for screenlay that were too slow and should have been to show the most important scenes as the President's Pitt interview, or Pitt is getting murdered instead of just being described. they would have kept the audience awake .Cut away a few minutes unnecessarily could make more room for more heart scenes like these.The relocation of the movie caught this one out of all time magnitude although they saw Pitt here doing the movie for worth watching.Also, big fans of riding, early 20th Century styles and Montana will really love this as well ........
