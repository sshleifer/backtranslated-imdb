I was surprised, that the 'secret wrath' was an enjoyable movie good ... Probably because, I did not have any expectations for this movie ..... Though, the film has its draw hole. ... I would say, that you could not guess who was behind the whole plot, until the very end of the movie ..... At first, I thought, it was Robert Ryan, when Using the same method as "light gas" where husband tries to drive his mad wife, but I was wrong ...... The main problem, and the film is, they drive in one whole direction, which There was no indication at the beginning. ..... I thought, Robert Ryan & Claudette Colbert brought the parties well ...... Plus, Vivian Vance, a fine character actress, who steals the one scene this ..... Everyone who loves movies, which keeps you guess, will be like this one ......
