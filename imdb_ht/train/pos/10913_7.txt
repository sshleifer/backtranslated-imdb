William Powell is a doctor-related murder and an ex-wife of "Ex-Mrs Bradford," also starring Jean Arthur, Eric Blore, and James Gleason. It seems that Powell had chemistry going and just about any woman with whom he was associated. Though he and Myrna Loy were the perfect screen couple, the actor made a couple of other movies "Thin Man" kind, one with Rogers generation with this one and Arthur, both in very good effect. One never gets tired of seeing Powell as a professional, vocalist and the "Ex-Mrs Bradford" is no exception. The former-Mrs. B has Mr. B who used an assignment to return food and then moved back to help him solve a mystery that he had dragged into. And this is not the first time he did that! It almost seems like if there was a movie "Bradford" before that one or that was designed to be the first in a series of films - Mr. B complains that mystery-extract secretions are constantly being brought to the case. This time, a jockey riding the favorite horse in a mysteriously increasing fall on the horse and dying right before the finish line. The solution in the case is kind of strange but it's around the point. The point is the gender between the couple and the interference of their ex-wife. B. Jean Arthur is quite glamorous in her role and is very funny. However, with an actress who comes as brainy as Arthur does, the humor seems intentional rather than plimbrained. I suspect the writer had something else in mind - say, wacky side of Carole Lombard. When Arthur heard that the police had arrived, he said, "Ah, it's probably about my retirement .. I was waiting for the police to take a hand in it," reads more on a Powell rib rather than a serious statement. She always works well, and shows how a good actress can do her own part. <br /> <br /> Definitely worth seeing, such as William Powell and Jean Arthur always were.
