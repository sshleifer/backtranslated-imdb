Oliver! The music is a favorite of me. The music, the characters, the story. It all just looks perfect. In this tradition of the classic timeless novel turned music scene, director Carol Reed brings the Broadway hit into life on the movie screen. The transition from movie music music is not an easy one. You have to have the right voices, the right set, the right script, and the right play. All the signs show yes to this game. It almost appears that it was written for the screen! <br /> Our story takes place in Jolly Old England where a boy named Oliver manages to work his way out of the orphanage. He vanishes his way to the country in London where he met up with a group of juvenile delinquents, led by Dodger, the smart voice, quick release pocket-check. The leader of this gang is called Fagin, an older fellow who sold all the stolen goods. But all is not well in London city when Bill Sykes is played by Oliver Reed and his love girlfriend Nancy get tangled up with Oliver, Fagin and his young troops, and the law. What to indicate is a wonderful story of love, affection, and great music number. <br /> Whether or not you like music or not, one listens to these tunes and you will be colorful all day long. Oliver! is a triumph over and on stage and is a timeless work of art.
