The "Shop around the Corner" is one of the great films from director Ernst Lubitsch. In addition to the talent of James Stewart and Margaret Sullavan, he is filled with a terrific cast of top character actors such as Frank Morgan and Felix Bressart .They are the type of character actors that Hollywood sadly does not hired. In fact, the movie itself is the kind of movie that Hollywood does not do anymore. (The musicians of "You Received Mail" claim their movie to be a remake, but this is just nothing but a lot of praise for yourself.) Anyway, if you have an affection for romantic comedy In 1940, you'll find the "Shop around the Corner" to be nothing short of wonderful. Like good repetition. Enjoy!
