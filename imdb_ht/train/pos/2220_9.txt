We tend to forget that the master / slave context of the past century led to more than well-tended estates, powered by large groups of people slaves, and a lot of money for the white owners. It leads to a group of people who hold in the middle - generations from slave masters interfere with female slaves. <br /> <br /> Some of these kids just became slaves, and others were free ... but free and colored, which back then meant nothing but the relative many of them. <br /> <br /> A class that forms around the knees - the eyes of free color or free people in color - and that the class could, to some extent, to own property, raising themselves from downtrodden educate, and achieve a comparative dignity. That is, they are not slaves, but they were still exploited to a certain extent. <br /> <br /> Often, women lived as mistress of the white plant owners and wealthy people, set up in their own homes, and allocations, paying school for their children, and a kind of kindness, depending on respectability they chose to impose their family. In essence, they were prostitution themselves to ensure their own prosperity, and relative independence from work - an arrangement called Plaza. <br /> <br /> Feast of All Saints is a beautifully written story about the children of a woman, resulting in just such an arrangement with a local guys, and those who touch on their lives, to both negative and positive ways. The story was an eye-catcher for me, a New Zealander, that has no real conception of the black / white lines, let alone gray areas in the middle of the people of color free trod generate. <br /> <br /> Characters are very three-dimensional, and were well-rendered in this adaptation of the novel, by Anne Rice. The parties are well driven, the costumes are wonderful, and the brutal line lines are drawn out, and the disturbing areas make it all the more distinguished by the protagonists of the protagonists going on. Gentlemen of the colorful free could not get white, the slaves could not help themselves, and the white ones, even those sympathetic, could not bring the face to the economic fact of doing so right by people to relinquish so. <br /> I recommend this story, both the novel and the miniseries, to all, over the counter. If you can not handle the truth you will cringe and cower in some parts, as one injustice after another has been meted on those in color, both by the white oppressors, and by their own people. Bear in mind though that this is nothing more than reality, and this story is a way to absorb learning about it. <br /> I know it can sound bleeding, but this miniseries both entertained me and enthralled me, despite the sour taste I found in my mouth of what was going on, and I enjoyed it. Look-l. If you do not read up on the period, because there is a lesson to be learned from it all.
