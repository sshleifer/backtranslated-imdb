Citizen X tells real-life drama in search of a serious assassin armed "The Rostov Ripper" This great movie shows the long journey she has taken to try to capture a killer. The film shows how policies can help the killer continue to rattle for more than 12 years. (Perhaps more than 50 victims, mostly women and children) Stephen Rea's performance as Lead detective and Donald Sutherland as General Survey lead was superb. Jeffrey DeMunn as Chancellor Andrei Romanovich Chikatilo. This is the kind of movie that will malicious you and instantly have you on the Internet to research the real case. This movie should not be missed. It debuted I believe in HBO and never found a theater release in my understanding. Great movie
