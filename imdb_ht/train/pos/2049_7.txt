This movie is very cheesy, but I give it credit for at least trying to give some characterization to its principles. There are some great moments in the movie and the dialogue has some great moments too. <br /> <br /> The sequence of aerial attacks is perhaps the best part of the movie. <br /> I guess I really love the idea of ​​how long a veteran will go for a fellow veteran. Make sure you are not all well done, but the quote is not at all bad. <br /> Tom
