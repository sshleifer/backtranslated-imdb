Thelma Ritter stole the picture. I just finished watching it again. I could not help to become emotional in her final scene. He did not get the Oscar. That's why you should not trust too much of Oscars. Richard Widmark has never had a better part and has been perfect casting as a 3-D, flawless person. Jean Peters was great as the street, hard girl in her best role ever. And Richard Kiley must have been very good; why would I hate that other thing? Yes, it was heavily released on the patriotism; but without it, you do not have much of a movie. Watch the faces! Three stars themselves did not really need much script. I would like to see them doing this movie without dialogue. If you've ever seen Ray Milland and Rita Gam in the "thief", maybe you know what I mean. When I was a kid in 1956 in my first trip to NYC, I made my Uncle Bronx driving to South Street Street looking for No. 66. It was when I knew Hollywood could not trust. But I found the river. <br /> I do not give away in the story because I hate it when I know what's happening before I see it for myself. If you've seen it, no eligibility is needed. Just maybe, someone who reads these comments has not seen "Pickup on South Street". You will love it; just do not go looking for 66 South Street in New York City.
