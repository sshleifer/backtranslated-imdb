This document really opened my eyes to what people outside the United States thought about the attacks September 11. This film was briefed together and presented this disaster more than an attack on US land. This is a disaster impact from many different countries and perspectives. I believe this movie should be more widely distributed to this point. It also helps in the healing process finally sees something more than news report about terrorist attacks. And some of the pieces are actually funny, but not abusive. This film has become highly recommended to me, and I pass on the same feeling.
