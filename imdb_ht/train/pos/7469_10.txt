This movie was just absolutely brilliant. It actually made me think. During the film I was confused as hell. I loved everything about it ... it was just so confusing and so brazen and weird, it was hard not to like it. All actors were phenomena, and no one could do a better job ... This is one of my favorites in the year ... it deserves an OCAR.
