As another IMDB review notes, this movie starts a bit slow but it gets considerably better as it goes along. Yes, it is released by Roger Corman, and yes, it goes on some of the same themed grounds as the highest precedent budget as FATAL ATTRACTION and POISON IVY. However, the postponement of the wife's career as a blues singer rising against loneliness pick up the husband and needs almost Freudian to fill emotionally and physically "canceled" or "holes" while he's going along with smart use of minimally and environmentally friendly nicely done. Using a lot of numbers and characters, and also uses water in almost every scene both as a symbol and cleaning metaphorical symbol, all this movie, though clearly suffers from a minuscule budget, reminds me of several The way to achieve the more accomplished and most recent scenarios, namely the French movie "Boolean" that it seems to me at least may have been liberally borrowing some useful ideas from "UP against AMANDA." With a range of tools, UP against AMANDA keeps its suspicions with a look, fatalist look at surrendering to occasional lustful testimonies, but to achieve this as well or better as other films in this genre. The twist of the stepfather abuse of Amanda in the past (again, very Freudian) is also very unique in this genre and interesting. I agree with other viewers on the unexpected and sympathetic reaction to Amanda's fight in the elite story. Throwing is excellent I think. <br /> <br />
