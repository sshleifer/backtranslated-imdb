Some say about the 'play is the most important thing', or something like that, is attributed to that old Bard of Avon, himself, William Shakewspeare. if it was not old Will, it may well be our own, super-veteran movie director, Mr. Raoul Walsh. There are a large number of films that would support this hypothesis. None are more appropriate than JIM JAMES (Warner Brothers, 1942). The movie also rises another award, named as Flynn's favorite Errol in its own car start. It clearly gives evidence screen that would easily lead viewers to sit in the dark theater, or watch it on their home or DVD TV, to conclude. <br /> <br /> For sure, the story is a semi-serious biopic, which takes a portion of real material and combines it with a liberal dose of the old imagination to bring us a very satisfying, albeit a bit fictional (what biopic is not?) uncertainty. It's excellent, as it does good nutrition to the natural athletics of our lead, Mr. Errol Flynn. Even though not a Swashbuckler, a Western or a War of Pictures, this GIMELY JIM is perhaps the starting point that was best fit for the Australian rugged. <br /> <br /> Errol was a member of the Australian Olympic Boxing Team in either 1928 or 1932. Her training and skills of 'sweet science' are clearly demonstrated in the film and especially in the "Big Fight" for the Championship Blade of the great Boxing Army with the great John L.Sullivan, himself. (Play in expert mode by Ward Bond) Throw in it as a list of homework assignments at residents of Warner Brothers' support players. He introduced Alan Hale as father Jim Corbet, a Wagon Wagon operator *. His two brothers are Harry and George (Pat Flaherty and James Flavin), of the 'blue necklace' of the family, their occupation being declared 'Longshormen'. <br /> <br /> Big Jack Carson has made him the usual serial-comic performance performance in support of Jim Corbett's friend and fellow banker Teller. The rest of these we can both recognize and remember are John Loder, William Frawley, Madeleine LeBeau, Minor Watson, Rhys Williams, Arthur Shields, Dorothy Vaughn in the name but a few. <br /> <br /> Director Walsh also uses a number of Pro Wrestlers in the role of various boxers. So we have Ed "Strangler" Lewis with an unknown grappler * featured like 2 water pavers in the opening scenes. Others were Sammy Stein, Mike Mazurki (ever heard about it?) And "Wee Willie" Davis. These guys had a powerful, yet unpolished look at them that old Pier 9 brawlers would own. <br /> We Never Had Leading Lady, Alexis Smith. It is powerful in characterizing it in an "independent" woman, but maintaining true true ability as a funny player in many of the scenes. She shows quite a set of her part as poor little girl, Victoria Lodge. <br /> With all these ingredients in hand, the trick is how to mix the components in proper proportions to give it just the right mix. Well, Director Walsh does so with a reckless abandonment. Because it is looking for, above all, a great movie. His treatment shows all the skills he has had in a fine fine starting with his day as a player and D.W. Griffith. Mr. Walsh seems to have a special fondness for that period, in 1890. Walsh's message moves to the script in a fast clip clip, breaking the display scenes and a line-line punch, "The Corbetts of It Again!" So it is able to keep a light, even touching comics in a story that can become too painful and serious. <br /> <br /> In addition, in an almost unnoticed element, Brother Walsh gives us an authentic look at a San Francisco in 1890. And as a further example of his dearness for this period, he creates wide, dynamic images of the Battle of Historic Prizes. There is a vibrant, happy atmosphere aimed at these boxing scenes. As a crown crowned by this great, perhaps filmmaker film, Director Walsh gave the image a look as if it was an illustration of the Police Gazette, covering these events in those "Old Days". There is one thing to remember before looking. If it is for the first time, or if you see it once more: <br /> <br /> "CORBETS are in it again!" <br /> <br /> * In my humble opinion as a historian of both Film and Pro Wrestling, she looks like Tor Johnson, who later was a favorite of Director Ed Wood. <br /> ** A 'Livery' is a bit of a reaction to a vehicle for local transportation. <br /> <br /> *** It's true. Mr. Raoul Walsh was a Griffith Veteran player. He was the actor to show John Wilkes Booth in the nation of a nation (1915). <br /> <br /> **** Being born in 1887, Raul Walsh was old enough to have his own memories of the 1890 and the Sullivan-Corbett Tour Bout and what it meant for the life Articles in America in those days.
