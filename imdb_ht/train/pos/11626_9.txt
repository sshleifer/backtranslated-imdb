This is a nice, rhythmic comedy by Wes Craven (Nightmare on Elm Street), who for 85 minutes left aside the supernatural and presents us with something even more dire - evil in human beings. We are far more likely to encounter the harm of Jackson Rippner than Freddy Kruger, and Cillian Murphy (Batman Begins) does an excellent job of presenting a sociable, friendly, charisma. Performance by Murphy and by Rachel McAdams (Claire, from the Wedding Crashers) is brilliant. Most of the film takes place on a very intimate level, between two people, their eyes, their faces. It is action on a small scale, not to sweep through the age of the fabric, and it is no less compelling for these limits. Cinematography is nothing special, though of course one can do only a lot with a camera to the extent of a passenger aircraft, but the dialogue is excellent, the story is stiff. There is no distraction, no subplots confuse the problem that in his heart a fight between the main characters. By keeping his focus and avoiding distractions, Wes Craven is able to take that is a very minimal scheme and turn it into an exciting thriller, speed rhythm action.
