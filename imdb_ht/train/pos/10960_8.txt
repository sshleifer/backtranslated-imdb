I really can not remember who recommended this, but said it was one of their favorite films. It is certainly a strange one - like rubbernecking in a highway crash. Someone said that truth is stranger than fiction, and the truth here is something to see. I really can not understand how a fictional account in this documentary is to be released this year. How can you improve on this? The aunt and cousin Jackie Kennedy removed themselves from the New York Society and hid in the Hampton. In the process they become recluses and what is best described as "crazy cat lady." They would have remained hidden did not move the city to condemn the property for the wound and the subsequent rescue by Jackie. This movie did after that rescue. All during, you could not help but think, "how bad was it before?" It's a look at high society from the darker side, and it's absolutely fascinating.
