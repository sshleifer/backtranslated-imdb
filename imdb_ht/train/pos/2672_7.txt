"Journey to Hope" tells of a poor Turkish family and their odyssey in hopes that spirals descend into despair as they travel to Switzerland in search of prosperity. Although this movie has Oscar fairly well-fabricated, it lacks substance and has many implausibility. Many of the movie time 1.7 run the time to get to the bus, get to the bus, get on the boat, get into the boat, get into the wind, get out of the wind, etc; time may have been better than or left out completely. The story has a predictable conclusion, especially for those who have a common sense crime in the traffic of illegal immigrants. A refreshing and unrealistic look, but over-rated.
