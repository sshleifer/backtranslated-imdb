Just one of the best ever! Richard Brooks's adoption of Truman Capote's non-fiction novel is truly an artistic success. Stunning black and white cinematography (which should have been an Oscar), a quintessential haunting point of Quincy Jones and tremendous performances by Robert Blake and Scott Wilson as the oddly-matched killer. This film was 0 to 4 of the Academy Awards and was not even nominated for the best photo while Dr. Doolittle was. Go Face! Even if you do not find the clutter family as well as you do in the book, it was a good decision to focus more on Perry and Dick and the pain-tuned process of tracking these guys down. John Forsythe is also impressive as Alvin Dewey. There is simply no flaw in this one. 10 out of 10. Best Performance = Scott Wilson and R. Blake a second lock. Highly recommended!
