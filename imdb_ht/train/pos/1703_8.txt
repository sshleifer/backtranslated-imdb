When you come from a small town in Illinois myself, I can immediately relate to this movie. Considering the era he did in, the townspeople looked comfortably like a lot of people I grew up with. Yes the scheme is so-so. And yes, the Acting will not be nominated for an Oscar anytime soon. But not the point. The point is to stop reality and just have fun. And this movie has fun aplenty. Out of the greedy, uncharged banker of the well-meaning but dimwitted deputy, this film was made of keen pleasure in the genre of SciFi and small town living in its best. Who can not smile at the sight of the Drone Enforcer or Vern Droid? and I love the FarmZoid. Want me to have one when I was growing up. Generally, considering the technology being available at this time, this is a fantastic one in childhood, when you might sit back on an afternoon saturday, popcorn, and laugh at the foibles of small living city. This is a movie I would watch again and again, if for any other reason than to have fun in my mind and my little city.
