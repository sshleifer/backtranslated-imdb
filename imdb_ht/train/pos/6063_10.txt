Assistant to the Lost Kingdom is a movie about a young ruler (Simon) who was removed from his government due to his father (the king) being killed by clich√© "the adviser of evil". This movie about Simon's pride. Special effects, draws, acting, and generally everything about this film is BAD. However, it's so bad that it's funny. You will keep watching this movie simply because it's so bad it's funny and, like the other criticism of the movie said, it's so bad it's good.
