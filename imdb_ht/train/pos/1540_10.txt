This is an incredible movie. I can not remember last time I saw a Swedish movie this layer. It's funny, it's tragic, it's compelling, and most of all it's a slice of Swedish town's life. It breaks the clicks, and stays deeper. It makes you feel connected, not only to the main characters, but to all the characters. <br /> <br /> Big city girl draws back to her roots, her little town, celebrating her 70 grandfather's birthday, crossing paths and people she has not met in many years. Although the story itself is not unique, it offers a cool approach. The center of the story is the relationship between three sisters (on different stages of life), which is not very close. Or at least do not realize how close they are. <br /> <br /> One main reason why it's so easy to connect with those people in this movie is the Immaculate cast. First, I'm more than happy about the fact that there is absolutely no so-called 'A-list' Swedish actor in this movie. Usually there are a handful of actors who have the ability to find their way to almost every major production in Sweden. This time the company manages to keep it real by casting actors who actually seem to like their profession. Sofia Helin is probably the first Swedish actress since Eva RÃ¶se to prove that you do not need words to give an emotion. <br /> <br /> The report is also very appealing. The dialogue is more than credible, and compared to other Swedish films from last year or two, it's in front of miles. Maria Blom controls everything from the beginning, and if you did not know, you would never guess that this is her first writing and directed a feature film film. I can not wait for the next one. <br /> Once you start watching this, you really want to see it in.
