In an era of these awesome designs, I am rather in shock to seeing a movie and the good moral ones making it in the bottom IMDB list for animated movies. <br /> <br /> This movie contradicts the first. I will not refuse it. However, when I was in the target target group for this movie, I did not even notice, nor would it have to report if I did. Those who did it can use "New Generation" to remember that another way the Family Bear Care could begin. Perhaps we mean to decide for ourselves how Care Bear's family really started. <br /> This was my favorite movie at age 3-6, and it did not scare me or confuse me at all. > <br />
