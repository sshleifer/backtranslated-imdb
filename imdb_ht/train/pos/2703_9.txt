I'm not a big fan of kitsch camp and "so bad it's good" look kind. However, I really love this movie for its fun factor and - believe it or not - it's innovation. <br /> <br /> The whole thing has a ring of John Waters and is unlimited enthusiastic, but with some superb actors and considering the direction that makes the most of the slapstick and stylized movement. Billy Zane moves with incredible expressions (see the scene in the bus for a textbook lesson in how to use motion) and is framed by some unexpected stars. <br /> You may not like this movie, you can not enjoy it, but if you get the chance to watch it, then spare the time because the odds are you'll end up the movie with a smile your face, and a new perspective on humorous sense of some big stars. Very recommended.
