A Murder investigation goes on stage back while the Vanities, on its opening night, play on an unknowing hearing. Odd combinations of music and murder mystery is worth a look for its cast, its production number, and the sheer gift of the movie. Gertrude Michael has the role of bursting an intense bitchy actress on stopping the wedding between the star show, Kitty Carlisle and Carl Brisson, as well as starting the infamous "Sweet Marijuana" number a 70s Bette Midler album). So, while the girls choral shuffle around sliders, bumbling detective Victor McLaglen ogles the girls while trying to solve the slippery murder of an unknown woman. We quickly know that the maid (Dorothy Stickney) loves Brisson out of well, that the wardrobe lady (Jessie Ralph) is Brisson's mother, and that the scene manager (Jack Oakie) is locked in everything. Many of the twists scheme among the music numbers. The best-known chansoon is "Cocktails for Two." Kitty Carlisle also sings the haunted "Where are they from?" And there's a weird rhapsody that erupts in a Harlem specialty feature featuring Duke Ellington! Well threw it. <br /> Some terrific acting here, especially Gertrude Michael and Dorothy Stickney. Kitty Carlisle is quite good as well. Brisson is a total zero though. <br /> <br /> Charles Middleton Play Homer, Toby Wing Play Nancy, Donald Meek playing the doctor, and also see if you can spot Ann Sheridan and Lucille ball among girls shown.
