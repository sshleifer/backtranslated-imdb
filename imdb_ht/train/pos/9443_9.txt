It's a shame that Deliverance is mostly known as the Redneck Recorder movie and Dueling Banjos. Even those who have seen the movie can not get their ideas off in rape scenes. It's not as bad as the rape scene in Pulp Fiction. It's certainly not as bad as any rape scene just about any movie. People tend to miss the power of the movie that has the infamous buggery scene. Acting, the plot, cinematography, and soundtrack of Passover all borrow a hand in it charismatic brooding. The backcountry he shot in is beautiful and is well in dealing in the subject subject matter. Both major and minor actors make you feel like you are rafting down that river right along with them. <br /> <br /> The thing that separates this movie from others is the tangible sense of fear that it inspires. Not many films can make you feel this out. Under Line: This movie is a classic. I can not say much more than that.
