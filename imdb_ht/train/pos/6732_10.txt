This was the best documentary I've ever seen !! I just saw Master of Dogtown and wanted to know more about Stacy Peralta, and was surprised and happy to find out that this was one of her films as well. Gran Job Stacy! I was kicking back to work last week, bored O * & ^% less and this movie came up. Growing in Orange County in the 80's I surfed up and down the local beaches and did my father when he was a teenager. I grew up in the beach, my parents took me every weekend, my body sailing, boogeyboarded then moved out there. This movie just my fascinating. It was way before my time but it was awesome to see what these guys were going to .. Transformer Period! This movie is a collector item.
