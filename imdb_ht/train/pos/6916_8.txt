Winchester '73 was the movie that moved Mann from the b movies to the big league, delivering floundering career to James Stewart after war in the process by casting him as a hero of conflict (although since he inherited the project from Fritz Lang, Maybe Lang deserves credit for that). Both men would go to darker places - Mann and the Doorway's remarkably weak devil, who lived shelved by MGM until the successful Broken Broke success convoy was released? but a movie about a hunting man descends his own brother like the rifle of the title handed out to the person people along the trail before it ends up in one of the beloved hills directly the director is still stronger meat than you expect from the studio system. Great dialogue, an impressive cast to support ?? Dan Duryea, Is Geer, Millard Mitchell, Stephen McNally, Shelley Winters, Charles Drake, Tim McIntire, Jay C. Flippen, Tony Curtis, Rock Hudson among them? with the exceptional sense of the visual person raises the bar with this one.
