As far as the Muppet line goes, however, this is not the best, nor the second best. This has been marketed towards the kiddies, but there are some black and emotional moments, where parents can not want to expose their children. One of the exams of Miss Piggy will be "mail" to a jealous, long-lasting rhythm during this time of work. <br /> <br /> Beyond that, however, the story is progressive, and very fun. A scene from which Joan Rivers and Miss PIggy go berserk in a department store is simply hilarious! And there are other parts of this work that include the same level of leverage and pleasure. <br /> I love this much, and enjoy it still today. <br /> It rates a 7.6 / 10 from ... <br /> <br /> The Fiend:.
