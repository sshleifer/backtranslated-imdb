Great fun. I went with 8 friends in a tape preview preview of this movie. We came to see only one different, but after 10 minutes we asked what we had to take ourselves in this time the jokes became comical and remained humorous throughout the film. In the first part you just keep asking yourself about the thing 'malinski' and 'bellini' (there are many more examples in this language) and because they keep repeating the same jokes (with different twists) they find funnier and funnier. In search of this malinski all the main characters are introduced to the first one even wackier than the next. Up to half of the movie was about us did not even know the film name because there was no opening credit and we went to watch this sneak, but we sure had a good time. The house was packed (approach to 250 people) and I think that half of them did not like it and the other half liked the movie. If you love strange comic movies and great dialogue you will love it. Apart from Clooney this movie deserves a lot better than the 5.6 rating IMDB it has at the moment I write this, but when more ppl saw it I'm sure it's going up. 7.0 is reasonable I guess I would give it an 8 out of 10. (10 out of 10 after a few beers) <br />
