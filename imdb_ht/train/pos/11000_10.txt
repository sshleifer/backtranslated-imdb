If you entered the movie with expectations, throw them away now, because there are no hassles of doing this movie. This category of a single genre would be criminal. It's a spyware thriller, contains elements of noir, bits and pieces of action, science fiction, and cyberpunk all tied together with a brilliant narrative, self-curved twisting draw, and gorgeous movies. The comments here are centered around it being derived, both in good and bad way, in other cinemas. But as they say, each story crib from Shakespeare, so once you can get past, you're in for a hell of a ride. <br /> You will need to stop your disbelief at some point, and while the wear never gets incredible, there is portion (read: the elevator) who suffers from a low budget and visually a bit cheese. By misconstructing it's the same level as cheese sci-fi movie cinema, though, because this is about a higher level. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for action, you should turn off. This is pure psychology. But if you want to sit and devote a good 90 minutes to your life to a novel cinema experience, by all means, do it now! Watch this movie right now before it gets cool to see it!
