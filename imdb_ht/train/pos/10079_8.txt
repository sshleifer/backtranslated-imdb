I enjoyed the cinematic recreation in China in the 1930s in this beautiful movie. The story is simple. An older male scene wants to spend on his art of a young man although he has no living children. The face of the actors is wonderful to see. The story reveals the devotion and gratitude to the children to treat those who treat them well and eager to treat them well. Opposing them in the movie reminds me of my farwell I CONCUBINE, which was more sophisticated and complicated. The story here reminds me of a Dickens story on the day when children were almost looking. The plot is somewhat predictable and somewhat too sentimental for me but well worth the time to see for the courage, humanity, and history described.
