When I was young I saw very few movies. My parents are in the right to rent this one. I was very cautious at what the movie was about, in fact I did not even allow them to watch it. Brothers and sisters came to the neck and this made me very upset. So what did I do? Late at night I trashed the VCR! Hide the screen of the TV and call the police and report hoops. I was arrested off course, I was able to get my foot from the TV set before the police arrived. I only gave a sharply talk and sent home. My parents made me of course and made me work to pay off the debt for the TV and VCR. This tore me apart, slave labor really absorbs my faith, but I did it. Will make the house around. What happened to the end? We had a big screen TV, DVD player and a sound system surrounded for my work. How do I get the money? Easy to have made movies in my own and selling them to Disney! Do you remember getting neno? Well I wrote that films and filmed them to fish in the fish tank! They rewrite the scheme of course and made it to CGI because they could not afford to make it a real-life real-estate photo like I did! At the end I've never seen the movie that was not dead and the rating I gave it is my life rating! It is doing very good!
