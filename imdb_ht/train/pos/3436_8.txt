Letters with no end destination in another world found in the rooms back to the post office. Here, Alice manages to land a job in hopes of finding her lost father. What he discovers is the tease soul of his boss, Frank. A quiet little Aussie cops came up and went to the cinema. Now you find it in the deep black corner of the video shop, overshadowed by fifty copies of daunting film GODZILLA. It's a shame because this turned out to be a movie to satisfy a brave story with simple simple images and effective performance from the two drivers. This movie succeeded in the death of LARRY Marshall's LADY DEPARTMENT (1996 - USA), and came close to the shining, by Kevin Turkey Turkey, but Li Jianjun's POSTMAN (1995 - China).
