Just came from a preview tape for this movie. It made me laugh every 30 circles. The finish was so funny that tears rolled down my face and he wanted me not bought that big coke. There are definitely some lulls, but, in general, very fun. The film allows Steve Carell to have a bright chance after stealing the spotlight from both Jim Carrey's "Bruce Almighty" and Will Ferrell "Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgendy" in the movies. Paul Rudd is hilarious as always. I like that it can be so funny in these great comedies and continues to work in drama indie (like P.S.). I think Seth Rogen should get more jobs, because he is so talented and engaging freaking. Leslie Mann also had some incredibly funny moments. I highly recommend it to those who just want to laugh like a maniac. However, if you're easily offended, do not see this movie. If you are a rabid feminist, do not see this movie. And, please, no matter what, though you think you are one of these "hip" parents, do not take your kids to this movie. Sure, you should let your teens go to this movie, just do not watch it with them. It would be for some unbelievable moments.
