Hrm-I think lines came from the old movie posters. This is a mute movie that seems to have been translated into some languages ​​that were totally familiar to the translator. Here's a tip: Any movie that starts with a black screen and text reading "In the future ..." will make fun. This means that the quote is so implausible that they have to explain it to you. In this case, "In the future" means that, instead of fighting war, nations have guys riding in giant robots and her Duke out to determine, well, this is never very clear but It's probably something that's really important. There are good guys (obviously capitalism, that means "us") and bad guys (Commies!) And there are huge robots stop motion. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the budget effect was very thin, t getting to see a lot of the big robots. There are plenty of cheap looking interior scenes, and then a great space battle near the end. Battle in space is especially beautiful, as it serves precisely no other purpose than the rest of the budget budgets effect. With money saying now passed, the climatic fight degenerates in (and I do not do this up) of guys striking each other with stick. I can always find a laugh at a bar by re-adopting the final scene, complete with a final line of warranty to leave any auditory scratches. <br /> As I said-it's dumb. That's why I bought the tape.
