The only remarkable thing about this movie is that it was Steve McQueen's first roles to begin. McQueen's talent is undeveloped and raw, but refreshing honest in small pieces here little sci-fi sci-fi. Steve shows himself as the anti-establishment, hot rod car like actor who would become a polished icon in the movie industry just five years ago. <br /> <br /> Later on, McQueen said he hated this movie and that "he was patting". But everyone started somewhere and the pate is beautiful, cool and innocent. Have we all been so. <br /> <br /> The plot is fast paced and although predictable, always a fun time or so. And it's really fun to see Steve McQueen before becoming the king of Kool (and Anita Corsaut before he became Andy Taylor's girlfriend). A close friend sends me the DVD shortly back and it's a treasure addition to my movie Steve McQueen collection.
