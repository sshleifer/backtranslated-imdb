A movie, films and meager films, "The White Costume Man" is yet another breath of fresh air in the form of the film from Ealing Studio. While I suspect some modern viewers can initially get it dark, I doubt many would fail to be seduced by the scheme of expert scheme, the themes and characters languidly transmitted during the film. Alec Guinness gives another fine characterization to a film perhaps not as obviously virtuoso as inspired by the Ealing Heart and Coronets from 1949. This time he simply plays a character rather than eight, but as the unworldly inventor and scientist Sidney Stratton, she always finds the correct tone and expression. Together with subtle Guinness', expressive performance, the rest of the cast are effective. In the main players, Cecil Parker and Ernest Thesiger stand out. Thesiger is convincing absurd as the influential but influential business, while Parker is dependable as the mechanism of pivotal milling with pills. The father, that is, to Joan Greenwood, the actress dancer comic actress, who is in his insurmountable peak in this movie. Splendid and seductive in aspect and diction, it is quite sublime in this movie, a fine contrast with the Guinness as unusual, but more illogical. The scene where he apparently tries to tempt him was played so adeptly by the fear that he is both deeply intensely and entertaining ... The terms are handled very effectively, with no moral easy to draw. The complexity of the relationship between science, business and workforce is insightfully and enjoyable to examine. Visually eliminated by Alexander Mackendrick, this film is technically skillful in all areas; evocative photography, sound effects of music and music with a wistful script, all slowly impressed. A well-satisfied movie, with Guinness and Greenwood magnificent. <br /> <br /> Rating: - **** 1/2 / *****
