Whenever I see Nicole I love reading more. I like a movie like this. A woman you just will not give up, but keeps breaking your heart. My first movie is to see how this was in Human Bondage, Kim Novak - Laurence Harvey version. The beefs correctly in the Russian who spoke in this movie are petty, it was good enough to fool me or anyone else who can not speak Russian, I'm sure. Funny how people miss the point. There are no-goodnik Russian guys have also been cast. Finally, I had to tip my hat to Ben Chaplin, as someone else noted, playing a lady with great dignity, and there was definitely some heat between him and Nicole. For thought, guys get PAID for that, mind-blowing.
