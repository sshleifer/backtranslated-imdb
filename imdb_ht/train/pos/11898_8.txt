This film is a perfect portrayal of the Nutcracker; The dance is wonderful, the landscape of the background was excellent, and I love what floating BED. <br /> Oh, and the costumes ... I particularly liked the Marzipan, Tutu was adorable. Special effects were very well done (like the tree, the bed, etc.), and I enjoy the rats. I love how they did not scare, but nice and huggable. Except for the king, I suppose. If you are a handsome man, you will not enjoy this, but this is a very good movie that's good for all ages - just by all levels of testosterone. <br /> But I have a few complaints. <br /> <br /> Firstly, why did they have to put the Sugar Feather Fairy skates into these terrible bars? It would barely make a difference if it was naked! And secondly .. why on the ground did make PINK outfit Culkin?
