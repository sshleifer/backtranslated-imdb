A lawyer draws in a very dangerous game of cat and mouse when he gets involved with a females fatality in this adaptation of a Roman Grisham. Alting creates an atmosphere, gothic atmosphere, but the weak script. Article in a sidewalk, Branagh is convinced as the lawyer, and Davidtz is enticing as the object of his desires. Downey is unmatched as a private detective. Duvall has a small role, which does not allow him to do many with his unusual characters. Hannah and Berenger round out the impressive cast. After an interesting setup, the movie bumps down and does not really deliver on its first promise, but Altman is still worth a look.
