Late, high-class Z driving-in filmmaker exploits by excellence Al Adamson is really outdoing himself with this wonderful wonderful ghost-achieving soft-core music comedy that delights delightfully with depths of absolute absolute selulokid and jaw-dropping stupidity. The fate of futuristic fate of 2047 sex was judged by an illegal act by Big Brother-such as the Bumbling Controller's Scenes (an amusingly Erwin Fuller). However, Sweet'n'sexy Cinderella (Radiant Blonde Cutie Pie Catherine Erhardt) remains determined to change things for the better. With the help of the feudal fairy godfather (a flamboyantly campy Jay B. Larson), Cinderella goes to a grand gala ball and the specific plan to impress beautiful Prince Tom Prince (dorky of the Armstrong Vaughn) and teach everyone who makes love is a positive, fun and acceptable activities. Adamson directs this ridiculous and ordinary incompetence to all-inch inches, ranging the incredibly awful'n'inept songs and dance sequences with a totally lacking sidesplitting lack of skill and flair. Huge illness "We All Need Love" numbers and people in unhealthy absurd creatures on the jungle is a hilariously horrendous wonder; Similarly abominable "Mechnical Man" routine features a bunch of cavorting sick robots. Louis Horvarth's cinema, static movies, miniature plastic miniatures, Sparky Sugerman's really vibrating disco notes, the abundant gratuitous gratuitous (ravishing hottie brunette Sherri Coyle guaranteed special praise in this particular department), the brain-numbingly attempt attempts at leering lowbrow humor (Roscoe Annotator of robot law is especially disappointing), and the performers are just awful (Renee Harmon's passionate recording record of the bad Cinderella suffered the floating high arrow price here) further enhancing the vulnerable luxurious vulnerability to be savored in doozyly dreadably objectionable.
