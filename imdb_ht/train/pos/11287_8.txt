As noted earlier, this review is one of the best Tarzan films. Unlike others, however, I like the start of the movie as it feels like a very accurate expression of what a trading post must have been like. Plus the display needs to know why Harry wants to go back to the jungle. In addition to the beginning of the movie has one of the sequel to the most thrilling and terrifying legs ever made. This happens when Harry's safari group has over a cannibal tribe. The pre-sensitive production values ​​add a lot of realism, really depicting the terrible dangers that Europeans linger in the jungle. The movie offers, though perhaps antecedently, a correct account of how horrible treat the African Africans by their white bosses. In addition sexy Jane, thousands of elephants, some big sets and two chetas! Do not miss a classic adventure.
