I really enjoyed this movie. All aspects of the film were top teeth including the most important, for me anyway, the scenario and acting. This is definitely one of Richard Widmark's most important roles. He is totally convinced of his performance. Just out of curiosity, imagine how Humphrey Bogart or Robert Mitchum could tackle this role. This is my first exposure to Jean Peter's work that I can remember. It is very impressed here that I will definitely be on the lookout for her other work. Thelma Ritter, in an unmatched role, deserves the Oscar nomination she received to play the informer. This film works on every level. Black and white photographs are perfectly inappropriate and look at the viewer's hook right from the beginning. Widmark and Peters have great chemistry in their romance hard. Recommended, 9/10.
