More a snapshot of the most popular pinup of your typical time is to get out of biopic, this fun and fabulous film has the look and feel of the era with an excellent band and all you want in an independent movie type. I think the trend should show Bettie Page as some sort of sex vixen, like Jayne Mansfield. But if you've really looked carefully at Bettie's pose, he still looks happy. Not a "you want you could get with me" to observe watch, or "I just do that because my acting career did not work out" looking at a porn star. So the ladies involved in this film (three women producers, a female writer / director, girl co-writer and beautiful Gretchen Mol, whom I assure that helped shape this role with his own influence) really captured the idea of ​​a sweet, a bit naughty, South girl who really enjoyed having her photograph taken and hoping that good ol 'JC would not be too upset with her. <br /> <br /> Gretchen Mol turns out a high career career (she can just have the most perfect breasts ever), which I'm happy about, because she has the curse. Several years ago, she made the cover of Fairity Fair when no one really knew who she was, touting her as the next Li-Girl. And let's be Frank, which was a bit pronunciation. I mean unfortunately he never did it in Gwyneth's condition, but not for lack of talent. Make a few poor movie choices when you are a pretty blonde in Hollywood poses to make you forget I'm scared. If that does not put it back on the list A, well I'll be a monkey's bunch. <br /> <br /> Private intent, Bettie himself has not seen the movie yet. Bettie left the pinup party on a high score, and fell in love with her old flames, Jesus. Whatever floats your honey boat. You were one helluva woman. I hope you enjoy everywhere. <br /> <br /> Congratulations to Mary Harron, you made our cult of justice.
