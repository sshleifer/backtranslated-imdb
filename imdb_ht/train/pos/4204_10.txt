and anyone watching this movie will agree. This movie was directed at the time when draws, credibility characters and themes actually count. Jean Peters, Widmark, and Thelma Ritter steal the spotlight. Ritter is in the shape of the "Moe" informant and continues to live in the Bowery section of NY, acting as a puppet pigeon for NYC police. Only the other movie where I saw Peters is "Niagara", and it certainly proves its ability to act here, complete with Brooklyn accent. Widmark is a menacing way, such as the anti-hero who must discover what's right, despite his need for cash. The photography is brilliant. The neon, the train station (though it looks pure than the real thing!) Shack the port where Widmark lives as a transient. It is excellent use of the city, and "Lightning Light" in Chinatown; The many flavors and appetites of the city are addressed here; The political climate of the time is a haunting series. 10/10.
