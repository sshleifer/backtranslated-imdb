This is unlike any other movie, the closest thing I can compare to is a Wooden Allen movie ... But where Woody Allen is constantly fathoming people foibles Bret Carr appears to be trying to figure out a way to He goes to the attack with a crippling insecurity that tends to define us for better or worse. In the case of Lou, it is the root cause of his stinging, which can be traced back to a modern Kapou childhood trauma that reveals in the back flash. <br /> There are many unhealthy neurotic people in the world and I believe they all deserve a redemption chance, although the diversity of human characters is after all that makes the world an intriguing place, so maybe we We should not fix our neurosis again than we should fix our noses or breasts. /> <br /> This is an independent film shot on a long shoestring, but the output values ​​are tremendous as the scope of the film.

X Men are a bunch of phenomena if I remember correctly :)
