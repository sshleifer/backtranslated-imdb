I saw this film at Film Festival Film Toronto. Not as salary as it sounds, this is a three-part documentary (each episode is 50 minutes) featuring Slovenia superstar philosopher / psychoanalyte Slavoj Zizek. Zizek takes us on a tour of many classic films, exploring the theme of sexuality, fantasy, morality and mortality. She was directed by Sophie Fiennes, of Fiennes's multi-talent tribe (sister of actor Ralph and Joseph). <br /> I enjoyed this quite a bit, although I think it will be even more enjoyable on DVD, since there's such a draft of ideas to be digested. Freudian and Lacanian scans can be very heavy to see and see the entire set of all at once became somewhat disorienting at the end of two and a half hours. It did not help that a sick-advised coffee and possession of a bladder led me to some discomfort for the last hour or so. <br /> <br /> My only problem with this is that Zizek took the film that was quite obviously full of Freudian theme. It spends quite a while on the films of Hitchcock and David Lynch, not exactly master of intricacies. I would like to see him try to support his theory using a wider range of films, although this really just me says I would like to see four to five and six. <br /> <br /> Zizek is very funny, and part of the humor was watching him introduce what amounted to a lecture while setting himself in the current scenes in some of the films he was discussing. So, for example, we see him in a motorcycle on his way to Bodega Bay (from the Hitchcock bird) or sitting in the basement of the Bates Motel (from Psiko). That does not mean that his theory is not provocative. Even when I found myself in agreement with her, she definitely made me think a little more deeply about the movies. That's exactly what he's trying to accomplish.
