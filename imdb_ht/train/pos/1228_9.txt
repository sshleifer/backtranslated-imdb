This 1991 NBC-TV movie reveals six months before John Goodman's large-screen version of the life of Babe Ruth came out. For my money, there is no comparison between the two. Television production is not perfect but it presents Babe's story with more depth and complexity than a good Goodman dimension. I especially enjoyed the film movie in Ruth's love-hate relationship with Yankee manager Miller Huggins, who always understood her star's brilliance and also kept trying to point out why Ruth's own flawless character would never leave her, become a manager or leader of the players. The TV movie justly notes how Ruth never fulfilled the dream of managing the Yankees because of his flaws, while the horrific Goodman version tries to push the lie that Ruth denied what he should read for . /> This movie makes a great companion piece of "eight Out Men" since the story begins with Ruth's arrival in New York in 1920, one year after the Black Sox scandal and his home time exploited literally saves baseball from ruin. Indeed, the continuity between these films is equally accentuated by John Anderson's reputation as "Maid Maine August" role as Commissioner Kenesaw Mountain Landis.
