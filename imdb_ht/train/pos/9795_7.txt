I always said that Batman animated movies were better than the live action films. <br /> I've seen all of the animated films, but from the bunch, this is the poorest, and it's rather irritating "Mask of the Phantasm" would be ranked as the best, then "Finest World ", then" Sub Zero ", then" Return to the Joker ", and finally this last rank. <br /> <br /> In this newly animated film, there's a mysterious new battery in Gotham and Batman is intended to discover whether it's friends or enemies as it sets out on a quest for revenge. Get involved in three young women, he begins to investigate and discover who is the new batgirl. The tone in this film is very light considered most of the films are manure and weak, which were rather disappointing. Bruce acted out of character most of the time, bandits are being re-used in the recent films, and while the scene of the exciting actions, they're really nothing new. He also misses the dramatic effects of the other films, especially those of "sub-zero" that were heavily drama and character development. Everything in the movie feels nice to recycle and the supported characters are good but no one actually is rooting for. All the time I really enjoyed this, I had an explosion, and the identity of The new batgirl is surprised, but this was not as interesting as I would expect. <br /> <br /> (** half from ****)
