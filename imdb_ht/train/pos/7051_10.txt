Let me start by saying that "War, Inc." is not everyone's cup of tea. It is, however, very enjoyable (and gets you thinking - "Oh, crap"). The comedy involved the movie is not obvious at all - it's subtle assets (Tank Tamerlane, dry-cleaning services etc.), and it changes with twists and turns into the draw. only one, but I will not compare this with "Big Point Blank", because, it's different. Jan Cusack - I would not say it was "amazing" or "brilliant" - but it was good. On the other hand, her sister (Joan Cusack) was incredible in her delivery of line & comedy distribution - even though she was hardly in the movie (I would say the same about Ben Kingsley). Marisa Tomei plays a convincing reporter, and manages to pull her. Hilary Duff is very grateful for her role as Central Asian pop star Yonica Babyyeah. Duff's development as an actress is very noticeable in the film, and it does a very good job (even if its accent is a real tad). In general, the movie is what I might call "fun". It does not have a particular storyline, and it's very funny at times, but it has a subtle message. I would say it's worth a look.
