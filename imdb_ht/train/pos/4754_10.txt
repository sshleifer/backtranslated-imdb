One of my favorite episodes Twilight Zone. And the next day we were in the supermarket in Hollywood Blvd. and La Brea, my father and I, and guess who has come towards us in the go! Barney Phillips, but no hat on - at least, I do not think he's got a hat on. <br /> We asked her about her third eye, she said something like she left her at home, and everyone she met that day was asking her about it. <br /> A friendly guy. We've seen all kinds of character actors in LA in those days. <br /> BTW, I was a teenager and it took a long time to get more than the "three hands" on the alien! <br /> <br /> Robyn Fresh O'Neill <br /> <br /> Hollywood native and resident 1947 to 1963.
