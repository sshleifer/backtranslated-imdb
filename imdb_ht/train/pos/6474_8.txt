I totally drew to this and could not wait for each episode. The act brought to life how emotional a person lacking in the family must, along with the effects it would have on the nearest person. The only problem we as a family had is how quickly it was all 'explained' to the end. We could not hear clearly what was said and have no idea what Gary's part of everything was? Why did Kyle telephon him and why he went along with it? Having invested in a set of five hours we felt cheated that only five minutes were kept back to the conclusion. I was asked around and not one of my friends who watched it was any wiser in either. Very strange but maybe we missed something crucial ????
