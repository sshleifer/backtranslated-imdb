I saw this first movie in '90' early when it was first released. Rooms with a view have also been out. Enchanted April has been much more to offer! I found it more real and ground, the most credible characters of being 'normal'. At the end of the film I felt the same as I did when I first saw BBC production of pride and prejudice, I was denied for the characters to find what they were looking for whether it was insulation, peace, freedom or love. You get a sense throughout Italy so far away from everything they've ever known, that they are so desperate to take a risk and leave behind what is humdrum and structure. But in the heat of the spring of April, everyone's life was loosened and fend (in line with the Victorian corsairs) and quietly rebuilt everyone's satisfaction. What a small gem in a movie! How does it become no better known?
