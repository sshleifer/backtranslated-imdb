As a prince as the first of these two film films movie, the Man's end from the Snowy River is everything that a follow-up should be. It does not break on the toes of its predecessor, preferring to leave this legend that the first movie was live on to some unique immortality. <br /> <br /> The man from the Snow River II is based on the return of Jim Craig to the Snowy River Country after a three-year absence. The film subtly tells a story of changes in the nineteenth century, in Australian history, saga and horses. The scenario demonstrates a touch of Hollywood in lighter colors, an aspect that was absolutely absent in the first movie, but this blends uniquely with the essence of the elegance of Australian patriotism. The draw is far more vibrant than the first film, and many more bursting, with particular aspects of the previous incorporated into the movie, but the man from the Nile River II possesses each essential feature of the movie first; Stunningly beautiful cinematography, a stunning concentration of the Australian high country, the second most impressive foot of his filmed legs, and a fantastic and deeply moving band by Bruce Rowland is the first in any way. Geoff Burrowes has done a superb job with this film, and it is highly worthy of recognition, especially with regard to the quality of the Australian Film Industry. Throw in lead, from Tom Burlinson to Sigrid Thornton, and a well-substituted Brian Dennehy, bring to the parties with as many passions and distinctions as the first movie. As far as suites can go, the man from Snow River II is a prince; a deeply moving experience and inspiration again.
