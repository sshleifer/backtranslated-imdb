Excellent look at a mature woman, which will lose everything (even the pruner has a mortgage). His way of participating in this special "business", the innocence, and the true love existing between people in a small town, it perfectly blends to us as a result of a cool, comedy light and comic. I could not stop laughing with a very funny scene of two old ladies in a pharmacy. <br /> I love the European movie, and movies like this one, my opinion is growing stronger. A movie that I am also recommending to my eyes closed, in this same genre is Waking Ned Devine. <br /> <br /> Saving Grace, a comedy that many friends liked as much as myself. You will love it.
