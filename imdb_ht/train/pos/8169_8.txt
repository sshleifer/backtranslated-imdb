This is a mess upset and pretty convincing. Corbin Bernson is very much in command of this movie and painted his slick into the wild eponymous wildlife control practice. Linda Hoffman plays her cheating wife and is very easy on the eye - unfortunately for her, the little "sad" and the pool guy brings serious punishment in a way the good doctor knows best - shame on that smile! The last half hour of the movie devoted to Bernson's character is lost completely and the spotlight falls on a young actress called Virgina Keehne. A very talented scene, she pigs the limelight from the moment the braces come. Nice foot, too!
