I've seen Cynthia Rothrock's virtually all movie, and I'm the funniest. He reminds me of early movies Jackie Chan. Admittedly, Ms Rothrock may not be the greatest actress, but it is very good to look as both a martial artist and as a very pretty young lady. This movie, while probably not the best of all its films, was the most fun.
