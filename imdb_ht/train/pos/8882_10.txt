Jan Singleton's best film, before wannabees blockbuster such as the Shaft Remake, is a thought-induced film and great acting and excellent balance between the 3 main characters, each with identifying genes. His love for her is that she also covers the problem of childhood blackness, a problem mostly ignored by the media and other films that focus primarily on social-economic issues and racism by white. This film shows that black can also be ignorant and racist. <br /> <br /> The mastery thing about this movie is that it deals with many subjects without getting funding. It's not just about racism, but about how difficult it is to adopt in a new world (college), dating rape, discovering sexuality and isolation. Omar Epps, Michael Rapaport and Kris Swanson each deliver fine performance, and the support cast is equally interesting to Jennifer Connelly as a lecture (with yay) and with ice cubes and Busta Rim as a college boom causing little riots. The only negative is the caricature of a teacher by Laurence Fishburne ("Mantip?"). Surely many teachers are nutty. But they are not as flat. Skinheads are also a bit of a cartoon, but I guess them as well as in real life .. <br /> Overall a great meker piece of movie, if you liked American History X you'll love this one . <br /> 8.5 out of 10
