I saw this film as it was the second feature on a disk that had previously banned the Video Nasty 'Blood Rites'. As bloody rites were entirely awful, I really did not expect much of this movie; but actually, it would seem that Andy Milligan's director director has outdone himself this time as head top head without rites in style and stands high as a slick more than adequate sexual assault. The plot is actually quite similar to blood rites, as we focus on a dysfunctional family unit, and of course; has a legacy of poles. The film is shot in black and white, and the look and feel of it reminds me a lot of the classic 'Trump Humpp' curious waste. There are barely any gore on display, and the director looks more happy to focus on sex, and the term incest and hate the tablet. The act is typically garbage, but most of the women get naked at some point and despite a poor reputation, director Andy Milligan actually seems to have an eye for this sort of thing, as many of the sequences in this movie are actually very nice. The plot is thin paper, and most of the movie is filler; but the music is catchy, and the director also does a surprisingly good job and the sex scene itself, as most are somewhat erotic. In general, this is not a big movie; but it's the likelihood of appealing to the fan of cults, and becoming a better reference than the best known quality and quality 'rites without'.
