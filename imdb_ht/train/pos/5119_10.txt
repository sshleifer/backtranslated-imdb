I just said, this is one of my favorite movies ever. I can not even count the amount of time I've seen. I was already in love with John Travolta, but the first time the camera dipped his body after it all clean-raced looking for his first trip to Gilley, I was in awe. Debra Winger, as always, delivers a perfect performance as the young, naive wife of Bud, but with the attitude necessary to be married to a stubborn and hard-working cowboy. If you are not a country music player, which I did not, this is 1 band that will you sing right with all the words. If you get a chance, please watch this movie-it will not disappoint.
