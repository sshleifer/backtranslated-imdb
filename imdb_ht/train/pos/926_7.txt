I do not know why some critics have shown that many. <br /> It's a great, funny show - probably not the right material for mainstream first, but still ... <br /> <br /> The dynamics of the funny families, and all in all the same you see in most comedy shows. The supported characters are absolutely hilarious. The scheme of individual episodes and frequent Siegfried & Roy jibs are only just above average, but ever so often you have sub-cemetery or one-materio that makes you roll off the street floor. The show was well worth the 8 pounds I paid for it. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />: 8/10
