Who does not know Largo Winch in Trio in France-Belgium-Luxembourg (three countries where French "BD" or "Bandes Drawing" are massively published)? 18 years after the publication of the first comic book, which is itself an adaptation of a series of novels, has been adapted to screen. After a first attempt - and failed- with a TV show, the real thing starts. <br /> <br /> First of all, and that most of the fans did not get, the purpose of this movie is not forbidden to adapt the comic book series. Some essential parts, characters and actions of the original are missing. The film itself offers an alternative and more modern version of the series. As a 1st-class fan of the comic book, I must confess I was nicely surprised. The actors are good, so the storyline, though it might seem too fast. So I recommend this movie to everyone who is interested in financial / political thrillers, but it is clearly not an alternative to James Bond or Jason Bourne series as I could read on the internet.
