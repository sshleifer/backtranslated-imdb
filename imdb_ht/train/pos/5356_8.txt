Run Man is not a big movie, in fact it's kinda funny. But he delivers what you want in a movie Arnie and that's action and entertainment. I do not see how anyone could not enjoy this picture, it's so funny and over the head, that it's almost fun in itself. By the way, this is probably one of Arnie's most quotable movies out there.
