'Ned Kelly' is a movie that made Australians honoring a true Australian hero. We took to the world of Ned, his best friend, Joe Byrne, and other members of the Gang Kelly, as the film explains and maybe justify the Ned's action. <br /> There is an exceptional cast gift, who gives all the stellar performance, which brings the movie into life. (Great work, Heath!) Orlando Bloom was fantastic as Joe, playing the role of tranquil solemnity, loyal very well. I was sweeping at this time. For a moment I almost believe the gang would win the battle in Glenrowan, alas, he did not owe it. <br /> Some aspects of the movie are fictional, and as a hungry Ned Kelly fan (and supporter), was a little disappointed by this. Perhaps also the movie could go again and cover more in Kelly's Gang / Ned's life - I felt I was not covered enough. <br /> Regardless of some flaws, this is a moving movie that blinds all sorts of emotions. (And hey, I would assume this movie would be best to look rather than Mick Jagger trying to show Ned ...)
