A very addictive range. I did not see an exact combination of drama, action, suspense and sci-fi never before. I'm impressed by every chapter. Simply pretty smart, I do not know how the creators invented all this amazing story, each character has a strange past, problem, time relationships, providing the human sense show necessary for creating intimate characters. <br /> The most incredible is the fact that all the characters that are related among them are numbers they have encountered before without knowing it, and so on. Others, security enigma systems and Darma initiatives are elements that do not allow us to lose a chapter. JJ Abrams, what do you think to create this amazing story?
