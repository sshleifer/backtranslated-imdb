In my case I loved this movie because when I saw it I found more than I expected. I mean, this is one of the few animated movies that made me think about its terms even long after I finished. He talks about death, revenge and hell in such a way that he gets you as a punch in your face, even suffering with the sequel to the dream of the mid-point of the movie. That's why this movie is so good: the unique ability of Don Bluth (director) to play with people's feelings and to love or hate a character in no time. That, with the fact that he has many good characters like Charlie and Ann-Marie, who are in the sad but happy ending to say "I have something in my eye" hiding the others that you cried out loud. All I have to say are just some of the good points in this movie. As for the rest, you have to see them for yourself in a very honest movie. Don Bluth, thank you.
