I would say that this film provides an insight into the trauma that a young mind can face when a family is divided by divorce or other disasters. I would highly recommend this movie especially to parents or those who plan to have a family. <br /> I found the characters to be appealing and very sympathetic from a multitude of dimensions. scary monster although probably not scary for most adults, has a very real hint of what the overactive imagination of a terrific fascinating face can create. <br /> I found the movie to be delightful!
