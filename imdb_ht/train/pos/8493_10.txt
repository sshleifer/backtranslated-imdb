this is a great movie ... <br /> I saw this first movie when it came out. I just recently saw this movie again and still keeps up my memory in it. A lot of films we looked when we were younger does not seem to keep up when we look at them later in life. The movie is actually an 80 large example of the movie types being made then. Keaton is at his best, all the actors actually did a very good job and Ron Howard was very good at letting the story push the movie together instead to force it. The pace of the film is fast and some slow tasks and see the cars from the 80's are too funny. When you came from the 80's I liked to see the packet ugly again. This film is a great movie for 80 comedy lovers and movie lovers.
