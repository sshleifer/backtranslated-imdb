A terrorist attempt to steal a biological biological secretion, and in the attempt to escape, is infected when the case involves deadly compromising agents. Soldiers can retrieve the case, but the terrorist leaves his way to a hotel where he tries to hide outside. They eventually make it to where it was hidden, and the "cleanse" hotel and its occupants. Unfortunately they are thrown away by crust, and if you've seen the Return of the Dead, you know what's going on next. <br /> <br /> Zombi 3 has been largely panned by critics and zombie fans alike, as a complete chaos in a movie. While it is a fair evaluation, it does not expose it to high points. For one thing, it has a lot of bloody death to keep gore-meats happy. There is an abundance of zombies that seem from everywhere possible. They're in the water, the rafters of houses, hiding in trees, and for some reason, they love to hide under a bunch of dead brushes, only in spring out of attack as the heroes try to escape. There are even a flying zombie head inside a refrigerator. You will see him to believe it, as this scene alone makes Zombi 3 have to look IMO. It may have some terrible corrections and some very doubtful action, especially from the doctor who has to be one of the worst actors I've seen, but Zombie 3 is still a very fun movie. Sometimes it's good to sit back and watch a movie that does not require anything more than your time and an open mind. Zombie 3 fits this bill, and then some. It's even more enjoyable if you pop open a few beers, and watch it with some like minded friends. I give it an 8/10, just because of absolute enjoyment.
