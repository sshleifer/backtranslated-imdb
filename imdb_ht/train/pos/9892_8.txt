This movie is good cheesy. <br /> A bunch of people trapped in an abandoned school. They start getting killed, they know they've leaned, so what they do? A girl decided to take a bath, another decided to cheat on her husband (who's also) and an old companion for them somehow get a bed (in an old abandoned school?) And go to it . /> And it comes in with the gor with T & A. <br /> And it's also interesting from a historical / sociological point of view. Where's the usual slasher 80 is a reflection on how we see ourselves, or how adults see young people, or as Hollywood sees the rest of the country this has a unique perspective. This is a British movie made to be an American slasher. It's hilarious to see how often the British actors are trying to talk "Americans" involuntarily slipping back to UK accents. <br /> <br /> If you like the 80's cheese slasher (such as pieces) then you'll love this one.
