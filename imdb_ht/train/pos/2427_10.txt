This is really a great movie movie movie. Puppets without the reliquary are typical.This movie has been counting on the actor's talent and he pulled over. He even had a little a comedy in it, but he was not overdone.Once in life is what a supposed crime crime is, not the typical special affects garbage and sex thrown in.I especially loved the interracial aspects of it all. <br /> Now, on the actors themselves. Laurence Fishburne was superb in playing a petty criminal career. She is a shame that she only allowed her to show her talent in her own movie. Title Welliver was fabulous as Fishburne's fish. Eamonn Walker added the film's tastes already perfectly. Paul Calderon was perfect as a fat monkey / drug lord.I loved him acting as "King of New York". But the best act of this film came from Gregory Hines and Michael Paul Chan, who was scared optimally as two of Calderon's henchmen. Once in life is to make sure a shepherd. **** 1/2 * from *****.
