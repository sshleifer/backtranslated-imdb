It helps extremely if one is familiar with the culture and time period in which this film takes place. First of all, these women are NOT geisha, they are oirans (prostitutes) in Yoshiwara-type "green house", about 1860, given or taken .. This should help clear some details that can be confusing of the ignorance . The film deals with issues of loyalty, love and, perhaps more importantly, how people deal with adversity, both their own and that of others in their immediate surroundings. That more outrageous photography along with the hauntingly beautiful music, makes for a nice ride. Just plug it in, stop your disbelief and enter the world. You will not be disappointed.
