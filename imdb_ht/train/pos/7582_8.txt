Shintarô Katsu, best known for the Zatôichi film, again stars in this third and final movie of Kenji Misumi's (mainly known for "Lone Wolf and Cub), led the Legend of Hanzo 'Razor' Itami featuring great dicked one ninjas fight, "ghost", and discovered going shadow over in the Shogunate treasury. The Hanzo's plot was somehow getting stale and repetition .. What was once novel in the movie first, not again. Fortunately, this one was the best then the second thanks for having more humor ... I just glad that they choose to stop at one trilogy (i look at your Lucas) <br / <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />: Mako Midori just left one
