I have her hand in the creative team behind these "American" movies. "Direct DVDs" are usually synonymous with cheap, incompetent movie-making. But last year I was pleasantly surprised when I found myself enjoying the end of the DVD "Naked Mile". The creators took advantage of the opportunity to deliver a raunchy, yet comic little movie. This year offered up the follow-up, "Beta House". This is the honest truth, "Beta House" makes the first "American Pie" movies to look like "The Little Mermaid". This is not to keep banned, tasting, laughing out loud fun. Sure, the story is a bit slim, but this beauty of the whole thing. In the first 10 minutes we are presenting all of the main characters, the new characters support, find a handful of raunchy gags, meet the villains, and establish draw-line in general. With all that comes out of the way, the movie becomes a no-limit ride. The gags are a lot, and they did not hold back to this one. I speak men sperm, urine, dildo, chic-and-dick, sex with sheep, orgazim girls, and more. Not to mention the fact that not one minute goes by without healing or a sex scene. Back to the "Naked Mile" are Jan White, Jake Siegel, Steve Talley, and Eugene Levy (in a similar way to support the role of the latest films). All the cast does fine work. Steve Talley (Dwight Stifler), in particular, has a great energy and presence of screens. I'm expecting good things for her. The film is also packed with great movie reference for those who keep their eyes open. Not far from the biggest street of the movie for me was the "Deerhunter" parody. Classic. <br /> <br /> The bottom line is, if you're a fan of the series, you will feel good at home and "Beta House". It really pushes the boundaries of good taste, but in the end is pretty humorous.
