With films like "Wallace & Gromit" and "Chicken Run" under the belt, the good people from the other side of the pond, Aardman Animation, are now introducing us to a bit of their humorous tunes in the form of "Beast Comfort" .. "From a very early start to their careers," Animal Comforts "is a slice-of-life show where cuts in conversations are removed in their context and provide an animal in some sort. >> <br /> Aardman Animation has gone through the country interviewing people with harmonious questions such as, "Are you a liar?" and then speed things are a bit demanding about their sex life. <br / > <br /> The answers, while seem to be boring and mundane, are actually quite funny, when you understand the dialogue comes first and the animals are added later. ? One of the characters discussing what it looks like for a woman, "I love them kind of thin." is a bug, the walking stick. <br /> There are two dogs discussing odors and smells, while They sniff the rear of a poodle, as they talk about the different smells of a woman. /> There are two birds in a cage. As the "wife" tells the litany that her health, her husband suffered long by her, saying nothing. While it might take some time for "creative comfort" to find it in "leg" it should find a place on TV for those who are tired of the ordinary. While there is more evidence than Carter has once, "animal comfort" is one of a kind and definitely worth seeing. Some of the humor might seem a little racy, it's the claymation that catches attention to children (like the old Batman series in the 60's, the jokes are subtle enough kids they will not find them) and it's jokes are there for adults.
