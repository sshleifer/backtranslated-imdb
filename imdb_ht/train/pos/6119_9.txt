okay but just plain mute. Not bad for a horror movie / comedy. I've been reading how people change it with the Michael version and that's a good trick in my opinion because some horrors hate horrors and when they see this one they will get interested in horror movie like this one or perhaps ( never see it) The horror (possibly comedian) Uncle Sam, I'll have to see on renting or buying movie but 2nd is the best way then one but I bought this one on VHS in Amazon and was receive it November 21, the day before Thanksgiving. worth four dolars, l.o.l. in this movie. <br /> <br /> 9/10
