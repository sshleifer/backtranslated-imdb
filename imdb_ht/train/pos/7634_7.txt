<br /> Ok the movie was not going to win any awards and it is pure bubblegum, and it is a modern update on "It's a wonderful life". But it just came out as a cheap release on DVD and there is a lot worse way for blowing $ 13. You get a movie with a surprisingly strong cast but for most they've always been a year or two from becoming B starters . However it's an enjoyable way than an hour and a half just do not think too much of it.
