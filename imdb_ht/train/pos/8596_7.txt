I thought the Sentinel was going to be a mediocre movie. When I finally saw it, I took a good surprise. The film is not great but it's very fun and the action scene is very well done. This movie reminds me of TV series like 24 or Alias. It's very similar to this series and it reminds me too of Wolfgang Petersen's thriller in the line of fire. If you're expecting one of the original most original And one of the biggest stairs in the history of movies, you'll be disappointed. But if you go with little expectations, you'll enjoy the Sentinel.
