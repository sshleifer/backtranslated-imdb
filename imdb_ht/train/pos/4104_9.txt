It helps you understand Czech and can see this in the original language and understand the Czech tissue and the 'Professionals', but if not, 'Jedna ruka netlaska' is yet another big Czech movie. It's funny, dark and very enjoyable. The higher expense I can afford is that you never know what will happen next and even keep that feeling well in the second and third looking. <br /> For a small country, Czech Republic has produced an amazing number of world-class film and literature, from Hrabal, Hasek and Kundera to the films of Menzel, Sverak and many others. Humorous checks by its very nature are dark and often compromise, but often with a naive and hot feeling behind it. This movie is just that, it is ill and contrary with the less resilient places of human beings, but under it all have a wonderful story filled with promises, good intentions and optimism. <br /> I highly recommend this and most other Trojan and Machacek projects are involved. Enjoying it, it's a movie made for just this reason - anyway, it's as close as the Czechs will ever come to writing a really happy ending ...
