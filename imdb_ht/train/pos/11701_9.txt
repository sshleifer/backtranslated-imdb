This is a great movie for all X'ers ​​generations. What a different world America in 1972 was compared to our 21st Century psychic. You can find a sense of what a 1972 America has never seen as watching this movie. I found that the dress and the car styles brought back my fond memories to a better country than we have now. Just think ... back then there were only 4 or 5 TV stations to choose from. There were no AIDS, Muslim terrorists, Road rage, 911, Bird flu, freeway snipers, etc., etc. The Vietnam War was just about. There will always be 7 years before Star Wars comes out. The personal and internet computer would still be 29 years away. Then the first movie out producers were in the movie market themselves as no other movie company wanted it. So it started planting small Protestant churches in the country being shown on film projectors (This was the days before VCRS of course). The pastor of a church would be interested in showing A thief in NIght of his people would get a copy of the movie. Then he would set up an evening to show it to the church meeting area or lunch area. Members of the congregation would invite friends who are not slaves and family members and would be a social event of the week. <br /> <br /> If you can find past film production output in the movie and just watch it for its nostalgic value, then I think you will enjoy the movie more. Of course I speak as a Xer has. <br /> If I had a time machine I would go back in 1972 and say goodbye to the 21st century cesspool we have now.
