I lost count of just how many times I saw this movie - I probably know all the dialogue backwards - again I draw in it time and again. <br /> Set in Hungary, a young Jimmy Stewart plays qualified Baccalaureate "Kralik" who becomes the admirer secretary Margaret Sullavan's "Klara". Kralik secretly becomes Klara's feather-friend, and works together Klara confides in Kralik on the letter of his letter (Kralik). Clearly Kralik has been besotted with Klara - but he can not make his feelings known while he is in competition with the "feather-friend". Confused? Well you will not - this story has a sweet, ending almost sugar - but we all know it is ending all we want. Other characters worth mentioning are Frank Morgan playing his usual role, this time as the owner of the shop "Hugo Matuschek", Felix Bressart as "Pirovitch", the Confessor Kralik. Joseph Schildkraut as the arrogant women "Vadas" - so well played that you can not help but hate him right from the beginning. Lastly, William Tracy managed to put himself at his head and upstart his faith in a junior store "Pepi Katona". Recently re-made as "You Received Mail" begins Tom Hanks & Meg Ryan for me is not as good as the original - although I suspect that smaller audiences would not agree. <br /> If this film about your area on Christmas, I suggest you pour yourself a nice glass of wine, put a log on the fire and have a handy box of Kleenex.
