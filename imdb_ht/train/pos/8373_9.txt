Note for previous review: This film is "science-fiction adaptation of the iliad" according to the senarist. So, if the references are painful or not, do not apologize, it is the basis for the movie. They admitted they were stolen ... if suited to P.C. term. <br /> <br /> Great flick but too short. Probably did not come as well as the author, director, or studio wanted, but fun humorous. The fact that the studio itself imploded during the making only helps add to its legacy. <br /> A great remarkable budget should not be as fun, and probably would not make the scenario any more justice. But it's fun to dream about the potential. A DVD release with some extra lean is apparently available but I do not think it would play on NTSC players. I have no expert and so constantly try this figure out. For now, I live with incarnation in VHS.
