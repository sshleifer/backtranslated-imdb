The film did not do well in the box office. <br /> I saw it in a sneak preview. <br /> I've always enjoyed the movie. <br /> <br /> I live in 1 of the cities mentioned in the movie where past players moved to. <br /> It's not the best movie ever to put screens but enjoyable. <br /> <br /> Robin did well with his role. The best line of film at the start, by Jack Robin's character: "I was that SOB!" Clean here as not offend anyone. <br /> <br /> Was pleased when it came to DVD a few years back to the wide screen / letter box format. <br /> I'm not a football fan or a real sports fan. But you do not need one such movie.
