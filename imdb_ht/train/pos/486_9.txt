'Luzhin Defense' is a movie worthy of all eternity. It's a brooding, intense film, and keeping my attention the whole time. John Turturro is absolutely stunning in his portrayal of a tender, unique Grandmaster failure, and Emily Watson is spell-binding as the girl, but rebellious child of a highly respected Russian. The chemistry between Watson and Turturro on screen is obvious at the moment the characters meet in the story. All in all, this movie is one of the best in-depth look at the life of a grandmaster chess, and Turturro and Watson add a whole non-core, non-clich√© feel of the movie. Most people will come from the theater thinking, and feel a bit touched by this brilliant looking at easier to love stories.
