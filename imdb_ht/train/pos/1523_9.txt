GBS wrote his own screen adaptation at Nobel Prize winning but he did not live to see it produce (he was an Oscar in 1938 for his brilliant adaptation in his 1914 play PYGMALION). When Otto Preminger was promoted (produced and directed) this production in 1957, seven years after Shaw's death, he noted the British author Graham Greene making the adaptation and it was a solid choice .. Taking a Sign out of Shaw To own scenario, Greene uses materials from Epilogue to stage to create a framed device meld of the acts of the play (one early and a late in Joan's story) in a whole unified and most satisfying way. Where on stage of the shift in tone is buffered with an intermediate, here it works just as well with a return to King Charles Balois's bedroom bed (where the man Joan put on the throne is dreaming of the events that led to his current situation), and more material in the Shaw's Epilogue - the introduction of the John Warwick's Warwick shadow (English "King's maker"). The majority of the language is solid GBS, and their performance from Shauvians Stalwart (such as the Felix Inquisitor Aymler or Harry Andrews de Stogumber) for the newcomers (the film set up Jean Seberg's career) is the first percentage. It may be some jar, only familiar with many Richard Widmark's films, seeing him playing a fragile Dauphin and a bit funny, but the performance - odd self-billing - is professional, though arguably miscast. Symbolism of the opening credits and choices of the director to use the visual vocabulary of black and white films all serve Shaw and the story well. Go in for quality entertainment and you will not be disappointed.
