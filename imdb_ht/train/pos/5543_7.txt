Very well done and spooky horror films from poverty-ridden film companies PRC that usually put out really cheesy films like DEVIL beaten or dipped in flying. German Foreign Manager executive Wisbar does wonderful with a small budget and his studio-tie together. Gantry and goulish Charles Middleton is effective as the Strangler.
