Dekike Takashi Miike's kiddie territory has won me over almost immediately because it demonstrates nerves and courage in dealing with fantasy elements. This is a fairy tale fairy tale to be dark. Like a kid, I thought there was something disaster about the history of the past; terrible things happen to people in most children's books. Miike understands that these classic stories are a little scarier (and more disturbing) than they appear to be at first glance. The film maker takes the archetypal story of a kid on a beautiful quest from the classroom at preschool. It emphasizes the very real fears of a world filled with ever-ending missions. Sneakers love the downplay gravity behind sleep stories specifically for children. I appreciate the fact that Miike was more honest than most Americans. He goes for the jugular in the story but also shows signs of holding. But a self-owned Miike is always stranger than most cinema. I thought it was a great movie. Very recommended.
