"It's all up to you, Ed?" "Now you get to play the game." The day my father left my mother and took me to see this movie with her new girlfriend, on the opening day at Cinerama Dome in Hollywood. I was fourteen years old. I did not even entirely assure that what I saw, but I never forgot it, especially the scene with Ned Beatty. <br /> <br /> Look at it today, thirty-six years later, it still gives me pots. <br /> <br /> My father was a big fan of Burt Reynolds, hence the reason to stand in line for almost an hour to watch what was supposed to be an 'action movie'. I saw two films in the Dome before: "Grand Prix" and "Song of Norway." Well that was not exactly Mario Andretti or the Brady bunch. After I left the theater, I was shell-shocked .. But even at tender age, I appreciated the artistic ... and after seeing again today, I wondered I was still standing after this very dismal witness, but beautifully crafted film. <br /> Try it saying it was a traumatic experience for a fourteen-year-old who always kissed his first girlfriend. I did not blame my dad for taking me, but he was a bit tired of a witness. <br /> As an adult, I still find it quite disturbing, yet I'm still very impressed with the great way to make the movie. <br /> Burt Reynolds as an absolute astonishment, as is all the principles of Billy Red as guitar invited to guitar, Ronny Cox as the sailor of fearful insurance ... everyone does an admirable job. The sound quality is second to none, from the chirping to the ticking clock tickers. Photography, movies ... all technical aspects of this remarkable movie are the first percentage. These morally raised questions, in killing the sexual ansaulters of the consequence of dealing with killing someone, remain as deeply as it has been when this inaugural film was released. And the classic sequences of trying to survive in the desert after dealing with these unforeseen life-changing brutality. These four people, cities, suddenly confronted with a never-imagining situation, raising the bar from horror action. <br /> It's a classic to be sure. With the phrase "you have a lovely mouth" was quoted endlessly, from Saturday night Live in off-the-be-to-round cuffs around the water-cooler work, this film is without a doubt a great part of society culture our pop ... Like "Make My Day" or "I'll Become" ever. <br /> So what would you do if you find your friends were sexually attacked by guns by those mountains far away from your life in the city, cozy beds, wives and kids? But if you've taken the measures Burt Reynolds has done (and I would do the same) would you bury the glass-fast-la-ap-lake, or stand trial and take your chance? The bottom line is: Delivered Deliverance. You can take it to the bank. If this movie does not get under your skin, then you're not human. <br /> Even if you've seen this before, rent it again and ask yourself the question above. My favorite part of the movie remains the same: Ed failing to kill the deer ... then change. Life and unforeseen circumstances can change someone. And I suppose that this movie is all about Jon Voight, in particular, as Ed, gives the best performance here. And he remains one of the most talented actors in Hollywood history, from Midnight Cowboy in his very discontent performance as Franklin D. Roosevelt at Pearl Harbor, acting lifts the movie to another level. Climbing the rocks at dusk, frightening and determined to make it right It needs to be seen to be believed. I guarantee your battery rate will be raised to a new level. <br /> <br /> Briskly rhythm, tension, stiffness and tightly drawn as a banjo banjo, this is a morality game that asks the remaining questions today. Times have changes, but our choices as human beings do not have. <br /> Ten out of ten stars.
