I've only seen this movie once before, about ten years ago. I bought the DVD two days ago and after watching it I think it is even better than I remember it to be. Paperhouse is more than just a horror. It has such an amazing level of emotion and great characterization running across it. I especially thought Charlotte Burke was really excellent here. She is such a pity that she has not done anything else as she was an excellent actress altogether. His painting of emotions throughout the film was perfect and just the right amount of intricacies to get the message across, especially to the end when he realized that although Marc was dead, he knew he was going to be okay. <br /> / Several scenes made me jump (which is a rarity for me in modern horror films), most notably the scene in the basin, scene where Anna's father chased her with the strange radio at The background and bit of the legs break apart and move in the dust. <br /> All in all, an excellent movie with many moves.
