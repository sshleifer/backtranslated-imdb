I rent this movie out of blockbuster on a whim .. I love rowing arkin and the cover was taken ... i read back and knew right away it was going to either better or the worst movie I've ever seen. .. I guess I got lucky .. I laughed from beginning to end .. Alan Arkin brings a great character to this movie. I've since bought a copy of used rentals for my own collection and watch it ever .. I've recommeded this movie to the people and they all enjoyed it as much as I did ... I saw complaints menu and DVD functions .. but it does not take away the movie .. the disk author has been blockbuster exculsivley which is why they did not allow you to skip past the forecasts .. aside from you should not be left The functions of DVD discourage you from watching the movie excellent.
