The Running Man is one of those films that if surwatched, would become boring and even depressing. My advice is to look it maybe once or twice a year and a couple of peers and a few drinks. In today's climate of television broadcasting media and the capitalist fashion of society it really works as a social social revisionist, post-1980s-boom. Forget that though! There are other brilliant and best reasons to watch this movie. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />! it's Killian on a main highlight camera). The design of the stalkers is native to Americans, with the mirror characterization seen in the TV Gladiators' porn, and the WWE too. Buddha-see the end of grisly will fry any viewer of the core (like a foot note, why his death stands out as particularly disturbing at what officially an optimistic shareholder and a bitter sense of humor?) <br /> Jesse Venturer and Sven Ole Thorssen are great as muscle backs (and Arnies buds in real life), and it even got Mick Fleetwood in it too! What more can you ask for? <br /> I highly recommend the Run Man if you are looking for a great piece of fun action, with a gloss finish and some great characters. Just do not expect an education from it (at least on the surface value). Kind, I do not like it actually. You will be too unless you are a thesp. 7/10
