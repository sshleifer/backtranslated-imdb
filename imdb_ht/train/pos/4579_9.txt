I think that this movie was reasonably good. It's something weird that now the Olsen twins are 13 and have boyfriends and all. I enjoyed them very much when they were small children at Full House. Anyway, the casting was good and the movie was a bit funny. I kind of mix up between everywhere they change and their names. It's just the kind of an older version of it takes.
