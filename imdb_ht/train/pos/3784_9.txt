One of the most underrated movies I've seen in a long time, Bill & Ted's Travel Bogus is the second hilarious adventure of Bill S. Preston Esq. and Ted Theodore Logan, aka Wyld Stallyns. There are two ways to look at this movie: First, you see dumb dialogue, far from scheme, youthful ideas. OR. You see glossy downplayed idiots who again find themselves in a too big situation for the brains. Send a Bruce Willis or Arnold Schwarzeneggar to this draw and he becomes a big blockbuster movie. Bill and Ted go to the story with the same level of sincerity, it's only Bill and Ted. This is a tough fence balancing, but when you watch the movie not like a vicious comedy throwaway, but as an adventure featuring two guys who have no business being in an adventure, it gets more.
