The Journey of Hope (1990) is about a lot of many nomadic and poor Turks to do so that they could live the good life in Switzerland. These people are so desperate to live as the Westerners that they will give up their lives and lives in an attempt to reach the promised land. So many of them are swindled by crooks who make their living by paying big fees for those who are desperate in a non-existent situation. A brave cold family, the treacherous hill series and predatory criminals only discovered that there's not always a shining light at the end of the tunnel. This problem exists in the world wide, not just in America. Some people tend to forget that. A heart breaker in a movie that will let you ask why in the end. <br /> <br /> Very recommended.
