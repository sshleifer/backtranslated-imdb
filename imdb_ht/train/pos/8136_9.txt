This movie is a great mocumentary. It follows the rap group, NWH, made up of cold, tasty ice and tone def in the unique paths of big cricket rap, letting and back to high. Through problems with women, egos, cops and white, this group gets to the top of the gangster rap world, as this movie goes to the top of mokumentaries. I know my favorite mocumentary allbodies This is Spinal Tap, for very good reasons, however I think if in the right attitude, this film is simply better. The streets are never finished, even for someone not in the rapper culture. <br /> I'm a white guy, with no interest in music rap, culture or anything else associated with it, however I love this movie. Rusty Cundeif, who wrote the scenario, sings and starred in it showed great potential and it's a shame that I have not seen him since scared of a Black Nut. However, I've seen him one more time than you have, and that's what I recommend scary to a black hat for you to laugh quickly. <br /> <br /> Remember, "Do not shoot you see the white! .... in the eyes? Do not shoot you to see the white ones." <br /> <br /> Movie and enjoy the movie.
