When I found this movie in my local videostore I hope it must be another American American vampire films in the same vein of the "Lost Boys" (1987) .I Surprise "To Die" is a movie really good. It's a little bit reputable at times, but still there are enough stylish set-pieces and surprises to satisfy vampire enthusiasts.This is a perfect mix of romance and horror and it's surprisingly gory at times.If they are recommended.
