FATTY DRIVE BUS is simply the girlfriend, the most original and fun at work I've ever had to enjoy. <br /> <br /> This movie is by no means up to Hollywood standard, or even that of a comic-comedy funny comedy drug comedy starring "hulk" hogan, in terms of camera work, editing, act, budget, or anything else. <br /> <br /> This movie does, though, is a very original and enjoyable story, and it is obviously made by people who like to do it, and enthusiasm throughout the cast and really crushed crew in all of its budget and acting decomposition. <br /> <br /> This movie proves that you do not need a great budget or decent actors to make a great movie, all you need are some original ideas and passion for what you do. <br /> <br /> simply the best movie ever. I do not care as you find it, rent it, order it, steal it, download it, just see this movie. <br /> Now I just hope to make a DVD version.
