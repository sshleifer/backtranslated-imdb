There are too many new styles in the sitcom, but one of the best works is old fashioned with a hearing and placing indoors. Show 70 is a great example. When the show came on the air, nobody was really heard of Kurtwood Smith and Debra Jo Rupp so much less teenagers played by Topher Grace and Ashton Kushton (both of them are leaving the show this year to pursue other interests) I wish Topher would stay around because the show began on his character Eric, with his close circle of friends. Ashton is already John Travolta in our time. Remember when John loved Diana Hyland from eight, thinking of Ashton and Demi Moore. Throwing off the actors never knew we were good because a celebrity cast member could spoil it. I miss Mo Gaffney playing Joanne Don's girlfriend. I miss Lisa Robin Kelly as Laurie's original, the replacement could not match her and I'm sorry. I liked the casting of Tommy Chong as the wasted face, but dear Steven Hyde. I liked watching Tanya Roberts besides Charlie's Angels. I liked Brooke Shields play Jackie's mother. He really showed his talent to act before Broadway titles. This show was a pleasure with many surprises. I hope this show will last longer though 2 of the cast members will leave but I hope they do not stay too far too long. I wish the show creators, Bonnie and Terry Turner, also created my other favorite show, Third Rock from the Sun, are more successful on Fox than they were on NBC's show sabotage. Turners are not dummy and I hope to create more shows like this in the future.
