A very unique sci-fi animated film, and honestly I love uniqueness no matter which way it tends to be, better or worse. This French movie is very interesting to watch, the technical part is innovation, such as "Waking Life" I recently watched. <br /> It took me quite a long time to get used to the Black-White style, but eventually I love it, the sketchlike images are really fancy! The future contracted world is a final symbol of the human race in which I worship it very much. The whole plot is fine for a sci-fi, not so intriguing but it's OK, like some Hollywood's products, a giant plot on human eternity, a little glimmering with the tight finish is not so compelling, some developments are just too naughty and insipid, and the whole movie is too long .. so I think I'm just in love with this movie show style, others are not so good. <br /> On the eternity of life, I think most people have come to an unanimousness that we do not want eternity because it demolishes the meaning of life, our treasure our lives because they are limited and meaningful, if everyone can live for all time, so the world will become a disaster and chaos. Leaving a loved one is hard and heartbreaking, but this is also a way to show our lives genuine and all the emotions meet one's life and make the world colorful and lively.
