I came home late one night and turned to the TV, seeing Siskel and Ebert summarizing the peaks of the week. I did not hear anything about "Red Rock West", except two thumbs up and saw it before it went. He would not stay in the theater very long because of the money distributor's issues and the lack of promotions, but said he deserved better. <br /> <br /> The next afternoon I followed the tips. They were good, it was some of the most fun I've ever been in the movies. As some readers point out, there is a draw hole and the past 10 minutes never seem to end. But it's well worth it, for the fine work that went into the first hour. It's the best role that I've ever seen for Nicholas Cage, but almost everyone looks perfectly cast. Dennis Hopper goes almost over the head, which gets comical but strengthens how well everything else works. The compositions and music contributed a great deal of almost every scene. <br /> When I rent it later for my family, it did not work as well. The long scenes that built the tension of the theater were difficult to appreciate, and the distractions of the house. It deserves all your attention; Turn off the phone, make sure you will not distract, watch and listen to each scene, especially at the beginning.
