The first things first! This is not a movie action although there is a lot of action in it! I think you can compare it to American sports cinema! Where a team of very bad players succeeds in misfortune, there is a game or competition beyond wait! In that case it's not about football or baseball, but Taekwondo! At the beginning these street thugs seem good for anything! But soon we will find that they do not want to be sick and actually achieve something in life! It is nice to see them struggling with training! I was surprised how funny this movie was! From start to finish you will laugh your pants on! Young Korean actors are very compelling! Go see this charming good movie!
