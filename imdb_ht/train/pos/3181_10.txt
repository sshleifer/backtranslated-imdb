I had the opportunity to see this first movie at the Appalachian Film Festival, in which he won a prize for best photos. This brilliant film is made, with an excellent cast that works well as an ensemble. My favorite performances were from Youssef Kerkour, Justin Lane, and Adam Jones. Also, there are some great effects with dragonflies and cockroaches, which I was surprised to find that this film was made on a small budget. Writer director Adam Jones, whom I believe also won awards for writing it, doing an excellent job and direction. The audience liked this movie. Cross Eyed will keep you laughing at the movie. Definitely a must see.
