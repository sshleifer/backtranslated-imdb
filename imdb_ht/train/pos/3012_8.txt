This is one of the movies that you want you had never seen before - so you could see it again "for the first time". Van Wind Books always bring pleasure - but they are called too many flowers. This film is far away from the best film adaptation of its work. William Powell is William Powell - says no more. The plot is complicated. The story moves all too fast, because you want it to be the last. Enjoy.
