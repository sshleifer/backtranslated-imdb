The MATADOR is striking-human movie lite .... if you can say that on a hit-movie movie. Violence never really shows but often presents. At first I was scared I was in for another rtread in mid-90s gangster-striking-man-hipster-black comedy but was happily surprised when I realized this is just a sweet and funny story about friendship. There is nothing terribly interesting to happen in this film, but every bit of it keeps me grinpanted. The three drives have the best chemistry to have the big screen in recent years and it seems that they have had a great time making this movie together. Writing this sharp at times it felt as though the script had been adapted from a stage step because of the one dialogue scene. This is a good movie that I probably will not remember for too long, but at the moment it was a complete joy. Good movie.
