I knew about this as a similar program as Jackass, and I saw one or two episodes on Freeview, and it is the same, only more extreme. Basically, three Welsh guys, with one British bridal bride being brought together by the love of skateboarding, and a complete hobby / masochistic fun of themselves and their health and safety. They had puking, pizza foods, puppies jumping, nude paintball dumplings, jokes on the guy as little as heavy sleep / snoring, cascading at a workplace, e.g. army, cowboys, and many more crazy demonstrations that cause bruises, bumps, blood and vomiting, perhaps not only for themselves. Starting Matthew Pritchard is doing nothing at all, Lee Dainton also goes up to just about anything, Dan Joyce (one British) who hardly does lots of physical and has an OTT laugh, with Pancho (Mike Locke) doing so much It is famous for being short, fat and lazy. She has something about the 100 Best Funny Moments. Really good!
