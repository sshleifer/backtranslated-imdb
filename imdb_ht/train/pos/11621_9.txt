I was bored a night and red eyes were over and thought why not. <br /> <br /> Red Eye is one of the best movies in a long time. <br /> I mean I just got into the movie causing it was just brighter <br /> <br /> The story is new and different. The film also has two big drives in the movie with Rachel Mcadams as Lisa Reisert and Cillian Murphy as Jackson Rippner <br /> <br /> The act is just brilliant and you get the feel for those in the movie. <br /> <br /> The music is just excellent, it gives you thrill and can also make you feel relaxed. <br /> I just love how the movie was just so well done and never become boring. <br /> <br /> Red eyes are just phenomena. There is nothing more and nothing less. <br /> <br /> Overall, I love so many red eyes that I can watch it over and over again. <br /> <If you like Red Eye, then I recommend Elektra and Cry Wolf. <br /> I give Red Eye 9 from 10. <br /> Great movie
