This movie might have a junkie doubt as it made for TV, but it is one of the best movies I've seen. The film and its actors won several awards. It is inviting, fascinating, and it will absorb you completely. The story of a chase for a killer of Russian cideria by those who want their career risk to try to survive the lives of victims in the future would be a compelling story if it was fiction - but it's officially a true story. I highly recommend it.
