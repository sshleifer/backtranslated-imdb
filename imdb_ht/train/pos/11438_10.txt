Ralph and Mumford, misfits in their own country, find the scam of being involved in the Synanomess Botch. Twice over time is the story of them, the characters are met, and struggles to put things right. With a surprisingly impressive and beautiful voice soundtrack acting by some of the best in the business, this film offbeat hits the mark. <br /> <br /> The animation process, while just like that of the cut out "South Park" style, is smoother and far more three-dimensional. If I did not know that the animation was this style, I would swear that was traditional pen and ink. If you can watch this movie in Dolby Surround or THX, TANPARE do! You will not really miss anything if you do not, but if you do, you will get more out of the experience!
