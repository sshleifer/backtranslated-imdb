This movie is a riot. I can not remember last time I had such a great time in the movies. I've seen a few good comedies in my time and are usually very funny. But this one is the wall wall large lines. I think the best show is the last movie that I laughed so hard and so in. The movie was not suspended until the end when they made the 5 minutes of sentimental trace cleaning. Other than it's a constant bunch of one covered material and jumping situation. I would like to see it again before leaving the theater because this is like the Zucker films where you do not get all the jokes first time around. You will see it two or three times to find it all in. <br /> As far as the current movie goes, it could use a better edit, it's cage at times but we must forgive it . All the characters are great. It's not like a Adam Sandler movie where he tried to be funny and everyone else suffers around him, and is the butt of the joke. I think I'll remember all the main characters for years to come because they are all so likable. No victims in this movie. Also, thanks to being a 45 year old actress to play her girlfriend. Catherine Keener plays it and is a romantic in this movie. You just want women like it really exists. It is not a "10" as some of the leading women but somehow smile it is warmer than Julia Roberts overdone overbite. <br /> <br /> If you see the trailer for this movie you can not think too much of it. I assure you, the trailer does not do justice. They do not give away all the jokes good. Just some of them even. <br /> Oh and one more thing. I hope critics put this on the top ten listings. Many complain that comedies do not get the recognition they deserve and then by the end of the year they do not put it on their list. That means you're Ebert !!!
