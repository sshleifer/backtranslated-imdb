This movie is a fun movie, fun and quality. The movie very cleverly follows the guidelines if the book, and try to stick to the exact lines. The actors are all appropriate, and you would expect them to be the party. They use some popular actors who have a great effect on the movie. The graphics are a bit dodgy in some parts, and there are quite a few errors throughout the movie. There is no such thing as a yellow charging next to, for example. The camp is not as generous as explained in the book, and does not tend to show off to the camp as much as the book. All of its groups mention a lot of the book, but they are not in the movie. In general, a big movie for a rainy afternoon
