This is a wonderful movie with a fun, intelligent and dynamic story of culture difference and theme of running into what is important to life to do this a highly appreciated movie. Do not let the cynics of the world discourage you from seeing this. Keaton has wonderful moments and I ask in the fact that comedians never appreciate, because actors like Keaton do go to humor bits seriously look very easy. Great movie all around!
