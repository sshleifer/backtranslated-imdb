Sisters of law will be released teatrically on March 24th in Sweden. A good occasion for our Nordic friends to discover this original and thoughtful documentary. He was shown in GÃ¶teborg along with a retrospective dedicated to Kim Longinotto, "director of focus" at the festival. He gave a master class, much to appreciate, saying about his method as documentary cinema and told the audience about special circumstances that led him to shoot Sisters in law twice: the first version was lost for good, so a second shot organized and the movie turned out to be different to the end. A very terrible problem happened, in this case, created the possibility of a very strong movie.
