I just do not understand why this movie is getting bat-up in here. Jeez. It is stupid, it's not polished and it's (as I am) wasted on some. Throw in this movie to play the characters in the 'T' (If you look Permanently Midnight and became a fan of Ben Stiller then you'll be disappointed). Such a misunderstanding, intentional misfits trying to save the city / world with anything but gravel and resilience. The problem is not to achieve the boundaries until the great confrontation and that is the point! This is 3 times the movie that the Shagged Spy has always been hanged by the same demographic group, likely the same ones who feel the first movie movie movie in comparison to the end. I just do not get it. The jokes are working on more then a level; if you did not find it I know what level you are in.
