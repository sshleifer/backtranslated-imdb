I did not laugh this hard for a movie in a really long time. The garbage that Hollywood has set up recently drives me up a wall! This one was definitely cool and witty. If you look at the demographic figures for their evaluation, only a few women have been voting! I do not want to ruin the film for you, but I'm sure every guy who has seen this ran to the computer to read it and gave it a poor score, why? Because the film puts people in place, that's why. If more women vote for this movie because of its current humor value and not because it is harm to people ... it could easily be a rated movie "7"!
