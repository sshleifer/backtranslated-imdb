This story is very well-known. She is both sad and heartwarming about the girl's trip to discover where she came from and where she will be. Stephanie was adopted by her mother's best friend after her mother and father were killed in a car crash, and since she had labeled 'baby's miracle', she is dyslexic and she's getting a bit tough. Finding it on the road affects those closest to her side. His relationship with his guardian and his senior guardian boyfriend are handled very delicate and sensitive, and all the support cast is genuine, 3-dimensional and credible. Wearing around a fishing canning factory in the small town of Australia, this is a warm gentle, erotic film, and leaf with a nice feeling when the credit is closed. After reading some of the other rather funded comments about Hugo Weaving, I would like to add that I think he was brilliantly cast, and he was very sexy. No, it's not Brad Pitt, but that does not mean it's not attractive.
