Man oh people ... I was deported very simply (not the right term, there is a long list!) They watched this movie and finally got lucky to do that. And "news" are: Wonderful maze spectacle! <br /> For any "Follower" in the Trier: both Rigets, Element of Crimes, Dogville, Dancer in the Dark, Five Obstacles, etc. ... Probably the difference for its magnitude in visual terms. Everything is very bright and claustrophobic! You really get the feeling of being inside this "imaginative" nightmare when nightmare. Taken from the masters of cinema movies like Bunuel, Bergman, until the Noir movie in the 40's and the acidic drop in avant-garde Von Trier leads the art-film scene as the "well-intentioned" film maker of nowadays. His authoritarian way of dealing with very complicated, irrational problems, hit the viewer's nerve and the intent to heal some of the deepest injuries we eat in our hypocritical world. As Utopian as it seems, I believe people like Trier could help society in many ways in a broader aspect. The day films and filmmakers who carry this sort of power are no longer needed, as a tool for reflection, perhaps it might begin in a new era: "The Age of Emotional Control of Our Fears". This is what he offers us constantly in his work over and over. <br /> <br /> Bravo!
