I saw this film last night after age and age waiting for it to be released here in Canada (always only in limited release). It was worth the wait and then some. I'm a very hungry reader of Margaret Laurence and was excited to see that this novel was being turned into a movie. I actually ended up filming the movie better than the novel. I liked that the character of Bram Shipley was a bit less harsh, and that there seemed to be more of a love story between Agar and Bram, which made the scenes at the end of Bram's life more moving. The loss seemed stronger. Hagar was no more likable about film than in the book, but Ellen Burstyn was a genius in this role. It was Hagar and the. Christine Horne was brilliant and she has many bigger things in front of me sure. His scene with Cole Hauser was electrified. I could go over and over, in general a 9 * out of 10. Fantastic and can not wait to read out on DVD, a must own for my collection!
