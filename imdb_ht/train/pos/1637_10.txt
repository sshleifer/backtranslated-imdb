I love this movie and saw it quite a few times over the years. It gets better with every look. I agree with all the positive reviews here. Yes, it's frightening and brutal realism as life on the prairie was in those days. I found myself commenting as I watched it. Someone here was told Rip Torn was wrong. I could not agree more. It's brilliant as the hardy, miserly Clyde Stewart says little and works like a slave / workhorse. Conchatta Farrell is fantastic as the widow Elinor, whom Clyde hired as a housekeeper / cook (along with her 7 old daughter). Lilia Skala is excellent as far away from neighbors called Granny. Also a star is Montana's beautiful prairie. It is both beautiful and brutal in which to settle. Some scenes are both repulsive and unnecessary. No special effects here, what you see is real! It even has a terrific perfect score with a great script. Once you see Heartland, you will never forget it. She deserves all 10s she gets here.
