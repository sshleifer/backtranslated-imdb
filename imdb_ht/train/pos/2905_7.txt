This is a very funny movie, easy to watch, which amuses you almost all the time. Director's work is recognized and humorous style is her trademark. The film is a typical police history story such as lethal weapons, but the jokes and comedy are in Argentinean style. The twist is that one of them is a psychologist playing by Peretti and he goes with Diaz detective (played by Luque) on his homework while also helping him (Diaz is troubled because his wife cheated on him). Some of the dialogues are hilarious around the world: understand and ridiculously anywhere. It's pretty good overall, it would be worth a 8, but I rated 7 because it gets a little down to the end. On a personal note I must add that a "crap" to Adjuster Filmist, considering the good little coming soon.
