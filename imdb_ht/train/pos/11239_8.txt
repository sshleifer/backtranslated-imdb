Hidden Frontier is remarkable for being longer-run web-based Star Trek fan's fan. While the quality of production is not on a par with the production of fans like Stars Exeter, or New Voyages, Hide Frontier focuses largely on history, and in that regard it is very good indeed. <br /> <br /> Hidden Frontier has no physical lying; Instead the actors filmed against a greenscreen, and the numbers are digitally digitized. One of the biggest Frontier hidden achievements is the absolute volume of work being produced. One of the ways in this is to achieve is not to put the virtual devices at a time of filming, instead of post-production. While this saves a great deal of time, it's also worth noting that the quality of the resulting footage is not as high as it has produced post-production, though it still serves its purpose. <br /> While it's not everyone's cupboard, Hidden Frontier is well worth a shot, though you might be better off to start watching the third season, since this is where producers really start to hit they stride.
