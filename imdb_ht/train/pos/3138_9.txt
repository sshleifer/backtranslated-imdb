Yes, I did, as I sat here red-faced, remember he felt almost guilty as I watched her a couple of weeks back while my wife chose to look something as inconvenient (in comparison) as "Mommie Dezi". <br /> How does one explain the appeal of "Batman and Robin" - I mean the only ones that ever count, Adam West and Burt Ward. It was a terrible show, with terrible and terrible plots - and, yes, it was terribly funny! And the same applies to this "reunion" and "flashback" movie. Adam and Burt are invited to an auction where the old Batmobile will be sold there for charity. But it gets stolen, and our palate (like the heads) jumps into those old characters' (if not the costumes) and top off to find out what happened. Along the way they are reminiscent of the series, and we see how it all came together in flatbacks, and Jack Brewer and Jason Marsden play Adam's and Burt in the TV series. It really was quite interesting to get some behind the scenes gathered in the old series, and Adam and Burt just stepped back perfectly into characters (though they were not really of character - well, you would have to look at it to see what which I mean.) It was also great to see Julie Newmar and Frank Gorshin. <br /> If you're not a fan of the old series, you'll hate this. If - the sky forbid - you actually thought Michael Keaton and George Clooney made acceptable "Batmans" then you will hate this even more. And if you grew up with Adam and Burt and still want to admit that you never miss an episode - well, this one for you. <br /> Yes, it's true - 9/10
