This was one of the wonderful rare moments of T.V. that I wanted to capture forever on VHS. Is not it all the time? <br /> It was so creative and I remember it was revealed once a week and the wait for the next episode was excruciating. I want to see it all again. I want to buy it. I want what I can not. Not even about EBAY. <br /> So it was enough luxurious it was, by far, one of the best series in the 80 put out. It should be considered a classic but lost in space. At least this website and Wikipedia mentioned it. Sob. <br /> It was utterly appealing, funny, flirtatious, and original. Perhaps not like Sherlock Holmes original, I actually think Quintin is far more attractive and has a better chance with her leading lady than the Holmes stiff and chalky ever can be.
