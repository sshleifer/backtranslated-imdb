A film by Frank Capra in movie life. <br /> Keeping the blood pumping in our veins is the responsibility of HEMO Magnificent's hard work. In the mid-1950s, AT & T and Bell Science have partnered with Hollywood's renowned director Frank Capra to produce a series of CBS film films to educate the public about the universe around them. A far cry from the dark and white black so often foisted on young scholars, the Capra films would both instruct and entertain with the lively and eye-catching visual scripts shown in Technicolor. These four films - our MR. SUN (1956), THE CASE OF THE REASONIZED KOSMIK (1957), HEMO MAGNIFICATION (1957), GODDESS UNCHAINED (1958) - quickly became the school favorites, where they were shown to show in 16mm format. The star of the series is Dr. Frank C. Baxter (1896-1982), a profitable English professor at the University of Southern California. This pedagogical avenue proved to be the perfect film instructor, usually separated from his audience sometimes sometimes complex in a way that never made them look like dull or boring. Dr. Baxter, who won a premium Peabody for his achievement, continued to make high quality instructional films after Quart's Quartette. <br /> <br /> The HEMO Magnificent, produced, written & led by Capra, contains stories in the human heart and blood circulation system, using animated and humorous humor. Star Film Richard Carlson emerged as the Fiction Writer, Energy Assistant Dr. Baxter tells Hemo's story. The movie Maver will recognize Sterling Holloway as part of the TV production crew, with the voices of Marvin Miller, Mel Blanc, June Foray & Pinto Colvig as various cartoon characters, all uncredited. The devotional script that starts the movie is completely in tune with the tenor & tone of the output.
