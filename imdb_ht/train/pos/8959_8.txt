Although I agree that it's a good movie but not great, so many of the reasons have been posted to others, I still enjoy it. One reason is the music: I would call attention to the very cool appearance by the Candoli brothers - Conte and Pete - in a well-performing stage in the nightclub. These guys were two of the best jazz trumpeters in the days and they managed to conveyly launch the idea of ​​Jimmy Stewart by playing a bug bomber Duomo, one trumpet in each of Stewart's ears. The Candolis really played that well, too, though I suspected was the real music for what scene was armed later in the two of them. I do not know much about George Duning, who gets the credit for the music (other than it seems to have worked with the Three Stooges in more than one occasion), but the casting of the Candoli brothers as jazz-played warlocks was a real nice touch.
