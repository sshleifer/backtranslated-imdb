What I enjoyed most of this film is that like the movies of Hitchcock, it's a thriller that does not take it too seriously. Hitchcock understands that people go to the movies for a good time. Something that Hollywood seems to have forgotten in recent years. This is a thriller, but it has a lot of laughter and always has one eye winking in the camera. Rachel McAdams is wonderful as always. Cillian Murphy is creepier than he was in Batman starting. In ancient times, there were guys who always played the bad guy. We do not see much of that day because I suspect the Hollywood agents consider it a bad career move, but Cillian Murphy is really good at being bad. <br /> <br /> The direction R is surprisingly stylish. The story is good but the dialogue could use some sprucing up. <br /> "Red Eye" is a really fun movie with those who applaud when the credit ends have started rolling. If you are in the mood for an enjoyable escapist thriller, "red eye" might be your ticket.
