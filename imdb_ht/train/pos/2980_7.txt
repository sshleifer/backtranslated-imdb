This movie is just funny. ideas, but funny. To enjoy this movie completely you can not have a perception of how a movie like this goes and just enjoy all the side jokes and puns that are involved with the movie. I always find the bit at the comic start when he says "want a beer ........ cock". funny thing. but what makes the movie is the fact that it does not try hard to create a serious turn on the movie, many comedies try to have serious aspects that you just do not believe. But this is different and just focus on being funny. I must say though, Yasmin bleeth is terrible in the movie and adds nothing but the 3 main guys, coopers, remer and crack are very funny to watch and make the big movie to watch
