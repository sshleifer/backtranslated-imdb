Japan is in serious trouble. The demons have been infected by Edo, taking possession of the shape of the earth and bending them into the sick. On top of that, the rebirth of Ashura, Queen of the Devils, is near. The only thing that stands against the threat of this tomb is the Demon Wardens, a group of mighty warriors, who might just be as bad as the demons themselves. <br /> <br /> Izumo is a retired Demon Warden, who five years ago, took theater instead of demon killed after accidentally killing an innocent child (In a fight in strange remembrance of the scene scene bar at sunset until Dawn). One night is not a chance to meet and meet a beautiful and mysterious woman called Tsubaki. The fortunes intertwine (literally) and tie in fate to be lovers and enemies. <br /> <br /> If you think this sound like typical Japanese Fantasy / Swordplay season, you should be wrong. In fact, there is nothing typical about Ashura. It's a podge hodge of many different genres of films. Those just mentioned, as well as a comedy, drama, and romance. Director Yojiro Takita (Onmyoji) juggles the genre genre of the genre (although, the comedy seems to be forced into some scenes) and the end result is a ridiculous movie, but really popcorn fun. <br /> <br /> For sure, there are flaws in the movie. Some of the humor seems compelling, and out of place. And the act is not the greatest. But seriously, you watch Fantasy / Swordplay / Comedy movie for the great performances ?? No, we look at them for the action and their visual CG crazy, all of which Ashura has at peak. Do not be lying, the movie is not all action, but it is spaced out generously enough with lots of swordplay and the green blood buckle holds the average cheerful viewer. <br /> <br /> Bottom line; These films have its flaws and are not a martial arts season, but it does not try to be with it featuring interesting visuals and good swordplay action. The purpose of the film worked for me is that he never takes himself too seriously and if the viewer does the same, be sure to be happy by this fun and funny swordplay fantasy action flick. in 10. Fun movie popcorn.
