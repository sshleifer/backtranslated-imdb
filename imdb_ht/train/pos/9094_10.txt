I saw this movie independent when it was in Philadelphia and it was a nice surprise. I left the theater with a smile on my face. One of the things that made it so funny was that it was based on a true story -hilaryu! He has some great actors in it too. Mindy Sterling is in it and is very good. I loved it in Austin Powers. Howard Hesseman is also terrific. I remember her from the top of the class. I'm tired of all the movie edgy movies that keep doing. This is fun with light, and I can watch it with my family and not be embarrassed. I keep checking to see when it's going out on DVD. I will definitely buy it.
