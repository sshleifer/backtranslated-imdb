I saw this first movie about 4 years ago and I expected something funny, just like CB4. I was blown away. I was on the floor my butt floor in this movie is so great. Way better than CB4, characters, songs, draws, everything. The top movie film film "Two UP UPs" by Siskel and Egbert (and if two old white guys can understand the humor in this movie, you know it's good).
