If you're amused by a straight-faced logic in a logical situation, you'll enjoy this 8-minute Spanish movie fantasy. <br /> A woman gets into a small bar. The scene looks ordinary, but the subscribers, customers, and two musicians seem somehow unusual to submit. <br /> <br /> Suddenly, the singers play with one person starting to sing the title song, dance through head and music-comedy gestures. Customers, at first immovable, at the sunscreen (seriously, but gamely) and phrases from the song, it comes out of the slip paper slip. About and jump up and dance (clumsy but seriously) to corruption motions, such as backup musicians. <br /> But why ??? woman's wonders. The answer reveals as the open jacket opens and sees what is attached through his chest - just before the biggest explosive ... <br /> Even if you do not catch the song (probably ironic) lyrics, the performance-perfect performance would must give you a grin and a chuckle ... I'd love to see it again!
