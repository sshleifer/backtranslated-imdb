"Are we dancing?", A light-hearted cops from Japan, say in a worker accountant and family members who are attracted to a dance studio by a beautiful woman she sees on the train during her daily transports. What he found in the studio is the dance lesson and, most of all, himself. Funny, intense, and absolutely good, "SWD" is an award winning movie well worth a look by more mature viewers. (B)
