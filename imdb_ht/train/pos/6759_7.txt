WHERE SIDEWALK ENDS to be a well-known film Otto Preminger, the man who gave the LAURA world. And that time, he had the same co-stars: DANA ANDREWS and GENE TIERNEY. It must be said that Tierney here is under-utilized in that amount of more of a supported role while the spotlight goes to Andrews. <br /> She plays a tough cop, hardened to deal with a bunch of thugs in too vigorous manner until one night she accidentally kills a man in the process of arresting her. When Suspect falls on a taxi driver (TOM TULLY), she goes along with the investigation into the murder, but begins to feel guilty because she's in love with Cabbie's daughter (GENE TIERNEY). Tierney, by the way, looks a little too elegant for the girl she plays here and does not seem to fit into the squalid background elements of the story. <br /> <br /> The story takes a gloomy turn as the investigation goes deeper and has discovered that the murdered man had a silver plaque in his service as a hero war. In the end, he gets into a moral story and Andrews develops awareness of his crime. <br /> It is fascinating as film noir and performance from a strong cast to support. A good entry into the field of noir, forcefully directed by Preminger and nicely played by Andrews and Tierney, despite the bit miscasting of his character.
