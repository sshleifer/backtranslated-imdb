There are those who sneak <br /> <br /> "Mom Hollow" is probably the weakest film that Paul Verhoeven, director of great movies like "Total Recall", "Trumpet Container" and "Robocop" has ever been. <br /> <br /> That's probably not her fault. For some reason, Verhoeven was stuck with a complete script, and he did better in it. <br /> <br /> The first part of this movie is rather good, with many cynical jokes, great special effects and even Skunk Anansie on the soundtrack. Unfortunately, the movie fell flat in the second part, was it degenerate into a standard slasher movie or maybe a very bad "foreign" script. The last is especially ridiculous <SPOILER>, as Kevin Bacon holds back to life after a number of incidents that should (in the sense of the logic of the word) killed him. </ SPOILER>. And the whole thing is quite, indeed: the subject of becoming invisible is never fully investigated. <br /> But all in all, Verhoeven managed to stay well above this average and this movie. <br /> <br /> ** 1/2 from star ****
