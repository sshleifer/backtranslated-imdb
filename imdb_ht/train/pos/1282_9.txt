See this once couple on the Sundance Channel several years ago and got a nice Cinematic stuffed into the system. A semi-surreal is still tough to take on modern media culture (or lack of it), focusing on some seriously wrapped, beyond-Hollywood-Margins to stay. He had a fun performing early in Mak Ruffalo, with some memorable cinematographs of the DP that made Polish Movie Cinema. There was a humorous umompromising suicide with a weirdly original feel of it that definitely put it apart. This movie had classic cats written all over it, and I'm amazed it's not yet out on DVD. <br /> <br /> We hope that soon.
