I saw the movie holes and say that she has to be the best film all year long. He brings the child to everyone. I mean who would come up with the idea of ​​having boy troubles digging holes as punishment? Louis Sachar who is. Although the film was different from the book it was still very good. For example Caveman / Stanley was supposed to have one of the largest. Weight wise and wise wounds but ZigZag / Ricky was taller and Armpit / Theodore was bigger. Also X-Ray / Rex was supposed to be one of the youngest boys but did not. The only thing that I did not like about the movie was that the flashbacks were rather compelling and long. I'd rather see more of the present than past but that's just my opinion. I especially love the work of the boys though. Like Kalma / Alan played by Jake M.Smith was supposed to be a Moody and tough young. Jake M.Smith did just that and did a great job of doing it as he did almost all the actors in holes. So, I would say if you havent see holes again then you should definatly see it when it comes out again or you'll miss out on a whole lotta fun.
