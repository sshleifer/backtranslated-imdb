If you would like to see a movie of different kinds, if you feel the love of your heart, even if you miss the Lord, this movie makes you think. Although Georges is mentally handicapped, you can see the ultimate intelligence in the end, when love gives you direction by the brain. I'm not emotional, but this movie makes you feel the human. The movie is as good as Forrest Gump in my beliefs. Foreign movies are sometimes more interesting, but there are not enough advertisers to make them popular. "Rang-e Khoda" (The Color of God) by Majid Majidi is another example of these foreign movies, almost with similar taste.
