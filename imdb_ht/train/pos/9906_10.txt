Yes, the scheme is hardly conspicuous and very thin. Yes, the act varies between sadness. Yes, he did many times before. However what we are facing is a non-shy movie away from what they do and pretend to be nothing more than it is. There are some original death scenes and the tension increases throughout the movie. In addition you never more than a few minutes away from a gory kill. I urge everyone to watch this movie with an eye without prejudice and see it for what it put out to be; a scary, funny slasher flick and a second theme melody.
