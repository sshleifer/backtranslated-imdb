Sunday should not be Sunday without a movie action, and when you want intense combat, you go to Tom Berenger (platoon). Here she plays a sniper in the jungle going after rebel and drug chief. Life is a bitch, so it gets a kind of green office (Billy Zane) to help in the mission. The film is from Luis Luis, who stunk up Anaconda. It does not do better here, but Berenger makes the movie refreshing. <br /> <br /> Sure, it may be a little time - who wants to see a lot of walking in the jungle, but it's a good thing, tense action when the weather is right.
