My kids recently began to look at the showers in this show - both the early episodes on the N, and the people later on ABC Family - and they love it. (I did not know the same show lasted past the first or second quarter) I'm curious as to encourage all the changes - I saw them describe as "highly advertised," and again a half hour looking for online efforts It revealed nothing but endless comments on how these early episodes were so much better than the later episodes. (Personally, I do not see a lot of differences - the scripts and themes remain largely the same at all - but they lose some big people on the road) My daughter has put the DVDs on her wish list, so maybe The land of special features and Book will shed some light on all of this. I also wish they would make some humorous references to the changes - such as the "boys meeting worlds" where they dropped the little sister for an entire season or so, and when a different actor later showed up, she asked where it is known and says "upstairs", or when early set of geek "Minkus" shows up for graduation from high school, asked where it was and said "over there," the show Part of the classroom has never been shown by the camera, before saying "Hey, Mr. Turner, wait!" and running on the screen (Mr. Turner was another character left) Oh well - maybe there will be a true Hollywood story about this or something? I was just glad to see Aunt Hilda shows up for the final - he's still one of my favorites - it's too bad he could not have been a more reunion reunion cast. (Zelda candles just did not cut it for me)
