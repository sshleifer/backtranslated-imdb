Fawcett's Kudos take on the role that, at the time, was considered controversial. For my recall, rape was still a taboo subject in the 1980s, and women's rights and emotions were rarely so deeply examined during that time. Fawcett is simply a woman who follows, then leaned by actor James Russo. It is adequate as the obsessed psychopath, but at once a bit transparent. Diana Scarwid has a small role, such as Alfre Woodard as spouse of the house. Woodard worries about the legal consequences when Fawcett, the victim of rape, took revenge on the culprit. The scene where he launches a frying pan in hot oil in Russo is classic, and as the violent he deserves. He then keeps it in slavery, and the consequences must be faced. A very real story reflects the emotions and rage of victims of rape, violently, physically, and mentally. Very recommended. 8/10.
