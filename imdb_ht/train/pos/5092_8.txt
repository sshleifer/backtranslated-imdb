I thought King Solomon was beautiful to do. My only reserve was Alison Doody. His act was superb but his makeup and hair was not in the period, and always seemed to make him look out of place next to other actors. I thought Patrick Swayze was an excellent choice for Alan Quatermain. It was nice to see a seasoned, rugged actor looking into this role after sitting in movie after movie and beautiful haired, the skinned actors like Val Kilmer, Brad Pitt, etc. It was an excellent choice and I enjoyed every minute of this film . This version can not be compared with the 1950 version and Stewart Grainger. It was a big screen movie and was not made for TV movie. I thought both Quatermains were credible but the media should remain separate. I'm looking forward to seeing this once more, and I hope Patrick Swayze will again look at these kinds of roles.
