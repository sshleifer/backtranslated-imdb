A heat looking for a job is to make mistakes for a man hit in a small town of Wyoming, which leads to all kinds of hassle. Cage is perfectly thrown as the malheureu chmuck hopes to make a quick buck and get out of town, but find it can not escape the title city. Hopper does what he does best, playing a psychic known as "Lyle from Dallas," the real hit man. Walsh as a crochet sheriff and Boyle as a brunette female females come out fine. Script by John and Rick Dahl brothers have delicious twists and turns, and Jan's direction creates a terrific atmosphere "neo noir". Witty and entertaining, it sucks the viewer from the start and never lifts up.
