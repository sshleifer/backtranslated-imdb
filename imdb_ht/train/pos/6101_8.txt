So I do not ruin it for you, I will be very short. There are some great action and funny lines from the attractive cast. A young graduate from Harvard Med School (Brian White) finds he does not know as much as he thinks about people. She goes to a small hospital in Florida for her internship because a girlfriend (Mya) leaves her for a job as a TV producer. His Senior Resident (Wood Harris), helped the wonderful of his creative collaborators (Zoe Saldana) bring him speed. They help protect their careers and show the greatest potential from a compassionate doctor instead of a player who just wants to make money (as seems to be true for many of my pre-midsighted friends).
