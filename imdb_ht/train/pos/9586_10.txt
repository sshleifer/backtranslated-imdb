The movie really challenges your notion of identity and society we live in. It is well done and very powerful. People in the movie are honest and reveal the world that exists outside of the normative ideal. I believe it gives great insight into a sub-culture that shakes the very ideas that the viewer has in society. It is shocking at times and more powerful because of it. Some parts have been hard to look, as most facts are, but not about doing. Well it's the first time you watch it, but it gets even better in second or third time around; because you have the chance to wrap yourself in the many subjects to discuss and challenge.
