I see what I saw in Bette Davis's juvenile. It's splendid of all this almost-proud political actress who actually stars Warren Williams as the policy operation is still behind his retirement. Vivienne Osborne is brilliant as her ex, and I found myself rooting for her at all. The Williams character is not at all sympathetic, and it's not even a decent op. <br /> <br /> Guy Kibbee is one of the best of what he does. As a candidate cites from his sleep in a political convention and nominated to be governors in order to prevent a rival candidate from being nominated, so this whole mess made of international political wars at a party called "Progressive Party." If you are in a political mind, you'll probably see another party than the one with which your affiliate reflects in the fictional "Progressive Party" of Williams and Kibbee. I could draw parallel precise, but we're not here for that. This is a good movie for those of us who love these old comedies. If you've ever watched any of the old Wheeler & Woolsey titles (HALF SHOT AT SUNRISE, RAINMAKERS), you will find Frank McHugh, as Arm Williams, looking and behaving a lot like Bert Wheeler. He deceived me. <br /> Yes, both my wife and I recommend this one.
