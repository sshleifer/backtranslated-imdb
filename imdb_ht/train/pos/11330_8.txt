This is a beautiful story of mania guilty drive. <br /> <br /> Matiss, on a lonely night stroll in Riga (?) Passed by a woman on the wrong side of a bridge railing. It passes by without a word. Only splash in the water followed by a cry for help causing him to act. Then only too small and too late. <br /> <br /> The movie chronic her efforts to find out more about the woman. On a local troll troll, he found his pocketbook. It's more and more pieces of life together. She "looked" changes as her mania grows. He did the right things. In a nice dialogue dialogue with the "former boyfriend bastard" he forced Alexej to face up to the guilt that both felt. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Traces. Beautiful movie noir with a beautiful twist. A good Indie finish.
