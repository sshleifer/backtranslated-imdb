This film probably never made a blip on the radar screen, but it's quite quite a bit of quality. It is very lively, yet you think "Only a movie." Duvall and Lock show common people, and you would never even realize that they are now great actors actors. It seems that the jerk of this story is a little too old to be kicked out Eugene's girlfriend, but I guess it's possible. It seems easy that the kid would travel from Montana to Nevada alone, but I guess it's possible. You might think that family problems in this movie would never happen to your own family, but I guess it's possible. I remember Glenn Close saying something like "You think your job is the hardest part of your life, but not."
