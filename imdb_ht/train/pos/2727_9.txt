One of the best true-crime films ever made and very faithful to the Truman Capote book that invented the genre true true crime. Haunted Quincy Jones notes and tone notes acting by Scott Wilson and Robert Blake as Dick and Perry, the Assassins. Why Wilson did not go in to be a great star after this film is a mystery. <br /> <br /> The black and white cinematography and editing of this movie are top notches. The re-creation of murders is awesome and since leaving the real seizures seizures, even more scary than if the war was shown. The movie was filmed in the current Clutter House which was sold to another person after the murder. The film has a very feeling documentary - besides the scenes of the current House Clutter scene being filmed at the gas stations and the killer stores actually went on. Nancy Clutter's favorite love, babe, is even in the movie. Does Geer have a great turn as the prosecutor in the short trial scene that is not just filmed in the current courtroom, but has several of the real murder murder diaries that show themselves as the jury for the movie. <br /> <br /> This is a solid movie, awesome every time you see it.
