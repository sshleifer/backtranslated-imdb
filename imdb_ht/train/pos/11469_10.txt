Everyone knows about this event 'Zero Day'. What I think this movie did was that Elephant was not that they were telling us how these guys were. They showed their lives for about a year. Throughout the film we get to love them, they laugh with them even if we fully know what they are going to do. And this gives me the thrills. Cause I felt guilty to be brave by the comments, and I just thought Cal was a sweet guy. Even if I know what will happen to you? Even at the end of the movie when they were about to commit suicide and just decide if they did it on the count of 3 or 4 I thought this was funny, but still I was afraid to see themselves blowing. Of course I was. I loved them. They were cruel, perhaps, but I felt like they were really normal guy, that they did not really realize it. But I knew they were. <br /> <br /> This, IMO, the main force of this movie. It makes us realize that our friends, family, or anyone can plan something crazy, and that we will not even notice it. This movie, as good as it was, made me feel bad. And that's why I can not go to sleep right now. There's always that feeling of this little in my stomach. Butterfly.
