This is my second time for a perfect spy. I watched it 2 or 3 years ago and loved it. I love it still. It's natural that it is compared to the great Beeb's Big Leaf's series, Tinker Tailor spy warrior. Tinker Tailor focuses on spying "games" to play; Perfect spy gives us the other axis - what kind of person a spy is. There are a number of themes that share movies, along with others in the genre. Ambiguity - moral, sexual, interpersonal - that creates a multidimensional space in real vs. fo, indoors vs outdoors, love vs responsibilities. In a way, these characters are sly when treated most dogs by their loved ones and respect - "slingshot" in its various nuances. The theme of dad and dad is also important. One of the most intriguing characters in a perfect spy is Rick, the main Magnus character maybe replacing dad. Throughout the story she betrayed and betrayed. A rogue that always manages to climb back to the ladder when it has been reversed, who seems to be impervious to what others think of him, asks Magnus every time they meet, "Do you like old man's?" And never, "Do you love me?" Maybe it says this elsewhere, but A perfect spyware is a love story. <br /> <br /> Another term is that of malware. The nature of the business is to turn others - turn them against governments, against their friends and associates, turning them against the values ​​and beliefs. In each of Le Carre's movies I saw the spy from the cold, Looking Glass War, Tinker Tailor spyware, smiley's, and a perfect spy, turning and turning the foundation into the tragedy. <br /> <br /> Finally, not so much a theme as an artistic touch - in each of these films there is usually only one shotgun, or maybe two shots control the story. Violence, torture, cruelty are always just below the surface. We see the results not as blood stream or dangling cells, but in the objects Le Carre objects are stuck in as they ineluctably suck down the morass. <br /> <br /> If you have not seen the movies above, and you enjoy a perfect spy, you're in for a treat. I would also recommend the Sandbagger series (Yorkshire TV), the 2nd and 3rd seasons that start to reach this level of complexity. File IPCRESS and funerals in the Berlin beautiful, though light beans. To intrigue politics try a very British hustle, home to four and yes, Minister / Yes, Prime Minister. <br /> <br /> If only a gross would put his hands on the Three Kingdoms - there would be a movie and intrigue and complexity.
