I liked Dedee Pfeiffer (is that spell right?) In Cybil. Do not see it for a while and forget how much I miss her. I thought he did a great job at that. Thrust in support was also very good. At some angles, the same daughter looked like a young Nicole Kidman. The Abductor was very creepy and the story generally had some good twists. The young companion was a hottie. I thought the husband definitely had something to do with it for sure. Just had the movie movie network for Christmas and I love those movies. Leave my interest and I'll look it again when it's back. Does anyone else recommend any other movie like this? You can post on the board or send a private email if you wish. Thanks in advance. Aboutagirly.
