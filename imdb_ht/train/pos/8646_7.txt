In 1990, Brad Pitt and Juiliette Lewis made a TV too low for both sides to play almost the same type of party they did in California. I have no doubt that this has led to the filing of this great screen movie. <br /> <br /> California get aspiring writer David Duchovny and his girl friend, photographer art Michelle Forbes on a rocky relationship of quality due to Duchy's mania and writing a book and getting into the minds and soul of serial killer . In fact he has received a most unusual odyssey planned, he wants to cross country and visit the sites in several famous tournament killer. But he and Forbes are flat breaks. <br /> <br /> Fate intervenes in more ways than financial and reaching Brad Pitt and Juliette Lewis a pair of unusual south types that agree to split the price of fuel on this trip cross country. It seems that Pitt is a serial killer himself and she decides to do a little research on her own, delving into the mind of a person who is captured with humiliation. California is not the kind of movie I usually go for, but in reality the ability to act and charisma Brad Pitt does it work at a great degree. Pitt is the market definition of a gothic Gothic refugee from deliverance. But better than she is Juliette Lewis who once again plays these sorts of self esteem that she seems to do well. Watching her scene with Forbes as she does her hair and Lewis describes her sad and pathetic life. Lewis's dialogue and Forbes reactions should be shown in the acting class of the country. <br /> For those who love flashlight slasher, they do not come better than California.
