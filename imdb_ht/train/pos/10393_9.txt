Let's cut a short story. I loved every minute of it. A fabulous fantasy in true Arabian-Native style. There is an evil sorcerer, a beautiful princess, a jinn and everyone is happily ever after. Modern Hollywoond sure to have one or two things to learn in this classic. Only riddled: the special effects are very dating (love Sabu and the djinn's tree, though!)
