The "Plainment" represents Cecil B. DeMille's leadership ability to be more correct and un-realist. It has been established in parallel for no less stellar intervention than Wild Bill Hickok (Gary Cooper), Buffalo Bill Cody (James Ellison), Calamity Jane (Jean Arthur), George Armstrong Custer and Abraham Lincoln, even though in reality Lincoln was already dead at the time the story takes place. Every once in a while DeMille floats dangerously close to the truth, but just as easy to veer away from unashed and showmanship spectacles. The film is an attempt to stop Custer's last standing with a deck of fiction that is only wound based on the lives of people who have already produced the stuff of stuff and legends. Surely, this is the world according to DeMille - a zeitgeist in the history of entertainment, but a beautiful kanik relic by today standards. <br /> <br /> TRANSFER: Considering the former of the movie, this is a moderately transferred transcriptering, with white too often clean and very solid. There is a considerable amount of film pills in some scenes and an absence at other times. All in all, the image quality is therefore somewhat consistent, but it is never all bad or indeed ?? just a bit better than in the middle of the road. Age-related areas are kept in a minimum and digital anomaly not distracted. The audio is mono but nicely balanced. <br /> <br /> EXTRAS: Forget it. It's Universal! LINE LINE: As pseudo-history painted on seluloid, this west is compelling and fun. Just take her character and story with a single tablet? in some cases ?? a whole box looks more appropriate!
