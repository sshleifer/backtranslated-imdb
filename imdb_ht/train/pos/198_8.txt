Oh it's so cool to watch a Classic Silent once in while! Vidor's director is simply delightful and even makes a long (at least 1928) as his head. The story is about success in life and how it changes you. Marion Davies plays a girl who leaves her friends in a little comedy studio to be part of a larger "drama" studio. He becomes a great star and the consequences he's really ward off from the real world. For a moment he even denied it (poor) past! The cameos are simply hilarious, certainly the scene where the main character (Marion Davies) sees ... Marion Davies in the studio and concludes it does not seem that special ... It has to be one of the first movie- The movies here and for its real franchise are awesome to see the cameras and materials in way back then. A must-see if you ask me !!
