A clever, entertaining coworker accompanies Peter Ustinov as a career and his sober embezzler placed on a US conglomerate in London. It's abetted by foxy (and sharp horn) Maggie Smith and threatened and exposed by Bob Manhart company man. This is an heist movie and a lot of brain. Ustinov is exceptional as Smith and Newhart are quite funny. The real surprise is Karl Malden, as the seed popping "executive vice-president." Malden was so loose that loose. Cesar Romero and Robert Morley pop into some funny comic. Excellent music notes are not Laurie Johnson. Eric Till's direction is animated with the script by Ustinov and Ira Wallach is the first-rate & very smart. A good time good!
