I remember sitting there, electrically by Werner Van Braune's explanation of rocket science. I watched as history, science and humor were all tied to an engrossing story of possibilities. <br /> <br /> That was fifty years ago. And the shows are back in the Disney treasure series, and what a treasure they are. I watched them last night and tonight with my 8 year old daughter, who at first would not even come to the room, but later changed her mind when she saw being part of anime. While he looked I looked at her, and at the end she was almost as engrossed as I was. <br /> <br /> Turn and you are a young and younger wife of your own ... <br /> <br /> Be sure, some of the predictions about the moon's arrival were wrong. But there is a lot of information that is still quite accurate, and the overall presentation is still impressive. I found myself thinking my daughter's teacher might want to show up in her class, not only as a 50 year old associate, but also as fun and easy to understand lessons in history. , turn around and again ... you are wondering how much really changed in 50 years.
