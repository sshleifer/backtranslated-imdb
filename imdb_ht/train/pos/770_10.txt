I love Tudor Chirila and maybe that's why I enjoyed the movie very much. Two days before the movie premiere I went to see his concerts. I saw the trailer and the video "zmeu" before the movie and I thought I was reading it all ... I was wrong: instead of a good movie I helped a great one! I FELT the movie. it was sad .. it was funny .. but most of all it's LOVE pictures .. i can not even begin to describe the band .. so i will not :) i'm not a movie critic .. i can not describe it's more words .. i a whole wave description is because the play leaves me word ... thank God for the keyboard :) Thank you Tudor Giurgiu, thank you Maria Popistasu, thank you Andreea Barbu and Thanks TUDOR CHIRILA. Encore! :)
