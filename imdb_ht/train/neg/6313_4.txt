Well it's not often that in the UK there is a movie made about inner city life from the perspective of the Afro Caribbean community, the last example that I can remember was back to Babylon back in 1980. So, I had great hope when I heard about boy boy, a movie that was known as the British version of La Haine! Well La Haine it's not! I agree that the use of dialogue and environments gives this film an authenticity that has been missed in other British films at the end, but my anxiety is that this film predicted endless sadness. <br /> The smart film deals with escalating issues of black on black violence that is sadly all common in London, but I'm concerned that movie makers now use the type-casting of plots as opposed to characters that are equally as damaging. Saul Dibb has had a great opportunity to make a movie that would be both entertaining and inspirational for all of us, but unfortunately missed and creating a movie that only reinforces the idea that a young black man in London will be the only avenue is violence & trajedi
