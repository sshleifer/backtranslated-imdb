Here's how you do that: Believe in God and repent of your sins. Then things should be turned into the next day or so. <br /> <br /> Up to fifteen minutes past, this movie just plays as a bad reminder of a little drinking life. Her mother died. His stepmom is a b_tch. Her father dies. He drinks. He is married. He has kids. He drinks some more. His wife became angry. He disappears for his children. Woman threatens to leave. She calls a late night reverend b / c she wants to kill herself. Then, after the recovery occurs, when you find "Left Behind" like subtle messages. <br /> "She needed a check". This is the phrase I've repeated about and once a credit started rolling so I would not lose my respect for Madsen. <br /> <br /> Madsen drops in his knees and begs forgiveness of Christ. Once it does, it goes out and it actually says it sees the world in a different way. He told his wife that he had found God and that was good enough for her. Flip four months and the wife tired to go to church. The movie ends as Madsen is walking by the bar and gives a soliloquy how happy she is with Christ and without alcohol. Final moment? It gives a bit of unpleasant odds to the bar (that's why it's home) and gives a gay, Miami-Vice, after-school special jumping gratitude into the air as the freeze-frame camera. See why did I repeat the sentence? "He needed a check." <br /> Man this movie is bad. The B-Class 80's production value does not help much. The script could easily be an episode "Touched By Angel". It could have been hit from 30 minutes more ads. The act is wooden and never credible. Even Madsen, who I am a big fan and is the only reason I sit in this, make it clear that this is her first job acting and she does not know her $ her from her elbow again on camera . 45 minutes into it I began to get discouraged. This was like duty. I just wanted to put it away, saying that okay, I saw half of it. That's good enough. But no. If I were sitting in Cheerleader Ninjas, I could sit all this way. The only reason I do not give this one a 1 is for two points: 1) I like Madsen. I know it's not fair. But it's great to see the opening title "Introducing Michael Madsen". My Sue. 2) Some of the dialogue is so bad that it's classic. I'll stick some quotes to this end so you can also enjoy them. <br /> <br /> That's about it. To wrap it, this is a piece of crap that should remain flushed with the rest of the turdles. But, hey! Look! Michael Madsen! (See also TILT, TARGET EXECUTIVE, MY BASIS, etc.). Now I had to review the insect dog and watch Madsen turtle a cop to get my respect back to her. Look at Kids. <br /> "This stuff will let me go blind, but I'll drink it anyway" - First Madsen in the taste of cheap alcohol <br /> <br /> "I do not understand! Everything is looks nice! "- Madsen walks out after confessing before God" <br /> "I'll be downtown later and pick up a Bible and I'll get a head too" - Madsen after converting to the dinner table, because Satan lives in hair you are
