I will never forget the great and great comedy of the ORIGINAL movie! Lines, Rhythms, and Event Distribution in the Outstanding Films! However, the end of European vaccine is a great kite down. <br /> <br /> At the end, Griswalds have a European Vacation on a game show. The problem is that many of the jokes in the movie are little more than too mild, "ha-ha" laugh. For example, a flight plane on an airplane asks Clark, "Do you want to coke you in the Can?" Clark replied, "No, I'll have it right here." That's really the only line that's funny in this movie. <br /> <br /> The European Vacation Humor is overstated. As if the writers borrowed all the jokes from the movie first, they tried to re-fail a script that had been done before, and counted on a sluggish-sweat sequel to kick at the end of the picture just to kill time. /> <br /> Worst, the natural comics stand out like Randy Quaid as Eddie's cousins ​​and the original children who played Rusty and Audrey from the movie's first well are nowhere to be found. Replacement is not funny, can not act, and just look like they go to the most powerful motions of the time. There are also a few rude gender jokes and comments that are not just not funny, they are in bad taste. <br /> <br /> The Griswald should stay in the Wally World. Where are they legendary! Do not join them on this dreadful European adventure. The viewers should re-watch the original vacation movie at this place! You will be glad you have done.
