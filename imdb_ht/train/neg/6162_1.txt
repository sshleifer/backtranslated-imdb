"Smokey and the bandits" were not exactly Shakespeare, but then nobody wanted it to be. She was slapstick, but she had brain. It has a very clever script and characters defined with a fun wrap-up. People from the theater smile. "Hooper" gives none of this. There is no reason to smile. If he assumes a tribute to the Hollywood Stuntman, he does look awfully awkward by giving battle scenes without seriously choreography and one of the most compelling cars I've ever seen. It all looks fake, seriously-filmed almost on purpose. Poor Sally Field (as the girlfriend broke his hand on the sidelines) gives it weaker role, and not a single funny or smart line ("If you do that, I will not be here when you get back" ). Burt Reynolds holds the camera look and winking, but the joke is about any audience sitting at "Hooper". * from ****
