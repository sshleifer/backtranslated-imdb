Where to get the money to make movies like this? I mean, nothing is redeeming this film. None of the actors are known, the writing is awful, the photography is blurry, the story wanders between being a malicious version of Repo Man and a Western nicklodeon and the act is incredible. For someone who watches all kinds of films, good and bad, I must admit that this movie is about the worst I've seen since the human eye attack back to 50 years. I do not really like to waste the effort of people trying to create some entertainment or, heaven forbid, art, but this movie would seem to appeal to no one. The story flips over a mysterious contamination of someone in a bad version of the Soul Celtic eater, although it works more like a succubus man without the sexual anonymity. The bad guys have team up with the good guys in a city where they can escape from. Take her out of there like that, alas, is the best part. My advice is that unless you are in bad mythology, writing romantic, compelling acting and tedious surroundings, you'll better be served by leaving this one on the shelf when you're out renting videos.
