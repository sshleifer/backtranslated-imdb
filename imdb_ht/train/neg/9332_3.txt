It's not a terrible film, really, and Glenn and Keitel are top-notch actors. Further, they make an acceptable job with the very weak script. The landscape is lush and the plot has some interesting twists. Further, I observed why these actors and the crew made the movie, they are professional and they get paid for it. But I wonder why studios spend time with money for making a movie and then not releasing it for theater audiences? Though a movie is a box-office flop, surely it does make some money. If you're a fan of Keitel or Glenn, rent the video or catch it on TV, as I did I. Granted, the film will not help resolve the January immigration with Mexico, but the experience is far better than 90% of the TV ticket price today.
