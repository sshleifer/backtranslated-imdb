I doubt it will never even have a movie movie. I liked Gram Parsons to be sure and I did not expect much from this film and got even less. What could have been smart and moving was camping. He was devoid of the music that made Gram and had more filler than cheap dog food. There was no background on Gram or the colorful people of that era. The characters shown were not familiar with me as a fan of Gram and all the versions of "adventure after his book" I heard. Rock and scroll is all against, good people too but should be taken with a single grain. They may be great stories though exaggerated. However, this film took a good story and was back in to drift. Stealing any dead bodies and their implications should never be a dull story but made it dull, somehow. I'm tempted to steal all copies of Grand Parsons flight, head out into the desert and burn them all.
