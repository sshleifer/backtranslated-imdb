This story is about romantic triangles between a nt. African male prostitute, a French transsexual whore (Stephanie) and a Russian-speaking Frenchman and never looks shady. As a movie it is dull, sad and depressing, injections on fog, sunbreak winter days or seriously lit interiors, where everyone is immersed in a strange blue luminescence. And yes, I know, because the white balance came out. Everyone is talking with downcast and looks like haggard, shabby and dirty. Bodies are bones and injections of these inability to look ugly and unappealing. Moles, greasy hair. Yuk. Bad news in a movie where people spend a lot of time either naked or sex. <br /> And the story? Well, Stephanie's mother will die. All three characters are back in the village of Stephanie, where, through a bunch of rioting in desolation lands with predictably gentle interiors, we see a bit of childhood Stephanie as a boy called Pierre. Mom dies. Well ... and that's about it, really. Character development holds at a minimum, as is the denial of the story. I think the scenario is not linear (it would explain a lot of name sequits) but really, after paying seven euros I do not feel like having to build the movie myself: that's the director to take my money for. To expect me to enter the story says the process and get my hands dirty, so to speak, will ask too much way. <br /> <br /> This movie is a pile of firefighting pans made, above all, from a desire to boast the burgers (ie the fingers). I can see how it was a Shoo-in for the Berlin Film Festival, and I can see why he got nowhere.
