I love Westerns. I could watch them all day. "Good, Bad, and Ugly" is my favorite ever. I watched "Silverado" for probably the 8th time just the other day because it was about CMT. However, this movie, Shiloh Falls is without a doubt the worst Western I've ever watched. The act was terrible all around. They explain nothing at the end of the mysterious compass of the things. The only good part I can think of is the good-looking girl canteen. Most of the apparent long lines between the dialogue seemed intentional just make up time to make the film in length acceptable. This movie is not even worth the new rental fee I paid at our local rental shop. I felt I was stolen and deserved of a rental reimbursement if there was such a thing. Only reason I finished it because I hate not seeing a movie in the end. I turned it around half way because it was so bad. For the director, please do a better job if you decide to do another. This is the kind of movie that has the potential to turn people away to the west.
