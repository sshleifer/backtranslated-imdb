For the first time in years, I felt the need to log in to IMDb today to purify myself in this movie by writing a review, because it was just like a let-down to watch. The awesome sound scheme when I read it, I expect a minimal mystery thriller, a phantom hunting phatom. Unfortunately, it all gets so badly watered by a mundane, tiring love story and too much understanding and teeth-gnashingly stupid "no-one-thing-like-like-this-except-in-bad-movies" - dialogue that it's just agonizing. <br /> Here's a run running through the worst offense of this movie: <br /> - The script depends so heavily on coincidence with the inexplicable and inexorable sort of the main character that it's just ridiculous. No, actually, it's upset. And lazy. <br /> - Related to: good emotions. A long paradise "just in time" moments. <br /> <br /> - the main characters. Well, it seems that the senarist has never experienced real human beings in real life, but instead took full knowledge of it in bad movies. So its characters are boring, mutual shadow second generation. They are only trace-devices, where-people have the slightest little bit of personality. They are "men and women in break-up that always love each other". Never see one before except in 100,000 movies and it will not get any more realistic or enjoyable. Think of the blandest two-dimensional Hollywood ticket prices and you've got it. There is not one character in this movie that even remotely cool, good, or interesting. <br /> - The resolution is far-fetched, this wave swings very bad and needs just one nudge to reverse, even though the word "resolution" could be ill-tight here, because the movie is a turmoil which will not be anywhere anyway. Since you are in, though, you do not care again. The third third of the movie I just fast-throwing, because it's just so unbearable to look. <br /> <br /> Well, that's it. Regardless of the redemption feature of this movie, it has all become buried under incompetence. Do not watch this turdock.
