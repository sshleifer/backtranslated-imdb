I enjoyed commenting the first review far more than I did the movie when I saw it in a second theater running in '80' early. I was impressed then in the care taken to create costume patterns so well after the Tenniel designs. But me, the cast was largely wasted, the personality muffled by the masks, while the direction I think was very static, and the quiet photography. The rating jotted down at the time was a naughty, which means "not worth sitting at once". Still, I also would jump in a chance to have a second look.
