A wonderful obvious thriller-by-number, in which the only possible twist turned out to be a hidden nothing. I looked primarily for English language performance by Isabelle Huppert. It was not great, but then it was a strange role. I would not be surprised if half of the contributions it turned out were left on the off-floor floor with the last-minute rewrite script. <br /> <br /> The act is the least appealing thing about this movie. Steve Guttenburg looks like she tries to meat out her role and the charm that everyone told her she had. There is a sensational senseless sequence in which it suggests that its vital sexual ability will be able to help treat PTSD. It's a refreshing performance. Elizabeth McGovern is more of a genuine and genuine charm and character but it's a bit of comfort. 3/10
