Well, so this movie previews only tells you that a little rebel girl goes to live with her grandmother for the summer in order to straight out. That's actually not the case! She is about a 17 year old girl rebel that reveals a secret and she's up to her mother to believe she's telling the truth or not. <br /> <br /> To be honest, I really enjoyed the concept of this movie. They had a really good scheme and a really good theme in a loving relationship between mother and daughter. I did not, however, loved watching Lindsay Lohan in acting. In fact, this movie would have been GREAT if they had someone else, perhaps a better actress. The character of Rachel (loan) is a very sexually aggressive person and he sort of reminds us of the real Lindsay so she takes away a lot from the movie. <br /> I do this too, thinking that if you put Lindsay aside, you will enjoy this movie. The finish is pretty much (and sad).
