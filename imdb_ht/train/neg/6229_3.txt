First of all, let's find some things straight here: a) I AM a fan-always been as a matter of fact (I used to watch Speed ​​Racer all the time in preschool). b) I do like many B-Movies because they're hilarious. c) I like the Godzilla movies - a lot. <br /> <br /> Move on, when the first movie comes on it, it looks like it will be your usual B-movie, down to the fancy FX, but all a sudden- BOOM! the anime comes on! This is when the movie goes WWWAAAAAYYYYY down. <br /> <br /> The animation is very bad & cheap, even worse than I remember from speed racer, for crisis! In fact, it's so cheap, one of the few scenes in the movie I "shine" to remember is when a bunch of kids runs out of school ... & it's kids even about & over again! FX are awful, too; Dinosaurs look worse than Godzilla. In addition, the live animation transition is organized, the dialogue with voice (especially the English dub that I see) was trembling & I asked my dad to take the tap from the DVD / VHS player; The only thing that caught me survived was cracking out jokes & comments like the Robots & Joel / Mike on MST3K (or selecting the season). Honestly, this is the only way to barely enjoy this movie & survive at the same time. <br /> Heck, I plan to show this to another fellow otaku me on Halloween for a B-Night film. Because it's stupid, very painful to watch & hilarious impulse at the same time, I give this movie a 3/10, an improvement from the 0.5 / 10 I was originally going to give it. (According to my graduation scale: 3/10 means pretty much both boring & bad. As fun as the counting three unless you find a way to make fun of it, then it will become fun as the count of 15. )
