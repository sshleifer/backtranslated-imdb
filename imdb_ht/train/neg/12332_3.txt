The film looks super on paper. A romantic comedy in which a frantic lover gets dragged into a transfer thriller should be generic cross-breeding gold, especially with this excellent cast rom rom. <br /> I'm afraid Lawrence Kasdan simply gives her two stars too many ropes, and they hardly go and hang themselves. Adam Brooks' script may well blame but you would expect better from Kevin Kline's to a fish called Wanda. Rather ping-pong in one another and the romance developed easily never reconciled satisfaction and the reason one of them is in and superb in France. Jean Reno co-stars amiably as cop-to-heart and I guess she's been a star-and-a-party. Thank you for going to make these Pink slopes noticed (s!) So maybe it was ok with that ... 3/10
