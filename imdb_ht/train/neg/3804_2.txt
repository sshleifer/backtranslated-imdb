This is a poor movie by any standard. The Story of Point Match had a certain intelligence, with the direction and writing of a certain passion (Woody Allen mixes his own culture to that of the classic English massacre and explores what can do with it). Scoop, however no of this. It's wrong to write, the two drivers are hopelessly wooden and the story itself has no interest at all. The genre that it perfectly requires at least some sort of subplot and witty explanation and tide-ups (why are cards and keys kept under French cone in closed rooms?). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Various Hollywood genres (Curse of the Scorpion Scorpion / Rose brown in Cairo etc.) has given us many fun over the years. Even Hollywood Fini has a great central idea. Sadly his inspiration left it this time.
