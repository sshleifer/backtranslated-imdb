Now is not it? Considering the great works by dancel, Clive and Jodie, the film never grows in something more than a dead-hard / heist copycat. Yes a couple of jokes, there is absolutely no unpredictable twists, to be honest only the unpredictable moments they have because both directors and editors have made some stupid mistakes, it's a shame for them and a waste of time for us. If anyone can tell me why the earth was digging a hole inside safe, who hell is the Rebe and how the earth knew that diamonds were in the cell in particular, it might just be doing my day, but it seems that Spike asks us to take too much of this one for granted, and not raise our concern when something looks stupid ... it's just another movie studio movie to relax and enjoy. .
