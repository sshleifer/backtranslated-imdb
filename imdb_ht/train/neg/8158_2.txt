What is the point of creating windows that have absolutely no relevance to the original movie? No points. This is why the Prom Night Night is so embarrassingly bad. The original movie requires a group of kids to hide a dark secret that eventually finds them all killed, one bar, in a brutal act of revenge. Can someone please explain to me what a mother dies-prom-rising from the steel tomb to the crown made with the first movie then? Prom Night 2 had continuous congestion caverns that left the audience wondering how this happened and why should they happen? But in the end, I guess you could call it one of those movies that are so bad, you end up laughing at it.
