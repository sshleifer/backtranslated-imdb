The massacre The ultimate story of revenge by a Nerdy guy who fell victim to one of the coolest and cold jokes of cinema history. Unfortunately after promising the opening flick went straight to hell. A very tedious and redundant chaos with mediocre slashings and an ultimate half hour that sucks on a whole new level of suckiness. The guy who played the nerve actually killed himself shortly after the flick was released. If you want to rent the flick off it after the tour and remember, choose life.
