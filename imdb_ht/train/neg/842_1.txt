This is not Michael Madsen's fault, he's hardly in it. This movie was just awful. If you want to laugh and be bored, go ahead and watch this movie. Words can not describe how idiotic it is. Sorry Michael. The cinematography was dark. All other actors are unknown. When watching it, it feels like a soft porn, but with no heated or heated scene. This movie has sexual intercourse, because it is on an underground underground S & M. The act was bad, except part Michael Madsen. It looked like he wanted to laugh. I hope he paid well for this lousy movie. It is something I should not be proud of. It's not even a movie B for cable, it's more like an F and it should never be shown ever.
