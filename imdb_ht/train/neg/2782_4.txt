Just saw this film last weekend, I'm upset, and disappointed with it. Basically, the film tells you that immigrants, even from the former Soviet Union, came to this country, bringing everyone to be with them from the old country, and invading and taking on what Americans were is working for. Which is a very bad way of looking at immigration, and a worse way to tell people about it. That's the main thing. Another thing, the overall writing, directing and filming is on the village's amateurs level. The actors were very well, but did not go up to save this bunch of crap. A few jokes were funny, but most were bad with cheese. Could not wait to get out of the theater, wanting my money back.
