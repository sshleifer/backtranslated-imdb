Army, cliched superhero movie action drivel. I had high hopes for this movie, and the genre of HK buddy actioneers is one that I do not despise, but very rarely I see a scenario as hilarious and funny as this one was. This would be forgiven, as it always does in these kinds of movies, when the action offset, unfortunately, it was not. The action brings the surrealism trademark and the top nature of HK shares, but it's not very involved, obscene gory, and in fact often completely incoherent (maybe this is due to re-editing for U.S. release, it shows signs in many places in patchwork). I was very disappointed.
