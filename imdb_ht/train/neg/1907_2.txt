This malignant piece of waste managed to be racist, sexist and homophobia all at once, while pretending to be terribly chic and sophisticated. Atrophic performance, a stage ridden shrimp, and boring directions make this movie one of the clear drags. Two scenes were especially offensive - the one in which Schaech scrubs his tongue after kissing another person (he really was that gross), and the scene where Eastwood is kissed by Schaech's best friend, who pretend to be Russian. After leaving the room he called "f ** strange"! So much so he was a cultured artist who dreams of living in Paris! <br /> Jonathon Schaech can be a friendly actor on screen, and it's amazingly good-looking. It's a shame he did not learn more of working with cutting director Gregg Araki on a movie earlier, and tries to save this movie from down to a string of gay stereotypes and a mud of homophobia.
