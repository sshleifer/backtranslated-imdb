Deathstalker is directed by John Watson and its Rick Hill star, who is some kind of body built and famous, if I understood the right? The plot follows as Deathstalker (Hill) trying to find something back from the evil master, and he traveled to the master's cave. He meets many noses and monsters during his trip, with the surroundings very close to Tolkien, and of course the Conan Barber. This is a rip off of great success in Conan, and though this is very stupid film, it has plenty of good litter and it is recommended for garbage fans and tolerated film dunk! There are no many movies in this film. Couples in the scenes are almost atmospheric and fascinating, but those focusing on Deathstalker are naked women and big muscles in Hill. Females are usually discouraged and very stupid victims, too, so this is very filmy and so can not please many feminists! The fighting scene has nothing special and beautiful dull, and monsters are neither special anything. And all other aspects of the movie are also very amateur and seriously done, but what did you expect in low budget effort like this? This tries to be great as Conan but neglected very miserable. As I said, this can please fans of turkey movies but no one else. This belongs to the category it's so bad it's great! <br /> <br /> Deathstalker is still not as close as bad as it might be, and as a turkey film, I appreciate this almost as many other turkeys, are enjoyable in strokes! If the bad films are your cup, then try this and have fun, but if you do not understand "enjoyable movie bad" then stay away. But if one can not stand large amounts of stripping, then stay away from too. There are more nudity here than violence, due to these scenes, the movie has a rating R. Otherwise this might have some movie family film PG! <br /> <br /> 4/10
