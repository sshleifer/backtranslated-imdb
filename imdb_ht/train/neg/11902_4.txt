The hysterical thing about this film is that, according to the director, it has difficulty finding a distributor in the U.S. because most of them see it could not reconcile the seemingly controversial messages of Christianity and bitter Americans. Thought to anyone who sees this as a religious film in any way is mockable. Because a minister on a prayer mission with the homeless or wanting someone "Godspeed" to make it a "Christian" movie? One can interpret that it is actually mocking religion for the "Land of Plenty" and all its excess material, the best of an organized mission can do is hand out a bowl of soup with a Bible verse. Many of the poor or downtrodden maybe? Many homeless missions initiatives? How about many veterinarian veterinarian vets? As a surviving weight gainer in our "pink" agent, Americans think that America is a "land of plenty" of paranoid parrots? Maybe we have many psychiatric patients? Certainly we do not have many people involved in Palestine politics based on the main characters of the movie's characters. Of course if you worked in a German shelter unfortunate shelter would have been more concerned about peace in a country far beyond their personal survival as the world knows how Europe is "the continent of Plenty" when it comes to sophisticated. /> <br /> Indeed I agreed with the title to the end as the United States is the "Land of Plenty" and in this particular case it refers to the abundance of poor scripts, amateur actors and films directed . Life is too short and one, even an American, does not have "much" in time to waste watching this piece.
