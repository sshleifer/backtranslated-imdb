As an Altman fan, I would look for this movie for years, thinking that and throwing a big, it should be at least very brilliant. <br /> <br /> Big mistake. <br /> This is one of Altman's great-cast mishmashes, throwing together atmosphere and improvisation (or thereby feeling) and hope that he would all come together in the editing room. It does not. As Maltin points out, this turkey is remarkable only for the first performance of Alfre Woodard, who is veterinary failures all around it. But other than that, avoid at all costs. (Which is very easy to do - it has never been released on video - in my knowledge - with its cable appearances frequencies at the Halley Comet.)
