Alone in the dark is Uwe Boll's kick in the Hollywood blacks after House at the Dead Punch in the face. <br /> <br /> If anything it proves just how much of a Master Boll masterpiece is. After forcing Artisan from business on the Flop of House of the Dead, one can only assume the virtually credible Lions Gate Movie only released AITD under contractual obligations after acquiring the artisans. Because AITD is an even bigger example of complete lack of film-making conferences, display scheme and just plain plain thief from other movies because it's supposed to look cool instead of because it is fitted in the movie's foundation. /> But then the point is not it. Boll does not try to make a coherent movie because she's not trying to be alone in the dark. It is just trying to manipulate Hollywood. <br /> <br /> Alone in the dark, like the Dead House, Dungeon Siege, Far Cry, Bloodrayne and other 3 or 4 projects that are "announced" or in "Production". <br /> These are not films to be directed, but investment portfolios. Each one of one of them runs in production under the pretense of the Bill Tax Law and his investors are exploiting can be close to the next 2 to 3 years. The more bomb projects it can be released in this time frame, the more money it and investors can get. Why harness to make a good movie when a bad movie makes you a mummy anyway? The result is the terrible movie of alone in the dark. <br /> <br /> Alone in the dark, as all his other movies are just a cynical exploitation of Hollywood's current trend for lazy film making. <br /> And to those who support Boll do not call it misunderstanding or next to Ed's Wood, accolades, do not make a cult figure out of the man, you just make it easier for him to find investors but give him notoriety . br /> <br /> For more information, read here: http://www.cinemablend.com/feature.php?id=209 http://www.cinemablend.com/forum/showthread.php?s= & threadid = 21699 As a sidewalk, just do not ask me how he got his throw-list together. Unless the actors are on investment-scam at least, mystery is still being discovered.
