Successfully runaway in the "God's Army", every Mormon and a camera seem to be trying to make a movie right now. In the case of the latest "Other Side Sky", this was not at all a bad thing. This movie, while not great, was quite good. "Ward Singles", however, is not. <br /> Tell the story of a young, divorced Mormon guy violated back to one life, the writing and shooting style of the "Singles Ward" is, in many ways, very similar to the 80s comedy "Ferris Bueller and Day Off ". However, similarities are over. While "Ferris Bueller" was funny, original, and well-acted (as far as stupid comedies as ever this is), "Ward Singles" is completely the opposite. It tries very hard to be funny. However, 90% of gags are either flat or clich√©s and jokes you've probably heard a million times before. Other 10% seem to be thrown in the filling time. And the current, while not terrible, is the best amaturish. In addition, if you are not either a Mormon self, or very, very familiar with the Mormon culture, you will not find hardly anything at all. Whereas the "God's Army" and "The Other Sky" appealed to a wide audience of viewers, both inside and outside of the Mormon Church, this movie is definitely a great joke inside, and even if you find it , it's just not funny.
