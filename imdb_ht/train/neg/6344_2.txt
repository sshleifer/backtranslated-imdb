Well I'm injured, a Wooden Allen movie that I walked out after half an hour (I'm aware of the moral vulnerability of commenting on a movie in which I've seen less than half but I hope you'll understand why). Basically, it became apparent very early on that we were going to be patronized out of the screen and: a script that expelled its advice as if with bullet points; a cast that was all trying to be the character of Ana and his sister (with the exception of Chloe Sevigny), and was seriously led to doing so; with a camera located around bearing, only to have to be nothing movie, but chat with the actor delivering it. Dream? Nobody; It's partially pre-narrated, but the action does nothing to develop a dramatic situation. Maybe I did leave too early in this case, but then I would decide to spend another hour and a half in one -clin-Allen clones. The script has its comic moments ?? I went almost entirely on the back of Will Ferrell's extract from the trailer (trailer-tuned again, go!) ?? but there are little pace left to fly on nonchalantly, as is best. Worse than this there is no liquidity. He says this wooden film makes a jungle look like a jelly: opening coffee-binding arguments were the most abusive case-in-point. The only thing that should be done by numbers is review ?? 2/10.
