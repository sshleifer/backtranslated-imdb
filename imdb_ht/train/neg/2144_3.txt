I always thought Cinderella II was the worst movie I've ever seen, (followed by Peter Pan 2, and some other sequences like the Lion King 2 and the Hunchback of Notre Dame 2). All these films are made with the same idea; because the movie has no draw, they try to make up for that by filling it with jokes. I'm not saying jokes are bad, but they do most of the movie. The first time I saw the movie, I would give it a 1/10. But now I think about it, most kids do not care how good the original film was, they just care that the movie is fun. I still think the movie was a bad end, but that does not mean it's terrible. Now I think she deserves a 3/10.
