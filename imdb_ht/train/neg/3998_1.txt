Can you say "Any shock, no scheme?" There have been many unexploded explanations in this film. There was no story about the room other than death. * Who was it wrong? What made it this way? Why a countdown "hour"? Then, there were unexplored things to attract; for example we * saw * a camera in the air vent, which he mentioned. But when he was up to say the ventilation, there was no camera. <br /> How about the fact that all the ghosts look "Digital", and the things "winked out" before you hit the ground to make a sting noise? Hmmm ... when you put all of the * items together, it makes room 1408 look like a spook home of high tech. Except that there was no follow-up on that. <br /> <br /> O ... in the way ... electronic does not work at 1408. Well, except for the TV ... the cell phone has no signals, but internet wireless works fine. How many inconveniences can you add? I'm sorry, but this film was nothing but "shock after shock". It's all done before. Reflection in the mirror. Things just come from site. Change paint. Mi bleen. "Oh, it's all just a dream ... no it was not." And, if the room was "wrong", why does our main character come in terms of his daughter's death, if he's going to keep it blocked there forever and ever? It just did not make sense. <br /> In addition, there was no background information on the "first book" that he wrote. Just some vague information about "Dad was a jerk" and to do. Speaking of Father, what was the bit about his father? "You will be in my place." <br /> In general, a truly horrific movie. It was 100% adrenaline shock factor, without any new or innovative effects, and certainly not history back, character development, etc. <br /> <br /> My overall impression is that the entire movie was made on "Cheap"; Very beautiful using a series and a couple of shots in place, and it has nothing but a reactive film, cheese, "seen-that-before" effect.
