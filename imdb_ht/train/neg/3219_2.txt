Someone called Howard Koch a schlockmeister but did write the scenario for "Casablanca", did not he? Or did not read. Perhaps there are more than one slinking chef around in Hollywood, and I'm not too fond of "Casablanca" anyway. Wait a minute - yes, there is another Howard Koch slinking around Hollwyood. This is one of those who wrote "Casablanca." There are no problems. I will take great care in this comment as "Howard W. Koch" put into this production, which means only a little. <br /> You know what this looks like? Someone read Cliff's note about the "King Lear" Shakespeare, and she decided, since no original idea was aboard the Express Inspiration Express, to update it and Hollywood to her with a happy end ... There are differences. Lear decided to divert up his vast estates between three sisters and before he does, asking them how much they love him. Two of the sisters throw themselves at his feet and his brown nose get in his money. The third is the good girl and refuses to go operas on Lear. But in the play, Lear stayed alive to regret his decision to lament the two of his catcher and prevent the girl from being honest. She winds up crazy and naked during a galloping on the mores, putting flowers in her hair and hallucinator. Kids can do this for you. (Take my kid, for example.After all the effort I wasted on increasing her, she showed no interest in becoming a doctor or a lawyer.) In the end, everyone in the play died. /> In the movie, obviously, the good sister is morose and committing suicide, but when she tries to cut herself, someone jumps in and saves her, so the finish, more or less, happy. This difference between Hollywood and a genuine tragedy, unless you define Hollywood as a tragedy enough for himself.
