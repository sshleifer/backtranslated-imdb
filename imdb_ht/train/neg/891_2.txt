Having liked 'Paris, Watching Me', I highly anticipate this film and I admit I went on with high expectations but was sorely disappointed for a number of reasons .. Although I did not expect a Re-performing at 'Paris' in New York I was expecting the same structure. What I liked about 'Paris' was broken down in the neighborhoods. You got a sense of every style director and the story they meant. In 'NY', there is no clear separation in the stories, at different points in the movie, characters from different stories run into each other that made me confused as to who I was looking at and what exactly went on . Also, the switch of LEDs was obvious but confusing since there was no sink. Another thing I liked about the movie 'Paris' was different to take on love. It was not all romantic. There was love between parents and their children, unrequited love, a lonely, woman-frustrated woman of love, etc., exploring many layers of complexity in love between people. 'NY' seemed to go just for a sexual, on-the-top. There were some reputable poker bucks (the couple was bigger than a life together, Julie Christie's short), but in general the film 'did not evoke any emotion for me. I did not connect with any of the characters I did with 'Paris'. I remember watching 'Paris' and feeling a deep sadness, loneliness, desires, hope, wonder ... he just had so many souls. For me, there was no soul in the movie 'NY'. <br /> <br /> Perhaps if I went to it without having 'Paris' appearing in the back of my brain as a comparison of this movie would be to elect a more favorable response, but as a top-titre Re-take in 'Paris, Je T'aime' I was sorely disappointed.
