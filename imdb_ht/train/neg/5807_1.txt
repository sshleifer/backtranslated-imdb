Do not even bother with this movie, it's bad when judging on its own base, but when compared to the original 1972 (which is a classic) it's down terrible right. And BTW, someone commented that the 1972 film is bad when compared to the book. This is funny, movies should never be judged against the books they've taken off. They are 2 different forms of art (as if this need to be pointed out but apparently it does). If you use this criterion for all movies then "2001" would suck and thus would be "Forest Gump" and "Silence of the Lambs."
