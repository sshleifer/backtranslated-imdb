Burt Reynolds came to a point in his career where he appeared to go to the motions. He would show up, share his friends on film, and take home a great check. It did not seem to matter to him that the product he represented was worse. <br /> No film to outgrow this much more than "Ace Stroker" that makes "Cannonball Run" look like a classic and "Cannonball Running II" watch look. Saved for a few race scenes there is absolutely NOTING worth seeing here. Even Loni Anderson's lovely hams is so bad as a blonde dumb it is embarrassing. If thinking of Burt hamming her with Jim Nabors and dressing like a funny sound chicken then this is your movie. Otherwise choose almost any other comedy movie and it will not be any worse.
