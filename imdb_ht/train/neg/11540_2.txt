This reminds me SOO much of Michael Winner's top weekend and it's awful English budget low budget. <br /> <br /> First I must say I'm a fan of both exploitation and serious films. I appreciate, say, 'Demented' for its ineptitude and 'last House on the left' for it's absolute unashamed brutality. And any number of invented inventions and increasingly brutal Italian turn. <br /> <br /> This was just useless though. Types such as a British budget director thought 'left in renewal' I spit on your tone 'without making it too hugely now that horror is back in fashion and hostage. All the stuff just do not hang together or have a point. What's the Violet's Daughter? Why do you have the man to be an expert in security camera? Clean.
