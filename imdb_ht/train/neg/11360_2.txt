Well, so, somebody, somewhere, a few years ago, thought it would be a good idea to make a movie IMAX 3D on some flies that stand away from Apollo 11 and go to the moon. So they did. Somebody, somewhere, was a fool. I want to give artisans accessible to do their homework on hardware. As far as I can say, the rockets and rocket launches were bang over. The overall graphics were very good - launching the rocket gave me thrill, as a good rocket launch always made (mechanical popular fly-machine without heat still running strong) and the 3D was very effective. The CG was not Pixar-quality, but it was generally good. The flies were like anthropomorphic moyencra, with some half-antenna late-60s cast in for color (hippie flies, African-American flies and giant african with black shades, etc.) and maggots to look more like grb and baby hair human (although they made conclusions brutally compromised). The scripts certainly did not do homework, relying on offensive and outdated clinics (60s sex politics including mostly-useless female characters, racial stereotypes, bad Russians, a flying fat who only wants to eat, two class-humor gross-out humor). In a movie aimed at the IMAX, they have been blaming a wonderful opportunity to sneak into some physical education and physical education content - they did not get the right physics (zero-g of the lunar module during burning landing? TANP. ) They were not even bothering to link the original radio between Houston and the astronauts, all of them in the public domain; Instead they wrote their own dialogue, which sounds like crap. <br /> But we loved the maggots. So they get a point and a half for rockets and maggots. Uh, yay. 1.5 / 5.
