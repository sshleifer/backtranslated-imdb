I saw this movie about 5 years ago, and the memory of it still my couple on this day. I was completely aware of how terrible she was supposed to go through it, so I only have to blame myself. But like most, I did not believe all the negativity. Being a Sandler fan, he just seemed inconceivable one of his movies could really be that bad. I figured it was just Hatred Sandler. I could not have been more wrong. <br /> What we have here is a comedy that does not have the same 1 second in anything funny. That is actually quite an accomplishment. You would think of a 90-minute comedy, they might have accidentally stumbled on something even remotely funny. But no, it's just awful. It's not "so bad it's good", just his bad. You can not laugh at how bad it is, you can only cry. You wait patience for a joke that will at least make you chuckle, but they never come. <br /> <br /> Have you seen the movie in the Ring? Where do the people watch a video tape and die 7 days later? If this movie was on the video tape, people would die immediately, not their own hands, and would smile on their faces as they realized the agony was over, and that would be the first smile since they pressed play. <br /> <br /> You might be inclined to watch it just to see how bad it is, to deceive your curiosity. Do not do that. Please do not. Believe me, I have done you a favor. There are 2 types of people in the world, people who think they will be far worse are the worst movie ever made, and those who have not yet seen it.
