I read Tom Robbins' EVEN COWGIRLS THE GREAT BLUES as a teenager. I loved every word. It was sexy, funny, and full of glamorous scenery and beautiful writing. But when I saw the movie, I could not believe what a dull, back, piece of junk it was. How did this happen? I think someone in Hollywood reads this book and fills it under "GAY PRIDE - WOMAN - LESBIANS." (This is the subject of Congressional title title.) Now anyone over 12 who reads the book will know that nothing has to do with real lesbians, any more than STAR war is about real travel space. The book was obviously - and I mean OBVIOUSLY - written by a heterosexual male who loves the IDEA in lesbians (in the nude, all the time), but never really met one. <br /> Still, someone in Hollywood said, "u oh, best give this to a Gay director or Gay People is making trouble." So they released it at Gus Van Center. There is nothing against the man, but - however Gay it can really be - it does not have a sign as to how to make a comic movie. Gus Van Sant has taken a straightforward man to the fantasy of guilt free girl / girl action and male voices turning it into a dull, literally-minded Lesbian Poster Recruiting Power. It's like turning an Oscar Wilde comedy into a tragedy Arthur Miller. Not very. <br /> <br /> The main signal that Gus Van Center has absolutely no idea what to do with the source material is to drop off badly riotously bad. Course has allowed him to hire the very best. His ignorance of the real Roman subtext (a real man's fantasy, not a masking poster pride recruiting) caused him to make choices that were not only bad, but scarce. <br /> <br /> Let's meet the cast of EVEN COWGIRLS to find the BLUES. <br /> <br /> MORITATE SHOT as the "CHINK" Okay, some non-recognition of Asian actors. And Pat Morita, at DAY HAPPY, was fairly funny. But depositing it as the CHINK was wrong, evil, wrong. Pat Morita has no idea that Chink is a very funny man. (Gus did not say it.) It also does not seem to know that Chink is. . . Well, SEXY !!! In the book he's not wise old Mr. Miyagi. It's more like Hugh Hefner! He is an old Randy goat and he knows a lot about Nubile's fun and responds to Sisi and Bonanza Jellybean. (You see, in the book, are not really lesbians .. Do you find that this is a right man's fantasy again?) <br /> <br /> JOHN HURT as "THE MOST." Well, he's a gay friendly man. But it is a SERIOUS, ACTAKER SHAKESPEAREAN !!!! You need someone who is fun, and camp, for this role. For John Hurt to be cast as a guy to jump as the meter is tragic and sad. I waited for Paul Scofield to shed at all dresses like Thomas More, and to relieve himself. "Now, Richard, you know you've lost your whole soul, for shame, my ex-student!" And yes, John Hurt was funny (and pretty gay) as Caligula. But that was black humor, not humorous and twisted humor like the book. <br /> <br /> RAIN PHOENIX as "Bonanza Jellybean." No talent, no training, no problem. Except that in the book Bonanza is funny, playful, happy, (especially) heterosexual, and love. In the film it is biting, passive, expressive, and dull. As for his taste for women, Robbins in the book put it like this. "God knows I love women, but there is nothing that can take place in a man who fits." Uh, Gus? Did you read this book? <br /> <br /> Uma Thurman as "Sissy Hankshaw." This is a tough role. In the book Sissy really is a very passionate and shy heroine. Still, a more accomplished actress might have fabricated a twinkle in his eyes, or a chance to walk it, means some sort of hidden force or fun fun in his adventures. Uma does not pull it off, probably because Gus never says it Sisi is supposed to enjoy a hiker and a wonderful and giant body. Uma plays it more like it in a TV movie about a girl who died in leukemia. <br /> <br /> This movie is back and dull. And I accused YOU, Gus Van Center!
