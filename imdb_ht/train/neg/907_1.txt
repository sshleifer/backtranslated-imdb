I wrote a review of this movie further down after buying it on DVD and being gravely disapointed. <br /> I tried to watch it again after reading some of the reviews since then. Being a movie student and making movies just like my own budget (ie no budget, shotgun shot), I stand by my original comment. This is a student project that does not have budget (and not a particularly good one), released on video / DVD to watch as a movie award winner (if you read the cover). So deceive the public to think it's something it's not. I want my money back to the trading act description! Complete Trash!
