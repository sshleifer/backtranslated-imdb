Bill (Buddy Rogers) sent to New York by his uncle (Richard Tucker) to experience life before he inherited $ 25million. Her uncle paid 3 women Jacqui (Kathryn Crawford), Maxine (Josephine Dunn) and Pauline (Carole Lombard) chaperone her and made sure she did not fall bad in gold-shades. A lady like Cleo (Geneva Mitchell) turns on the stage of the disapproval of women. We follow the story as the girls offer more money they appear in a show instead of the role roles they have agreed to carry out for the 3 months that Bill is in New York, while Bill meets with Cleo and another women. In the end, love is in the air for bill and another ............. <br /> <br /> The quality of photos and quality of the poor sounds in this movie a. The story is interspersed with musical numbers but the songs are bad and Kathryn Crawford has a terrible voice. Rogers are not good either. It is beautiful enough but only really comes to life when playing the drums or trombones. There is a very disappointing character that plays a taxi driver (Roscoe Karns) and the movie is just dull.
