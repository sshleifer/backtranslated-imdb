As someone who loves scenes chase and was really intrigued by this fascinating true-life story, I was optimistic title in this movie, but too many obstacles got in the way of the good story he should have been. The BAD - I'm a fan of Robert Duvall and many of the characters he plays, but his role here is one dull as an insurance investigator. The dialogue is insipid and beautiful Kathryn Harrold is real garbage. From what I read, there were several directors to replace each other on this movie, and that's too bad. You can say things are wrong with the story. I could not get "involved" with Williams' Cooper's poetry, either. It should have been fascinating, but it was not in this movie. It also kind of a sad comment that a guy committing a crime is some sort of "popular hero," but I admit I'm wound up rooting for the guy, too. <br /> Not everything was disappointing. I can not complain about the scenery, from the forests, green forests in Oregon to the desert in Arizona. <br /> I would like to see this movie re-do and do better, because it's a one-of-a-kind story.
