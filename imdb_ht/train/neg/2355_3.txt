I was almost forever against the inclusion of songs in a movie. My belief was that the quality of the movie would automatically improve if only those very annoying singers would be axed. However, things were quickly after watching that terrible Black (no song) & this movie, many songs. While Black was weak for an extreme, he gave a story that had some strong and good action. The songs were almost incidental and blended in almost the transparency of the movie. There is certainly no woman getting sprayed with water so there is no apparent reason from mysterious fountains while girating wildly in the streets at night. <br /> I was pleasantly surprised with the bold and unabashed approach used by the director. There was no glossing about at anything and almost every scene was completely credible. <br /> I would recommend this movie to Hindi speakers who have at least a slight understanding of Mumbai's life. The former because the English translation was below and there are many errors that, at times, completely reverse the meaning of the current statement. The latter because you will definitely appreciate the accuracy of the diaper once you've lived it yourself. <br /> I would definitely rank this as a worthy job for international recognition. Scenes and gossip drivers were a wonderful touch and served together as a genuine humorous source as well as another perspective on the whole mishmash. The movie falls short in a few places though, where the characters sometimes say the most inexplicable things that are detected from the overall direction of the movie. <br /> I also thought that a couple of the sad scenes did not do very well. It was a fun touch to watch, rather than arousing any feelings of sadness & scene of all trends coming across as a bit crazy. These are minor issues though, because the movie, on the whole, is really a scarce treat. <br /> <br /> In general, it's a cynical, pessimistic outlook and a refreshing one! Actors, not 'heroes' - that's the key. A chance to glimpse human beings beliefs in an extraordinary environment - everyday life. A rear-scene to look at the extent of the disadvantage and a rare ray of hope for American cinema. <br /> <br /> 8/10.
