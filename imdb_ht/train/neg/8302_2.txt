Funny how a studio thinks it can make an end to what was a Christmas Christmas story and an entirely new cast and expect it to float. Be sure to use various actors for Batman, but in that instance Batman was a classic character before any of the actor donned his Cape. In this example you had a classic character in the blonde horn ruling was stuck to wear Ralphy Ralphy who wanted a red ryder bb weapon for Christmas ... somehow we supposed to forget him and accepted another little boy little share that shares no original resemblance .. If I did not know it was an end I would not guess it out of the cast ... except of course Charles Grodin trying hard to imitate Darrin McGavin that you are still remember that the original was far better ... <br> <br /> In the end it might have worked if the movie was best cast. They should have looked to look for a love or simply ignore the original and not try to copy its look and feel. This one is just a cheap imitation. Ralphy has no sympathy just a desire to look like her character to shoot her out or die.
