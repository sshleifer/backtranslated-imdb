Like wearing a hair shirt. Positively, absolutely, without a shadow of a doubt one of the worst movies ever. Most turtle. Zero stars from ten. A long, tiring, worker, firefighter, self-conscious, theater, and dive artsy scene after another. Intend to be dreamy and impressionist, the soul bared, it is, instead, boiling morose. <br /> Half-naked, father and son are crap and whisper to each other love lovers. "Homo-erotic" is the point, loud and clear. OK, so what? <br /> <br /> Repeat more than once by the son is the line, supposedly arise from the "Lives of the Saints," "A loving father a crucified .. A son loves her to be nailed cross. " Parallel to God and His Son, Christ is heavy-handed, irrelevant, and bomb, like everything else here. <br /> <br /> There are some reference points on the theme of Russia's filiality: "Mother and Son" (1997); "The Return" (Andrei Zvyagvatsev, 2003); "Little Odessa" (James Gray, 1994); Turgenev, "Father and Child"; and, of course, Dostoyevsky, "the brothers Karamazov." The English credit indicates the intention of international distribution, meaning that the excuse can not be used by Russians to understand this disruption. This is nowhere near as accomplished or convincing as the latest Sokurov, "Russian Box" (2003). As in her "Mother and Son", a sophisticated equally powerful, some scenes are filmed out of mirrors, but not as interesting. The movie is almost monochromatic, injected at the beginning of beats filters, making it as visually as it is dramatically annoyed. A soft-concentrated haze only adds to the feeling of drugs. <br /> A soundtrack wrapped on, never closed, like a cassette ribbon. An old radio is still playing in the background. Russian romantic romantic swim infinitely like "theme-based Tchaikovsky." The presence of a "designer sound" (Sergei Moshkov) means, of course, that all these are irritating sounds, static radio, noise, deformation, and so are "born." <br /> It's hard to believe someone (Sergei Potepolov) actually writes this thing. It all looks as arbitrary as traffic, as if etc. by boring actors, erupting from anything to ineptitude. <br /> <br /> Modern art has finally succeeded in signifying the stuff without the thing, so that what we see is the idea of ​​the idea, empty as a shell, but not even a shell, merely idea in a shell. Could one require a better definition of decadence?
