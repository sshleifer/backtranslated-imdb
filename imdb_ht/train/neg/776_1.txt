I remember seeing this cartoon when I was 6 or 7. My grandfather picked up the video in it for free at the mall. I remember that he really sucked. The plot had no sense. I hate fox that has become Casper's friends. It was so stupid! Casper calls himself if he could not find a friend. So, what? Get on it! The only good part and I do not want to mean-spirited was when the fox was shot and died in the end. I laughed myself off of payback because this drawing was so tense. The bad news is the fox resurrected and it becomes a ghost. I wish he was dead. I think I gave this video to someone because I hated it. No wonder they were offered free of charge at the mall. If you have a child do not let them look. They will probably agree with me that it sucks.
