This is probably the worst excuse for TV programs since, oh, I do not know, WHAT CAN now? Never reach this ridiculous "serial" series. Even if it's mostly shot by Britney and Kevin themselves, you do not get any good details in their personal life. It's just just stupid, jokey talked to act like garbage. Look, I like Britney's music as much as the next babe, but this show is just the best filler for such a Britney addiction that they would watch her clip hook (yes, that would be an actual episode). Thanksgiving of these was broken, because they were PAINFULLY together. Show this TOXIC!
