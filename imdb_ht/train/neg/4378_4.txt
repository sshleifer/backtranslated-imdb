Give the title and unusual art box, I was ready for just about anything. Perhaps my expectation was forced just a bit high, because I left a little dry. <br /> A movie crew working on a soft-core sex film ends in a strange home when they get lost in the fog and decide the best way to spend the night is sex. Where was not this setting used before? The difference here is the uber-bad nature of the sex. Not allowing to show all the assets (illegal vaccine shots in Japan for a long time, showing that is fogged out) the film tries as hard as it can show the viewer just how abnormally sex can be. <br /> <In the meanwhile, a mud monster (whose origins can not be fathom) show up and begin to kill the men and raped the women ... then kill them. Some of the sights are a little bit, most notably a woman whose intestines pulled from her vagina or another woman spitting out a drop of ... stuff, but otherwise the gor is standard fare .. <br /> <br />> Finally the movie is pulled down to its own design; It's too over-surprising to be a narrow and horrendous picture of working as a flick of sexual films. Means can work, but there is a need for balance. <br /> <br /> 4/10
