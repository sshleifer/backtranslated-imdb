If this series assumes an improvement over Batman - the animated series, I, for one, thinks it fails very strongly. The character drawing is disgusting ... (Catwoman, for example, looks awful ...) But what really annoys me is that he did look Batman like a sort of wimp that just can not care for himself Battle, without the help of two, even three sidekicks. I mean, it is Batman, for God's sake! I know the comic books, I know that Nightwing and Batgirl are supposed to be Batman's ally, besides Robin, but still ... do Batman say he needs help from them ... What he can not handle a few punches? In BTAS, he could face a dozen opponent without any problems ... He became old? Come on ... <br /> <br /> And another thing: I really do not think that Batman would allow a kid like Tim Drake to go into battle that soon, without years of hard training. One, it's irresponsible (and Batman is everything, but irresponsible), and two, it's not what happened in the comics, if we are loyal to them. <br /> <br /> Batman - The animated series has made history, with its animation, its history and its characters ... That really was a legend in Batman. The new Adventures series turns the legend into just another Batman flick.
