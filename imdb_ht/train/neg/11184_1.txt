This is a really awful movie. <br /> I just write this so that some people are looking at it. If I stopped one person from wasting some of the precious life I watched this movie I'm going to be happy. <br /> <br /> Unutterably dull, although since it starred Al Pacino I was misleading to think that at any moment something interesting was going to happen. Then the credits rolled, and I realized I was completely fooled by watching this incredible drivel. <br /> I can not believe that this film is achieved as a score a lot as it has in IMDb (more than 5 stars when I last saw the vote). Are you those who vote ironically? <br /> <br /> Please, please do not watch this movie!
