I really can not think of anything good to say about this movie ... not one thing. The script is a nightmare. The writer blurs the line between chemical and biological features and does not seem to understand the difference. You would think they would at least get a technical adviser. The performance was bad by most of the throw ... although I do not really blame them. The material really feels. The correction was equally bad .. I'll just stop now .. it's all bad 2/10
