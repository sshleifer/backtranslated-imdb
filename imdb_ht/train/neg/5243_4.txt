Make your own mind. Personally I found it as much fun as receiving a spinner pipe from Stevie Wonder. No offense Mr. Wonder. Perhaps it is comedy, but I just found it stupid. Not exactly the first two babysit children choices; Wheeler (Seann William Scott) and Danny (Paul Rudd), from energy seller, to avoid jail time, are ordered by the court to advise two children in a development center led by Gayle Sweeny (Jane Lynch). One of the misfits is Ronnie (Bobb'e J. Thompson), a fifth size and the other is Augie (Christopher Mintz-Plasse), a bashful young man who plays in a medieval fantasy world. Wheeler and Danny desperately try to give their allegations a great deal of life, love and heavy metal. Lynch is hilarious with dry circles analogies. Supports are: Elizabeth Banks, Ken Jeongg, Kerry Kenney-Silver, Amanda Righetti and David Wain.
