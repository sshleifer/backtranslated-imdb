Baldwin was really stooped low to make these movies. The script, the music, just about everything in this movie is a waste of time. <br /> <br /> The FX sounds not real sounds, they stick out too much way (technical gadgets etc.) If they're trying to make a movie about things like this, at least try to get real with it and release them extra blue and bip, because these gadgets do not really sound like loud. Natural sounds such as traces and non-existent, which give it an atmosphere-like atmosphere. Directly seems to be OK for a low budget film (I'm sure it's a low budget output), although it looks fairly common at times. <br /> <br /> Most characters seem blank and fake, they simply have not thrown this movie very well. I would imagine it would have been a better idea to make Baldwin speak some Spanish than making Spanish actors speak English, when we all know that theirs is the most vibrant and lively language, so the performance of the actors can suffer greatly if they use an odd language. I mean, could finally someone realize how stupid it sounds to make international actors speak English and a bad accent? It should have been a long time buried dead film production. Production team ever heard of subtitles? This film again manages to showcase the European police as lazy and corrupt, society as vulnerable and discouraged. I mean if the plot again goes like "The Interpol can not do Jack, so let's call an American to bring down this international union" or whatever. <br /> <br /> Sony photo rugs on the same path as Columbia before it, just producing movies for the hell of it. I would imagine they have some self respect too. Is buyer supposed to buy all room titles just because Sony puts a good thing a few times a year? Maybe they should use the same team as they did Di Que Si - Say I Do. He speaks in Spanish and Pegasus Vega and Santi Millan to perform a decent job to keep the movie afloat. Look and sound better! Come on Sony, wake up, produce less, sell more.
