Yes, the South Star features a very forgettable title tune song by heavily placed crooner Matt Monro. It is very beautiful to establish the tone for this stuffy and rather dull, stunning miscast with George Segal and Ursula Andress as a couple of adventures in search of a great diamond. Adding to Harry Andrews (with a strange accent, no less) chase an ostrich, tons of stock stock of wildlife, and poorly composed and dull photography by Raoul Coutard, and you end up with a quite exploding floating in the forests in Senegal.
