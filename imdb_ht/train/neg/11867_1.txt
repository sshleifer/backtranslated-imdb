I do not think it was possible, but I found film worse than 'melted body'. This movie is really really bad! And what makes it worse is that another Australian movie ... <br /> <br /> Shot on this looks VHS, with a terrific 80's band, it just continues to be worse and worse, which is hard to believe how the beginning is (skinned men hanging up-side-down in a white tomato sauce spray anyone's room?). Why do the accents keep changing? From bad New York to drawl, in English prissy, then pure Aussie! And it's all right! <br /> This movie also claims to have some movie festival on the cover (I believe it was the Film Festival Utah). This has to be a lie because no-one in yourself is right to name this for anything (perhaps the Golden Rasberries but I think it's too bad for that aswell). <br /> <br /> Come on guys! This movie has number 1 on 100 below !!! He had ten times as bad as those films already on there. <br /> Well done the film "movie" in this garbage, to prove there is a reason why not see movie ..... 0/10
