I recently watched Johnny test in an attempt to get humor in it. I failed, horribly. Cartoon Networks usually have a tendency to show their enjoyment by all audiences, but Johnny's test is "entertainment" in the form below. The writing is incredibly predictable, and the gags run are not very gag at all. Kids will love it, and that's about it. Now this is not to say that it's all bad. The original opening theme was actually very catchy, but for some reason they took the skeleton in it and figuratively broke it with a figured aluminum stick. It's a shame, because that's really one of the best things she's going to do for her. Some of the characters might be very interesting, in theory. With a little work, the characters can work well together, but they're too one-dimensional. Then again, this makes it easy for kids to follow. <br /> <br /> The rite is a bit too fast as well. The episodes are too busy, leaving little time for writing intelligent. This is a real shame, because there are many interesting concepts that are shown in carrying out. On the top, however, the fast speed will stop the kids from losing interest, and that's really the whole of the target audience. <br /> <br /> Overall, the show looks pretty good on paper, but just does not succeed in being funny or interesting. This is a show I want to love, but I'm incapable of it. There are only a lot of potential not achieved. Kids will enjoy it, but that's about it.
