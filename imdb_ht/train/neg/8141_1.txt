Watching her live at night makes you wonder, just that's the world of greenlit this crap. A newlywed couple goes sparkle on the bees, get attacked by bat and the husband starts running around in his pajamas attacking various people. And where exactly are they? In the desert, then they are skiing, then they're in a small town that looks like it has nearby hills. The city runs by a sheriff who loves to look and has a personal vendetta against a doctor. The ski hospital runs by a really groovy guy and a beautiful thick whiskers and the wife looks like Mary Tyler Moore or Marilyn Quayle. There is no dramatic tension and the finish will let you fill up with anger. The special effect and makeup of Guru Stan Winston has made the effects of this film. I guess you should start somewhere.
