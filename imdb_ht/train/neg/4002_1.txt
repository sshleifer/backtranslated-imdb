The social comment was way blocked and the mystery itself is built and resolved in a series of implausible coincidences that were entirely incredible. Nothing has changed in Fitz's personal life in the past decade that makes it remotely interesting. <br /> I even had trouble understanding why she complained about staying in Australia as compared to the opportunity to solve mystery that she had in England. Does not it insist on the Australian police? It seems like a very artificial draw point to get him involved in a crime investigation. The latest episodes in the original series were very melodramatic and implausible, sometimes bordered on serenity, and this one picks up that robe rather than returning to the focus of a single series. Tris.
