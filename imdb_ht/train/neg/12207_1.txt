I remember I loved this movie when it came out. I was 12 years old, had a Commodore 64 and liked to play Rambo on it. I was therefore really thrilled when I got to buy this movie really cheap. I put it in my VCR and started up: This movie man is really bad! Sylvester Stallone says as 3 words in the entire movie (except for that terrible sentimental speech at the end), and has the same expression on his face all the way. With this stupid love thing in the middle, it's just so amazingly predictable. I just finished quickly and sent the whole thing and went to exchange the movie for something else.
