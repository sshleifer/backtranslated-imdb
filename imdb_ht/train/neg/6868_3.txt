Ok, admittedly as an Orthodox woman who lives in Boro Park, I'll be doing a bit partial against this movie. However, it seems that Boaz Yakin's single goal of making this movie was orthodox-bashing. With our wigs, modest attire, and separately apart, we are a very easy target already. Yakin never did it past the surface. The result is a film that has more holes than Swiss cheese: 1. Yosi says Sonia loves her more than G-d or parents. Then he deliberately challenges his father's orders that he does not go swimming because of his poor health. 2. Sonia jumps out of his child's bris. Why would a Hasidic woman from Monsey have such a strong reaction? It's hard to believe he never goes to one before. Let's deal with it, even Jewish Reform keeps milliard ceremony nowadays. 3. Was Mendel sleeping during his chesson class? He should meet his wife's passion in bed and avoid kissing him in the street. Especially in the busiest streets of Boro Park! 4. Sonia and Mendel had to be married for more than a year, and just now notice that they were not meant for each other? A little sign - wedding dress does not mean that the girl took the first parent to wear it. Nor will it shunned by the community if the marriage does not work out. 5. If Sonia really wanted to get into the jewelry business that seriously, he did not have to go through his lecherous brother-law. Orthodox female doctor, lawyer, teacher, etc. Sonia has come up with more whiny than sympathetic. Instead of taking control of his life, he sat back home and waited for things to happen, and then complained that he did not like the result. This does not stand up to one's environment; This hangs stereotypes. Frankly, I think he got what he deserved.
