I rated this movie a 1 since the draw is so incredible incredible. Judge for yourself. Be warned, the following will not only give away the scheme, but it will also spoil your appetite for watching the movie. <br /> <br /> A computer virus, designed by a frustrated nerd, sends a code to the TV screen and computer monitors. When the code - in the form of light - enter the eye it can access the 'electrical system' in your body. What it does is to force the body cells into excretion of calcium. In seconds after the patient's infection reaches his neck, developing tunnel vision, his skin turns white in the calcium, after which it falls with his hands and skull crack in a cloud of chalk. <br /> <br /> This virus is very intelligent. When it finds that a blind computer expert tries to demonstrate the code with a Braille production device - which operates by hand - the device is placed on a very high voltage, which causes serious burn injuries to the skin of the expert's head. The virus also attacks against remote control and keyboard ATMs. Fortunately he could stop by sending on the desktop outdated PCs in a rack and wiring the nerd with his back on a broken computer with his foot in some spilled water.
