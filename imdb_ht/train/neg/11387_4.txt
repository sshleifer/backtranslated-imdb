Medellin is a fabulous place to live, work, and study. I had twice, and never heard anything about guerrilla activity, paramilitaries took hostage tourism, or anything in the sort. There is "invisible police," but it is * not * a Big Brother system. There are just police enough to be visible in everyday life, but they do not complicate a person without good reason. The Sierra is an interesting documentary in which the youth he painted in the movie essentially gets its character. The directors of the film carefully skipped out lines drawn among the daily actions of the inhabitants of La Sierra, and when a "character" dies, there are genuine genuine.

The Colombians are waiting for their chances to show the world that the once-torn-torn country now thrives more than ever.
