What a horrible movie. Tomatoes have had a good rating for that too. Do not be fooled by the positive comments; He was not afraid. It was not funny. It was not smart. It will not even keep your attention. I just wasted 2 hours of my life to watch this crap-fest. The computer generated the monster was interesting to see the first time times. After about 15 minutes he has not yet entertained. The dialogue was terrible, must be a translation. Another negative that stood out was the Americans sort. 3 were described and they all lacked character, intelligence, and trial. Now I'm going to write a couple of pad pad this pad since we have 10. The staff in the video store should slip me to bring this headline to the counter.
