In theory, the "Commentary Director" should have worked. Rob Bryden's talent plays Peter DeLane, a former television director telling his experience behind the camera. Among the programs he allegedly worked on was 'Bonanza', 'Flambards', 'The Duchess of Duke Duke', and the 'Bounder'. Its comments are not the least informative, due to its habit of wandering to the point. <br /> But in practice, it fails to disguise. It's a one-jail show, and the joke is not particularly funny. The scripts are completely lacking in understanding, and Bryden fails to convince as an old man. Each time you stick to anything fun to say, which is like every five seconds, it's a lazy laugh. Instead of being amused by DeLane, you want to shoot her. If old man old grike you as hilarious, then this is for you. <br /> It did not help that the mock shows were, with the exceptions of 'Mr & Mrs' and 'Crossroads', rather good. For the joke to work, they needed to be really obnoxious like 'Charlie's Angels', 'OTT', 'Telly Addicts', 'Neighbors', and 'New Faces'. time, so thankfully we save the horror of future editions. Would not it be ironic early if the 'Principal' comments were someday itself the subject of a parody?
