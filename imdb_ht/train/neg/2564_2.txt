When I went to see movies I would stay up and watch it or if I did not like it, I'd go to sleep, but this was crap, I actually got up and walked out! .... This was wrong script and joined together, I hated it. Also, they should not take Brendan Frasier off, he was better. This was not as good as I expected, considering that I really liked George in the jungle 1, and the graphics were not as good as the first one, for example, the bird, and whenever he was crash into a tree. I hope the director of this attention, and his next movies, he needs to reconsider ... terrible! I really would like to give Ursla a good job, as he did the movie refreshing (until I walked out) ... in general I provided this movie a 2 out of 10
