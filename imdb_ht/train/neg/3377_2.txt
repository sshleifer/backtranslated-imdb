The Broadway Music, "A Chorus Line" is arguably the best in music theater. It's about the experiences of people who live for dance; joy to experience, and sacrifice. Each dancer is audition for part of a Broadway chorus line, but from each of them are stories about how life has been brought to dance as a respite. The version version, though, captures none of the passion or beauty of the stage show, and is arguably the worst movie adaptation of a Broadway music, as it is dead and devoid of any dance affection, any. <br /> <br /> The biggest mistake was made to give the director's job to Sir Richard Attenborough, whose direction offered just the right touch and rhythm for "Gandhi." Why would anyone in his right mind ask an epic director to direct a music that takes place in a fairly impartial place? <br /> <br /> Which brings us to the next problem. "A chorus line" takes place on stage in a theater that has no real sex and limited cost change. It's the smallest of Broadway musicals, and its simplicity was its glory. However, this does not translate well into films, and no one really thought it would be. Therefore, the film should take us into the lives of these dancers, and should leave the theater process and audition. The singers could offer songs in other environments and even offered the first ballet, jazz or class pipe flashlight. And they were able to dance Broadway into their living imagination. But there is not one little bit of imagination going to make this movie, just as Attenborough's complete intimacy for dance and the self-portrayal is obvious in the direction of his fever. <br /> <br /> Many scenes are outright awkward as the dancers tell the director's story (Michael Douglas) if he wants to hear them or not. Douglas' character is capricious about choosing whom he has a sympathetic ear, with whom he has no patience. <br /> <br /> While the filmmakers seem to be true to the nature of the play, some heretic changes have been made. Many lovely "Hello Twelve, Good Thirsty, Hey Love" - ​​a number of scenes of smashing that took the dancers back to adolescents - was removed and replaced with obnoxious, "Surprise," a song so badly that it was nominated for an Oscar. Adding ads in crash, "Surprise" simply retold the same story as "Hello, Love" but without the understanding or patio. <br /> <br /> There is no reason to view this film unless you want a lesson in what DO NOT do when transferring a Broadway movie show. If you want to see a movie version of this show, next closest thing to Bob Fosse's sound is "All That Jazz." While Fosse's daughter is in "A chorus line," she is the Fosse who should be involved, as director. He would know what to do with this material, which deserves great respect for that sad effort.
