Incredible. Does he find any dumber than this? Not a chance. The sort of films would be ashamed even Ed Wood, De Palma, and Woo. If the first part of the series had mediocre dialogue and the second one was bad dialogue, then this one has Christian dialogue. Amazing. But this time the story has lowered the dialogue level, too. In spite of acting with the dialogue, I loved the first two films, but "Zero Cube" will surely kill the franchise. The plot absolutely smokes so obviously stems from the pen in a cold-left cold. <br /> <br /> I sometimes wonder if the left ones themselves realize just how anti-democracy and pro-dictatorships are. In this movie are obviously the US target ?? a democracy. Why not target Kore, Iran, Syria, China, Zimbabwe etc. in anti-military cinema? Sure, most of these sites are hardly likely to produce a cube like this anytime soon, but that's around the point. Obviously, the garbage writer like this actually admires these types of diets, whether they are aware of it or not. I would even go as far as saying that anyone who determines US foreign policy attacks all the time, has anti-democratic beliefs in his core. <br /> <br /> Back to the movie: apart from being so far-sought that it is not even funny any more, the film has many obvious maladies. For example, for some reason, the guys who oversee the cube made it temporary and they are oblivious to the pain and sadism that the project entails, yet the one one first than the other suddenly turns against the system! Anyone who has any idea of ​​all about human nature will see right in this idiocy. Or how about this Christian character, one-eyed evil bureaucrat that speaks as if it's a bad Mel Brooks comedy. In fact, as soon as this animal appears the movie loses all the gravity and hence any chance of being interesting: it really becomes a comedy.
