... the only way to describe this movie on topics that should ensure that: scandals, sex, celebrity, power. Kirsten Dunst grins his way into her role as a movie star silent Marion Davies as she thinks she's in "Legally White". The guy who plays William Randolph Hearst releases to the point where you want to reach the screen and slap it. Eddie Izzard is very good, except he's playing Charlie Chaplin, and is over, oh, 125 pounds too heavy for the party? Difficult to believe this hamfisted, uneven wreckage was directed by Peter Bogdanovich, but then again, he did not make a montage movie in, what? 30 years? Sometimes, there's just not coming back.
