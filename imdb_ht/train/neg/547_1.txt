The full movie title is "Waqt: Race Against Time". This is a race no one can ever have, but you can certainly cut off losing margin by not wasting any of your precious "on" this bakvaas. This film was unwieldy and manipulative in a way that made K3G look honest. It tensioned my credulity too far. He was ridiculous stupid in his storyline, and deserved to be his for her. It's not quite as terrible as Baghban or Black, but this movie has nothing to recommend. Stupid, freeware, and a ridiculous performance OTT by Amitji. The central "scheme" is another nasty example of the brutally manipulative propaganda that infests many "family" BW films. If my father, who raised me, with whom I love dear, treat me as Big B did Akshay, I would shoot him myself. Do not say anything in trivializing of terminal disease.
