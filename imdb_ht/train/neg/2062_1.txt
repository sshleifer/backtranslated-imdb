I read all the reviews here after watching this piece of cinemas and it took me at least 2 pages to find out that someone else did not think that this unallny unallny montage was not the humor acute in the 70s they or indeed in any other era! If this is not the most comedy comedy * * I've never seen it going to do until it comes together. Half of the skittles were already made (and infinitely better) by acts such as Monty Python and Woody Allen ... If I wanted to say that a beautiful piece of animation that lasts about 90 seconds is the highlight of this movie it would still not Get close to synthesizing up just how stupid and drivel-escape this waste in 75 minutes is. Comedy Seminal? Only in the world where reverberation really means seeds. Imam scatological? Only in a world where dry is actually poop. Blag pr√©curseur? Only if this does not mean that this is a manual in how not to do comedy. Tits and bums with the odd beaver. Nice ... if you're a pibesan boy and at least a free hand and do not get out that Playboy exists. Give it a break because it was the early 70s? There is no way. Comedian comedies will be back at least ten years before. The only way I could even forgive the movie that they did was if it was at gunpoint. Retro? Diman. Sketches on subtle perverting clowns can cut corners into some circles (and it might actually have been funny) but it just comes as really sad. What kept me going through all the 75 minutes in the whole? Sheer beliefs that they might have saved a really fun crap for the end. I gave the movie a 1 because there was no lower score ... and I can only recommend it to insimni or patient coma ... or maybe those who suffered lockjaw ... jaws would eventually drop open to disbelief .
