Unless the title is supposed to be a bit different from the woman's transformation (the damages! Damage to us). However, if this film was not made-for-TV, it should, so considerably low-budget, included, underacted, and hit every cliche 70's except disco. Nobody likes, and you can neglect what's happening to anyone in this one. Eminently forgive except for bad, bad performance.
