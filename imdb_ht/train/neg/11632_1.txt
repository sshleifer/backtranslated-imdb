I watched this film in a screening screening and I'm glad I did not pay for it. This movie is just disgusting. He is filled with jokes and dick jokes and does not take pride in the action sequences (such as the shootout in "Little Germany"). I did a little list of things I enjoyed in the movie .. and a lot I do not agree at. Dave Foley's penis. 2. jokes are fart. 3. The Poop jokes. 4. The dude was a pussy. 5. By Gary Coleman. 6. The Taliban 7. Again make fun of Bush ... We get it is an IDIOT .. move on. 8. The dude has blond hair. 9. The plot. 10. Kill the Miners 11. Uwe Boll was in it. 12. Most of the cast was just outraged and out there. <br /> Now (some) good ones <br /> <br /> 1. The dude uses a cat as a silent as in the game. 2. Many actions. 3. Crotchy has made a return (with a queen in the Postal Code) 4. Uhm .. I did not have to pay for it. 5. There are a few "efs" moments <br /> <br /> Boll has done it again. He made another scam game of movie adaptation. Kudos for you, Mr Boll. 2/10
