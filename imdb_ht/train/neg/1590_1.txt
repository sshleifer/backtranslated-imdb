HAH! So this is the movie that the "Next Action Stars" came in. Well I'm glad I did not participate and did not win ... <br /> <br /> Is not it funny how one can just look in the first 10 seconds (!) And to make people yourself on a movie? I mean, come on! Just look at these titles! I watched this movie (or part of this "teleplay" since it was produced for TV and we could not bring them to watch it all) an evening while performing my military service and the audience with me 'was typical of the average podge guys who once looked into a set look like Las Vegas just for the girls in the show. so the bar was not really high, the most watched movie of my group was Girl Next Door (and it was not because of the great script; D. but this movie total of originality, acting, scripting, and just about everything else that made a good movie made it very easy to change the Las Vegas Canal (or it was CSI? do not remember ...) without any complaints by the rest of the group. And that is rare (!) For Sky Do not do this movie! If it's on TV, then yes, look at it .. And glimpse on it my conclusion? Well, since Joel Silver has indeed produced some of the best movie action outdoors (Die Hard, Matrix 1, in some names) I can only say that the producers do not give the movie it's quality, they give money to the directors .. And to sell this movie just because it's a Joel Silver movie is just a desperate attempt to hide the obvious flaws of the crew that really does.
