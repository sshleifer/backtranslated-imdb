ORIGIN! Avoid such an epidemic. I would miss this top 10 worst movie ever. Special effects, acting, mood, sound, etc. appear to be done by child care students ... wait, I've seen programs better than that. Open as a soft porn show and a naked woman holes make a shower scene then go bad out there. Good nude scenes, but that's it. Sound and light problems persisted throughout the movie. Sometimes I would swear I could hear roaring in the camera engines. YIKES! I would like to see another movie about this story, but do not different people. This bunch of actors and crews need more acting and making films lessons. Vote 1 out of 10.
