I read John Everingham's story years ago in the Digest Reader, and I remember thinking what a big movie she would do. And it probably would have Michael Landon never got his hand on him. As far as I'm concerned, Landon was one of the worst actors in the world, with his artistic license going on the head, as well as his massacre in the series "Little House" is evidence. The act, for lack of a better word, is the atrophy, sloppy scenario, and there are more close-ups in Landon's chances than they should be allowed. This film reflects Everingham's story as much as "The Little House On Prairie" reflects the books "based" on. It's just another machine to show off hairy Landuns show.
