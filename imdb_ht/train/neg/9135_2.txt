Oh, Sam Mraovich, we know you've tried so hard. This is your great opus, a bright example with the rest of us that you are certainly worth nominating at the Academy of Art Movement and Science Art (as stated on your 1998-era website). Alas, it's best to stay silent and to be thought to be a fool than talking and removing any doubts. And Ben & Arthur, you do just that. <br /> <br /> Seemingly assembled with a lack of instruction or education, the movie scenario guided us toward the real sector with each new scene. It's a crazy excuse in a story that can also be the best movie ally. Starting tepidly, the characters homosexual characters Ben and Arthur try to get married, going so far as they fly across the country to do this, in the shade of Vermont's finest palm trees. But all this posture is simply a lead-in blood. Then more blood, and more and more blood. I mean, must be at least $ 20 in fake without make-up in the final third of this movie. <br /> <br /> The whole movie is a gaffe technique. From the sound of the correction of the music, which includes one note sound sound occurred on a keyboard, it's an amazing that the movie even keeps together on whatever media you see it on. It is such a shame that some decent amateur performances are wasted here. <br /> No problem, Sam. I'm sure you've made five figures on this movie of rental or whatever drive soul soul (like myself) to see this movie. Unfortunately, we do not laugh with you.
