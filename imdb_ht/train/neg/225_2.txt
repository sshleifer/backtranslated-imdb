SPOILER: The young lover, Jed, is being chased by the spinster, Kate (Andie McDowell), because he believes that Jed is having an affair with one of her catty girlfriends. Kate thought she was holding a blatant delicto. Kate launches Jed's shoes out of the door. Each reluctance leaves, and then sits in the middle of the road to wear his shoes on. Then he came running ("breaking", one of the significance of the title) by a truck. And they died. <br /> "Then it gets running over by a truck." Can you imagine a senarist actually submitting a script to this element? Until then, a comedy that intends to be rubbed, but missing any real fizz. Everyone, but Jed is just annoying. Then they killed Jed, and everyone in sad, until the end of the gallows learn to love each other and be supportive, instead of destructive. I give it the 2 ugh.
