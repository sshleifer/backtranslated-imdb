There was not one original idea in this story. Themes have been pulled out of various sources; a few being the ninth gate, at the mouth of madness (another carpenter), and the ring. It even goes as far as featuring the same damn circle glowing from the ring and using it as the namesake film. The band by Cody Carpenter was all out of Suspiria. Hopefully no one will oppose this comment by spewing the word homage around. Yes, I saw that the theater played Argento's Deep Red. Claims a homage should be a cop coming out. This was the bottom-of-barrel. Send gore and "disturbing" imagery to the skin by making a good horror movie. The carpenter knew this. It should fade into obscures or find a time machine.
