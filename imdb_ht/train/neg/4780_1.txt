I think this cartoon is one of the worst cartoons I ever watched. I would recommend this drawing to those under 5. I used to love this show when I was 4 and 5, I still only looked at her when there was nothing over. Now I am 5 and I'd rather do my homework than watching it. The design used to be a bit comical but they were not enough to make me burst out laughing. Now I am older I'm interested in witch shows are not rated. I started looking at Doctor Who (12A), Torchwood (15) and Sarah Jane Adventures (PG). I'm interested in doing things with Doctor Who is not interested in drawing 5 years old. This cartoon did not last long only had 6 seasons, it was canceled because of it was given on viewers but some people said it was because the writers ran out of mind but for most other shows there at least 8 seasons.
