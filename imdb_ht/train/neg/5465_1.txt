This movie has a special place in my heart as the worst movie I've ever seen. It's about as fun as doing hard manual work and stomach cramps. The movie starts out bad (I would miss the first few minutes of the movie a 1/10) and then it gets progressively worse, minutes by minute. The only way to rate it at all would be some kind of negative spiral abyssmal that grows for ninety minutes, minutes long. Unfunny is not a real word but it best describes the humor of this video. Somehow the video managed even to make beautiful, scantily clad women and sex look grotesque and unattractive. This movie is amazingly bad. I would say that it would be best to be close to the TITANIC theme playing on and off with Buscemi's characters from ESCAPE in LA droning in to your ears than to watch this movie. Suites are not nearly as bad. If you have rented a trum film, get Tromeo and Juliette or combat shock. I would like to see 5 Tony infomercials back in the back of CLASS at NUKEM HIGH again. Not finding me wrong, he took some kind of criminal genius to make a movie this horrible and if ever a movie deserves a premium for being awful, this is it.
