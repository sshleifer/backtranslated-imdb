In the case of the fact that some aspiring directors are reading the comments I would like to offer some tips (free!), From the viewer's perspective. If you want to make a serious exotic movie movie, do it. If you want to make a parody of exotic adventure movie, go ahead. DO NOT try to do both at the same time, it does not work. For example, having a "funny rescue" character killed and cut himself with a monkey shaking a tree and dropping a coconut on top of a cannibal just makes you look like you have no IDEA type of movie you wanted do. This one is boring, leaking, cheap, racism .... you get the picture. A couple of smart moments and some glimpses of stripping out of Kathy showers (way too prissy here) are hardly worth your trouble. There is one reason everyone has forgotten about this movie's existence. (* 1/2)
