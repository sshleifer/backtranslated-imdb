THHE2 is fun in that you will laugh much and good and probably say "oh sh * t!" and "get your face off the garbage ditch or mute ** s" or things along the lines but I do not know if it's really worth it - I was very aggressive in the whole and the terrible military characters that do not seem to know first thing about combat. <br /> Yes there was more violence, gore, and a body count above the first one but I'm still debating whether or not to annul out my whole movie about how ridiculous it is (and they are not a ridiculous kind like Alive dead or born). Would be better than watching Aja's rumors for the 5th time. So go for some laugh, or go for some gore, but do not go out to meet it.
