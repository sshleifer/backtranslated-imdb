This, and Immoral Valley, both leave a bad fake to my mouth. It seems to me that Borowczyk is disgusting by sex, and the two films are precautionary stories about what will happen if you have sex. As a movie, it's not very well done - some of the act is really epic bad (like the "Indian" woman and the French accent). The flip-flop phase of the young woman being worried about the wedding being interested (when it seems like it should be the other way around), and sudden realization of the realization of the young secret does not make sense - you do not explained at all. I also did not like how the daughter's relationship with a black man was presented as a sign of her family pervertion or predilection for biology. The central idea, the ideas of this "sexy creature", if desired, living in the woods, could be a foundation for a bad but fun story, but instead is just used as a base for a nasty, gender-negative, play morality.
