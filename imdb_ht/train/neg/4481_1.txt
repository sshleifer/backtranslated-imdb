I was skeptical when I first saw Calvin Kline-esque advertising, but thought I would give it a chance. So I watched it, and all I can say is bleh. This movie was so bad. It's rare that I hate this film very much. Watching this flicker has reminded me of these funny scenes in Altman's "The Player," when the writers pile up their bizarre producers. I would like to know which MTV producer decides that an hour and a half-time music video adaptation in Bronte (but this time Heathcliff is Heath and it's a rock star, and Hindley's name is Hendrix) would be a good idea. /> <br /> Even that might not have been so bad, they have not gotten any other aspect of the film for evil as good as well. The direction must be "you are lonely, clue for me." I laughed loudly throughout the "serious" scenes and was bored throughout the rest. The camera was working hard and repeatedly reminded me that I was watching a bad movie trying noble. My theory is that the sound guy was bored and down to the beach for a few beers and her boom - all I could hear in the half-wave scenes. And in other scenes, I wish this all I could hear. When they talk about sound, what they did to the Sisters in Mercy's song "More" is absolutely invincible, then again, it's inexcusable what they did Bronte. <br /> <br /> On the bright side, there was one entertaining scene - especially the moment when Johnny Whitworth had hit Katherine Heigl's face - and if you can tell me what this scene was doing with the rest of The story is more powerful to you.
