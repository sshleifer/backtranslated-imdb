Who was George C. Scott? George C. Scott was a renowned actor. Practically any movie that he was in is the best for her. Now George has absolutely nothing to do with this film ..., but he once said something describing the movie a T. <br /> I do not remember his exact words, but it basically was says Great Writers Can Delay Actors Bad, But Great Interviewees Can Save Bad Writing. Never has this little observation been faster than in the "all the adventures of Laurel & Hardy: For Love or Dad". The casting of the two leads was absolutely perfect. Bronson Pinchot (Laurel) and Gailard Sartain (Hardy) not only watch the parties, but they perform an exceptionally good job of mimicking the real deal (styling with all). This film should stand as a lasting test of talent. This was said, this movie has fallen flat on its face when it comes to (or guessed it) written. <br /> <br /> Aside from the opening dialogue between Pinchot and Sartain (which was very "in character") and a Gag briefing involving a taxi, this film is a sheer tear to sit down. <br /> <br /> Problem # 1: Excessive time and effort into the conspiracy. <br /> I do not want to know why the mummy wants to kidnap the beautiful British lady. What I want is to see Stan and Ollie (or at least, their stand-ins). Way too much screen has been devoted to explaining the sketch or the non-very funny characters that say draws to turn on. However, even if this movie was all jokes, that would always leave us with ... <br /> <br /> ... Problem # 2: Most of the jokes are what I might call "water-down" slapstick. <br /> What do I mean by "watering down"? In slapstick, a character gets hurt in an exaggerated way for comedic effects (aloud Looney Tunes, 3 Stooges ..., or how about Laurel & Hardy?). In "roll-down" slapstick (as I define it), a character gets tired of hurt or inconvenience, and filmmakers to play that up for comedy effect. <br /> <br /> Perhaps an illustration might help: <br /> <br /> In Looney Tunes, Daffy Duck Shot by Elmer Fudd. This bill falls and puts it on. This is classic slapstick. <br /> In this "gem", Ollie accidentally bumps into some people. They turn, tell him to be careful, and continue on how happy they are. That's not slapstick. It's not funny. It's just ... boring ... and this movie is all about these jokes. It's as though they're this movie's bread and butter. Writers and directors just take these dull moments and act as they are supposed to be funny. Granted, the example I gave is the most extreme case, but I can only cut it a lot slack. <br /> <br /> Long Short Story: The movie just does not work because the script fails to capitalize on the pinchot and Sartain's ability to imitate Stan and Ollie. Instead, the script capitalized on display scheme and blame jokes. Watching this movie is basically looking at two excellent importers who gave no real material to work with. <br /> Not a good movie but an incredible sleeping aid. One miss and stick with the real deal (just as long as you steer clear of "Atoll K" and "Big Make").
