I believe that film wars should try to convey the fear of war, avoiding idealism and respecting some rudimentary military principles. Zvezda barely makes the first. Zvezda being a Russian war film, I was hoping patriotism, sentimentality, poetic pictures, a lush note, slave masters and German villains. What I did not need was the naive non-affairs, the scene of the unrealistic warlike war and the abuse of the syrup of the film in a film that avoids all historical or political references (Stalinis, Nazi, Holocaust) only end of a passing but however insulted in our sense of the endnote history of "liberation of Poland". An opportunity missed as a movie, but not as propaganda apparently.
