A friend told me of John Fante last summer after we entered a conversation about Charles Bukowski. I did not know that Fante was a favorite writer of the Bukowski - an author with corners similar to humor except from an earlier generation. 'Ask the Dust' is the first book my fancy read, and it remains one of my dear novels. The novel was a brilliant piece of writing about a sad, frightening young writer posing himself and the outside world as an overconfident, talented mastery talent who had no idea how to write about the real world experiences he had not none of them. In the novel the protagonist is a virgin, who has no idea how to win the grace of the women she desperately wants to write about in magazines. The story of his rare relationship with Camilla, how he settles for his first sexual experience with a 'injured' admirer, and how he eventually leaves with anything but the story of his failed attempt in love is biting and real no Hollywood touch finishes. Adaptation to the movie remains true in the book for a while but meanders in the cinemas trap of persevering love in racism, illness and death. The heart of this story lies in the fact that Bandini is a jerk and Camilla is f-ing crazy, and love has never been and would never be the real thing, no matter how much one of them wanted to get it in each other. This movie tore out the real meaning of the story out, replacing it with Schlock. I can not believe that the man who wrote Chinatown could read this book and make a movie about it that got it so wrong.
