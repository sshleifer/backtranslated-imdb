When I rented this movie, I was very busy ... But when I saw it, I realized that the film was less (much less) than I expected. The actors were bad (the doctor's wife was one of the worst), the story was so stupid ... she could work for a Disney movie (except for the killers), but this one is not a comedy, she is a ridiculous ruler of stupidity. The title is well selected except for one thing: they could add the movie after the deceased husband! I give it 0 and a half from 5.
