All you need to know about this movie happens in the first five minutes: it looks cool, it has an original solid reflective backdrop in the late-60s period, and all but a couple of its characters can not like . Once you get this message, you can also switch to another movie. Davies's protagonist ignores her lovely girlfriend, one of the few people in her life who cares about her. Then by the time she takes her advice to join her in the real world - instead of living a fantasy movie in which she is the imaginative director - she does not push her aside and picked up with her an actress was idealized beyond reason. A couple of laughs and some thoughtful art directions are things just worth seeing here. The film is also interesting as the documentary of Jason Schwartzman's fall from Mount Rushmore. In Rushmore, Schwartzman's brutality was something to be overcome, but here's just the character's character. Schwartzman's family had clearly landed in this role; here is expected to improve.
