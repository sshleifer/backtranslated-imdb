Approximately three minutes of this stuff I started fast-throwing, sustained only during nidity (why is it that bad movies still include those women looking good?). In ten minutes I did, and wishing I could get my money back from the rental store. People who write these cinemas should be sanctioned by the MPAA. Come on writer - the bad guys still in the car and the bomb activate by removing the good guy's guys! This is how it has been done since the days of the Ottoman Empire! Also, to add insult to injury, the "twist" of the end was so formal, that it could come from any action films written over the past 25 years. Burt Reynolds was good, but she should focus on real movies. <br /> <br /> This movie is just a waste of time - Run away! Run away!
