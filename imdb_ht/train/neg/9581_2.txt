That's the only thing I can be positive to say about this movie. Cleveland is the star, I was there and never saw the city look good. Beautiful river and cities. This film moves forward at a speed that expects you will not notice the lack of real importance of the world. People run around and shoot weapons without any consequences. For example, there is a shot from Rob Lowe's character house - two cars are stolen, and yet the cops do not show up there until later much later in the movie. Kill people to hire never look so implausible. The person who wrote this movie should be on the receiving end of a single balloon movie to lose bullets. Many of the actors in this movie are so much better than that. I checked the movie's date just to make sure it was not written during the strike writers but this was not the case. This film is currently in rotation on the Universal HD Canal - unless you want the drool on Lowe there is no reason to look it.
