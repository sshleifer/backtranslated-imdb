Why? !! This was an unbearable, inspiring and embarrassing movie. The embarrassment from being out of the city where they did it ... Pittsburgh PA! Why did these people make such a BAAAAD movie? <br /> And this movie was originally to be released ... it was more of a romantic comedy ... and nothing ROBO-anything. That all has changed along with Disney's courtesy courtesy. POUKISA ???? A terrible interpretation of this classic character was made. Looking at Matthew Broderick making fun of his own movies was not fun either. Sheesh !!
