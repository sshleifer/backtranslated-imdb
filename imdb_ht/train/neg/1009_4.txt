*** REVISIONS I CAN BE CONTINUED *** I'll make this review brief and sweet. I bought this movie from Best Buy because it sounded interested and had some top actors in it like Kevin Spacey and Morgan Freeman. How bad can it be, right? Well, it's very bad. Justin Timberlake plays Pollack, a wannabe journalist who breaks on a case that can lead to corruption in Edison's police force. LL Cool J is titled, a cop of the force on a special force team called F.R.A.T. (First Response Attack Tactics). He was associated with a "bad cop" named Lazerov (Dylan McDermott). At the opening stage we see Lazerov & titles carrying on some bank robbers, but at night they're busting a couple of guys doing drugs. I do not want to give much away, but things turn bad for guys doing the drugs. Pollack, who works for Ashford (Morgan Freeman) goes to a trial involving Deeds & Lazerov. He suspects bad games and Ashford help, making some investigations ugly. Wallace (Kevin Spacey) is all at F.R.A.T. team joins Ashford to try to bring the crooks to justice. <br /> You can say from the beginning that Freeman and Spacey performances are very subtle. The only one performing a performance is Dylan McDermott. It's a black net in this movie and he's made a believer out of me. LL Cool J is horrible in this movie. He tells each other the same way and shows the wonderful emotion. It was best in movies like Deep Sea Sea & Anyone giving Sunday. The movie starts off with some nice action, but then drag it to the bottom of the movie. The end is far from satisfied. <br /> Do not waste your time with this movie. I put it on eBay this weekend.
