I've heard (and read) lots of good things about Weeds that I was looking forward to getting hooked on another Big Cable Series (like Entourage, Sopranos or Mad Men) but which slowly eroded away with every episode I was looking at Season One. (did not make it past the first six episodes) <br /> <br /> The report was unoriginal, optimally and painted in Black Naked. The dialogue felt compelled, as the writer tries way too hard to be clever and hip. It was a rare moment when I was actually issuing an auditory street. Characters never developed enough for me to care for, being selfish and unappealing. I absolutely had the addition of the brother-in-law (which should have gone far in to catch a Predator) and the removal of Hiddo's daughter Quinn from the cast by sending him to boarding school in Mexico was so Unoriginal and clich√©, I concluded the writers had tested the loyalty viewer. <br /> <br /> Episode after episode I loved the characters less and could not get past many of the technical flaws in the story line. <br /> Add to that I heard that Season Two was not as good, so I lost all motivation to continue to watch this play out. <br /> <br /> If you're a fan of good casting and writing, I suspect this show will be a challenge for you to love, unless of course you are hurled and then all the bets off.
