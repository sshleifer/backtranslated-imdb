I bought this movie about blu-ray because it promises great visual and music. I was also a big fan of a movie similar to ... Baraka. This film is a lot of genres after Baraka, wide angles, very similar shots and cameras take long passage through each shot. Even some of the scenes were identical (street and traffic). While Baraka has told a great story, nature juxtaposition, human environments, spirituality, and horror in the world of an engrossing fashion with great music, this film just jumped from the injection shot that has no history encompassing, mediocre notes music, and then. ... POOF, it ends! I thought they must have some sort of mistake! History of the world? Half the film is Egypt and landscape (looks like Arizona, but I did not bother to check). Seriously, this terrible, rent it if you owe, but do not buy it. The movieers should be ashamed of putting this out.
