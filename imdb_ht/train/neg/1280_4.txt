When I saw the name of this movie, I would always think it was a music. Like the "Harvey Girls." It's not. It is a pudding that has been cooked, striking the kitchen ceiling, and has predicted cutting and cobbling together. There is no music and it's not a piece but quite incredible. <br /> It begins with patriarch James Woods telling the greatest of his three daughters, a toddler who is growing up to be Barbara Stanwyck, that he must keep the family name and home. <br /> We think it will be a historic historical story. And it is, for a while. Then he gets to the story of Stanwyck's cold-hearted fight against lawyer George Brent. Why is he thus dead on his back? Well, why else? As we learned in a strange flashback sequence told by Stanwyck, he once thought he could inherit some money (for his sister as well as himself, of course) not married. He hit on someone he was taken to be a land bumpkin, who was in fact budding lawyers Brent. <br /> <br /> If someone thinks the child they have, a young man at eight or so at the time of the main draw is - well, you know ... They had a quick marriage and during the time Very short was together, she became pregnant. One of her sisters is in love with a painter called Gig Young, who plays by Gig Young. The other sister tries to take her away. Etc., etc. It is a delay, disruption disorder - quite enough to act, but without a little bit of logic or plausibility.
