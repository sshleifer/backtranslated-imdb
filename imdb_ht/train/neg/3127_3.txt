An archaeologist (Casper Van Dien) stumbled upon an ancient, 40-foot mummy, well-preserved underground in the Nevada desert. They are determined to keep this secret and call a Jewish translator to help figure out the story of it. Mummy, as explained at the outset, is the offspring of an angel fallen and is one of the great many that apparently existed in those "days." In order to save his son from a devastating flood that predicted everything to kill, he mummifies his son, buried with several servants for centuries - planning to lift him since then. In our present, the angels are still walking to the earth and the mummy is resurrected and a ceremony is expected to take place. Most of the film is slow, it has to do with a lot of biblical criticisms and a lousy couple, air-punching battles. The mummy is decent looking, but not shown almost enough. It should have more to do with that but it's dragging on such a big deal ... eh. Do not bother.
