NSA, CIA, FBI, FSB and any other snoop agency in the world should watch this movie for information on how to recognize people. (as MST3k commenter says ... "Sanata has the dust on each! Santa's Tentak reach far and wide! There is no hide in the Klaus organization") from telescopes that can span more than millions of kilometers ears that can hear everything. It's amazing that the CIA does not have Santa on the payroll. <br /> <br /> Satan's roadways are hilarious. Pitch ... it is so useless. The cheese factor in this movie is tremendous. Very low budget but so fun to look. I recommend looking at the Mystery Science Theater 3000 version for even laughing. <br /> You even get a laugh at the plague of good kids. <br /> I give this a 1 for quality production and a 10 for pure cheese and fun factor.
