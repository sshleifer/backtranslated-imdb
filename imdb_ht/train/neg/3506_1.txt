I should not be so quick to look at all the good comments and say this would be a good show .. This show is only good if you do not know what "talent" is .. I will not even tell how offensive it (I know it can be offensive to a lot of people) because this does not really hurt me on the show .. What bothered me is that people look at this and think it's funny. makes me feel like our generation gets in stupid and i'm actually scared that it will one day be run by those who watch this garbage .. <br /> <br /> Basically the plot is simple .. On an offensive, self-centered, spoiled woman (Sarah Silvermen) is getting into everyday life .. <br /> So she does not like to make a million times .. In fact almost every joke either made or is racist .. .. <br /> Sarah also loves singing .. i like to hear his voice..which it is .. by the lyrics .. lyrics are weighing ... he loves to sing about a lot of things .. <br /> /> If you like to see a woman c put everyone else down and make th em feel like crap while at the same time farting and saying crap on every race then this show is for you.
