I can not believe that people think this pile of waste was funny. Changing the attempts of humor among wickedness, disgust and misery, 'There is something about Mary' left little reason to stay until the end. Sure, Cameron Diaz is very nice, but that will never have enough to save a movie. Ben Stiller tries hard to work in the plot, and is obviously very talented, but the movie is a loser. <br /> <br /> Not once were any of the credible scenes. The vaccines were seriously timed and poorly framed. Farreley brothers should stay away from doing the movie at all costs. I check IMDB to see what they are working on just to know what to avoid. <br /> <br /> 2/10; The bonus is from one time I smiled. It's not like I am humorous or alone in my opinion. My wife hates her, too. The next day, we saw 'Rush Hour' and laughed ourselves funny. This movie just stunk.
