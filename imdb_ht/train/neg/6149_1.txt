I will spend a few days dedicated to Ron Howard before I swear in her work entirely. Having, unfortunately, faced with Lucas in such a young age, Howard is now caught up in many of Lucas' features. How else do you explain his disaster? Only film is useful, of course, being 'Willow'. Everything else, including this, is too dependent on superficial junk. <br /> <br /> Some people. <br /> It can not even have semi-intelligent focus like Peter Weir. No, poor Howard is so stuck on his knockbergian kind that he will quickly forget. <br /> <br /> Here we have the old adage: "Love conquers all, even diseases." Too bad for Howard that Lynch has already received from all of the more skilled subtext. Heck, even Disney did better than that. Ron even goofs up on the possibilities presented by imagining reality. Howard's Swiss commentary is just awful. Do not even rent the DVD. <br /> <br /> Final Analysis = = Cinematic Dude
