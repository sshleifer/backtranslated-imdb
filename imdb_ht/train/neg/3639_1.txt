This film absorbs from beginning to (especially) to the end. You probably do not get any worse, acting, scenario, photography, camera work, etc .. it's all bad, very, very bad. <br /> But what makes it a 'big' look, it will give you more than enough good laugh. Worse, the better! I really do not have any signs of what ever these people think of doing this movie. A Viking Viking Film? The story is ridiculous goddamn, it's more like a comedy of disguise, such as Mafia, also free but humorous humorous. <br /> <br /> And look out for very very late in the movie ... uhum.
