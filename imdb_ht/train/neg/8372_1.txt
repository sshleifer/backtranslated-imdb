I can catogoricaly with the belief that in all my 51 years on this planet is the worst (filament of the child) movie I've ever seen in my life. <br /> I took my three grand kids to see it and even they had difficulty increasing a smile during the minor minor 90 minutes. The sexual Indians I will leave for another day but they were as taste like the movie. They should pay you to watch it by paying them. It is truly terrible, there is no other way to describe it. Those who made this movie should bring in work to get money from fraudulent pretenses. Apply for my spelling mistakes but I'm upset that it spoils my mom's and my grandson's greetings, Stephen
