The second of the Vacation Series is easily one of the most enjoyable, as Clark Griswold wins a trip for the whole family in Europe. <br /> <br /> The essence, the humor below the belt that worked so well first time around is virtually nonexistent here. This crafty fault lies with Hackerling director, who's obviously nowhere near as a good director as Harold Ramis and a very uninspiring script that has only a handful of decent lines spread. <br /> <br /> The cast does what they can; Chevy Chase injects some forms of life into the procedures, but it's simply not enough with the funny comic Eric is completely wasted in a small role as a very unlucky Englishman. Some potentially hilarious moments have not been played out of all potential and let the viewer mostly aggravate. All European reproductions are only one and almost universally unpopular at all (such as how English are SOOO polite). <br /> <br /> Apart from a few scenes, there's hardly a laugh in the eye and the end turns this one into complete slapstick. But if you're a fan of chevy chase (like myself) the movie is look, but no more than that.
