I just want to start by saying this is the first review of a movie I've done on the net. I felt the need to warn people about this movie because it really is one of the worst films I have ever seen. After reading the interview with the director saying she respects constructive criticisms and so I'm going to try to avoid bashing the movie just for her sake and offers my opinion as to why I found her to be so terrible catastrophic. /> 1. The actors. I know the budget can not be allowed for great thespians but with Nicholson working in the industry for more than ten years surely he knew some at least average actors. Incredibly the lame does with special effects. Once again budgeting obviously interferes with what was originally intended, but after working in making up for many years there really is no excuse. The obvious similarities in hostels. Also, there was not exactly a rip of it sure to try the money to success in ancient films. The only problem was Roth knew where he was going and exactly how to get there ... <br /> 4. The music. Not at all creepy or haunted by even disgusting just plain annoying. Script in general. All dialogues were forced and awful! Also the sub targets on the theater and the guy who come in to save they were as weak as almost as a reflection. Editing. WTF. How jarring, and not in a great way. Nuf said. Seriously I would like to hear the director's thoughts on my post (it's not often his pages on IMDb.) Cause buddy ... what you thought. Surely at some point during either the shooting or correction you realize what a yolu turkey was on your hand ... Sorry, I do not want to be said, but you must have more talent than what I expect your next feature Goodballballs movie or wahtever is better, hopefully practice to progress. But in the meantime, avoid this as the disease. I want my mines back 81 back. (At least I do not pay for watching it.)
