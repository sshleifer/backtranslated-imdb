A family moved into an old house in Japan. But there is a catch it's haunted (BOO press). Oh, did not mean to make you jump. Only a review. Stay back down. Ahem, now any way he haunted by an old samurai who killed his wife & his lover in slow motion. This naturally makes a 3 minute stretch from 7 to 8 or 8 feet. History is surprised. But how bad can you ask? Well it was SO my brain began to melt and flow from my nose to thoughtful gout. It was so bad every time Doug McClure came on the screen I was praying that I had flashback in Ti Wonder (Yes, I know Doug was in "Out of This World" & Not "Little Wonder", but it's pretty much The same damn show, and I can hum "small wonder" the best theme) There are so bad movies that are good. This is not one of those <br /> <br /> where I saw it: extra heat <br /> <br /> My class: F- <br /> <br /> eye candy: Mako Hattori gets topless, Susan George gets 2 love scenes (one naked, one just topless) <br /> <br />
