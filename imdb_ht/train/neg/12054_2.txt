"What happens when you give a homeless man $ 100,000?" As if not asked these questions are somehow morally absorbed in what eventually will happen. The creators of "Reverse of Fortune" try to get their giggling gurgles while antics disguised as some kind of social responsibility experience. They took Ted a homeless man in Pasadena and gave him $ 100,000 to see if he would turn his life around. And then with the most sophisticated pedagogy and guidance, they let him go on his happy way. What are they trying to say? "Money can not buy you happiness?" "Homelessness is homeless because they deserve to be?" Or how about, "Raise someone up - it's more fun to watch it fall from a larger altitude." They took a man who had nothing to lose, gave him something to lose, and then watch his dump it all down the drain. Is this supposed to be fun? They dress this sower with some gloomy music and dramatic camera shots, but in the end it has all the high moral ground in car crash cars - only this time they engineered the car crashes and asked, "What happens when Do you take down a sign stop? "
