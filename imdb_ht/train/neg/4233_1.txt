I could not believe I was spending $ 14.00 on that. The only type of pickup is the outrageous gorilla. The double was worse than any I had ever experienced. It looks like he's fired with a VHS camcorder. I think every pfennig spent on special effects because there was a lot of blood and body parts everywhere. It's one of the worst films I have ever seen, but I must recognize the luxurious gore that was not as disgusting as it could have been because the movie is all so funny and incredible
