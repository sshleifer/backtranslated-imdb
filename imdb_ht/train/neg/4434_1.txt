I rented this movie, thinking it looked like a wonderful historical treasure. What I had was was a piece of pure waste. This film was confusing at most stains, cocoa in almost all stain and obnoxious stains. Miravino's Miraculous presentation of a queen playing a young boy was depressed at best. Ben Kingsley should strip off his knighthood for even considering this movie as one of his projects. Fiona Shaw should definitely stick to Petunia Dursley; At least Harry Potter movies are more fun than things are called a piece of a movie. <br /> <br /> The cinematography looks like some kid college took a class of 101 movies and failed miserably. Almost every stage of the movie will cut up for some sort of effect; The end result of the course was the cheesiest bit of correction I've ever seen. Jay Rodan was almost as agile; Too bad it was like a bad script to work. Rachael Stirling gives her best effort as the almost gullible lady in waiting. In the end, I really want Blockbuster Video gave refund. I'm so happy I did not spend 10 bucks watching this show in the theater. If this made Marivaux play since the 18th century, it made me wonder how many people of the ages had their best masterpieces during this work. If I were there, they would not have heard the play on the snoring. Thanks goodness for the modern convenience of DVD players; You can jump past boring or horrible scenes. Guess that means I only look at the beginning and end!
