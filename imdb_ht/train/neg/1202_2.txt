A dog found in a local nest is tied to Satan and has a waste of puppies, one of them giving a family that just lost their dog before a hit & run. The puppy wants no time to do as Donald Trump and shoot the Mexican housekeeper, how festive. Only the father suspects that this canine is more then it appears, the rest of the family loves the demonic pig. So it's up to the fathers say the day. This late 70's made for television cinema television has little to go for it except a feeling of flaw in nostalgia. When I see that as a kid I found it to be a nail-bitter tension, but reviewing it as an adult I now realize that it's merely lame, boring, and not really quite acted in the least bit. <br /> <Grade: D
