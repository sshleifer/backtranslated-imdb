First, I realized that a "1" rating is supposed to be reserved for the worst of the worst. This film gets in my hands because, as a review points out, it's not bad at a top-notch, over-top-type sort of way that would allow it to have some comic or cult value. He simply misses his mark on every count. ** Possible faults ** The dialogue is completely censored. The continuity is so deliberate it's painful. Daniel just finished talking about his lost love, and his last words flamenco dancers began. The mock-shock of what's in her name (see? I do not even remember the name of her character, let alone the name of the actress forgettable) when her husband (the Baldwin) first told her that her friend is the bad guy. The car and the motorcycle chase made everything right. Vegetable braces go flying. Cars crash into each other. Motorcycle will go down the stairs. People almost hit, but considerably, no one. Oh, that's right ... except for the one guy who was stabbed several times, it is obviously stumbled on the sidewalk and knife wound, and an approaching vehicle did not notice it. Hmmm. <br /> It gets more and more remarkable to me that movies like this can do. There is so much pressure in the movie industry to make money, you would think someone in Hollywood would think of making the movie worth seeing. Now there is a novel idea. <br /> My suggestion: do not see this movie. Do not rent the DVD. Do not watch it on cable. There are many other things you can do that will let you feel more satisfying.
