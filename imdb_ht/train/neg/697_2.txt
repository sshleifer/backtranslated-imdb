Two things are good about this film is it's unknown celebrities. <br /> First, Daphne Zuniga, at her first appearance in a film, youthful and supple, and seems to still cover her body today, steals the very beginning, which is all she is in, and that's what. It is obviously just starting out because he acted improving with his next next. Secondly, the score by then known Christopher Christopher (Chris) Young Composer is what keeps this stinker from getting a single star ... yeah, I know a star more is not much, but in case This movie, it's a lot. The rest is just stupid horror sense of a couple of college students who try to clean out a dormitory that is due to be torn down, getting off one by one by a unsuspecting killer, blah, blah, blah ... we all know where this is going. Watch the first few minutes and Daphne Zuniga, then turn it off.
