Dr. Mordrid is foolish. I would not recommend any adult or child to see it unless they rampaging the murderer already. There are many things in this movie that he hurts me. Speaking of sight, having eyes in the sky, against a series of stars. Only the devil himself could imagine such a cruel thing. I rented out every copy I could from local video stores and broke them with a 5-pound cross. This movie should remain closed in a cave behind the 4th Dimension and all other creatures are lousy in hell. This is where this movie belongs. I suggest you want some scandalous entertainment, go and rent All dogs go to heaven, or angels in the Outfield. Those movies are worth seeing. If you want to commit a sin and love horrible movies, you need to see Dr. Mordrid.
