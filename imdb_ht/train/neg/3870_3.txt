Under the slippery green dance of computer graphics have to shine the surprising art and skill of Ichikawa Somegoro. Alas: he lost all of the goo. The scenes of Old Edo - and the courtsman, drifting on the Sumida, repetition and acting in the Nakamura-za - were all interesting and engaged, taking you back in an exciting and rich era. The action on the Kabuki stage, in which Somegoro excels and excites, was more enriching than any of the absolute high jinks that followed. The skill, the energy of the audience, the colors of their sets, were far more satisfying than all the nonsense that was taken on scheme and performance. What an opportunity to waste! One of the best Kabuki actors is alive and gets lost in the hole.
