I usually like zombie cinema, but this one was just plain bad. <br /> <br /> These good parts: Topless swimming girls and deep thong, Sonya Salomaa's topless, and Ona Grays are silly jiggling in a skimpy head when they run. <br /> <br /> One part of the bad: cut too much video, too much Morris movement slows down (it shooter action), not enough bloody and brave, bad acting, and no history. Only others in the theater were smart and left right after the topless swimming scene. A total dump of $ 6 and time. I give it a 2 out of 10.
