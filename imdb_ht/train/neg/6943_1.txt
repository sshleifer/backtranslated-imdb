This movie is deeply idiotic. A man wants revenge for a crime - but when he enacts his revenge - there is a video camera pointing right to him all the time. Who has a brain cell in his head would sit there and do so for a long time in front of a video camera? <br /> <br /> Just the fact that this script can never happen except with someone able to dress themselves up to destroy it for me - but it got dumber press <br /> I think the script writer writes There are some serious habits for cooking the brain cells and making them draw traces you can drive a battalion of armored tank in a mere man seeking revenge for the death of loved ones, but in the middle of a plot these things Go totally wrong, and then unexpectedly dissolve. <br /> Only those who write this story were not so mute as to write totally unrealistic to draw spins that can never happen in that way. For those writers I say-seek help for your mental disability.
