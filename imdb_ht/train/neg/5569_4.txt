I tried to love this movie, really. In her view, all I can think is, "This guy gave me the ramps, I would have gotten a restrictive order." It also calls CODEPENDENCE in capitalization. Was this really the conversation before making the movie? "Let's make a movie that puts two chronically depressed, socially inept people into a deeper insulation relationship, and encourages them to complain about how bad their lives are!" From what I have seen in life is that the last thing in our world to find attractive to a potential companion is constant self-pity. <br /> <br /> The atmosphere of the movie is distinctly 80-eh; brooding and slow. Do not get me wrong, the movie has its moments, just a few of them.
