Despite positive reviews and exams in international festivals, this film is not for everyone. The story looks very much with other movies, where a young girl in the family of immigrants needs to overcome many common problems of her age, and also fight against the ethnic traditions of her family. He does so by selecting some kind of sport, and with the help of a local boy, which for some reason falls in love with him, he meets his problems and wins. <br /> <br /> In her Girlfight in Boxing, in her bend like Beckham it's soccer, and now she's kung fu. But combat is much inferior to the product than that, it's simply nasty to watch it. Semra Turan, the "actress" who plays the role of a young girl, may be doing many things, but one thing she can not do is to act. His presence on the screen is anemic and clumsy, the dramatic situations, in which he tries to show some emotion, dread, body and facial facial features are amateur actresses, seriously instructed by the director. The remaining cast is a little better, but they just can not save this cliche film with stereotyped characters and deep scheme. In addition to this relatively good movie time there is nothing new or interesting to offer. Even the kung fu battle is not a reason to look at it, it's just boring. The slow motion was really necessary, the choreography was basic and lacked the inspiration, and most of the kung kung scenes are just training or standing in all kinds of kung fu positions, do not actually fight. Not to mention how ridiculous it seems when a small and small thief fights large and muscular boys, and knocks them into the legs. <br /> <br /> The only reason the movie has noticed at all is because it's European. It's very easy to publish this movie - A first martial arts movie from Denmark, but no need to be deceived, it's not. It's just a drama about stupid young girls and its problems, that is, by the way, not really compelling. <br /> <br /> Bad movie with nasty lines, acts and stories.
