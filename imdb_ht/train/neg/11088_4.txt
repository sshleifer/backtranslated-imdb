This is a OK movie but miss any real profound either emotionally or in terms of storytelling. The story is based on real events and this limits the amount of action normally, also there is no real suspension. <br /> <br /> Washington is credible in the lead but it is sleeping in it, there is no scope of flex any muscle to act for it or throw in support. <br /> The story simply dropped a little flat, even having never heard of the title title ending was obvious, but unlike other films about such injustices one has no emotional impact, you do not really care From him, his motivation in people on the outside seems to be more academic than concerned for his well-being. There is an attempt to inject some emotions using the outside boy who hero worships Carter but this looks compelling . <br /> It's an OK movie but immediately forgettable.
