The story is about the life of common people from Antwerp, living their lives. So I told her, and nothing more actually told about the story. The film is fast, like a MTV-flicker, and quite photographs and we feel that the director is talented and should make more movie. So let's forget about this one and hope for the best and next Deus-Barman picture.
