I'm not one of the people who just went online after I saw a movie and decided to call it the worst movie ever to do. If you have doubts, please see my other review. However, for the first time ever, I saw a movie so awful that I wanted to write about how bad it was before it was even over .. <br /> I love bad movies. For me, Ed Wood is a genius, I thought Bloody Killer, Jeepers Creepers and most terrible horror movies were good. However, there is not one good thing I can say about this movie. <br /> <br /> The plot is fundamentally non-existent. If someone reads my review of the money to see it, they can discover for themselves what's the case, but I advise you that a nickel would be worth more than watching this movie. is bad. <br /> <br /> The act is bad. <br /> <br /> Drive the two attractive, but that's all there .. I'm not the kind of spoofing a movie for anyone, but I invite anyone to email me at foxbarking@yahoo.com to ask for my opinion about this movie before garbage a census about it. I will tell you nothing. <br /> I love cinema, and I love horror and I love new movies invented. I even love porn movies like Hostel (which some re-claimers have claimed this was like, but obviously they thought only that Roger Bart was in this and Hostel 2). But this is the number one most worthless and stupid and dumbass movie every day made. <br /> And you neglected this review, this will come from someone who not only sat all the House of the Dead premiere, but actually bought a copy of it.
