- When the local sheriff dies, his wife takes on and is determined to clean up the city. Not everyone in town, however, is happy with what he is doing. When the sheriff orders a city curfew, the local saloon owner (also a woman) hires an assassin to care for the sheriff. There is no way the saloon owner could know that the sheriff and the killer would fall in love. <br /> - Gunslinger is an example of what happens when you have a fairly interesting concept and combine it with poor execution. There's a good movie here somewhere trying to get out. From more capable or with a larger budget, Gunslinger might be a fun look at women's role in the Old West. As it is, Gunslinger is a sloppy mess to a movie. <br /> - There are just so many things wrong with the movie: a support throw that has no ability to act, stilted and unnatural dialogue, and lying that look like lying down. But the biggest offender is the correction. I was amazed at how often a scene would begin with the actors (and horses for that matter) obviously waiting for Corman called "Action". The best is the scene of two horse riders just standing beside a building. All of a sudden, they take off and come racing around the corner as they climb hard for several miles. Or, take the example of people who may seemingly transport themselves to the city. We see a man entering a building and a second later positioned in the city of his horse hill. <br /> - It's not as if Corman did not have a few decent actors to work with them. While there were no big stars, Beverly Garland, John Ireland, and Allison Hayes were all able to turn into a good performance. But in Gunslinger, they do not give them much to work with them. <br /> - I have now seen both the MST3K and non-MST3K versions of the movie. I would recommend going to the MST3K.
