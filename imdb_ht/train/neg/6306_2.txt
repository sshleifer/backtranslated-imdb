Working in a video store I get to see quite a few movies and on occasion I try to watch some of the movies are not so great. Proud was to be one of them. The initial idea of ​​telling in the story of a primarily black crewed boat during WWII was some merit. However in less than 10 minutes of watching the movie you find that the main point in the movie was told about racial tensions in WWII. The hidden story is on the ship, the crew and the exploits of the war. This is the main point of your layer to the point of over all of the movie. I commend the men who served in USS Mason for their triumphs in the face of adversity and the difficulties they endured. They should make a film that focuses on the accomplishments of those people who have done for themselves, the marine and for their country and have not made a film that focuses on racism during WWII.
