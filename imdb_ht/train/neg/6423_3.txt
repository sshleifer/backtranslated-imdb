The first 30 minutes in Tinseltown had my finger teetering on the remote, looking flick around to look something else. The first of two writers, down on the chances, living in a self-made-space bar "bin" was mildly fun, but painfully averse. The introduction of the character, played by Joe Pantoliano - guy in film movie, who lives in the park and sleeps in a bathroom, offers hope and I decided to give it a few more minutes. Then a few more until Christ Swansons introduced as a budding film director & Nymphomaniac brordlin, added a bit of spice. Performance solid performance has increased its presence above and beyond just a very welcome eye-candy inclusion. Finally, obviously low-budget impact on the movie and ill scene shot, stuttured pace and slapstick touches certain moments. Some of my favorite movies at all times were budgeted, Whithnail & I being one that also deals with 2 guys with a dream, but down on the odds. <br /> However, for my money, the actors saved Tinseltown from the "terrible movie" archives and just about nudges it's "could be a cult movie" archive. I laughed loudly at some of the scenes involving Joe Pantoliano's character. In particular, the penultimate scenes of the Clich√©d Fortress, but are still comic, rich-but-vice-up home characters, where the story unfolds towards its final moments. <br /> I can see how Tinseltown was a big scene of playing and while the movie-makers did better to translate this celuloid, it simply did not work and while I laughed loudly at some of the scenes with a Covered Materio, I think the first 30 minutes dulled my senses and these expectations a degree I would laugh at anything. <br /> <br /> Unless you're stuck for a gift coffee coaster, do not pick this up if you see it in a bargain bargain.
