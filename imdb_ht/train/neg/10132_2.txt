STAR RATING: Saturday night **** Friday night *** Friday morning ** Sunday night * Monday morning <br /> <br /> The American military has just launched a new new discretionary fighter which can evade detection unlike any other. A rebel pilot (Steve Touissant) steals and plots to make the US government ransom. So they are forced to send in the best John Sands people (Seagal, who else?) To stop him, in exchange for his freedom from a detention center where his idea to be wiped into all information of the prescriptions he learned over the years. <br /> I had to skip force attacks because I could say in the cover and the problem of production that occurred that it would crap and when all the negative reviews were low and low user rating was pouring into it just confirm what I thought . But I decided to give FOF a go because Shadow Man (not the same director) was not bad, and, to hell, Seagal was my favorite action star once and perhaps just maybe he could make a movie great again. Oh, what a fool I was. <br /> <br /> Dubbing, sturdy stock trees in airplane discretion planes, terrible camera work, cheap production value, risky, compelling competitor scene that became Seagal's trademark with a boring, sleeping induced non-sketch go anywhere. <br /> <br /> Fortunately his next movie, Once upon a time in the Hood (which I'll skip), apparently marks the end of his deal with Sony, meaning no more of these Horrible film movie European action and his next film Prince of Pistol could mark a return to theater. Hell, he did it before and Stallone will have to manage to do it before him (Rocky Balboa.) <br /> This is not a robbery. It's not even a flight of pleasure. It's a robbery that even fails to take off the ground. *
