There is only one big moment in the survival of Christmas * that almost makes it worth the pain: James Gandolfini cracks on the stupid head of Ben Affleck. The movie serves as another unfortunate example of James Gandolfini to prove that a great actor is also joined to his career by acting in this movie. <br /> <br /> Young and rich execution, Drew Latham (Ben Affleck) was inculcated in believing that one should never be alone on Christmas. (And, from the outset, the problem is hiding and our suspicions of disbelief in this idiotic movie: how many people in Drew's social standing, in 2004, really care for one or the other whether Christmas is spending alone or with half the family or with a whore fifty dollars?) Storyline finds Drew buying in a family to spend Christmas and, under the condition that pretend to be his own, skeptics ignore all the controversy clues His money was not buying the emotions he was looking for For $ 250,000, a driver truck driver, Tom Valco (James Gandolfini), and his clumsy wife, Christine (Catherine O'Hara), agreed to be Drew's ad hoc family , against protests in the hands of the son, Brian (a very one-dimensional Josh Zuckerman) and daughter, Alicia (a very soft-focused Christina Applegate). Drew then spends the rest of the film allegedly recapturing his or her youth - something. The following messages in this movie are as tristed and logical as its dry-silent storyline. She was filled with bra psychosis, Drew imported a fake smile on her face and eyes blindly kept in denial of every denial that she supposedly purchased the Valco family to avoid. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> If Drew pays these people to recapture some of the joy of family happiness, how psychotic must it be to pretend happiness among the barbs and mental concerns about his presence? Not a case in the Valco family hides their true feelings and pretends to be happy while around Drew - three of the four members make it patented clearly to despise him. Is it so unbelievable that he can not see that his money by buying him the "family" atmosphere he had inculcated in believing was a truth in the first place? As with all this movie, one wonderful as * four * screenwriters can possibly get so tangled into their own narcissistic dreams appear in a credit sequence that they will neglect any semblance of plausibility, or intelligence. Director Mike Mitchell, who was responsible for * Deuce Bigalow: Gigolo Male * - stopped the right. 'Nuff said. Gandolfini and O'Hara somehow managed to shine, proving mettle amongst this mess. Christina Applegate is willowy with cutesy and blonde and fire in all the right places, scathingly off Drew's little band of corpses for most of the movie, then making an over-face and falling in love with her because the script tell her. br> <br /> And I would not go so far as to say that Affleck is a bad actor, but Jan Schneider looks best at his shoulder. There's a new level of desperately looking for talent in town.
