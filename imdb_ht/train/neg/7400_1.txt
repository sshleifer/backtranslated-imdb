I've seen some pretty bad movies, and this is just up there. No scheme to speak is like one of these bad comic episodes on a soap opera. I just wanted to smack the girl because, well let's just say, it's real suspicion all the way through the movie. The monsters run around putting some bling was funny. I also saw a bit of Silent Hill in the. And I read that this was done by, with or staring a Finnish metal band, Lordi. So it's not surprising that it did not make much sense. It seems they are a machine for promoting bandwidth and nothing more. FX are very good, look at the movie, the monsters, and even the act is also good. But the story and the saying of it, just are not there.
