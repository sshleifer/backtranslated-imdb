I watched this because I thought they were going to have a lot of cars chases and gawk's cool cars. Guess I was lying. This movie is very boring. <br /> <br /> The movie starts out Kip Rainy (Giovanni Ribisi) sits out a Porsche dealer check to see if they have the right car. When it's confirmed it is the right one, Kip gets a brick out of the trunk and chucks him in the window, breaking it. He becomes the Porsche while his friends become the keys. They start the car and take off the night. Delivered in a deposit only being followed by the police. So the crews all equipment all the cars and go way apart. Then we get a glimpse of Memphis rain. She is giving a little talk to a bunch of children in a go-kart track. Then it is confronted by Atlee Jackson (Will Patton). Atlee tells Memphis that his brother Kip is in great * blow *. Memphis is known as one of the most notorious cars in Los Angeles. Memphis heads in a junkyard and meets Raymond Calitri (Christopher Ecclesten). This guy threatens to kill Kip if Memphis does not deliver 50 cars in 72 hours. There are some issues with this movie: <br /> <br /> 1.Story: The first 48-in-film hours take place when Cage and Duvall are looking for a crew and planning everything out. The last 12 hours of film are a waste! <br /> <br /> 2. Cars: You see perhaps 10 cars out of the 50 as the movie movie. So where are the other 40 cars? Why not find them? <br /> <br /> 3. The chase: The chase at the end of the movie was a joke. He was not suspended at all. <br /> 4. Dogs: Somewhere in the movie, the dog eats the burgers and swallows three keys as well. This is impossible. The keys were flipped open. The keys would have substantially damaged the esophageal dog, stomach, and intestine. The guys suggested giving the dog laxatives to help him feather it out. This will not work. The dog will get a lot of diarrhea but no key. He stated in Jackass after Ryan Dunne stuck a toy car up his rectum. Take laxative, many diarrhea, but there is no car. Even with the dog. <br /> The couple during the hunt: When Eleanor breaks for a few minutes, Nicholas Cage tries to desperately try to start the car. You see a police cruise behind him who does not look at his car at all. But right when Nicholas Cage starts the engine again, the police officer jerks itself right, sees the car, and immediately starts chasing him. It is stupid. So right when he heard the engine start and saw the car, he knew what the car he was looking for. How does he know he's the right car? It only sees back to it. <br /> <br /> Overall, the movie is boring. There is no action. There are many cars. The movie is stupid. I never saw the original but I planned. <br /> I give this movie 1 star from 10. Get the fast and fury instead.
