I consider Stuart Bliss the worst movie I've ever seen. The act was terrible and the funny plot. I found the fact that the main character's wife left him triggering a mental breakdown, but he got so funny and boring, after a while I was able to care less about any of the characters. The movie keeps going on and on the same ideas without anything cool or surprising to add to the plot. The whole thing and the Geiger counter was too much after a while after Stuart started opening his wall to see what was behind him after the counter indicated something was there. Then there were scenes of repetitive and flyer, and people are confusing where it meets itself. <br /> <br /> I should have guessed that this movie was a flop when I did not recognize any of the actors. Make yourself a favor when this movie comes and read a book! You will be better.
