Before watching "Dahmer," I thought that no movie would be worse than "Freddy Got Fingered." I was guilty. The sum of "Dahmer" rose, it is a story about a gay serial killer that features nearly no killing and almost entirely consists of Dahmer's encounters with gay men before they died. There is no draw to be found, and it serves no reason as far as telling us anything about "Dahmer." All that you will learn about Dahmer from watching this movie is that he likes sex with men. Terrible act, horrible direct, horrible writing, terrible things ... If you have to choose between watching "Dahmer" and vomiting for three hours, go with vomiting .... it will be less painful. .
