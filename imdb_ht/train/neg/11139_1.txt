There is not much to say about this movie, it is horrible. <br /> <br /> Acting with dialogue is way far decent way, the story of the Hybrid Werewolf is not very well explained and everything has holes drawn here and there. <br /> <br /> CGI is something you would not like to see. She is so amateur that she made me vomit. <br /> <br /> The only good thing about the DVD was in the extract. Gag bobine a. Everything else, just waste time and money. I hope anybody will buy this, this is not even worth renting. <br /> <br /> Just stay away from this.
