The real irony is this: Joe Besser was a tooth comedy, in other situations away from the Stooges. It has a definite track record of being very funny and smart. Moe and Larry and Shemp were actually known to her or at least for her many years and love her work. So, what about Earth was going on when it joined the troop as the "third stooge"? Obviously, there is nothing. In most of these late "Stooge" era shorts, more often than not, the boys are riding against each other or Joe against each other and this is not accurate to Stooge. "One for All, All For One, Everybody For Himself," in Curly quote from "Restless Knights". One thing about a good comedy team, Laurel & Hardy, Abbott & Costello, the Marx brothers, does not matter how much they try to take advantage of each other or slap each other around, when the chips are actually down, they stick together and come in each other's help. In this particular, none of this happens. It's almost like watching a dog fight as one tries to cheat others or to be mean and embarrassing, and not for comedy effect either. One might assume that there was something behind the scenes going on here, art imitate life. Perhaps there really was this why Besser did not stay very long with Moe and Larry. Just look at the story of other teams and tell me I'm wrong.
