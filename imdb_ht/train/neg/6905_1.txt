Polynesian men of the men drink, fight and make a stream of sexist, stupid and enfunny. Polynesians real life is more funnier than these stereotypes, carton characters. Supposedly the Samoan girl did not watch or act Samoan at all, seemed more like the white girl's stock having gender and anyone on a whim. With weak as water story lines you can not say anything about the act - even the most brilliant actor can do nothing with this script. It's sad to see the Polynesian actors want to play these sad stereotypes in a movie that is not a single good scene, and only two or three 'jokes'. What a waste of money Kiwi 'taxpayers, what a lost opportunity to make a big movie on a vibrant community. It's best not to make movies if they're as bad and mindless like this.
