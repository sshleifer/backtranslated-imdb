I do not like this movie, but then I did not think much of the book either that, although there was so much applause as a "masterpiece", I found lack of character development and disjointed with the logic of conspiracy, although it was far more readable than the frightening first fancy "Road to Los Angeles" was not published until Fante became fashionable in the mid 80s. <br /> I was intrigued to see what sort of soup soup would have been with these lean ingredients. He worked hard script-wise to repair the many shortcomings in the book, but for money I did not save it. There was never a movie in Asking the dust while ever trying to loyal to the book. I consider this insane city madness. <br /> In a word: forgettable.
