Man, I was disappointed. <br /> 1) Adam Arkin is more whiny than Ross Geller from 'Friends' <br /> 2) A great cast wasted (Kenneth Mars, Alan Arkin, Ed McMahon, Pat Morita, Louis Nye) and this romantic script . <br /> 3) The film suffers from terrible rhythms. It jumps around across through a mumbled, confusing way. <br /> 4) The story does not even make sense. Why does he want to break the football track? What about the violent stupid music? None of it is explained. <br /> 5) It's not funny. It's like a bunch of accountants trying to make improvements, saying, "Look at me! Look at me I'm funny!" This was a bad attempt to make another "love of first bite". <br /> I love Larry Cohen movies, but her man has failed here. I could not wait for the rolling credits. Horrible shame.
