... But this issue is that it is very far from a good music. <br /> <br /> Granted, one can not always expect the witty masters like Sondheim or Bernstein or Porter; Again the music of this piece makes Andrew Lloyd Webber look witty. It's very dangerous and uninventive (with one or two exceptions) and just after I watch it I could not remember one important tune - which is rather tragic coming from someone who has learned all of another Hundreds the three listeners. <br /> It is also unusual un-theater. It takes place on an incredibly large stage (one really has to feel sorry for those people in the front row that broke their neck in order to see something happening 50 meters to the right or 100 meters on the left ) and does absolutely nothing to her. When there's supposed to sing one person on stage, just what you get - and the rest of the enormeous stage is empty. For me as an aspirant theater director it was almost painful to look. The reality remains, Cole Porter seems to capture French culture in his work better than those whose talent can never come near. And I'm believed by the popularity of this ta-ka-legend music.
