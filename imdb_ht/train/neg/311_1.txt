I just finished watching Going further. I must say that we should send all copies of this movie to Iraq and make them look. I even tried to find a blind woman to look at this and turn it around in like 20 min. Adam Sandler could not get a better project than that? As for the writing, if what you want to call it, the guardians should be forced to watch this movie forever in hell !! I believe that somewhere I read that the budget for this movie was $ 10,000 and was way below. Did Wallmart find a good thing about that? Each store has a big big this crap sitting on the sales floor. The only good thing about this movie is you can use the DVD as a coaster, or trade it into a friend, but then they might not be your friends anymore !!
