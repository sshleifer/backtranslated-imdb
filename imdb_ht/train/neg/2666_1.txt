Honestly, if someone has a brain, there is no 1 positive thing <br /> tell about this movie ever. <br /> I lost $ 1 this lease. I would rather laugh at Will Smith saying "If you got a dream, you got to protect it." <br /> <br /> All actors must have been bored or had no fame at the time. even Matthew Mc Conahay * however you spell it * was the best then all the actors in this movie when he played a psychic in Texas Chainsaw 4. If you see this movie, and have nothing good to say , or IQ, to be extremely low, and the bad taste of movies, it hurts me. Thank you ... and the truth, who spoke! <br /> Save yourself from the misery. <br /> <br /> Find the Devil's regime, now this is a classic.
