I must admit that His body more actually was not as bad as I expected, my mom wanted to see it, so I rent it. I figured just go ahead and see the horror in front of my eyes, but actually this was not too bad. I just waited for this horrible film, but it seems like the writers mean no harm, but the casting of Eva Longoria (Parker, sorry), it looks a little bit of series for the movie. I think I can get it to be a little better without it, just it annoy me. But Paul Rudd and Lake Bell had a decent chemistry that made the film somewhat likable. But you have to admit, there was no point in this movie, it was one of those quick checks for the actor's style of stuff. The movie had been funnier if someone really paid attention to it and had a better cast. Henry just lost his bride to be, Kate, who was killed by an ice sculpture on their wedding day. But when her sister took her to a psychic, Ashley, Henry dropped to her, but Kate was haunting her from the grave. Kate is jealous and does not want Henry to move swiftly and will ensure that Ashley does not get him by torturing her day and night and rambles her, believe me, and Kate's voice, that's awesome. <br /> On her dead body is a movie audience, not sure if she's worth the money, but I would give her a lecture for you if you want to see it or be curious. Eva Longoria just does not have enough power to the stars to do the movie work, there is no offense to those who love it, it just belongs to the tiny screen on the silver screen. Not to mention the character of Ashley, it seems still not too uncomfortable with everything he pulls, or his "gay" friend, Dan, just yet, not really likable. Just with some re-writing and proper attention, this movie could be best, but instead we find the average predictable romantic comedy that will leave with an empty sentiment.
