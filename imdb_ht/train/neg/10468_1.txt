I did not know what to expect in the movie. Well, now I know. This was a really awful movie. The scripts, directing and acting were equally bad. The story was funny and stupid. The director made a smart movie and thought to induce, but he did not. I dropped to my place for the last half of the movie because it was so bad. Where was the movie focused? Where was anything in this movie? Christians should boycott this movie instead of encouraging it. It was chabili to do with a waste of my money. Do not see this movie.
