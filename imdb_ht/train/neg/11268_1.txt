I was hoping that this movie would do at least look. The plot was weak to say the least. I was expecting a lot more to consider the line to throw up (I wonder if any of them will include this on their CVs?). At least I did not pay her rent. The best part of the film is definitely Dani Behr, but the rest of the film is complete and speaks PANTS.
