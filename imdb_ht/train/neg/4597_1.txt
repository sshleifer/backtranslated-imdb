Having endured this correct movie I'll admit that it's a more modern story in the story than previous versions. But it is so inaccurate and has done so politically correct that it made me angry after watching it. Davy Crockett was very poorly represented by Billy Bob, who I thought would probably have been best cast like Sam Houston to provide both boys love in oratory. I think the self-absorbed Dennis Quaid (a current Texan) would have a perfect crocket and would definitely eat in his sense of hunger in self-worship. As a Texan and a true believer in the Texas attitude I feel Davy Crockett was the Excellence Texent though not born here. Our official motto is "It's not braggin 'if it's a reality" made for Crockett. And the last scene in the Alamo where Crockett is the last survivor to be the greatest riot Davy Crockett has ever done. For even saying that this giant of a man and seasoned fighter would allow himself to be taken alive is ridiculous. Three different accounts of eye witness put her dead in the middle of a dozen or more dead Mexican dead after unsafe violence but in combat. Finally, the lunar ending of the film supposedly described the Battle of San Jacinto as a mutual battle of 600 Texicans vs. 700 Mexican soldiers when there were actually nearly 1,500 well-formed Mexican regulars. Every Texas school child who pays attention to the first-class Texas class knows the fight taken by the Mexican Army by surprise during the time of the Siesta and the Mexican army were so confused they could not fix rows and fled as they were not trained to fight but hand border borders.
