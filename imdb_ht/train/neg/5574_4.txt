"Godzilla vs King Ghidora" is a perfect example of how a great idea can be lost by domestic subjects like pseudo-patriotism. Here, travelers in the future try to break Japan, replacing Godzilla in local heroes and monster puppies, three-headed Dragon King Gold Ghidora. They failed, however and at the end of Godzilla battle Ghidora. The battle between the two behemoths is very cool, but the plot of the film is full of holes and the whole thing about "Japan is great" is really stupid. The creators of this film were not even threatened with respect to the enemies of Japan, which are stupid gentlemen gentlemen, who are easily outsmarted by the smart Japanese. The good thing is that at the end of Godzilla and King Ghidorah almost destroyed both Japan and it's ridiculous enemies in one (actually two) spectacular combat. But until this reign of battle, the film was really dull and pathetic.
