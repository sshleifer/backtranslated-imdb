1940. - A visit to Ghetto Lodz in Nazi occupying Poland, was recorded by a German cameraman and co-operation of Jews in the Jewish community, combined with archival footage, clips from international newsreels, and extract of cultural-related films displays the Jewish World as fraudsters and parasites. This documentary interprets Jewish life in traditional anti-Semitism and Nazi ideology. A frank, sinema-unique expression of hatred hatred. I personally get this awesome and very offensive movie. One can only hope that these pictures like this will never happen to the screen again.
