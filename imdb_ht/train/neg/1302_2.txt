This movie is just like any other Dutch movie, so if you enjoy movies such as turkey fruits and little blond dood. Then you might be okay with this one (though these two have better stories and actors) Zomerhitte starts strong enough, but even that a good scene ends up having nothing to do with the storyline. There's a lot of stripping (but I and others just could not find that attractive girl), the dialogue is ridiculous (as we did a lot of other people's watchful films), and some of the scenes, is to be completely random that this is more of an involuntary comedy than anything else (such as a random scene in which an owl kicks someone in sight ... it has nothing to do with anything and is only once referenced later in a sentence saying "you've heard what happened ... I was there"). The only reason I gave her a 2 is because some of the places are in look beautiful ... that's it. And the reason I saw it was because we went to the sneak preview (here in Holland we have a strange system regarding sneaking forecasts, you pay less money then for a regular movie and you do not know what movie it is that you will look all you know is that it's a new movie that is not yet in the theaters). My advice is to stay far away from this movie, if you really want to see a good Dutch movie watching temmink or blackbook.
