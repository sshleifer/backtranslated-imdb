Watching this last night he surprised me that Fox spent so much money on it and got a little back on their investment. It is the type of disaster that should be seen to be believed. <br /> I'm sure the first morning of filming Raquel Welch lures in the rack on his stack to prepare a place for the Academy award he would surely have for this movie original soundtrack. Oops. That's not what happened. <br /> <br /> The infighting of the detailed series was printed by Rex Reed and this helped the film to attain a reputation before it was even released. When he finally released was not the usual three circus ring in advertising. If I note correctly, in Houston it's open to drive-ins and theater in neighborhoods and never played any of the great venues. <br /> I lay most of the blame on director Michael Sarne, who was hot after he led (not all that good) JOANNA, a movie and music on young people to swing London modes. <br /> <br /> If I remember correctly, Fox wound up his shot and piecing the movie together the best they could. That's why scenes play out there in no particular sequence and characters appear and then disappear. An impressive impressive cast (Kathleen Freeman, Jim Backus, John Carradine, Andy Devine and others) are wasting nothing to do. <br /> <br /> To expand it in length featuring many clips of Fox movies featuring stars like Carmen Miranda (of amazing footage of GANG's all here) and Laurel and Hardy, who never dreamed they should play in an X rated movie. X rating is due to the occurrence of many sexual perversions; However, none of the characters seem to be having any fun. Maybe someone involved with the movie had a Purit Puritan sensitivity and calculated that if they could do things unappealing it was not bad to exploit them. This was one of the "fast" photos that nearly bankrupt Hollywood in the 1970s. A jarring spouse that EASY Rider (made to change pocket) was the most expensive movie ever to do because many films followed and tried the worst way of copying its success. Sixtyish, once honoring directors such as Stanley Kramer and Otto Preminger, made movies such as RPM and SKIDOO in an effort to attract a young audience. White directors and writers tried to make their films attracted a black audience. Those movies are closed somewhere in a vault with two named and many others in this genre never, as best I know, came from your home video or cable. They are deep secret studios. <br /> <br /> Raquel Welch's performance in this is, everything is considered, very good. With the right direction and script she could have played the kind of sassy free woman Rosiland Russel and Barbara Stanwyck specialized in. It looks great and has awesome costumes. Mae West is the legendary sixty-actress actress I've ever seen. On one hand it's kind of heartbreaking to look at his attempts to take his glory off years away, but I'm sure he needs the money. <br /> <br /> If you want to see a big budget X-rated movie in this era check out BEYOND VALLEY OF THE DOLLS (also in Fox) because it does not take it seriously. It's crazy kids play with the equipment in a larger studio. MYRA BRECKINRIDGE tries to say something. There was just no one who wanted to listen.
