The Sentinel represents all about soul sorrow in Hollywood and the lack of sadness in imagination present in many cinemas these days. I can not possibly think of one good thing about it, it's all these generic, so factories made and so lazy assembled that it really only exists as a infomercial on how to make money from them unsuspecting, undeserving the public . /> A plot on a Secret Agent service plan to assassin the Prez might be quite fun. If it is occupied by a good director or a caretaker who cares. Douglas is one of those framed. Basinger is Lady First, with whom he had an affair (a unprecedented, unlikely scheme solved). Sutherland is the best friend who believes he's guilty because there would be no movie if he did not. And Longoria is nothing. A woman with a chance of Maybelline and ... that's it. I guess there are fewer requirements for women when entering the secret service. As usual in a movie like this role in Prez itself is nothing more than a tool, a sign and very seriously written. <br /> <br /> Clark Johnson, who gave us the same as SWAT back in 2003, mechanical direction miss any kind of signature and has all the complicated visuals of a cheap TV movie. Douglas, Basinger and Sutherland look incredibly bored and phone-to performances from far. Eva Longoria, the most sub-exposed woman in the 21st Century, is basically only in this attracted to the Desperate Housewives audience. Its role is 100% gratuitous and it absolutely nothing more draws or adds to character development. It barely has 2 lines rubbed together. A really cynical marketing scheme. <br /> <br /> If you are a glutton for punishment then do not let me stop you. But it is time and money you will not get back.
