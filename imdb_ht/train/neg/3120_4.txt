I did not really expect much of the "cost of night" and I actually never heard of it until I saw the cover of the videostore. However, the film is very effective when it comes to building suspension and tension. On occasion it draws a little, but it actually helps keep you wondering what will happen and most importantly: when. As the movie progresses, the character playing by Robin Williams gets dragged into some kind of "cat and mouse" game at the point where it gets obsessed with finding out the truth and existence of a 14 year old abusive abuse that no-one The only one seemed to have ever seen. The night reader is an interesting story, which is great to build the suspension of the movie, and you're pretty much caught in the dark who is lying down with what is real. However, in the end it kind of disappears and does not live up to the potential it may have had. It does not really give you a detailed or possible explanation of the other main character, which would have been helpful and interesting.
