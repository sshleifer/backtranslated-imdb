The Power Rangers are definitely the worst and completely ridiculous television gameplay TV show in the history of the United States. <br /> There is absolutely nothing even remotely entertaining on this horrible TV show. <br /> <This is simply the worst ever show, and awful actors, dressing up in multi-colored teamwork that look completely ridiculous. The owners of this show should shame themselves, since there is no value to deserve this nonsense. <br /> <br /> Kids of today should try to look better like show story games instead of this garbage.
