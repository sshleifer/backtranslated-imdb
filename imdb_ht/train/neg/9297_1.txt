I gave this 1. There are so many twists that you can never make sure you're rooting for. Total Mayhem. Everyone dies or almost so. I'm tired of cross hair and change views. I can not give the draw away. Complete with crazy. If I had paid to see what I would ask for my money back. I wish the reviews were more honest.
