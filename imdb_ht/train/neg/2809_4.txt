When I look back to my college at the University of Ohio, there will always be one event in which I will remember with fond memories. Channel 23 is your local access channel and until the last few years, very beautifully played anything they have sent. This included many DIY cinema ranging from a marshmallow marching guys guy and then scanning the photos online, in a Macbeth version of the 8th grade that apparently just learned how to do squibs. <br /> However, the king, in my opinion, in the channel 23 lineup was Midnight Skater. The first time I watched it was around 2am. I should study. Or sleep. Or watch regular TVs. But no, all that is for pussies. My roommate and I looked at night skater, and when it was filled, I did not think one of us believed that any of the movie was just happen. But be sure, it was about a few nights later, and we were to come to attack that this movie did, in fact, exists. <br /> I was able to go over and over as horrible as it is, but it's the terrible sort of living worth living. The plot is disjointed, horrendous, all the souls of scars, but not God, if others are watching with you, its impossible not to have a good time watching it. It's sort of like the first time you hear "Hardiness" by Chuck Pahalniuk. You hear it, you are lousy and shaken, but five minutes later, all you want and desire is to make someone else experience the horror to throw you just endure. <br /> <br /> Long story short, Midnight Skater, for all its epic fairytale, to make for some fun late nightlife. More, I desperately want the theme skater theme. Kudos gives the person who wrote it and sang it. The sweet God I love this song.
