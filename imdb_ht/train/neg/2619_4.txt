It is a good movie for kids who love dogs. It runs a little slower early but ends if a flurry of gooped up De City. The basic draw is the same as the first movie. The bright coast of the adult movie is the bird talking that thinks it is a dog. The bird speaks like a human (Eric Idle of Monty Python) and barking like a dog. It is the comedy that the movie needs the most. Watch her in the matinee so you do not have to pay full cost or wait for it to appear on Disney.
