Greatly re-modified and often confusing, the original screen version of Fire Man was at least ten years from the date when it was done and the past years did not make it any better. This is the kind of movie that producers with too much money and too little experience to get attention and everyone else just does pay their outstanding foods or drug dealers, and Scott Glenn's barking guards will come out on a member of his 12 - year rescue -The elder load, the daughter kidnapped in a wealthy Italian family. An exciting cast - Joe Pesci, Brooke Adams, Danny Aiello, Jonathan Pryce - are all doing well, the action is sluggish and rarely and only notes John Scott's exceptionally good (part of which turned into the latest coil in Hard Hard ) to make a positive impression. A case where the rumor (performed by Tony Scott, the original choice of directors for this version) is an improvement.
