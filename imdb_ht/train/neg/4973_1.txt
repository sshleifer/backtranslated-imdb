I stopped five minutes when Beowulf was given a double-shot, automatic and sparse robot. Not only do crossbows have seldom telescoping, but Beowulf defeats Grendel in hand-to-hand combat. Terrible, wild acting and eternal darkness that plagues all Sci-Fi original movies did not help either. Having only a few minutes a minute before I felt upset my anger and decided to watch I love Lucy reruns instead, that's really about everything I have to say. But you might as well just realize that it's a movie-made-for-TV movie and jumping it right there. <br /> A travesti.
