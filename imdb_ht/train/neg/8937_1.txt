Generally I love horror movies, but unfortunately this has dropped out of the bin bin bargain books from my friends. We sat down to look, ready to be scared and finished spitting food everywhere we were laughing. The concept is not that bad, but why they decide the ten numbers in the series would have luck I do not know. The worst thing about the movie is the actors. Working in the camera was poor, the special effects are actually not bad if I was generous, but in general the story failed to connect to any level because the actors were efficient as a little bit of ELM seriously. They were wooden than measurements, especially a young foppish actor who was fifteen years old too young to be taken seriously as any kind of government agent. He looked more like a public school boy in reality. There was a really fun sex scene where she looked like she was bobbing for apples as a busty lady got up on her head, and later her vice sized size was hysterical, but then I remember she was not supposed a comedy. I desperately wracking my brain to find something positive to say about this movie apart from the occasional flash of breasts, but there simply is not. Let's hope that ten had the lucky number and did not make another, I'm not sure the ribs I could take it.
