This should be worth a "O" rating, or even a negative one. I watched this show for ages, and the show flying sharks around around the series 7. This episode, however, is the evidence that the flying shark was. It's written is lazy, absurd, self-indulgent and not even worthy of garbage like Beavis and Butthead. <br /> It is quite possible to be ridiculous and still fun - Pirates of the Caribbean, the father, Count of Monte Cristo - all "fun" movies that are not to be taken seriously. However, there are things like ridiculous as in "this is the worst thing I've ever seen." And indeed, this is the worst episode of Stargate I've ever seen. It's absolutely obnoxious, and this comes from someone with a stargate in her basement. Make me want to sell all of my stargate accessory, most seriously.
