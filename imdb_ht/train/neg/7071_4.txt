Then the film was released in 1997 'special effects', as they were, were poor. They would have been dating even for the 1980s, and even some films made in the 1970s and 1960s had the same or better SFX work. Certainly no-one involved in the production of this movie was looking for an Oscar. It's a wild departure from Fred Olen Ray's normal stuff, most of which have the word "bikini" in the title (bikini pirates, bikini ranges gear, bikini girl from the planet Lost, etc.) and they are little more than T & A flicks, but here we are with a movie rated "U" and aiming outright in the kiddies. You've got for her credit for diversification !! This was a minor hit-to-video clip that later resulted in a couple ending - Invisible Mom 2 and Invisible Dad. Dee Wallace-Stone (whose career has gone down soon after 1982s "ET) plays the 'Invisible Mom' in the movie title and would return to the end .. Russ Tamblyn (whose careers have been in free fall even since The "West Side Story" 1961s) plays Dr. Woorter's Weaver's probably just to say that most of the cast was at the point of their careers where they should prepare to work on almost anything just to pay the monthly bills - except perhaps young Trenton Knight as Josh.Li instead say though that although he worked before this film, this actor kids did not work again after the end, "Invisible Mom 2" .. Maybe the movie was cursed .. After all, it was not that bad in this movie .. For a child actor, it is very good - no better or worse than any of its most experienced stars. <br /> <br /> As mentioned above, the "invisibility" effects are Naff to say at least, the direction is poor, the obvious writing and nothing acted in writing at home. There are so many movie films out there though, and for any mo to under the age of about ten, this movie will not doubt be well looked. Most adults will probably want to make an act disappear from their own while it is about to, and I would not blame them one bit!
