I'm not sure how related, but I'm almost sure that Lost and Delirious is a remake of this movie (or the story that's based on). Very similar to plotline, and even some of the scenes and sets seem to be very, very similar. Lost & Delirious is actually a better movie, so see that one instead. <br /> <br /> This one moves very slowly but was a sequel to French movie movie, that's what should be expected in the style. Told in a retrospective from the perspective of one of the girls reviewed school. Correcting in the flashbacks and the current scenes is a bit confusing at first, especially since the audio comes from every double (ie, recaptured hearing while seeing the present and vice versa). Also, the "girls" are a bit old to think of a boarding school. Finally, not many development characters even get you attached to the movie.
