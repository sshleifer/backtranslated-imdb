Do not waste your time with this movie. This is a total phase in terms of acting, directing, sound editing, banding ... There was such a garbage of performance by some of the very good actors. The film does not justify Paresh Rawal who is perhaps one of the most talented actors in Bollywood. Akshay Kumar who is also an emerging star did well a poor job. John Abraham, what is wrong with it? Is that what you call acting? I mean he should thank God that he has a nice face otherwise he should have Razzie award in India if there were any such awards in Bollywood. Asrani a great talent, but too much of it as before. <br /> <br /> Screenplay that does not mention a rip-off from the Boeing Boeing 1965 was quite seriously framed. First of all, people in Bollywood just can not do something original. On top of them they do not even know how to copy well. The jokes of the film were so late, it became painful to sit down in them. Priyadarshan may have a star in the south, but it's just not fit to make a decent Hindi movie. Sound correction is amazingly crazy. I can go on and on this matter, but the bottom line is that Bollywood should be ashamed of doing such a movie. The worst part is that some people seemed to like this movie. What is wrong with you guys? This is the reason why Bollywood is where it is. Did you know that Bollywood is doing more movies than Hollywood every year, however, most of the movies are strange in abroad, because of movies like this one. I am an American and I'm absolutely disappointed in Bollywood for producing this piece of thrash. Movies like Dil Chahta Hai and Lagaan were just terrific. They are world class films that are timeless ... among the best of this decade. Garam Masala, however, is perhaps one of the worst of this century. Period. <br /> I give it a 1 out of 10.
