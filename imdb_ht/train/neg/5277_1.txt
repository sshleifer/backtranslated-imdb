I kept this on the movie tonight and was amazed by how a movie with such an interesting site might wind up being unbelievably awful. WHO DIDDI? star Brandon Davis as a high school high school Chris Hughes, a geek who inherited the heir to a porn empire left by his biological parents. Even though the award sounds like the movie might be a lot of fun, it is lost by inept directly to the first time director Andy Fickman, a sophisticated and predictable keyboardist and actor who is even malicious by direct-to-video standards. Even the normally Charlie Talbert's turn turns into a surprisingly dismal performance as the best friend. Ali Landry is the only good part of this luncheon and unfunny drug. 1/10
