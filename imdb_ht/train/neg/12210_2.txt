This movie is a joke and must be one of Stallone's worst movies ever made. This is a typical 80s movie where you have one person to destroy the whole army alone. "The first Pt 2" is very similar to the "Schwarzenegger" bomber, but there you have Arnold kill the terrorist while you have a specific nation shown as the bad guys. This film is a typical American anti-Soviet propaganda. True, this was the peak of the Cold War, but I'm sick because I have Communists or Nazis still show up their enemies. There are many American films that have something in common. Why can not there be a movie that shows Americans as the enemy? Who will believe that one soldier soldier will destroy the whole army? Do you really think that something like this would really happen? Not looking at it, an average, brain wash Indian viewer certainly would.
