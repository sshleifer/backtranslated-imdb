This rip off of 1984 hit the "Gremlins" is probably possibly the biggest railway train in a movie ever made. Even for a movie 'B', all other horror movie movies on the same platform completely dwarf this film in terms of plot, act, and goodness. <br /> It starts with a random old security guard and younger safety security guard whose name is not important. Why? Because a few minutes in the movie she walked into the safe 'banned', and she died while living out her fantasy was a rock star in a cheap pub. This is just an appetite for the auto-filled main course. The main character, KEVIN, various liver writings prove herself as more than a total pussy. Perhaps it succeeds in the movie, but at the audience it proves itself as nothing more than a bad actor. Kevin gets himself a job with the old security guards, and is guided by his security change in the (wait for it) to abandon a lot of studios. Yes why you harness a set when you can just use the studio itself. Return to the movie. Kevin somehow opens the banned save and releases the Hobgoblins. People are forced to huggoblins to live out the heated fantasy and then kill them for some reason. Must be returned before sunrise or other ... or else? Exactly. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />! Kevin's manipulative and AMY's 'reserved' girlfriend, whose deep desire is apparently to be a seriously described cher looks-like with fishnet costume and a pair of grandma grandma on top. Do not ask me how that works. Well possibly the most fun character of all is KYLE. How these groups of friends made is up for questions. Kyle is a perverted creep that can not go an hour without self-interest. His pacifiers include sex-chat lines from other people's homes and most likely sniffing underwear. <br /> The story unfolds as the hero research for the Hobgoblins: knee-high animals (aka hand puppets) which, for some reason, try to travel no more than the borders of the neighborhood. Each of the characters eventually live out their fantasy fantasy that has never done anything and it has millions of dollars ... or the film has a huge budget. <br /> <br /> AVAILABLE AVAILABILITY: The Twist End This movie will let the surgeon ask "What?" Hobgoblins are back in the safe by ... their own free will. Perhaps they have lost patience waiting for the overthrow of ravages, or maybe the story-writer was the critique of the writer and decided not to worry about the end. Returning to the safe, the old security guard reveals "what he learned from the military" and explosive detonators that destroyed the safe, signaling the end of the evil oblooblin and the end of this coaster roller coaster ride; best equipped at a ride on a escalator. <br /> <br /> The absolute thing in this movie is enough to send someone to tears. If you plan to look at it, I recommend a few alcoholic beverages in advance to take any serious consideration of the film from yourself.
