A group we watched this movie was really disgusting. We wanted to forgive the fact that our favorite character Jo was not over (it's not like the writers / producers could do anything about that). The word was poor, the script was subtle. What really annoys us: 1. When the guys realized they were both Natalie's date, they did not just let them wear with that stupid (and finally degraded) contest - but only because of meso compete guys, It's not because they really wanted Natalie. 2. Although they can not choose between the two men before the reunion, Natalie suddenly decided that she really liked one of the guys and is now ready to marry her? (and there was no prediction that he was really a better guy, it's as though the writers fluttered a coin and then just spit it out at some point in the movie). 3. Blair makes a point of talking about how she does not want the kids and then all of a sudden when her husband says she wants to have children, she gains agree with her.
