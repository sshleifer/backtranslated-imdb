Munchies start from deeper Peru (looks more like a dirt road) where archaeologists Simon Watterman (Harvey Korman) and his son Paul (Charles Stratton) are in an expedition. Simon thinks that ancient Aztec buildings were in fact center control lyecraft & he is on a mission to find evidence that alien lifeforms visited Earth, while at once such structure discovered a strange creature that he sticks to his backpack, & take back home with her in the Sweetwater American town of California. Simon feels that the animal is the evidence he's looking for & for some reason inexplicable decided to leave the thing at home while he's going to share his discovery. Simon asked Paul and his wife Cindy (Nadine Van der Velde) to take care of her. Meanwhile, Simon's brother and fast-food businessman Cecil Watterman (Harvey Korman again) steals the animal for his brothers will not make any money out of it, but his idiotic dude (Jon Stafford) has a fight with read & chops it with a knife, but the individual parties grow back to separate animals that continue to cause many havoc in the townspeople ... <br /> <br /> Directed by Bettina Hirsch has to be one of the worst combat ever, if not the worst. The script by Lance Smith is so unfunny it's painful. Each joke of munchies misses the target by the thousand proverbs, I doubt the humor of this piece of crap would even appeal to pre-adolescents. There is just nothing remotely funny or even fun in Munchies as far as I'm concerned. The basic story is crap too, they just reached this beast running around with no explanation of what it is, why no-one ever saw it before, how did he manage to learn English so quickly and how to read it learn driving etc. Everything is a Gremlins big (1984) rip-off and none of the elements that made that movie so good. The character is unhurried, the Stupid Deputy (Charlie Phillips) and his father (Hardy Rawls), Cecil brings a nasty and soft fake peach and head Melvis himself (Alix Elias) & more besides. They just plainly embarrassed and ridiculous, I challenged anyone to find any of this funny rancid trash. Basically Munchies failed spectacularly to either a comedy or horror and end up being, yes you guessed it, crap. <br /> <br /> Director Hirsch was obviously working with a low budget here & it shows, everything takes place in two homes, the desert, some caves & a miniature golf course. This is really cheap & incompetent film-making. Special effects on the munchies themselves are really awful, the dolls just with no movement unless someone in cameras pulls a string attached to his arm. I can not stress how bad the effects, these things would not convince my 4 year old nephew (as it proves me & yesterday to her!). Total incompetence all the way, this film absorbs. <br /> <br /> Technically the movie is terrible, bad effects, design blame design, garbage set & well, just the frog everything. The act is rotten in & around, from the Korman cops with two roles in which proves that it can not act & it's not funny. <br /> <br /> Munchies are a really bad movie that fails in everything that it tries to achieve, make sure to look it if you want me will not stop you but just do not tell you have not been warned! My advice should look Gremlins again instead, but the decision is for you!
