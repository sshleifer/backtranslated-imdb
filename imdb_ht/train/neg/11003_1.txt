How do I start? This film is probably one of the worst films I've ever seen .It has no kind of quality deliverance .I just sat down in this movie and it was a struggle. It failed to find even one smile on face I find it hard to believe anyone would distribute this terrible movie. I felt that this film was a failed attempt in unpleasant humor. The only thing that was worth anything on this movie was the soundtrack, I'm pretty sure the reason I wanted to see this movie in the first place. I'll wrap this up as I'll try and forget the time I just wasted this piece of crap. I'll leave you this warning. Do not watch this video, it's successful.
