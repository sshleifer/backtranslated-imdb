An excellent performance by Alix Elias emphasizes another mis-led and confused bat. I saw this film, perhaps 12 times, with each run in, I get less and less fun. Why are so lustful munchies? Does this ever explain? Are they a reflection of ourselves, animal head 'boorish'? If, why not make it clearer? Why not retreat back just a touch of intricacies that filmed this film, and make this explicit connection? Another part of this film that disturbs me in no end - motorcycles. The little jacket monster wears on the front cover seems to suggest 'street-wise' traveler. The sun glasses say 'very cool dude.' With all this I'm ready for easy riders to meet the Muppets. All that I find is Munchies (1987). What gives? Wood in the Gremlins series if you are a fan of diminutive, wise-cracked, puppet reptile - it will give you the treatment you deserve.
