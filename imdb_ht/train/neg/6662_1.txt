* Spoilers and extreme bashing lay ahead * <br /> <br /> And then show first started, I found it tolerable and fun. Enough Oddparents were the kind of cartoon that children and adults liked. He also had high ratings along with SpongeBob. But he began to fall because of this crap that Butch Hartman and his team pushed into the show. The first, humor toilet is not all that funny. You can easily pull a laugh out of a little kiddie with a burp, but that's pretty much the only audience that would laugh at such a nodding joke. Next, there are kiddie jokes. LOL we can see people in panties and we can see cross-dresses. LOLOLOL !!! I just can not stop laughing at Bliss like gay! Somebody helps me! But of course, this show would not sweat bad if it was not for stereotypes. Did you see how the team showed Australians? They have seen them as nothing but kangaroo-like, boomerang-sent apes that live in a hot desert. But now ... Does the coup de favor to why this show really sucks the loudspeaker of them all ... OVER-USED JOKES !!! The show constantly pulls up the same jokes (the majority of them were unfunny) think it is like the bigger thing ever! Cosmo is mostly one of the blame. I hated how to keep on mentioning "Super Toilet" (which also had a mix of humor kiddish in it just as well) and cosmo would wild out. And who can forget that mute is burning jokes that all parents of Dimmsdale would use in one episode episode? You know, one of which every single parent (subconscious other parents said) would pronounce exactly the same phrase before breaking into their kid's room? Yes, it can be first class humor for some people, but it's s *** other. <br /> If I do not mistaken, I believe Menchy Hartman said something about the end of the show. Thank you God! Everyone around my area says it's, like, the Nickelodeon droll ever. I just can not agree with it ?? I think it's just another pig in the pig that we find on our cartoon daily, just worse.
