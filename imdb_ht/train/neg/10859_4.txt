This is another of the many B movie miniseries attained as the movie noir in the hope of generating some interest in something devoid of it. All aspects of the movie - script, act, direction - are mediocre. Acting by the three driving is wooden. I guess John Dall was hoping to go to the movie business but then someone realized he had a little talent and therefore ended up doing TV work. Lee J Cobb who is usually terrific can not climb above the poor script and the poor direction. Jane Wyatt is supposed to be a fatal femdom but nowhere near to convince the viewers. The film has two of the seemingly unlucky cars I've ever seen, one of which John Dall goes after Lee J Cobb is particularly unusual. The DVD transfer is typical Alpha.
