I saw the movie last night and I really wanted to like it. My expectations for the film went up and down since I heard he had done. Some days I would see something spectacular and some days I would be disappointed. But they were the kind of fan of me, I had high hopes for this movie but in the end I was sorely disappointed. <br /> While I love the Donner Richard movies I did not like their nature sometimes campy or the changes made to Superman's characters and power. <br /> <br /> Singer however chose to take the worst component of Donner movies and put them in his version. While Lex Luthor is a little darker she still has nothing more than a shyster, as well as a common criminal. It's no more intelligent than when Gene Hackman played it. Kevin Spacey does his best to play Luthor well but finally he falls victim to written essay and unremarkable dialogue. <br /> <br /> Its Henchmen have more than two dimensions than even funny henchmen books. Most of them literally have no dialogue in the movie. <br /> <br /> **** SPOILERS AHEAD **** Kitty Kowalski is almost exactly the same character as Ms. Tesmacher. It seems to be like evil and cold as Lex Luthor but it proves to be just a dissolved underling after seeing Superman in trouble and quite predictably betraying Luthor. The biggest desire of the film was Frank Langella as Perry White. I was not a big fan of White's perry in movies at Donner but at least he had a soul. It was after all said and done, a veteran reporter who cared about the truth and a good story. Perry White Langella is nothing but a corporate stooge. He wants everyone to focus on the stories related to the deal because they sell papers even though all other papers are doing the same. He does not care about the real stories, the real mysteries like the black out and what Lex Luthor is up to now that he's out of prison. <br /> <br /> The worst thing about Langella is that it is DULL! Some actors can be quiet and mild and yet have a undercurrent that lets you know that water is still running deep. Frank Langella is cold winter. <br /> <br /> Brandon Routh is not a bad actor. It is OK but yet there is not a single line of the entire movie. Do not blame the actor. Its movement is clearly meant to look gracefully, as even the slightest movement of his finger effects the way it flies. But it always looks choreography and artificial. Lois Lane while seriously writing was surprisingly well-off by Kate Bosworth. Unfortunately, again, for a journalist and writer Pulitzer writer, it is about as easy talk as any teens on Creek Dawson. James Marsden was my favorite actor in the movie, especially because it looks more like Superman than even Routh. Without all his powerful power managed to figure out Lois Lane's message, flying an airplane in the place, gets on board the Luthor's yacht and delivers Lois and his son. <br /> <br /> The moment is moving in the movie is when all gadgets are trapped as it is flooding with water and the boat is going down. You see them slowly going into the water. You know the Superman will come by the last time to rescue them but still you can not help but feel sorry for them. As I said before the plot is very haphazard. Unlike Singer said, this is not a movie about a superhero returning and trying to find his place in the world. As soon as he returns the world gets him back with open arms. Lois is the only one who is not happy to see him back. Even Luthor is happy to have Superman back because he gives him a chance to settle the score with the man in steel. <br /> <br /> Superman are shown to be probably one of the dumbest heroes of the universe. A great piece of greenery stolen from a museum, Lex Luthor is out of jail, he now has knowledge of Superman's power and weakness, and yet he still can not connect the points enough to know Luthor should use cryptonite against it. <br /> <br /> According to the movie only the superman is good for getting up really, things are really heavy. The sequences of actions are all incredibly predictable.
