Your attitudes toward Prom Night II will determine how much joy you take away from the movie. If you are waiting for a horrific pride, look elsewhere. If you love cinemas movies that are rather fun to look unfold, you'll love this. Lisa Schrage has time in her life playing on top of Marie Lou and Wendy Loyd Schrage's rage perfectly during her "owning" time. <br /> Not classic movies but a fun way to kill a couple of hours with a finishing end. <br /> <br />
