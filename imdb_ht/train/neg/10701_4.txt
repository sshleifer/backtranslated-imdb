Merry madcaps in London stage a treasure hunt, and one young woman inadvertently set up her father to marry politicians with a strong, independent lady-Flier who has never been in love. Intriguing early car for Katharine Hepburn, playing an aviator Amelia Earhart-like was too self-involved to give himself to anyone. The director (Dorothy Arzner) and senarist (Zoe Akins, adapting to Gilbert Frankau's book) was obviously assigned to this project to get the point of view, but why all the old clich√©s kept intact like frozen affairs ? Billie Burke plays the kind of simplicity, woman's wife who takes her to bed when things go wrong, and Hepburn's final scene is another bummer. A curious associate, but not a classic for Kate-Watcher. ** from ****
