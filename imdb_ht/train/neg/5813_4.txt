Tierney to a hard guy guy, but this movie bothers from virtually competent RKO kilbak his impact at every turn. The script is about as compelling as OJ Simpson at a dinner dinner ceremony. Just counting once more Tierney's beloved companion machine swallows an excuse to blame after another for his evacuating and violent acts. The old lookout on her "only happens in the movies" applies here in shades. Then there's the guy playing the Watchman, who seems to have to wander from a comedy comedy WC Fields, ruining the ominous mood of the process. One-bedroom static sets do not help either, and the obvious Feist director's feel for the material. Then add a final chase machine that misses both imagination and pay-off, and the results are very flat. In fact, the movie only chooses at the station-house scene where hard-wet cops discover the hidden capabilities of innocent-looking future gas stations. Too much Tieney's career is never really frozen. I picked up what had to be largely being like a big guy hard off cutting off like on and getting in one scratching sand after another. Its ice-cold and clear-cut emotion reminds me of Lee Marvin's hard-guy liver better. Anyway, this project might work as a radio play, but as a movie with a promising noir title, it's a disappointment.
