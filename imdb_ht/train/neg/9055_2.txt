Being a fan of Billy Bob Thornton, with the diversity of his skills, I noticed this movie listed, and was surprised I had not heard of it. <br /> I would travel more than usual during both periods he filmed in 2000, and when he hit the theater more than 2-1 / 2 years later (which passage of time is the first sign all was not well with the output ). <br /> Now Patrick Swayze can not act for apple back, but Thornton has more than enough ability to make-up for the difference between them. And Charlize Theron is a person who would be a pleasure to see, even though he showed his dry paintings. <br /> <br /> In order to be curious, I check out the product information of this site. He made a whopping $ 600 per screen weekend screen, with just over $ 400 each, after his monthly theater runs in 2002. Overall, $ 261K, which I would doubt could cover Throw and crew the crew and feed for a week on which the story is beautiful benign, and even the use of the usually interesting localization of Reno is as dull as the rest of the go-on. <br /> It's something like several SNL bits all pieced together, not individually too big at all, and the overall presentation is even worse. Regardless, the costs for this production have to be considerable - though all worked for less than the usual fees - so one thing that made it a barely tolerable opus was the quality of the filming and Billy Bob is present (albeit a little bit logical here, compared to his normal work. <br /> <br /> Think of the three superb, totally diverse characters he described in "Sling Blade," "bandits" and "Bad Santa," and you know he has accomplished this work as a standard, long before the viewers had the opportunity to confirm that. One star for him, even here, with one because production was pure Well, say, the typical "life" flicker.
