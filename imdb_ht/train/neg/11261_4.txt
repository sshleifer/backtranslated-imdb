To begin with, I have to point out the fact that you're going to feel completely lost for more than half an hour. Yeah, some things happen, but you do not know why or for that. When you finally figure out things out you just realize that it's nothing, but a tight soda opera, dealing with mature prostitutes, dead mothers, illegitimate sons ... Characters are rather poor and the actors ( especially the young ones) do not help that much to look credible. Only Marisa Paredes stands out, but she is a superb actress, no matter if the movie is pure garbage. The only positive thing to say about "Fr√≠o Sol De Invierno" is that beginners Pablo Malo seem to have good intentions, and has filmed a couple of well-intense scenes ... Well , maybe the next time ... <br /> <br /> * my rate: 4/10
