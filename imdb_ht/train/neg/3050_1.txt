Just when I thought I would end up a whole year without giving a single movie a "bomb" rating, a friend brought this notorious torture to my home last night. I feared the worst of her reputation, and she was like God-terrible as I would anticipate. This is a Mexican disaster that has occurred, embraced in English, and produced by K. Gordon Murray. It has been terrible and painful, and features a rather frightening Santa that does not operate in the North Pole, but instead of a cloud of outer space, and no small elves help him make his game, but rather all different groups of children from virtually every country has. The opening sequence, where St Nick chuckles happy as she observes monitors showing all those hard-working kiddies while singing horrible holiday songs in a variety of languages, seems to go on forever, with no no story. Obviously, SA Santa Claus does not observe the child labor laws! <br /> <br /> Eventually we get some nasty apprentices and slinky red-adapted apprentice of the devil himself traveling from hell to Earth, just making the naughty kids and turning Santa's Christmas Eve into a nightmare. Watching this movie is a trippy and twisted experience, and is tied to small children and turns them into Santa Claus and the holidays forever. Strange, the name of Jesus is often mentioned in this Christmas movie, which somehow makes it all the creepier in the context of all the rare things that are going on. This easy to make my personal list "The worst film I've ever seen," but I'm sure nothing is unique.
