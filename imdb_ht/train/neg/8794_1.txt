I'm completely disoriented why this movie even loves, let alone be held in great consideration, especially by many critics who, otherwise, quite sensitive. There is a keyword that describes this movie in its core - irritating. The easiest example explains this is to use the director - or, more accurately, abuse of music. In the first half, a really tired reggae melody played about three times (when once is too often). But in the second half, the Mommas and the papas "California Dreamin '" are played at least seven times, usually in top volume. God, if you loved the song or not in advance, you should be quite sick at it in the end. Just think, some people claim to have seen this movie four or five times. This means they cost California Dreamin either 28 or 35 times ..... <br /> All this blamelessly blameless (it contributes nothing to the story) can possibly be excused if the rest of the movie was there is no persistent merit, or if the story was in any way involved. <br /> <br /> But it is not. <br /> <br /> The only aspect I found love was Bridgette Lin's packed around and still plays the invincible Asia in a layer of sinus. Even this was fairly promptly set. <br /> I'm sure this ineserved high-profile film will convince many poor suckers go and see it. <br /> I can only warn you - if you've never seen a HK movie before, do not start with this one. <br /> <br /> If you feel obliged to watch it, avoid at all costs seen in a movie. The fast-forward and mute buttons are essential tools for coping here. <br /> <br /> You've been warned!
