In this film, the old Amitabh Bachchan fell in love with a younger woman, again. He meets him in his restaurant. The youngest girl, Tabu, flirt with her. He does not know what to do and ask him out. Her reaction to her invitation is rather strange. It was supposed to be funny. <br /> And annoy me on this entire movie. It's not funny. The jokes and script was awful! The only jokes I love were on the teeth of a waiter, but after a number of times, even started to do. Amitabh has a little girlfriend called sexy. This was a strange relationship! A girl and yourself in an old woman! He was scared! I know someone can attach to a kid, but this man has adult conversation with this kid. He did not make any sense. Tabu's father is Paresh Rawal. He gave Amitabh a hard time, but we all know Paresh, he can not do that. So, even the conversation at the end, when sitting around the table, even being supposed to be funny. <br /> I'm just like movies that really are funny. I suppose I will never watch this movie again.
