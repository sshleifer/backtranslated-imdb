Watching this movie was the biggest waste of time and 2 rental bucks in my life. If nothing catastrophic happens before I die, this will be the biggest regret in my life. Who ever thought about this movie, or financed to deserve a kick between the legs, because of where they thought when this film was taken. It's about a guy overweight that is a romantic hopeless, and writes firefighter firefighters who try to pass through as poetry. He met his boyfriend friends on a trip to the coast. Where to meet girls with these. Only the fat guy does not get a girl. Skin poops do not annoy me, I take 'em for nominal value. But this film is trying to have more than one flick of the movie. It's about Fat Guy looking for love in some girls, but then meeting another bikini silicone girl who enjoys his poetry. She found her talent for volleyball that gets money for her family and seduces the ladies, only she has her lady still. The dialogue is super-horrific for even a movie C. It supports a tone of black stereotypes, no character development, it's a glorified pornography, without any pornography in it. Never watch this movie.
