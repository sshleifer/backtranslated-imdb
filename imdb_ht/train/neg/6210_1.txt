This is the worst movie I've seen since "I know who killed me" with Lindsey Lohan. <br /> After watching this movie I can assure you there is nothing but frustration and deception that you should choose to see. Hey, Tim Burton, I've made a big fan of you ... or this movie screen? I mean seriously, what is f% # k? <br /> Without giving anything away, here is the story of a wave of Nutshell ... Nine wakes up, doing things, taking action, making decisions irrelevant. .. and the movie ends. Oh wait ... here comes a beke ... <br /> <br /> Spoiler Alert! Spoiler Alert! At the end of the film .... it's raining. I think a part of my soul died while watching this movie.
