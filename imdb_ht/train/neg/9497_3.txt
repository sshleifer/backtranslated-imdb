you have a strong belly. Holden was actually 55 years old in filming, but looked around 70 and she lived only another 8 years. At a Holden point, "I have twice your age." Well, try to get tripled! "Old enough to be your dad" theme was fired for not working. Granted elderly citizens sometimes wind up with legal adolescents. More power, but that does not mean I want to look at it. It's not a matter of trial but the digestive track. I love my food where it belongs. Lenz is fun to watch with the 70s cars, clothes, furniture, etc to make it worth it if it comes on overdue cable at night, and you want to look something in the wind down to bed. It would have been nice to see the blonde friend of Lenz, one of those who had his guitar right, to get more scenes. Pleasingly spacey ... Who was this chick? I'll try and find out.
