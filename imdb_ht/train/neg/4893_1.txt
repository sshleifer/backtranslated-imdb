The film is actually too slow. Some nice images but it can not exceed the fact that the film is in fact boring. You see a sexual intercourse a lot of watermelons and a sexual intercourse while eating a watermelon and maybe a bit more. It can sound even interesting to someone but believe me to look it for 2 hours is not fun at all. Even if you laugh several times but it's really not enough and it can be more out of hopelessness and unbelief than out of pleasure. They bother the boredom director trying to put some video clips in the movie. They are really colorful clips of absurd songs maybe from the 50's but it's hard to say exactly and they are trying to be funny so hard that it's really sad. Several times you have a feeling that the plot could evolve into something, which is a powerful scene created but in the end it just somehow evaporates with this. Besides the clips there is hardly any dialogue left alone music. The director tries to be original and artistic at all cost. Personally I can not recommend the movie. I believe that art is something that should not be boring. During the projection there was to be all around the movie that's just my short review of my short review.
