I'm embarrassed to write this review. I say that because of the reading you will know that I sit in the whole thing and that is embarrassing to admit even strangers. But I just warned people who read the viewer reviews about their IMDb before watching a movie by watching this one. It's the least I can do. This is a bad movie! Believe me. The plot is jumping. The act is unprofessional. And the directive, camera work, sex, costume, etc., are all second rates. Let's go.
