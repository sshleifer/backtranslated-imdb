Steven what you did you hit a whole new bar. It is strange since Steven's recent film shadow film was directed by the same director who made this garbage. The shadow man was good this diabolically bad so bad he was not even funny Steven is hardly in the movie and feels like he's in a comic appearance and when he's in the movie he's dummy half the time anyway. As for the well-stocked action just told the wizard of oz there was more action than this waste has hardly any action in the movie and when it finally happened it is boring depressions to seriously shoot so-called action scenes. Seagal hardly kills anyone unlike him on film where he goes a host of those who are besieged scene 1 and 2 with exit injuries. The plot is so confusing with many plots that he does not perform at times. The best fury flight must be good what a shame I wasted 5 pounds on this garbage 0 out of ten best chance next time
