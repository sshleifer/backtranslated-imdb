It never ceased to amaze me as you can take an excellent actor and put it in garbage in a movie like this. Robert De Niro is one of the best Hollywood stars ever, but he could not save that movie. In fact, his character is very similar to the one he played in scary cats, which was actually very good, but I can not stand it when actors do the same over more than one movie. I believe he gets old, and that's the case here. <br /> There's nothing surprising in this movie, but then, the story has been told a million times before. Wesley Snipes is typical of your baseball player, and his pointing out of his characterization. De Niro plays the fan obsessed, but his role in this movie is less than fun. <br /> However, because De Niro is in this movie, making it a draw if you are a fan (no pun intended) who sees everything he does does not matter how bad. But to see De Niro at his best, see "Midnight Run", "Goodfellas", or "Couple Land", or even go back and check out "taxi driver" or "godfather II". Do not waste your time with this drivel. Rating: 3/10
