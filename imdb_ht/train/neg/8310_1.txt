Another vast scheme that tries to blame the U.S. government and the Armed Forces (especially the Army) for every disaster since the flood. Anyone who has ever served in the US military can see how bad this film is. Uniforms, equipment, sets, and styling are all wrong. (And of course, all Senior Officers are either criminal corruption or total idiots.) Blatant propaganda who has no attempt at objectivity. Most of the theory presented were disproven over the past years. Use every cliche ", rumors, and Urban Legends from the Gulf - all are presented as Gospels. (Truth is that no one knows why some GW vets are sick and others are healthy like horses.) PS This is It is NOT fun and I know veterans, Koreans, and Vietnam veterinarians and some very serious diseases, too. (And the government has the responsibility to take care of all of them.) Sensational movies like this will not solve the problem !
