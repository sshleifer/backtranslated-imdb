This is an installation of the guinea pig series notorious. A short live Japanese TV, which was canceled after a psychopath admitted being inspired to kill a young student in the show. This short of the series is, like all the other films in the series, practically without any history. A group of guys captured a young woman. They tied him down and continued to torture him to death while videofilming him. They beat him, poured oil on it, used to pinch on it and finally, to tight "love", pushing a needle in his eyes. This is the simplest of all guinea pigs, and one of the first. It was probably this movie, more than any of the others, who gave the guinea pig rumor to mourn. They certainly gave Nicolas Cage's inspirational film "8 mm." These movies have become quite popular in horror circles. They have progressed in more polished but equally graphic movies such as "naked blood". They probably fill out the left channel in the film world, which got a little cleaned and became reality television. Not recommended, but will probably attract people who will see anything once, and ask why later, I know I did.
