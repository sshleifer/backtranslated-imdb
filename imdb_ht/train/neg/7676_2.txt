I was honestly surprised by Alone in the dark. It was so bad I could hardly believe what I saw. There is no character, just a few stereotypes wandering and getting killed. The extent of the character development gave each character a name and occupation, and that's about it. There was no real plot, and none of the characters seemed to be any motivation. In fact, many action scenes just started on their own, from nowhere and a technologically pounding track. While I was watching this movie I kept asking "Where's this past? What's happening?" Acting was high quality dramatic, with stiff wooden deliveries, as if the actors had read in four rays without understanding the lines. Problems delivered to lines have made even more obvious by sound sound design. ADR sounded as it was recorded in an open room. The actors were always taking care of the obvious hit marks, almost robotic in their movements. So these lisless automatons whisked in a series of implorable and confusing scenarios, often without even the benefit of transition scenes. They were here, now they're there. This happened, now what's happening. Random and low rhythms or reasons. I had lots of fun watching it. Definitely not worth nine bucks though.
