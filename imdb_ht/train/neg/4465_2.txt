After successfully recorded in Amenabar and Balaguero, Spanish TV cinema spread as a worldly disease in the horror movies. The result is all in films such as El Segundo's number, a bad TV production writing, but acted and directed even worse. I did not read the book Ramsey Campbell, but I'm sure the author of the doll who ate his mother did not have much in common with this terrible production. Avoid it at any cost, unless you are looking for a quiet night to sleep in a cool movie theater. 2/10
