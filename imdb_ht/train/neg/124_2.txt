This film was probably inspired by Masculin, Feminine and I encourage you to see that film instead. The film has two solid elements and these, (1) the realistic act (2) impressive, without good, pictures. Besides, what hit me most is the endless stream of silliness. Lena Nyman must have the most annoying actress in the world. He acts so stupid with all the nudity of this movie, ... it's unattractive. Compared to Godard's films, intelligence was replaced with stupidity. Without going too far on the topic, I would say that from this the difference between the French and the Swedish society. <br /> A movie in its time, and place. 2/10.
