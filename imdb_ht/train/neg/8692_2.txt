I think Elisabeth Rohm, though she can try hard, is not very good at all. I guess it was because of the budget that it could have been the only one could get for this price. I especially watch it for Myron Natwick's performance, which has my work very well. It was most credible and undoubtedly the most reluctant to watch. When it was not on the screen, the thing was dead. This was filmed in Vancouver. He gave me the ramps, but to ensure that in real life it is a kind, comical man compassion. He even said that playing the role gave him the ramps. <br /> I'll watch anything with him in it, but Elisabeth Rohm - never again. It was as interesting as the Law on Order and Order. Maybe someone very nice, but no actress.
