Yes, this movie made me feel real horror when I realized that I paid for it and spent over 1 hour in my life trying to watch it. The bald guy just gives me the impression of being a psycho - Junkie actor and the girl is the worst actress I've ever seen. Believe me if you appreciate time to avoid this movie, I understand a movie requires money to be created and some movies do not have money but that's no justification for a stupid and wrong act. I still support independent movies, when it deserves support, but movies like this make a bad name for this kind of movie. I'm still traumatized. I will not trust any anymore anymore.
