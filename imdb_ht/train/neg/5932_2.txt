What kind of documentary about a failed musician include a single track by the artist himself? Unlike "Ray" or other unmistakable films on music artists, half the fun of the theater (or on the couch) is to relinquish the great songs themselves. Here, all trains are covered by refreshing characters, and these proposals fail to slow down the Cohen style jazzy. Most often, the covers are seriously singing popular versions. Yuck. <br /> <br /> Interviews are as much or more with other makers and figures rather than Cohen himself. Only rarely the movie features Cohen reading his own works (never singing) - such as letters, poems, etc. The film really did not take much of the artist's life story, either, or about its development over the years. A great disappointment for a great Cohen fan.
