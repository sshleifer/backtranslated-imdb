It does not even deserve a review, other than a warning to potential viewers. It's a bit generic ghost story about an actress humbling a studio during the filming of a WWII period. There is no fear involving, no suspense, nor any surprises. A shocking moment that looks a bit too funny to be shocking. The visual style is very flat and dull, although some really nice corrections once in a while. The story has never come together, and the movies are really just a total bust. 4/10.
