Two old men sit on a park bench. I would not really have a problem with this scene - Only problem is that it's not a scenario in the movie all <br /> <br /> Yup Movies do not get any more concept than that. They are also no longer bored than this night, but there`s worse because these two old men are chalk and cheese. One is Moyer who is a communist Jew while the other is Midge Carter a former golden glove champion who's black too. Let me now see a Jew and a black man sitting on a park park getting along fine. Well I guess it`s possible but easy, but if this movie has such an harmless scenario why play up to the joint? Why are the ridiculous ribbons of Tribalism that take the oath of Hebrews? The little ironic that the Jews have seen at the start of the movie is exactly what kind of Jews have seen in the Nazi propaganda movie in the 1930s <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> is that he`s writing for a completely different media than movies, he`s based on a stage and shows game. Walter Mata sleepwalks in his role as Nat while the commentator almost dies of the whole movie
