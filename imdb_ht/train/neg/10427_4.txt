Well, they say Nymphomania let you satisfy. I do not know if Stella James (Sean Young) qualifies as a clinical nenophoman, but she certainly is in sexual relationships with men. He still explores, trying to get "more data" so he can see what he wants out of life with the guys in it, though it looks like in his age he should have a very good idea not right now. (I can not agree, however, with anyone who says Young too old for the role. If it is, we should all ages so nicely.) For the most part this film let me cold, though It does not mean the worst of its kind you'll ever see. And unlike the recent 'Eyes Wide Closed,' at least something happens to this one.
