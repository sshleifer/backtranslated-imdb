That review liked this movie my surprises. The plot is a shuffler. The wooden characters. Michael Bowen spent most of the movie spying on the characters and misjudging other of them. No one has any redeeming quality or point-of-interest. This is not a noble task. It's not imaginary. It's not ironic. It's no smart. There is nothing right in front of this tedious task. That is missed theater release is no surprise. That "Network" when it reduces the venue. I definitely recommend going to a relay in the Smart Garden show on PBS or even a good information if you encounter this mess on late night TV. If you meet it on daylight TV, take a long walk. Even if you walk into smog, you will feel better not to suffer in this shambles. Life is short. This movie is long.
