This film features a gorgeous brunette named Danielle Petit. It has stunning green eyes, and it's the first stage and the last stage. It is the only thing about this non-repetitive film. It may not be a future as an actress, because this type of film is the kind of offensive disaster that kills careers. The movie itself has absolutely nothing to recommend it. It is not a good horror movie, or a good fake journalist report, or remotely well done. There is no apparent skill in his production. It's like a bad student movie. The terrible element of the story does not make you sick, it is the fact that it is so wrong to do what makes you sick. I would give the movie ZERO stars if I could.
