Bingo is the game, bullshit is the name. Rarely the screen has been smeared with such a blow-up hodgepodge in half-cooked design theory, purit prudery, and new-age gibberish. The bulk of the story is set in Viciente, a Christian resort in the Peruvian forest. Thinking of the Tolkien Rivendell meets the Planet Forklift Star Trek, inhabited by followers of a non-mission-based culture, but unexpectedly-hoping for love and peace. Thanks to the truly original and minimalist gaming design (rainbow-visualization of all energy "energy" is particularly creepy), "Celestine Prophecies" resembles feeling like a "Twilight Zone" in 1980. Real error regarding church history and many nomenclature . I can not believe Hector Elizondo agreed to be part of that. Maybe she was born without her consent, Bowfinger style. May the Lord be gracious to the director, the senarist, the author of the novel, and the poor soul who sees the movie or read the book.
