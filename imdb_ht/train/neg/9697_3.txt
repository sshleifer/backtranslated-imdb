I saw the first of the dwarf-cinemas and sometimes I had little fun watching it. There are many TV / Comedyactors famous appear in the first part and feature, in fantasy costumes, the typical little episodes of the Stand-Up-Programs and exactly which are the second movie problem struggling with. Everything was already there .... there is nothing new to find. You are familiar with most often injured and mute "jokes" and still feel like the goals put into each comedylooser in the last decade who want to get back on stage. There is nothing relevant about the story: the typical fairy-tale story of Rumpelstiltskin, without any significance. I hope something like this but that's nothing I could complain about. I actually complain about the lazy story writers who had an entire story; Business only found many jokes and parody inside but they did not find it anyway. This is except the great appearance of Helge Schneider a total waste of time and money. (If you do not like it then withdraw 2 points from my ratings) If you like to save your money and get bad jokes then watch this crap this great night out tonight on SAT1 or RTL for free. I'm sure you will recognize some "laugthers" I've seen last night in movies.
