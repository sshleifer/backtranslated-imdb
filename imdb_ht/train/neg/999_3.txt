I saw 'Descent' last night at the Stockholm Film Festival and it was a big disappointment. Significantly because the scenario was potentially powerful, the prospect of seeing Rosario Dawson in a smaller intimate movie was interesting and, being a fanatic (sound pervy, I'm not!) In 'rape / revenge' flicks in the 70's, I was The useless say very curious to check out this movie. My conclusion: let's stick to the classics! Yes, the scenario has potential, but the dialogues are flat, the actors are compelling. Even Dawson is empty. Some might say that it is a good reputation in the world of college in the U.S., that the void of the characters serves a purpose and all that jazz but it just makes the whole movie. Just like the scene where Dawson gets raped: it seriously misses intensity! I did not expect anything 'Irreversible'-style but still, are not we supposed to feel compassionate for it? I did not. Not for a minute, she was so lame all the way ;-) And I read that the photography was impressive. Well, it's good indeed, but there is nothing ground-breaking either. I must admit that the screening of the festival is not so good so maybe I miss something here but at the end of the movie, I could not help thinking 'I feel like watching Argento's' Inferno' again. lol. More seriously, the first stage of the club is beautiful shot and all but I had the bitter sensation of watching a longer and more boring version of the scene at the dirty bar near the American-Canadian border in 'Twin Lynch's Twin - Fire Markets and Me ... ... The red and blue lighting, the heavy bass music, the general / decent atmosphere ... No, I just could not get into this movie. Too bad.
