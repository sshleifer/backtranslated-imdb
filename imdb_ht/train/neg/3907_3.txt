I'm glad I rented this movie for one reason: its imperfections made me want to read the Allende book and get the full story. <br /> <br /> Pros: The movie is beautiful, the period shows well with each (the best of my knowledge), and Meryl and Glenn do good work. <br /> <br /> This is the worst act I've ever seen in Jeremy Irons - I keep asking if something was wrong with her mouth. (And I hate the tremendous English style saying "Transito.") Winona Ryder does not be credible except looking at gene and idealism. Most of the other performances are OK, but so some things hang together in the character arts and development relationships that I was frustrated and upset before the end. <br /> I'm pretty curious now whether this movie is typical of the August Bail's work. I can have another couple of bucks for Rent Smilla's Snow in Snow.
