The Pallbearer is a deception and at times very boring and a love story that just does not work partly and filed in Gwyneth Paltrow (Julie). Gwyneth Paltrow is walking in the movie all with a look insane on her face and hard to say that David Schwimmer even sees in it. <br /> <br /> However the pallbearer at times is comical particularly the church scene and the group stage with his friends is a laugh but that's basically it. Watch the Pallbearer for these scenes only and fast forward to the rest. Believe in you do not miss a lot.
