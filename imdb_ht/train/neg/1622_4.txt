The one thing I remember this is that it showed the week after Nigel Kneale `brilliant 'QUATERMASS series was broadcast. The trailers were heavily emphasized that the main character had a mutilated arm that had I hoping it would be like Victor Caroon from the experimental quatermass following the streets of London. <br /> No chances are these because the racing game is just a thrilling rather drab and guard in having a hero and a physical impairment trying to find the bottom of the race battles investigation. I suppose if you're a fan of Dick Francis you might enjoy it but put it in the context of the late 70's when the SWEENEY was just finished and professionals were still being produced, there`s something missing about the racing game. A trailer featured a car on taking another in a motor way, if it`d been a trailer for the SWEENEY you see Jack Regan on taking a car and beat a confession from the slags that` make a bark while They will be professional about taking a car and dragging the terrorists inside. I think sums up what`s wrong with this series
