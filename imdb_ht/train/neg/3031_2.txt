Tony Scott destroys anything that may have been interesting to Richard Kelly's clich√©s, patchy, overwrought scenario. Domino Harvey (Kiera Knightley) was a model that dropped out and became a bounty hunter. This is his story ... "sort of". The problem with this garbage is that there is not much of a whole story with Scott's extreme graphics strategy in every act shot as a distance mechanism that makes us indifferent to everything in Harvey's chaotic life. <br /> <br /> You just do not care about Harvey. Knightley plays it as an obnoxious, cynical rooftop that has nothing to respect our respect. She pants people she does not like and sheds her clothes and inhibits when the situation requires it, but it's not the least bit real and Knightly is not the least bit convincing, either. The movie is boring. It's loud, too, and packed with one of the most scary music sources I've heard in a long time. The second minute final is a poor re-run of Scott "True Romance" The bigger point and gang of Domino will meet two sets of bad guys who - surprise! surprise! - Destined to shoot it out with each other at the top of a Las Vegas casino. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this potentially interesting conflict is totally botched by Scott and becomes a confusion, firefighter, freaky exercise in masturbation cellulite. This is not a bravest or experimental piece of art; It is a failure on each level because it gives us no point to enter into life and dilemmas of its characters. <br /> <br /> Mickey Roarke looks good as a grizzled bounty hunter, but it disappears in the background as "narrative" progresses. Chris Walken turns into another nasty cannon and Dabney Coleman, still solid, is underutilized. <br /> <br /> Do not be fooled by this multi-layer film of the mouse-ridden movie. It's still a turdur does not matter how hard you polish it.
