This film is not based on the Bible. He completely leaves Christ out of the movie. They do not show the rapture or the second coming of Christ. Let alone talk about it. It is not quoted in the scriptures. The end of time are called the Great Tribulation. The film does not even show bad times. Seven bowls, seven cities and seven trumpets of burning boils down to a second second cast of the sea changed its structure. The anti-Christ killed 3 1/2 years in the tribulation and how the movie ended. The only part was correct was there were two prophets. It did not use the name of course because it should be too close to the truth of scripture. The worst part of it I really wanted it to be a good movie. I wanted to get people unsaved into it. I feel that the movie is wrong. It's a counterfeit just like all the evil spirits do. I just hope he does not take away the next movie based on the left side of the book. <br /> <br /> The second problem with the movie is it's just bad. Bad acting, bad effects, bad draws and poor character development. I saw the best Miami visa episodes.
