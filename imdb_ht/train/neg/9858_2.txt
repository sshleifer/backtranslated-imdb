This movie is NOT funny. It just takes the D & D nerd stereotypes and amplifies. All the main characters do less than 30k a year, they all live with their parents, they are all socially delayed, and have no luck with women. The jokes are terrible and inimaginative, as two of the gamers are getting beaten up by a black midget because one of them had a KKK looking over (he suits his wizard) and the other guy was on a hot rocker Jan. oh how funny, it's a nerd so it does not know about sports). You may have to be a child learning child to find any of this funny thing. Poor makes the mockmuntaries so painful to look, but obviously very cheap to do. I feel sorry for Kelly LeBrock and Beverly D'Angelo. I guess these are the only opportunities available for past way hotties first steps.
