I really wanted to love this movie, but the story is ridiculous. I do not want to spoil this movie, - do not worry right from the start you know a bad thing that will happen - but here's an example of how this sloppy movie has been put together. The cowboy and "observing" climb up the ridge. The cowboy has a busy bar handle. The cowboy and "observing" get into a shot out and half race way down the ridge. The cowboy is clean to raze from the rest of the movie. Shortly between the gun battle and the ride down the hill the cowboy had time to hatch, in the dark, on the back of a horse. To be fair, the act by the four main characters is solid.
