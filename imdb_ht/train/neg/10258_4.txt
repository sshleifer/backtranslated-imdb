The Earth is destined to be no more thanks to Father Pergado and a bunch of coins. Christopher Lee (who has since said he was cast to appear in this by his producer who told him loads of great actors involved) is Father Pergado and gets his usual routine serious and scary. Throw is not too bad, though most now retired from acting. The film has terrible sound effects (especially created from pressing keys on an old computer it looks) and it ridiculously reflects at times - showing a scene in the sky, for example, for what feels like hours at a time . Despite this the story is very funny in a world-is-ending sort of way and production is adequate. Interesting one scene features Albert Band and his wife Jackie; Meda Band; Writer Frank Ray Perilli and Charles Bannah's assistant to Bennah Burton. Despite plodding my nature really wanted to see how it all worked out and so loved it.
