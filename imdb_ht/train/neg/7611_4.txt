1st view 2/28/2006 - 4 out of 10 (Dir-Sydney Pollack): - DVD version I watched titled "3 Days in the Conductor" - So CIA drama full of set-back performance does for a lot set-back movie. The first story revolves about 7 out of 8 members of a CIA research group who died with Robert Redford, codename = Condor, who was one of the remaining. Who killed them and why? That's Redford trying to find out while trying not to be the 8th victim at the same time. Along the way, it becomes Faye Dunaway's character involved involved, originally because she needs a place to hide, and then she eventually helps her out after a little love-dovey. This is one of a handful of innocent guys on their story running, but this one does not have a lot of suspense. The flat performance does not help with the completion of the contract's seal for the audience enough either. Although there is a good director of Sydney Pollack and a group of classic performers, the story and performance are not what they should and that's why the movie is not what it should be.
