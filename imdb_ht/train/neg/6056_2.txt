To be honest, this film is another of a series of great disappointments ... most of the so-called "movie master" films are only awful in terms of sub-par by effect and ridiculous story lines. Aside from Ron Perlman, everyone else in this movie can not act to save their lives ... The gunmen sounded like a man playing bop-under the boom mike or something and watched completely unrealistic ... in general, this movie is about as scary as home alone ... the only good guys are Burns Cigarette, Jennifer, and maybe Pelts ... I do not know how these guys can sleep in the middle Night knows that they have lost much of the genre that some of them actually use to understand.
