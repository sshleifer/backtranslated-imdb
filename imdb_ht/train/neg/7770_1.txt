This complete chaos in a movie was directed by Bill Rebane, the man partly responsible for the really sad Anti-classic Monster Go Go. As I was nearing the end of the cold I came to the incredible conclusion that this movie was in fact even worse than the 60 shocker. The story ?? how it is ?? It's about three millionaires unique to inviting a group of people in remote mansions to play a series of lurid games. Anyone who manages to pass the pace and survives the end will win $ 1,000,000. It's a very simple scheme but Rebane still somehow makes vague procedures incomprehensible. Things happen. Characters are completely forgotten. There is nothing that makes too much sense. Then it ends. Weirdly. I mean what the hell was all about exactly? I guess you are leaving your own conclusions. Value production and act without question of a pornographic film standard. In truth Pamela Rohleder (Shelly) is not even good. It is so unbelievably terrible that it is compelling. Unfortunately the same thing can not be said about this crap-fest as a whole, it's just a rotating basement basement.
