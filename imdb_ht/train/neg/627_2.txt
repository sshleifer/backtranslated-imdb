Oh, dear. This movie ... It was awful. I'm a big fan of horror movies. And most of the time, other horror movies say they are bad, I love. The actor who plays 'Scarecrow' was amazing, I'll say that. But this scheme was terrible. It made no sense! She had too many gore, and a sex scene that was not needed (and revolting) at the beginning. I believe the director was trying to be 'shocking' or mediocre, but it just went out horrible. To add to the pile of ferroma craps called a plot, the actors (besides 'scarecrow') are awful, and I care little about them that I soon forget who was. In conclusion, this movie made me sick. If you can avoid watching this movie in any way, please do.
