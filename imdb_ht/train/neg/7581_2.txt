I saw this movie the other day in a movie school class, and I did not see a movie Almodovar before, but went to expect it to be good. Unfortunately, it turned out to be a freaky movie and only a couple of laughs in the blend of two hours of absolute boredom. High heels are just a collection of random scenes that might have worked in their own movies separate, but simultaneously do not add up to any entire type at all. <br /> Or so I thought. Then the next day, my film teacher passed all the class period explaining all details to hide the movie, such as how the mural described flamenco flamenco dancers in the background of the dragon queen scene is some kind of book lack of identity that Spain as a nation developed under fascist rule. Apparently, the whole movie is full of little bit little bit visual shock and references like this. <br /> <br /> Great, but you know what? It's still a bad movie. It takes more than depth and complexity to make a good movie - you still need to give the audience a reason to keep paying attention, something to interest the viewer enough to actually care about all the subtle tricks. High heels give us weird, cut-beat characters but keep them in mostly mondy recycled situations from other movies, and Almodovar does not seem to be using them to make any kind of point. What meaning, for example, in the Hitchcockian character's revelation character comes to the end of the film? Why is that even in there? Just surprise us? <br /> There is one funny scene that has to do with a news stream. And that's it, it's the fun moment. The rest of the film is just cynical phimic references and visual signals that apparently exist only for the sake of showing us how spirited Pedro Almodovar is. But no matter what my film teacher says, she takes over self-indulgent knitting for a movie to be good.
