This is the first guinea pig movie from Japan and this is the worst, in my opinion. A bunch of guys turtle a girl for several days before finally killing her. And at this point, I'll say that these films are not real! They are fake horror movies that try to be as realistic as possible. The scenes are sick but also unrealistic in many cases. For example, when they kick the girl on the floor, we can clearly see how to kick and stump the floor near the girl! And how stupid this looks like! Sound effects are also unrealistic and do not make sense. Other scenes include triple animals thrown on the girl, the girl exposed to loud noise for many hours, the cut of nails, worms placed on the wounds of the girl's body, the eye pierced and snapped into horrible details and stuff like that. Very ill and mean film film and it has absolutely nothing valuable or important cinematography. This first entry is the most sick and amateur pig in Guinea, although it's not as blood as the next part, Blood and Blood flowers, which tries to be as shocking as possible. Experience is perhaps the worst thing I've ever seen and the next thing to mourrish there. This is still (of course) fake s (n / t) uff, the only difference in genuine "snappy film" is that no one dies or hurt for real in this movie. I can not recommend this to anyone since thi s so s **** y and repulsive. They consider this is a great horror movie to understand anything about movies and the real meaning of it. I watched this as a curiosity (like the other parts of the series) and now I know how insignificant these waste are. They work only at the level of trauma and that's not too valuable cinematic success. The Devil's Experience is perhaps the worst movie I've seen with mermaid in a hole (Guinea Pig 4) is perhaps the most disgusting movie I've seen. So these are very extreme in my book, but that's all they are.
