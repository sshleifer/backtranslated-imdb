I agree with most of the Columbo fans that this film was a necessary change in format. Columbo is a unique cop and unorthodox police method. This film looks like a remake of any other ordinary detective drama from the past. And this is the disturbing point, because Columbo is no ordinary detective. There are two parts of this film that let me be intrigued. First, I can not figure out this movie title. It is misleading. Perhaps a better title would have been "the bride vanished" or something similar. Secondly, Columbo hides a piece of evidence without offering the reason (giving the viewers at least) why it does. <br /> I do not feel betrayed, just disappointed. I'm glad Peter Falk went to the usual Columbo. <br /> <br />
