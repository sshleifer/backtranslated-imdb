Having seen the first ten episodes, I must say this show is absorbed. <br /> What bothers me the most, is that the show was shot in Canada. I know it's cheaper, but should have shot it in California, so we could have scenes in the desert. This would be true for the film. The first scene out of another world is in the mountains, and many pinetrees where it looks cold. It does not feel very Egyptian. What worked well in the movie was that it felt like you were in ancient Egypt. Here he feels like they are running around alien fights in a Canadian forrest. And it is so lame that appaerantly, on other planets, the fall also comes. You can see the leaves on the ground in the walls that all seem like spare outside Vancouver. It just makes the show even more incredible and dumb. <br /> Then there is Richard Dean Anderson. It's not Kurt Russel. Ensure she does a decent job and she tries to copy Russels's performance slightly, but she's just not as cool as Russel. And it's not as good as an actor as Russel. And Russells way of playing O Neill, well it was more cynical. Andersons O Neil, is way too soft. I love reading that Russels version just did'nt give a s *** and there was no problem popping the bomb until the very end of the movie. Michael Shanks does a really good job as Jackson even if you take James Spader. <br /> <br /> Teal'c is a really annoying character. It is Jaffa. Not a Jaffa. Just Jaffa. Aaaarrgh !! An ancient bodyguard of a rare pathetic character, seen only in the pilot and in one other episode so far. Teal'c spoke talks with acts like a robot. I saw the best act of Jean Claude Van Damme. <br /> And the fact that Teal'c and the Ra Ra and the people are saved in the movie, can speak English all of a sudden is also incredibly mute. What made the aliens so scary of the movie was that they spoke an ancient language and were real monsters. <br /> <br /> As for the special effects, they are really good at the pilot. But the very rare effects of the actual show seriously make and look cheap. Especially a planet visited with crystals. It is so obvious to walk through a scene with a painting that is seriously done in the background. It's a reproach to our viewers that they have made it look so cheap. Especially when they could do it before a bluescreen and cgi origin. <br /> <br /> X-files were the best effects when they first revealed their first episodes in 1993. That was 4 years before SG-1 started. And they did'nt have two US dollar budgets for each episode, which SG-1 supposedly had. They must have spent all the money on catering. Because I do not see it on the screen. <br /> <br /> Incredibly boring and pointless show, which would have been great if they shot the show in Hollywood with a bigger and better budget writer and best character.
