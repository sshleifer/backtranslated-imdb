What we have here is a movie about how the pursuit of money and revenge can corrupt your soul ... or something like that. Guy Ritchie, a director known for reworking it in the criminal genre, bites off more than he can grind with this one. <br /> <br /> Use it in modern movie noirs to attack the theme of a man putting himself free by swallowing his pride, being handsome at his enemies & giving away all his money falling flat on face it's been. When the character Jason Statham no longer has fear of Ray Liotta, he apparently drives Liotta crazy enough to blow himself off to the final stage. Why? Basically you can not set up a mafia like the Liotta character, which has presumably reached its station in life by displaying the kind of ruthless behavior of the entire movie, only then having him drive into suicide There is nothing more than a tender smile on the face of Statham's character. <br /> <br /> Before anyone starts saying I miss the point ... I'm not. I find it OK? Get out of the quest for wealth & you will find true happiness and inner peace. Make beautiful of your enemies and this will confuse him to self-destruction. This seems to be in the movie and in itself this is not a good quote for a story, although hardly original. The problem is that Ritchie simply does not have the skill as a movie maker to carry it out. At the moment when Guy Ritchie realized this, he seems to get bored with the story and begins to insert red-herrings: the scene when Statham gets hit on by a car - Why? Shoot in some scenes as Marvel Funny Animations ... again, why? <br /> <br /> There are so many loose & unanswered questions left by the end of the movie, you could get all the 2001-i on it and try to figure out them, or simply accept that there is no answer & each The viewer will interpret things in their own way. My head? I was so bored with the tune of the movie that I simply did not care. Frankly the story ended, could not come too early so I did not have to sit in any more of this firefighter kitsch. <br /> <br /> A waste of two hours in my life.
