Knowing Enki Bilal's funny for some time, I saw this film. I thought this could be a great way for the artist as Bilal spread his art and the idea of ​​wider audience. I also thought this would be a good movie recommended, and I thought I'll enjoy watching it ... I was wrong! The film was a true turtle to watch. The idea has potential ... but movie leaves too much way to want, and basically everyone who sees this movie leaves with the impression that it could do it better. I will not make suggestions if you should see this movie or not. Chances are if you're reading the pages that you've already seen, or that you'll see it - but you have to prepare for 102 pretty bad.
