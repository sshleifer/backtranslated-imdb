Recently I watched the first guinea pig movie, The Devil's Experience, and I must admit that they were disappointed. This film is consistently included in any of the "nastiest" films and maybe I expected more because of the hype. The truth is though, I do not miss it. If I would watch it believe that the opening text to be true ("I found this tape ..."), I might have been a bit disturbed by it, thinking it was real. Even without the benefit of knowing it is not to be real though, I think I would have worked out that it really was not. Throughout the movie, the girl's reaction to what made her just is not what they should be. It should be screaming like a bans in pain. The fact that it does not mean that it's obviously not real. I would not want to look at her if she was real, but if she would be more convinced of her act, the movie would be more disturbing. <br /> Then there are notorious scenes: nothing has affected me all through the scalpel in the hand. The hot oil, maggots and innards just did not bother me. I'm not saying I'm "tough"; just that I could not stop my disbelief, in part because of the girl's inaction. <br /> <br /> The scalpel made me wince a little, but the hammer in the hand just did the rubber look hand. And the final scene with the eye was again a little wincing but nothing more. I did not want to look far and I felt scarier. <br /> <br /> Maybe it's because the movie is twenty-odd year old, or maybe I just jaded. Truth is, I did not find this movie in all disturbing. <br /> It's kind of stuff you might expect to see playing on a ribbon as a modern art installation and as an exercise of stripping away away characters, history etc. and just leaving the turtle, it works on some levels. As a disturbing movie in film though, it did not work for me at least. <br /> I watch guinea pigs and my wife, who's "just in a movie" bent and wonder what all the melo was about. We discussed why I watched these films and my reasons are many, but there is a desire to be affected by a movie. He said he did not think that any movie could be so convinced as to disturb it and challenge me to do exactly that. I've played it horrible scene fire from irreversible and it was indeed disturbed. <br /> I'm not sure I have a point, other than that both of us have been more disturbed by a scene from a non-horror movie genre than any movie so far that is out of disruption.
