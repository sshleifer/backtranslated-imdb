It was probably just my DVD-but I would not recommend that anyone tries to watch this picture on a DVD. <br /> I turned up the volume on my TV to the highest possible level, in order to hear about 80 percent of the dialogue. Some of the speakers still remain sub-acoustics. If you're out in Scotland, you can have a chance, albeit a little one. <br /> <br /> Country voices are drowned out of almost all ambient sounds, including unwrapping a package, track, even lightly on a cigarette. <br /> With the volume reached up to a level in which voice can be heard, I can guarantee that at least one of your neighbors will call the police when the scene changes in a loud setting, like a disco. And that you will be hurting yourself diving for the remote turning it back down. <br /> <br /> There are art and art, even in the field of mixed audio. But this effort, at a time of war, would meet international criteria to be classified as an atrocity. After about half an hour, I gave up, and saw nothing else picked up in the photo either.
