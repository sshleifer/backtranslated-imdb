Storyline: The film spanning 4-odd hours covered in the appropriate details of the Kargil sector near the LOC in 1999 when Pakistani infiltrators crossed the LOC and entered into deep into the Indian territory and the Indigenous Retaliation. . To learn more about the story, I would suggest readers article articles related to Kargil. <br /> <br /> Comment: If anyone looking for a formula story in this movie, then one can be sure he is absent. LOC is a story of pure sacrifice, patriotism, courage and many and many bullets and blood. Movie Room where I saw this movie filled with cheers and cheers when the movie shows American crowns. Movie audiences seemed similar to audiences like in a Match vs. Pak Crisis Crisis. <br /> <br /> Watch the movie as a tribute to the Army's sacrifice and for the characterization of the real war hero (4 PVC hero honored) who sacrificed their lives so we could see that day. The film was made a brilliant painting of the Army that fought all luck in rough weather conditions. The negative film is that it's too lengthy and the songs are very dangerous.
