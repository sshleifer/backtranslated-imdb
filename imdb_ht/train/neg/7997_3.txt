Even for a tired movie model as nature vs. sugar people that were so strong in the 1970s, ants fell miserably short of being even a bit effective (though fun for reasons he did not want). It is sooooo preposterous. Apparently these ants bulldozers near an altar were eating poison garbage for decades and are now suited by emitting poisonous bites - hundreds of these bites were fatal. Watching actors in some cunning notoriously falling among small specks black is painfully comical in a not-so-good-but very-bad way. So many scenes just look ludikrous: a boy trying to fall into a dumpster also being attacked, Suzanne Sommers cries out in horror while lounging in bed, Robert Foxworth and Lynda George breathe in pieces of wallpaper, Bernie Casey faking a leg gamet, and list going on and off. The danger shows chains of ants crawling out of a dark line drainage of ants all over the walls. The cast for the movie is not bad on paper, but none of these actors seem to believe in the material. Poor Myrna Loy was sitting in a wheelchair in this horror. I hope he has found a good use of the money, because it is obvious what was ONLY the reason for a woman in her pedigree she should be in this nonsense. Although it is quite a bad movie, it lookuces - once for me, and it has many of these sixty poor quality films - actors-nailed actors themselves, made-to-TV feel, and the daunting animals in nature reeking revenge on people. This time man must push his hand into a pile of ants to be affected. Really quite obnoxious.
