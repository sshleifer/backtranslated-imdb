It touches a few interesting points .. But! - It fails to show evidence of all 'exclusive' studies shown. Who are the 'friends' and 'small group of scientists' who gather these data? - What's up with the Al Gore biography go on there? Like how she likes to play with the cows on the hips or that her kid was hit by a car .. too bad, but .. what to do with the ozone layer? <br /> I've seen Much better things, in much less time, on Discovery Channel .. I really do not understand why this has such a high score on IMDb. Unless you lived under a rock, this documentary would not be any news about you ... all this is old news ... And all Al Gore trying to do is to get some points of popularity. P.S. I'm not American so do not even try to say that I'm a bunch fan: p
