You remember the movie Spice movie and how bad it was (besides the songs), well to Simon Fuller's managers (also the manager of this group) made the same mistake set S Club (another of my dear ones) in the movie their own. S Club: Tina Barrett, Jon Lee, Bradley Mcintosh, Jo O'Meara, Hannah Spearritt and Rachel Stevens (what happened to the seventh member, Paul Cattermole?) Basically asked the boss for a break, and while they see themselves on TV! Three of them swap, and vice versa, half discovered the clones made by a vicious scientist, and the other half just find themselves in trouble. Also begins Gareth Gates as a script in his head. This film may be more of a plot than Spice Girls 'movie made, but besides singing "bring it all back", "Do not stop Movin'" and "never had a dream come true" this is not there is no goo reason to see this movie. Not long after the group split for good. Adequate Yearly!
