Most college students find themselves lost in the bubble of universities, cut out from their communities in which they study and live. Conversations are being conducted with fellow students and college faculty. Steven Greenstreet's documentary is a prime example of a disillusioned college student who judges the entire community based on limited contact with a small number of its members. The documentary focuses on a small group of individuals who have been described as representing the large population of the population. As is normal, people call the most to get the most media attention. Other than his discontent in the community in which the film was filmed, the documentary was well done. My only follower is that the feelings and chaos of the movie show were attributed to the entire community rather than some people who expressed them. Of course it is important to examine a conflict like this and to make people aware of the difference between political views, but it is ridiculous to implicate a community of everyone in their actions in a few radicals.
