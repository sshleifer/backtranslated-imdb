CREATIVE ENCOUNTER is a horrible and useless rumor of the 1945 classic David Lean, based on Noel Coward's play "Still Life". A doctor removed a piece of gravel from the eyes of a woman in a train station, he is in a miserable relationship, he is happily married to social workers of Italian ancestors. They are encountered by accident on another occasion, form an instant attraction and arrange to meet each other every Wednesday. The pair fell in love, but after spending a few afternoons together they realized that they had no realistic chance of happiness and party agreement. Or original one-act game involves two ordinary people who fall in love. Sophia Loren and Richard Burton, the Super Stars and veterans of Hollywood Epics, are the idea of ​​'ordinary people'. Loren in particular is sick - Sophia Loren in full make-up, looking like a million dollars, working as a part-time social volunteer worker at a Citizens' Bureau of Councils just by true rings. Burton, looking haggard, and colorful hair, too much make-up and wearing platform shoes, do not come across as your general practitioner. That said, you can not really blame them for having an affair after seeing their wives. Burton is married to a literary critic who spends his evening penning poison reviews and treats her husband and contempt. Mary Loren, Jack Hedley, potters around the house all day and is boring terminal: the most interesting thing she ever did is almost a matter of six years before. The final scenes together will induce vomiting, ("You've been a long, long way away", etc.). This great British actor worker, John LeMesurier, has a three-minute chatter as Burton's friend, and seems to be a little inebriated, speaking his line in a barely heard voice. It's a sad and unforgettable performance in a rehash involvement in a classic cinema. Avoid all costs.
