Encouraged by the positive comments about this movie about here I was looking forward to watching this movie. Bad mistakes. I've seen 950+ films and this is really one of the worst of them - it's awful in almost every way: editing, rhythm, scenario, 'acting,' soundtrack (singing only the movie - a landmark tune - is played no less than four times). The movie looks cheap and embarrassing and is boring in the extreme. Rarely I was so happy to see the end credit in a movie. <br /> <br /> The only thing that hinder me to give this a 1-note is Harvey Keitel - while this is far from its best performance it at least seems to be doing a bit of an effort . One for Keitel obsessives only.
