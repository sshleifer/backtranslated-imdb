Poor Tobe Hopper. He has led an ever-present classic horror "Texas Chaimsaw Massacre". Since then everything he did was terrible. This is probably the worst ... and that says a lot. It's about a man (Brad Dourif) who has the ability to do things (with whom) catch fire ... or something like that. Hardly an original idea (anyone remembers "Firestarter"?) It's a real mess ... literally everything is wrong! Pathetic acts (even Dourif!), Asinine script, loust production value, effects of special effects ... everything is BAD !!!!! A must miss ... not good for laughing.
