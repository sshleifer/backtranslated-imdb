When I first switched off on this morning news, I thought, "wow, finally, some entertainment." It was a little fun for a week or so ... But we have to face it, these news reporters (if anyone can even call them) there are ways to earn a lot of "playing around" time. First, I thought Jillian was breathing in fresh air. But seriously, this woman has little of journalists at her. It is very unprofessional. It keeps on interrupting Steve when he begins to inform the viewers on a certain news report. It just really gets annoyed at the point that I can not watch it again. Jillian is NOT a good journalist. Hell, it is more of a celebrity who loves being a celebrity. Therefore, he immediately transformed into a celebrity around the celebrity whom he was supposed to interview. It's not very professional and probably bestowed his relationship with celebrities more important than being a lawless insatiable journalist - and that's all I can say about him. <br /> <br /> Also (disappointingly), this show has more entertainment news than news reports that are needed on the world, the government, the US, or something that will benefit and / or serve the best public interest . They are too focused on sensationalism that everything is going to come up as a commercial product. On the other hand, garden reporters are interested in luck ... <br /> I believe "Good Day LA" is for young adolescents and celebrities, and it is definitely not for those who are currently CARE about the news. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> So today. "The Good Morning America" ​​ABC is also okay ... as long as Diane Sawyer does not become too serious.
