Oh yes, Sakura Killer is a jump, terrible movie ninja, make no mistake. But it's also an incredible enjoyable one. This is largely thanks to the awesome presence of one Chuck Connors, who is billed as the start of the movie but really only shines through a few scenes. I suppose he was supposed to sort of a kind of obi Wan Kenobi ("The Ninja-Buster", copying the cry of the box), but his "wisdom" is mockingly. "Move without thinking" ??? My friend says this is the sign of mental retardation, not in supreme concentration. But really, two of her help, Sonny and Dennis, have such horrible dialogue that 'Brooklyn', as we call the Colonel, tends to shine in comparison. Especially looking for Dennis's logic regarding the 'genetic connection' Sakura are involved with. If you know anything about cloning you will die laughing. And yes, this is a bigger draw point, as. <br /> A very fun movie, Sakura Killer is a gem-to-get gem. I will not spoil the 'trick' ends for you either, except that it's a perfect set for a killer sakura. Too bad Chuck Connors have died. :-( Because it has a smooth way to blow away from ninjas.
