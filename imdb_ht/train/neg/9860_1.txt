I usually enjoy films like this. It's in style documentary injection, but the acting and writing are just awful. The act is wooden and stiff and the writing is just for clich√©, but not at all in a great way. As in this thrilling, I am surprised at a 5.2 / 10 on IMDb. I am sure that most of these votes must have been from family members of the movie. I suppose if that's the case, you could manage a couple of laughs, as it's still funny to see your family / friends make a movie. Well, in a way, I guess this gives hope to all writers and come up, directors, actors, etc., 'if they can do it, you can do it. Although, maybe you should not.
