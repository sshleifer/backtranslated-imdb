Perhaps one of the hottest classic horrors made, Halloween does feature Michael Myers memorable and some great actions by Jamie Lee Curtis. <br /> However, its rewatchability factor is very close to zero, as there is an unbearable amount of time spent on dullness / accumulation of the real events. <br /> <br /> This is the movie sort you can go to microphone popcorn and do not miss anything at all. <br /> How it spawned many suites, I will never understand. <br /> <br /> Thanksgiving Rob Zombie is remaking this. And generally, I hate remorse. <br /> Surely it will be more than offset for all-time random-filled gaps and some original points that the original original is missing. is a movie we feel we love, much as we are teaching that we would like Dickens. <br /> <br /> Do not suppose this is a classic.
