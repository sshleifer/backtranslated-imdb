"The second coming of Suzanne" is yet another of the surrealist films that try to come across as very sophisticated, but all of it puts the viewer in sleep. Like other types of movies, there are limited dialogues. Everyone is more interested in the visual aesthetic of the shot. However, the movie feels that nothing at all keeps your attention. <br /> <br /> Video boxes states that this film is "one of the most interesting visual adventures ever seen on film." Yeah ... sure. It's right up there and watching these exciting events as a melting ice bucket or a turtle walking for a mile. 1/10
