Black Rising is your typical bad, obviously quickly producing movies / sci-fi / fantasy. It has a weird, unplanned plot with so big holes you could fit an elephant in them. Most of the time I did not know what the hell was going on but it did not really matter, it was a simple devil hunter returning from hell to save Camper history and confused things added on to witches and a book of evil and trace elements and characters that make no sense or totally disappear for any reason. The act is bad but there is honestly not much to do with this script I guess. There is a couple topless scenes that are probably the reason that this bad movie was made (like many other bad movies). Give this one a pass if there was nothing else about T.V.
