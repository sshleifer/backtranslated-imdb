The order starts at Rome where the head of a special order of priest who faces ghosts & demons called Dominicus (Francesco Carnelutti) was found dead, cut in New York City where one of his orders was Alex Bernier ( Heath Ledger) contacted Head of Cardinal Driscoll (Peter Weller) who asked him to investigate the mysterious circumstances surrounding the Dominican death. Together with his girlfriend Mara Willims (Shannyn Sossamon) & fellow priest Thomas Garrett (Mark Addy) Alex travels to Italy dug in his mentor's death, as the truth begins to emerge from appearing that Dominic was a man 'Man Eater' which absorbs the other of their sins and lives with the burden of them so that they may die peacefully and that the Church was not pleased with its activities. Alex must do what's right even if he goes against what he believes ... <br /> <br /> Also know under the title of Sin Eater this was German German co-production written, produced & directed by Bian Helgeland & t really doing so much for me if i am honest & i usually i honest it is. Anyway allow start with the mess in a script that has some OK ideas but it's really predictable, excruciatingly dull and boring, really unusual at times & it takes itself far too badly. The whole concept is Daft & while it thinks it's clever and it's oh so owning twist that ties everything up & bringing full circle story I thought it was the most obvious & lazy way to end those things. There are usual religious themes here, morality, sin, forgiveness, faith, beliefs, prophecies, blah, blah, blah or know something sort. Then there's the torsion that's not hard to see coming, there's abuse of power by high ranking religious, corruption, greed, evil, etc you know the clown Hollywood ideal & terms that get reviewed every time it deals and the Church. The order has nothing new to say & as a serious piece of film-making it absorbed, much. I'm not too sure that the Order is meant to appeal, as a dead-hard horror fan I did not see much horror at this at all, as a suspense it's less than thrilling, as a mystery too predictable & there is nothing here really grip or holding the interests & for some reason I can not know the IMDb also lists the Order as an action movie that is absurd as it's as exciting & action packed as the average episode of Sesame Street (1969 - present), harsh but what I think ... <br /> <br /> Helgeland Director does an OK job, the film seems to have a very soft lighting scheme & it all looks a bit drab, grayish & mat. For a horror movie is supposed to be very light on crisis or horror elements, in fact there is no either side of two bad kids that can turn into a flock of birds for no apparent reason, no wonder. Forget about any war or violence as there is no good, but it would help at least make the Order a bit to look. Under the IMDb 'Trivia' section, the release date of the Order was put back for some of the special effects could be improved because they looked unintentionally funny, all I can say is judged by the movie to end the effects to be really bad begins with because they are not exactly brilliant as it means now. <br /> <br /> I was surprised to see the Order had a budget of $ 28,000,000 which is a hell of a lot of money & I just can not see where it all went apart from the sets and good production design. The whole movie looks & feels very average & completely forgettable. The act is OK although the bitter guy looks like some sort of bad-mouth comic funny relief, a good actor like Peter Weller deserves better than that. <br /> <br /> The order I prefer the Eater's Sin Act actually is not that it matters too much, missing all of its goals intended by the provincial mile as far as I'm concerned & is a pretty dull way to wasting 100 odd minutes in your life so do not do it! Not recommended.
