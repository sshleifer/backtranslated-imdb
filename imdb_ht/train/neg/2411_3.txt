The Dead Living Hood is about a young scientist called Rick who lives with his brother in Oklahoma City where drug dealers and prostitutes are full of streets. Then one night Rick's brother gets shot by a gang driving down the street who fought with him earlier. Desperate, Rick called his scientist partner to bring about the latest mechanisms working on bringing cell blood to health. The formula was not tested on someone, or even a dead body but Rick is determined to bring his brother back to life. It gives the body a double dose of the formula but nothing happens. So, Rick called 911 and the body is carete away only to return to life and to be born on the human body. Now Rick must get his zombie brother before the entire hood is transformed into a neighborhood of the deceased. Hood of the living dead is one piece of waste. The plot is a direct rip off of Resident Evil, the act is just awful especially with fake Rick crying for his brother, the guns are so fake because each time the gun was shot and sent out sparks out and make up is just lame. Only foxes are covered by the actors face. Zombies are also modified. They run, roar, and be shot in the heart to die! Zombies should only defeat, moan, and be shot dead in the brain! This movie is so awful, the outtakes are just the right moment in this movie. Hood of the Living Dead will become a 3 out of 10, a little entertainment here and there but only succeeded as a budget low budget smuggling.
