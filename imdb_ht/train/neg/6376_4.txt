Jennifer Cassi (Gina Philips from "Dead and Breakfast") returned to the home he grew up in who he had just inherited from his deceased sister, not recognizing his grandfather (Fay Dunaway) who still lives in it. Jennifer decided to sell her as she was in dire need of the very money of granny's torture. It also begins to have bad weather that will occur in a mysterious cone. There was really no one relating to this movie. Jennifer looked cold, far, insensitive, and narcissistic, whereas the grandma seemed spitting, sad, and narcissistic. This movie is good and well designed, but there is no one of scenario and I found it hard to care about what happened. <br /> <br /> My Class: C-
