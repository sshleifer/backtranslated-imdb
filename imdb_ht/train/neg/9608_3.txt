Man, what the hell was the man who made this movie about? And most importantly, where can I find some? The opening scene lays the tone for the movie: a naked writhing woman in a circle of fire, transforming into a werewolf. And this is not American Rick Baker's linguistic transformation, as. We're talking about some of the worst makeup ever captured on the movie here. I can imagine some Italian stones that spread on naked Annik Borel (who plays Daniela, the protagoness film (is that a word?)), And ask him to roll in fur. That's how bad it is. From here it does not get much better. The minutes are wasted as the male sculptor male scaffolding scenarios on Daniel with his condition or something (I can not remember, but the dialogue is so bad if you do not laugh at it you will cry). <br /> <The funny thing is Daniela is not even a werewolf, it is a psychic that goes mental every time there is a man around (understood, as it was raped as a child) so he thinks he becomes a werewolf like her ancestors (opening scenes). It can not help but tear from throat to every person she meets, and she just wants to be loved! Things start looking up to Daniela as he meets and falls in love with a Buff Stuntman who does not trigger his 'episodes'. Check out the mount here, one of the cheesiest you'll ever see (laugh and embrace after headfirst dive through a window). Daniel's luck is not caught as the movie takes a brutal turn, it is suddenly viciously beaten and raped by a group of thugs that kill the stuntman. Reminiscent of "I spit on your tomb", Daniela extract bloody vengeance on her violence. This is 100 minutes in my life I will never get back. But hey, the game you play when you're a movie geek.
