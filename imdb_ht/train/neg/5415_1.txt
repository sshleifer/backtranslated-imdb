Dil was a memorable film that brings seluloid to a great director such as Indra Kumar. The film followed with Beta, Ishq, Raja & Masti all were superb. <br /> But then each successful director gives a few horrible movies along with some hits. Pyar Mohan is one such movie. <br /> Even if the comedies are saying nicely, but then they neglected the laughing viewer. Comparing with what kind of comedy movies did today this is a mute. <br /> <br /> If you really want to watch a movie and laugh, please do not watch this. Because the pathetic comedy will make you cry only. <br /> <br /> In short, the movie is worth a miss.
