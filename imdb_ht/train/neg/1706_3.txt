Wow, this was a very bad movie ... as it's other movie reviews there is no plot, no character development, maybe there were some types of script but it's hard to say based on the final result end. <br /> <The editor of this movie was really non-existent, it tends to jump from the scene scene without any connection or anything to help the viewer to determine what actually happened. <br /> <br /> All of this is simply a flush of zombie budgets that have not been thought out of all, have bad acting, bad dialogue, bad things. <br /> <br /> The only thing that saved this movie from a 1 or 2 is the Gore factor, I think this must be where they spent whatever money they tried to justify doing. <br /> If you are (like me) dedicated to finding and watching all the zombie cops you can find, do not watch this. Period.
