I just saw this in the 2006 Vancouver International Film Festival. The summary of the festival sounding is very good we decided to check this one out. I'm sorry to say I was very disappointed. <br /> <br /> In addition to writing wrong, it was boring. I will not take away the actors as there are so many they could do with this bad script. <br /> <br /> The first bite was cliched without ironic, on the headless headless without humor. The best movie was Hunt Hunt went with a feeling of horror campy. Instead he was seriously arguing with this and a boring film. I can not recommend this movie. It felt too long and all at all just plain weak.
