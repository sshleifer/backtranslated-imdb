The 60s are a periodically fun movie, most of this entertainment is out of the movie's film. It is very uneven, and it contains many annoying elements. Take for example switch between black & white, and color. If they do what's right, this could be fairly effective, but because it was bad, it turned out to be a nuisance and only detracted from the already bad experience; Many of the film had an odd odd to it. The act was not very bad for a movie made for flickering television, but then again it was outright embarrassing in other times. Many of the events were not coherent, and the end was confusing. How did this family somehow end up in many of the major events during the 1960s? The finish was too much to boil for my taste; because it was hollywoodized, everything turned out right in the end. I would advise you not to waste your time on the '60s and doing something else with your time. I'm glad I watched this class, and not on my own time. I think I can safely say that the best part of the film was the inclusion of Bob Dylan's music. These people just think my rambling on the sticker. I hope you take my advice, and stay away from this.
