There is nothing to say but Wow! Is anyone actually having someone sneak up on them in an open field? Well this happens approximately 25 times in this movie (clearly the favorite tactic director). In one of the opening speech speakers in the talk / hot list was mounted in the back seat of the camera man can sit in front of the movie. Shortly after it came to the field 5 competitors showed up and, although it is clearly in the last 2 in the afternoon they are all convinced that the sun will be set any minute. After about 30 minutes of our boobless waste we are privileged with a flashback in the clown's story in which we see some of his previous victims. If you watch this movie check out the chest of ladies .. her ribs go all the way around her neck, she's flat out disgusting. Most movie movies action occurs during the night but without a night vision camera the chaos is forced to happen during the day. The few night shots that made him in the movie look like being stolen from the witch witch project or random shots from the yard directors. The film somewhat delivered itself to the end when there was a matrix like to shoot out with the clown that we rewound and watch over and over hysteria. <br /> <br /> Definition of this PHOTO RENT if you ever have SNUCK UP ON A DAY OPEN. <br /> SIGN, ANSWER
