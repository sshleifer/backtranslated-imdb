If Ashanti was a serious attempt at a film about the institution of slavery, still prevalent in the third world movie world would have been best received. Instead she gets to a star nailed to a movie where the stars came in, told the lines, and collected the checks without much conviction. Michael Caine and his wife Beverly Johnson work for the UN World Health Organization and are busy doing humanitarian work in East Africa. Together comes Peter Ustinov who can barely convene enough sheep to make a go to the party as a Muslim slave dealer. As Johnson is black it tram her anyway along with a lot of kids and a few adults too. Caine's course does not take the sweet kidnapping and the rest of the movie spent in a rescue rescue. The rest of the cast has folks like William Holden, Rex Harrison, Omar Sharif and Indian movie star Kebir Bedi in partying and looking so incredibly bored with the whole thing. <br /> <br /> Usually in something like this talent as those mentioned above will be just too incredibly and done on a diet of scenery. But Ashanti does not even have to go for it. <br /> What an incredible waste of time. The arithmetic of tax writing is to infuse the air.
