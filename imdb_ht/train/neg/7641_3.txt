This is one of those movies that tries to be moody and tense, and instead, ends up tripping all over her head. When you saw it at a queer movie festival, I was intrigued by "teenage college threesome gone wrong" written-up, however, over-all ended up being disappointed. <br /> It's hard to criticize a "true story" since there is not much that can be done on the scheme - but I found this disjoint, melodramatic and utter depression. It's dark and almost disaster, painting a creepy flash creepy in the seventies and imposing music and jerk pre-ups. It just does not work - some scenes where so cheese that instead of trembling, my audience was suppressing snickers and rolling eyes. <br /> <br /> The story has an interesting site, but this just turns down into a dark, miserable spiral.
