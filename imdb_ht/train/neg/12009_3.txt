I had a video of the stuff. And I think he tried my fourth one that I managed to watch the entire movie without drifting off to sleep. It's slow-moving, and the idea of ​​a mid-Atlantic platform, which may have been revolutionary at the time, is now just a big big yawnaroony. Apart from Conrad Veidt, the rest of the cast are very forgettable, and it is only in the action towards the end of things to get really interesting. When the water began to spread over time, on one occasion, lift me up. But give it to the man. No one can hold a cigarette like Conrad Veidt. He does not love it between his indexes and middle finger like the youngest mortals. He keeps it in his finger, while showing us the old pearly-brownies. There are a few scenes in this movie where the smoke spread to the sky against a dark background, and it looks very artfully done. But he does not say much about this movie if all that affects you is the tobacco smoke.
