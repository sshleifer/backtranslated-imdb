Definitely the product of young minds, this piece can be very well appealed to the 20s crowd, who constantly tries to find their place in the world, while obsessing about every newo. However, I can not imagine that the heavier amount of narcissistic belly-gazing, trite humor, or interior subjects would be particularly engaging in anyone over 30. Another problem is that the peripheral characters, whom the filmmakers obviously There is nothing but contempt for, they hyped up to those careless absurds for comical effects, that they fail to be reliable in any real way. However, one has to give some style to the filmmakers, who obviously grew up in the video generation, and used all tricky trick fixes in the book in order to spruce up an otherwise non-existent plot. There are 2 points to remember here. First, beware of darlings festival. Secondly, even if we live in the age of youtube, not everyone in the mundane's life deserves great-screen treatment. But these young filmmakers have the right to make their films, and if others 20-somethings can find something in it to identify and, then all the best. But I could not help but think of the end of this film as this latest generation, just now coming to age, will be the real world fares that present many challenges and hassles. At the age when each child is always reassured of how special, and they all deserve 15 minutes of exposure, resistance and ability to cope with adversity does not exactly appear to be the strongest generation of this generation.
