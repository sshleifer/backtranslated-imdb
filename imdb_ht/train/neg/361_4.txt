After reading the book, I liked the story. Watching the movie I was disappointed that many changes were made. He understands that books and movies differ but it has two different stories, only the names and some of the book's history remain. Read the book and you will have a better understanding of the movie. The book gives you a better development of the characters. These characters are very interesting and take care of them. Wherever they were in line with the book's description. Some characters are not included. Television has microwaved many great books and stories, this is a perfect example of that. Entry of the author does not always ensure a good movie but it can sometimes help.
