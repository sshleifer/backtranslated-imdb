My life is about saving animals. I work volunteer with a chat rescue organization. I'm a vegetarian because I could not kill an animal even to sustain my life. I can not even kill a spider, and I'm out of it. The scene where the children throw stones at the bird until it dies, and Sooner participates in an attempt to accept other children, made me sick and has hugged me ever since. It simply convinced me that the human beings are pathetic in their need for acceptance. The last - adoptive parents are adopting Sooner - not to get the reputation of animal crimes. Why would anyone want their children to see this movie?
