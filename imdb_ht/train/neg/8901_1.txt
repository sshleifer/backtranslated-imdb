I'll do this short and sweet ... this movie sucks !!!!!! <br /> I watched Part 1 earlier today and thought she was one of the greatest films ever, and gave her 9 out of 10 stars. So I thought maybe part 2 and 3 would be good suits, I was wrong. This movie bored me to death and was different from the first, she had the scheme to continue with her. It was like bad dependency from one part or one. <br /> I love Walken, but I was sorry for him here. I was so happy about Glenn Danzig being in this movie, but it does not shine you will miss her. There was a full cast of bad actors and those I do not like Eric Roberts and Jennifer Beals. However, it was a breath of fresh air to see Ethan Embry, it is one of the funniest people in the world. <br /> <br /> This movie will make you like the first one a little less, so do not watch it because you feel you must read in yourself, being a fan of party 1. I'm going to wait a few days before I look part 3 and I pray it is better than this crap. <br /> <br /> The last scene in the movie and the lightning was one of the most beautiful things ever to show on film. Fast forward or jump in that if you can not bump the first part. <br /> 1 of 10 stars - this was awful!
