Have you ever seen a movie made entirely of long shots? No? Me, ni. Well, I finally saw one of the "Spring of My Hometown," and I must confess, now I know why people do not. The technique is "Ati," to be assured, but it's definitely NOT ripe for public consumption. The technique is heavily flawed simply because the viewer has no emotional attachment to the characters, and maybe that would be the intention of the director. I do not know, I can not read it, and I certainly do not know enough about the judge to make a trial. But one thing about this movie that is painfully evident is its ridiculous anti-American sentiment. As an American, I am well aware of my country's participation in the Korean War, and I'm very well aware that we were not always angelic, but I'm going to be damn if I'm going to take this guy's version of how things happened . According to this foolish blind, the Americans were not only at the root of the war, we were the cause of the war, and we almost only destroyed the country. Whatever, Mister Director. And I suppose you would still be doing this movie in the Korea Region if we did not interfere, right? Talk about to forget your story. This is almost analogous to making the Nazis "the good guys" while turning their allies into "the bad guys." This film is so historically naive and so really incorrect that it's almost embarrassing to watch. For a person from a country to be his very exterior interference, he is sure to come as high and mighty and judicial.
