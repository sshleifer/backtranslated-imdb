It's a poor movie, but I must give it to the lead actress in this one .... Francine Forbes. It appears to be the lesser act and I personally thought it was kind of beautiful. Too bad it only appears in another movie in the database. In addition, the film is full of ridiculous gurus and fakey death scenes. People get stuck with them GUSH like 2 gallons of blood! And if you like watching poor horror movies, I recommend this one very.
