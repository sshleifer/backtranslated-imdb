Oh man is this movie bad. It leaks horribly. The story is about a race car driver in love with himself, and then has to promote a fast food chain and while doing so, does not like itself. He tries to get out of the deal with terrible, painfully unfunny uncertainty. Jim Nabors looks like she's sleepwalking, does not act. You will miss like Burt sidekicks as Dom Deluise and Jerry Reed while watching this Stinker. Andoni's hair is outright scary, proving that tons of hairspray did not come from the sixties. Or maybe that was a wig. Speaking of Burt's waves was not bad in this movie. His worst "day wig" was in "Smokey and the bandit 2". Anyway, this movie is the worst movie film Reynolds, ever, ever right standing with "Cannonball Run 2". The original "Smokey" and "Cannonball" (and "Hooper" that, fortunately, had no end) are great, funny films. This is not true. Even Ned Beatty, who is a great actor, feels. You will be long for a kind of Jackie Gleason type that is fun to hate. And your idea, this is not one of these fun movies in bags over. It's disgusting, pure and simple. Even the outtakes in the end were tedious and boring, and worst of all, unfunny. And least of all I forgot, "Stroker Ace" was one of the first Nail Burt coffers' nail bits before her a bit-revival later in "Boogie Nights", another film that, like "Deliverance" earlier , shows that the man can act well when he has a decent platform to do so.
