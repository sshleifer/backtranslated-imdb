This movie is not worth the movie it was photographing on. The dialogue is flat, filled with overused overlines and delivered by amateur actors who sound like reading a script for the first time. The screen, dried, the movie style is a cheap imitation of the "Ring" style visual effects. Characters do not even act as a normal person would. For example, the character who is looking for her twin sister in her home force her way to the front door, ramps in the house are all scared and it's not even once called out her sister's name to see if she is home . What? You would think she was just burying her sister instead of looking at her. Way too much recapitalization in its infancy. Excessive reflexion is a typical sign of an amateur director. It is actually funny to watch the many shots of the woman driving her car down the street, up the driveway, around this corner, over here, over there, oh a side view, now a front view. Ase already. You'd think you're watching a TV commercial for the Solaris! Terrible movie. 0 out of 100. I really have mercy on anyone who has spent money making this movie or watching it.
