I went to see this one and very wait. Well unfortunately the dialogue is absolutely stupid and overall the movie is far from worrying inspire or interest. Even a child can see the missing logic of behavior character. Children today need creative stories that would inspire them, which would make them 'dream' on events. That's precisely what happened with movies like E.T. and Star Wars a decade ago. (How many kids imagine about becoming Jedi Knights and interpreting their own lightsabers?) Seriously not wasting your time and money on this one.
