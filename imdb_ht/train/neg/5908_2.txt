This one is a little better than the first one. It always depends on a lot of its humor that basically keep saying that the old Bond movies have not been realistic. Which puts thin after many parody. The girls were more interesting in this one. <br /> There is a tremendous amount of total humor out of humor. Hopefully a real comedy day will come back.
