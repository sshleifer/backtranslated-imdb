The film looks disjointed and in general, badly written. The scene moves together as if 10 different people have written it, and none of them have interacted with each other. Apparently they wanted to take a page from a Miracle on the 34th Street (original movie) film, but it is done in a way that is poorly that the movie falls apart. This movie is for the very young, and even They will see the fact that anyone who scripted it knows little nothing about baseball. Like: <br /> <br /> When the angels in the place of death, the owner does not seem to care, nor is it bothered by the fact his manager just got to fight with his jug ?? About this person? or that he PUNCHED plays the team by ads on live TV. However, when the team is a game from winning the Division, it gets lowered from form on a story (sucked by a 6 year old) that the manager will receive help from a kid who claims to see real angels. What sounds worse? A violent loss from control manager whose team has lost 15 in a row? Or a coach on the way to the playoffs that will act a little unique and will help foster children? Reaction to the owner does not make any sense. And he moved his mind to change her mind by Maggie and it 'straight out of cliche country' speech during a news conference. The angels are supposed to be playing for the Division in the final weekend against the White Sox, however at the end of the game the announcer keeps saying Angels have won the pendulum. "The pandant does not decide until a person wins the LEAGUE Championship, not the regular title of the seasonal division. <br /> <br /> Whitt Bass, the Goofball pitcher is the starting pitcher and wins the game that breaks the lost track tracks ?? Then the pitcher begins many of today's Today, Mel Clark (Tony Danza) said the ninth guardian had thrown 156 tones, in a low-scoring ballgame. Typically in the game scoring The count of gold is much lower than this, usually around 80-90 tonnes. <br /> <br /> The "AL" angel says the end of "championships must have been on their own", though he and his angels have manipulated and set games throughout the second half of the season. <br /> I could go on and off, as there are many other examples where the story is wrong writing <br /> < For the younger children (under 10), this movie can be fun. It's too bad to make this right could be a classic. Do something like this and it's a forgettable mess that's going to be all time to live as a UHF / night caddy r soft Saturday.
