After reading the book, which has a lot of meaning to me, the movie did not give me any of the feeling that the book was aiming. That made me wonder if Kaufman even loved this book for her successfully doing it in something else.Each that or she is simply bad. What's the most important thing in the lightness? From the very first scene, music teared out most of the dialogue and feeling, and this continues right in the movie. I think the musicians thought that no optimistic music play right in the movie, this would make the story feel light - however they were completely failed here. Instead the music manages to give everything that 'feel movie', in a dramatic event to delay them, so that everything actually feels heavy. <br /> Another example of how this fitting adaptation is not to embed the story line to make it more dramatic. In the movie we see Franz over Tomas in the street, who is on his way to see Sabina. The introduction of this lucky / passing meeting, which sure did not reach the book, gives Tomas the story more meaningful than it does light. <br /> There are many other examples where the continuity of the story has changed, so for the worst, however this might be because the book simply does not convert well into a movie, as is the Kundera style. This will make you wonder if all the recemers generated on this site were written with books and movie experiences in yourself rather than writing about just the movie. A movie that is as long as it is uncompelling. For those who do not read the book again I recommend just reading that. For those who have, I must say you'll just be wasting your time and probably end up here writing clear remains clear-clear.
