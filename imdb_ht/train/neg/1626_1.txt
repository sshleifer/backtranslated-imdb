This movie was back on local TV here in South Africa recently and I thought I would warn even those who enjoy watching B movie cinema (which I did) that this is not even fun. The plot worries a couple of visits to a home country. Some aliens appear and .... The problem is that most of the movie, obviously shooting at the early sixties, consists of extreme extreme shots in people walking, in real time and awfully slowly, from a BB This makes the movie tired of extreme and expects the blood and provocation Gore just never happened. I'm really curious - how many people actually watch this from beginning to end?
