Run away from this movie. Even by B-movie this movie is obnoxious. It is also insidious in its terms. The main theme is that people who reject society and have no respect for anything fresh and worth to admire a prestigious one. Those who treat others who respect are losers. Guncrazy is a movie that speaks for the disenfranchised much better than this movie, seeing it instead. <br /> No normal kid would do that trent. State Troops do not work as they do in this movie etc. Watch this movie to make you realize why writers use the hoker-and-a-heart-of-gold couple. Mija is a completely unsympathetic hooker, who is yes, there was a terrible life. However, it is such an awful audience that the audience can not identify with him. <br /> <br /> Usually there is one thing a movie can recommend, in this case no. It's such a ridiculous film she insults those who are trying to identify with the main characters. The acting adequate by B-film standards and the direction presented is nothing new or interesting.
