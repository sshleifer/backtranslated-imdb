Although there were some fun moments, I thought the film was very lame. The longer he ran, the worse he got. Once the action went into Monument Valley, I found myself watching the magnificent outcroppings more than the increasingly funny and compelling character of the characters. <br /> <br /> The character of the daughter was particularly incoherent. First it's in the deal, then discover the truth and it's grief. Then he came back, then the desert again. Then he returned. There is no apparent motivation for any of its decisions. There were interesting characters, some interesting scenes, and many missed possibilities. I should say the pictures were much less than the sum of its parts. Apparently those who loved Repo Man were inclined to love this one. Researchers 2.0 have no match for the Cheapest.
