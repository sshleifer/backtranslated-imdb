This is at least the third rumor of this movie so if while watching it, there is a sense of already gone, not surprised. All that has been done has changed the environment of the story and tells it differently but the differences are not important. And it does not get any better because the plot is defective to begin with. He never worked. Like the previous, the act is mediocrity. The draw has a unique finish that will surprise anyone who has never seen the movie before but the finish does not fit the story. This movie has ended ten minutes earlier, it would work and was very satisfied and I would think it is more worthwhile. But here is the spoiler and that at the end of the crime pays because the criminal does not hold. I never liked this message from a movie.
