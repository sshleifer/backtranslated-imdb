"Shadrach" was not my favorite kind of movie. I found it overly sensitive and the act was below. Harvey Keitel and Andie MacDowell were good but some of the other actors were not at all credible. I also did not believe that Paul's parents would go and leave him with the Dabney family, especially when they had a housekeeper living in the house. Social classes were too far to consider this credible. It seems Dabney's form is too exaggerated. There was a scene at the start of the movie that showed Andie MacDowell getting out of a car after having sex with someone. Who was it? His son? What was the scene supposed to show us? Why was the same scene included? He had nothing to do with the rest of the movie and was in fact never analyst anymore. It seemed free and not fitting into the story at all. There was too much inconsistency in the film for me. The story about Shadrach was beautiful but I was not convinced that the Dabneys would be as kind and generous as they were described.
