Live! Yes, but it does not kick. <br /> True Story: Some time ago, a Dutch TV station made an announcement that was going on when a new reality show. A contest instead. The main participant in this show would be a woman who died in something horrible and she should give her to one person lucky and progressive kidney failure. For real. The country and international media were all over this story like flies on a turd, saying it was arrogant, immoral, what-this-the-world-coming, and the love. In a way, I agreed. <br /> <br /> As the months passed, the tension builds up to a degree that the government has been especially occupied by the problem of whether they should let this show go forward or not, instead of running the country. <br /> <br /> The show did when and right until the last time they pushed forward. And up to the last moment in the country was raised in arms, the Prime Minister made speeches, each newspaper wrote about it, everyone in the country held their breath. And the network pushes on. Towards a new border on TV. And they definitely succeed in doing just that. The envelope was pushed. <br /> The show reveals, and we're all watching a sick woman terminal choose the right candidate to receive her kid for her or she would live, too, he would die shortly after. <br /> Then, in the past moments of the show it was revealed that it was a partial fake. The woman was not sick, but all the candidates were. There was no kidney auction. The whole show, which, with the advertising and advertising and all the discussions, built up for months to a major fantastic, was an advertising cascade to focus attention on the issue of major shortages of organ donors. The man who founded this network in particular itself was killed in kidney disease. <br /> Now this is TV. Leaving everyone far behind in wonder ... <br /> Do not give me a wrong act, poorly directed movie about some women trying to find a Russian roulette show on American television. si. <br /> <br /> * Spoiler * As if I'll believe they would get this to the FCC. As if I'm going to believe this could be found in the U.S. Supreme Court on the basis of free expression. As if I'm going to believe the ridiculous ending of this woman pulled her and she has awareness because some guy shot herself on air. <br /> It's all done before. See Running Man and Arnold instead. At least he had a good semi finish. <br /> <br /> * Spoiler * This is a malicious piece of movie, along with a ridiculous finish. So it gets injected at the end, that's supposed to make our film public going to feel better after we leave the theater because there are some types of justice? Do not take my word for it, but I would say this: leave this one alone and look at a test model instead, you will get more quality.
