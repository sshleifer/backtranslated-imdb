The movie is full of flashbacks from the first movie Boogeyman as well as, inexplicably, footage from another movie series of Love Brainwaves Uli Lommel / Suzanna. It is framed with some more current (since early 90's anyway) feet which are boring, poorly acting and cheaply injected. Not only the movie almost completely flatback, they float the same floats in the movie. So you see the recycle foot on them and over again, as if you did not see it already. As if the original were not bad enough. I have never seen a movie so padded .... Someone has treated the last dollar out of those films. Total ripoff. And talk about padding ... why do I have to write 10 lines on this garbage? If I can convey that it's trash in 2 lines, that should be enough.
