... and I actually gave it a ZEWO on my 1-10 personal scale. I went to the movies since 1952 and saw well over 1000 in the theater (I'm not the movie rate that I see only on TV). This is the only movie I've ever rated zero. <br /> <br /> My wife and I took our four children (then aged 15, 11, 8 and 6) and even the kids thought it was awful. In fact, it was my daughter (now 26) who alerts me to this site (surprised that the movie got an overall rating of 4+). The animation of the dinosaurs watching amateur at the time (and is even worse in retrospect), the act (particularly by Sean Young) is the atrophy and story line is simply amazing.
