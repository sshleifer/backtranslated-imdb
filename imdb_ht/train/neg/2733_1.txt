I debated as to whether I should tick the spoiler box. Since 99% of this show has probably been previously seen by any follower of Scrubs it probably does not come under the category of a spoiler. <br /> <br /> Clip Show. Grrr. We all knew Friends were going down the tube when they started and clip shows ... and five and a half years of the scrubs went and fell down that hole. <br /> I need to ask if writers just could not bother writing this week and just say themselves "let's show the funny thing." He did not work. <br /> For starters, showing all the time that people fall down is not funny when taken out in context. It's not funny to see Todd hung by her banana Hammock unless we know why she was hung by her banana Hammock. Secondly, for what was supposed to be a compilation of JD's imagination, one was dreaming the Turk, another was not his fantasy, although I forgot that. <br /> <br /> And that's the problem. This episode is totally forgettable. We've seen all these things first. And the collection of clips of those who dance? Why? That's not funny. <br /> Finally, I must admit two of my Scrubs moments I've shown in the last compilation ... Dr. Cox realizes that Ben died ... and JD tells him how proud he is. But even seeing these moments again did not save the episode. The summary says it all. <br /> <br /> Worst episode ever. Bill Lawrence, TANP does not let show you go as friends, keep it cool, keep it funny ... or wrap it.
