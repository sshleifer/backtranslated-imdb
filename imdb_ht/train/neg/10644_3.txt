Well, here we have yet another movie cancellation of role. There was a lot worth looking, despite the tired scheme of unknown sex. However, this one is not. In the previous review, I think I made my point on the general decline of fun for Haim films that followed the late 80's. This is one of them. <br /> <br /> 'Just One of the Girls' is about a high school kid (Corey Haim) who tries to avoid bullies by dressing up like a girl and going to another school. He joins the cheerleader squadron and makes friends with fellow cheerleader, Marie (Nicole Eggert). Obviously, it can not keep the camel too much longer. <br /> I think this film was crap, and it was not even funny. But judging by a majority of reviews, it seems fond of Alanis Morrisette or teenage sex queen, Nicole Eggert, are the only ones who wish to watch this. If you are looking for a feature-rich feature (or role-shooting role), look no further than 1989. This is about the point that Haim career tanks.
