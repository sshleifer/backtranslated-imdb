While I've never been a fan of the original Scooby-Doo (due to its odd production value), it looks like Shakespeare compared to this pile of crap brought to us by Hanna-Barbera! Without a doubt, Scrappy-doo is on the most annoying and terrible characters created for children (and this includes the Teletubbies as well as the Tommy Tapeworm). Who is bright idea to create some sort of short mutant dog and allow him to talk and then seal the scooby-doo characters with it? Anyone who deserves to die or watch this show (I think death is preferable). The bottom line is that the little dog is simply unfunny, annoying and scratching on the nerves - and this is only in the best episodes! After many years, it would be best to just finish the franchise than creating this mess! I can see why in the movie Scooby-Doo live-made Scrappy-Doo's villain - since practically everybody hates him!
