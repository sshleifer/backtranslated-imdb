A romantic vision and fraudulent vision of an average middle-class "artist" and a comfortable elevator ... It is clear that the writer-director never suffered unemployment directly and certainly has no personal experience in her. If you believe that this story is absolutely ridiculous, people who do not work at all ages behave like young, no anger, no fear, no frustration, etc. All the characters live depression the day does not bring pranks, jokes youth. They never look for work, doing almost never rejected experience or heartache, etc. Living on the gentle is just about such a summer vacation in school ... Ridiculous. Especially if you compare it with contemporary chefs in love of Ken Loach, etc.
