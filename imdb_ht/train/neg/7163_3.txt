I asked myself, "Out of all the bad films I could see, I saw myself", "could not I have at least seen one that was fun?" Even though a movie is not quite done terms of act, directing, writing, or having you, it can at least have fun, and therefore worthwhile. But not only is this bad film of artistic value, it's incredibly boring. For a plot of these senses, it moves awfully slowly, with little dramatic tension. At the very least, in a low-brow attempt at entertainment, the deaths of the characters could be cool and / or gory, but the creators of this little failed in the department as well. what movie will it be? Pretty much nothing, unless you find entertainment from watching Christopher Walken, who could have been brilliant, put little effort into his actions that he fell into self-parody mode (why he decided to do this movie anyway?). / <br /> I give this movie 3/10, because God helps us, there have actually been worse movies done before.
