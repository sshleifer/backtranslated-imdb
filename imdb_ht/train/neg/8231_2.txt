WHO IS COMPUTER ... But it can actually be playing ... .. <br /> Five Killers can be summed up in one word .... Amateur. This film is trying to better shape it from most films by Blair Witch 's style of filming .... it does not work .... it just ends up looking and feels like someone has a good video camera walk, wind and decide to make a movie. The story has no explanation, the protagonist is given no real motivation (and looks like a lesbian wearing a power-suit compared to the five girls) and no violence speaks of ... just the sounds of screaming and crunching . The whole movie takes place inside a wind which means decent landscape is out of the question. The five girls really do their best and what they gave, but on the whole come across as beautiful awesome actress ... although the material gives it hard to judge if they can actually be .... to spend film in all screaming, squealing and whimpering .... so that half the time it's hard to make out what's said and the cameras are so bad it's actually hard to say who told it. This video portrayed itself as a violent torture film but is in fact just five girls in a screaming wind of horror ... that literally resumes the movie all ..... then we get to the end then which looks like 5 hours at constant screaming and all five girls are still alive ... with one less finger. Soldiers just got up (get it ... fingers .... LOL) is for the poor actresses who have tried hard and probably lose their voices (with the pride) after making this movie awful. Do not judge this by post .... you will be very let down.
