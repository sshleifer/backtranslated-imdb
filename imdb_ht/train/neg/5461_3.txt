Like all cult TV shows, there is a group of people who like the Twilight Zone so much that they rate practically every episode as they show in greatest EVER. While several of them are indeed wonderful wonders, the truth is for every great episode, there were several who were mediocre and at least one who was crap. However, such dead-hard trekkies, lovers of these areas insist that all of them are gold. In fact, this is what initially got me to review some individual episodes in a couple of couple couples instead of the movies I usually watch. While this is not the worst episode ever made or is it among very worst, it is poor by any reasonable standard. A widow is watching a long procession of civil war soldiers going through his home. In the end, a very unexpected death reveals and does not have a whole lot of excitement or suspension here.
