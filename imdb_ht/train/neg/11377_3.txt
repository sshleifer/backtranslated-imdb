ok. For starters, taxi drivers are amazing. That's not the taxi or amazing driver. what it is bad. but I thought it was funny, which meant he had some kind of royalty. like dialogue ... wow. There were more or less no scheme, the characters were all stupid, and the film was preachy. There were some places I thought the film would plunge into the violence of a taxi driver, which would have hit the message at the end of the film on the hardest. I can not even believe that there are 20 other people who have seen this movie. Yes, it's worth to look if you are real bored and want to reaffirm the fact that anyone can make a movie, or at least try.
