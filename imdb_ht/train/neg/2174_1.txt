It's hard to believe people actually love this twot! I think kids can enjoy it, but I read it kind of kids movie parents can not support them sitting in. Predictable sketch, boring Belushi, and possibly the actress woes young at all times. I'm going to give the director some of the responsibility for the kid, but it's really painful to watch. I feel embarrassed for her now, there are people who know she was reading. When he sang the Star Spangled Banner I turned the sound off - then I came here and discovered they did so because it was Star Search. I always felt Jim Belushi would be disappointed in trading on the name of my wonderful, sad brother, and this crap shows why. Zero stars.
