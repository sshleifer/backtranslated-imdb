I had no real expectations going to this movie and I'm glad. Even though I expected it to be bad I would have been disappointed. <br /> <br /> Where to start? First of all, I think 15% of the film is made of stock footage in the circulating circles of a dark forest. I found it. There are scarecrows. I think the title "Scarecrows" was enough. <br /> <br /> Second, it's not a damn thing that ever explains about the scarecrow and paranormal events. Have too many times left WTF? Third, the movie takes its head seriously. I'm all for a B-movie with blood buckets, women screaming, and unreasonably violent consequences of a simple psychopath or ancient curse. But these movies often know they're B-cinema and even their array, such as Dead Snow (hilarious Scandanavian Zombie Flicker) or Evil Dead 2. But this movie looks like its crapdom subconscious. <br /> <br /> Finally, there should be more blood and / or nodity. Yes, I told her. If you're going to have a crap horror movie, do with the massacre. But if you're going to have one hot and one semi-hot girl, one of them needs to show some side-boob at a minimum. So, as the summary says, skip "Scarecrows" and just poke yourself in the eye. You will thank me.
