Very low-budget police films about homicide detection are trying to solve the murder of a woman with body turning up in a stolen machine in Central Park, and only signs are a tattoo on her arm. Although released by RKO, this has looked at an independent production collected by the studio for distribution. The cast and crew, with some exceptions - among them a young and uncredited Jack Lord, director Edward Montagne and cameraman William Steiner - include unknown comprehensiveness, and it shows. Their performance is universally sub-parade and will not pass the belt in a high school film formation, the direction is stodgy and saccole and, as mentioned previously, there's no any chemistry any between the lead actors. However, despite the many film difficulties, it has a few good points. The location of New York City, with the ultra-low-budget film, gives it a heartfelt authenticity as that of the superior "The Naked City", a shootout in a decent dark decade, and some of the procedures Investigation is intelligent. Otherwise, it's not much to write down at home. It's worth a look, however, for a preview of the sections sectioned in New York City in the early 1950s, and the ex-cars buffs will be ecstatic to see the hosts in the '30s and' 40s car in the streets. > <br />.
