Serom is on a crazy doctor who finds a serum that supposes all diseases of the power of the mind. Instead, it creates some kind of monster that needs to feed human body and brain. The mad doctor creates some zombie from cadavers and has some problems. There is a very long lead to all the action and lots of scenes getting you know with the characters. The nephew doctor's wife gets into a car accident and the Mad Doc attempts to use his new serum on the boy. The results are not good. This is a C and OK class movie acting but there are some issues that are leading to some continuous mistakes. There is not much zombie action in this one and the effects, while adequate, they have nothing special. You can fast forward in slow parts and get some fun out of the action stage. Watch out for some nudity and bad language.
