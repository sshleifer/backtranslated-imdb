The genre of suspension film really takes a dip in this one. The big problem is impossibility. I realize that you need to create difficult situations that would cause suspense and the feeling of tension in what will happen next, but this movie was so predictable, and it's just not credible. I find that more I watch this kind of movie, the more I always say things to actors to direct them away from danger. Continue to make bad decisions just about the borders. If they took the time to make it more realistic, I might have loved it a little. When you said that, you might better stay away from this one.
