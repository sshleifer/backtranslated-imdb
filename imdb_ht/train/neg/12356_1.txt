Watching this movie was a waste of time. I was tempted to leave in the movie, but I resisted. I do not know what Ridley Scott intended, but I learned that in the army, women get as stupid as men. They learn to spit, to insult and fight in combat, and that's also a waste of time (in my opinion). And, anyway, what the hell was the scene in Libya? Are they still fighting Gadafi or is it easy for anyone to believe Islamic people are always dangerous?
