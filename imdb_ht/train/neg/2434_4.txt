Realistic film, sure, except for the fact that the characters do not seem to be scared. When Billy Zane tries to kill someone, she feels bad ... but does not look like that. That is why I do not like his performance in this film. Tom Berenger is again playing a soldier. No good thrill, realistic sequence. Do not always shoot, that's a big thing. Well filmed. I hated the helicopter's sequence, causing one terrorist to kill almost the entire marine batch ... I give it ** and a half from *****
