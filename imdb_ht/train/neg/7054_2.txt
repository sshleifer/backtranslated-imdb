This film was absolutely pathetic. A merely and lack of any story just let me look at three drool bites on Baby Bikini. Sometimes I felt I was watching an episode of Beavis and Butthead. I did not even sit in the entire movie. Emran Hashmi disappears, and Hrshitta Bhatt is not impressive at all. Celina Jaitley was not bad. The only refreshing part of the film is the story of Anu Malik and his mani in Shayaris. It was very hilarious. The songs "Sin Ne" and its remix version were really good. You can always count on lip-blocked eyebrows and lip-synching a board. All in all, it looks like Emran does not have a good script from Bhatts to come back up this time.
