This movie is terrible. They act is a waste basket. No weeping, no action, hopeless songs. Though the landscape is great. I have always wanted to go to Greece. <br /> <br /> Anyway, as for Saif, you would expect a great performance, but even it has been released. <br /> <br /> Akshay Kumar, recognized as the puppet of Bollywood and the Singhs voice. It was sensational in this film. For only this performance, Filmfare should present another award. Bathroom awards for the worst performance. By the way the trophy would be a toilet seat. <br /> <br /> Kareena Kapoor. It's first of all not comparable to her Karisma sister. In acting, in looks, or in body. She now wants to prove to herself that she surpasses her. He comes to this film to wear the bikini with tank tops and short shorts. I really wonder why Saif Ali Khan is leaving his wife's clothes-to be dressed like that. But it must be impressed by some who dress like that. But if you ask how, then consider every person who has a ship watching this movie. They dream of having Kareena Kapoor in naked beds with a condom. Including me. Personally I think she dressed as a whore, but I really love her. <br /> I'm forced to give it a 1/10, but I would really give this movie a 0/10. An unassieved movie.
