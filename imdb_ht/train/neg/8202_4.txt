Is it a remake of the thing (1982/1951), I think it is, there are many factors out of the movies before they deny it. So the act is bad, James Spader makes a superlow stargate re-deduction of himself, with his cupboard cup and thinking another strange / movement but that's about it, other actors I have not even noticed. You do not get the feeling to know anyone in the main characters. With the evolving draw is slow, boring and, yah i know what's about 30 min. Notes / music is ultraboring, eyeman has lots of abertallented people out there who scored for a coke with a credit, but this is the biggest crap. Some of the special effects are beautiful, if it's done in the early 90's. If you like Alien Slimy, Thrill and Emotion, do not make this movie. It's a dull combination of this, alien 3, epidemic and some Jerry Bruckheimer / Michael Bay production goes really really bad. Now, this combination would be cool if salmon knew what they are doing, and that's just about this production that knew what was, no one. Even though I've seen far worse, I would not recomend this movie for anyone, but if you are one cold night, and just want to glance in something, it will pass the time, slowly.
