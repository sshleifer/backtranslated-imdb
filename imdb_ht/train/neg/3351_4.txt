Effects (generally) not generally possible in the real world but in the world of Hollywood renewal, not only is it possible, it is necessary. The haunt was provided courtesy of the computer treatment of a first-class cinematographer-turner-director who had once shown promises (Jan Bont Speed) but has since produced a great deal of budget expenditures (twists, speeds 2). <Br /> <br /> Actor is useless to a movie of this type and seems to realize it. Liam Neeson and Cathrine Zeta-Jones act as they wish they were anywhere but in this movie. Lili Taylor makes an attempt to add something to the procedures but also something that might be unknown since the script feels like half of it missing. Events just happen, good and bad ghosts show up with no rhyme or reason and then the story just ends with an event that does not satisfy that event does not mean to wrap up 90 minutes before in unanimity. Not even the reason to see this for the effects since we all know that anything can be put on screen now. Why not look at the service of a good story instead of just for their own?
