This was a blind buyer used DVD. It totally kills a nice buzz I've gone when I hit playing. <br /> It's bust-led comedy, but it's up. squalid. The plot is ZANY!, But the characters do things in each other that are so petty and disturbed and readily understood I finally found it depressing to look. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the box brought me to expect something more than an unmatched, hottie film. (I know, I know, the quotes on the box and Nomination nomination Academy do not mean anything.)
