I usually only write reviews for my movies I really or really liked. And, as you can probably say in the number of stars up, I did not like it. From now on, I suppose you read about the plot or maybe even see the movie, so I'll skip the summary. Let's break this down, advantage and pitfalls: <br /> <br /> Account: The concept: The cited set up to be interesting. Use disorder theory as a theme was interesting. However, it was not carried out well. Correcting me if I'm wrong, but it seems to me that disorderly theories were misleading. The event that occurred in the film seemed more like convincing coincidence than anything. I guess the effect of the Butterfly was represented by all "God (which) causes tsunami to bring back status." The presentation comes as really sloppy though. Some people call this intelligent, but it just seems to be another action movie movie .. <br /> <br /> History: Is it just me, or it seems that Kamal just drives this together to give Is it an excuse to play ten roles? The plot is very understandable; Govind kept losing the bottle many times in the dark accident (his friends just got mixed up the flask and a packet he had sent to India, a crazy old lady just going to throw the bottle in an idol, halved Just to unexpectedly encounter at the same hospital, and the case with the idol just reached mix with one that belonged to a famous singer.) CGI: O God, the CGI. It was even worse than the special effects of Jaws 3, and those who sucked. Right now, I could say that the parties were hosted. Even my ten-year-old cousin knows that underwater cars do not seem like that. <br /> <br /> Now, I'm now realizing that the action scenes of Tamil movies are not realistic, but the cascades of this one were surprised and actually distracted me from the story. up: I have to admit, they did a better job than expected. I thought Kamal should play people with the same skin tone, so two guys white guys and fake Japanese Aikido guys keep me in custody. However, it was still very bad, I could easily tell what was wearing masks. <br /> <br /> The songs: The music has been distracted and out-of-place in many cases. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It was loud, dignified, and obsessed irony on that idol. I actually find myself wanting to die. <br /> <br /> Draw Hole and Logic Fridge: Let me find that right: a monkey laboratory was smart enough to get past a password-locked door, but not smart enough to tell the difference between a bar of chocolate with a flask and a deadly virus in it. Then an ex-CIA agent who's after the face of the vial appears to have headed for India. Instead of following it immediately, she married a first pole dancer. A famous singer pandjabi and cancer check in a small town hospital in the third world when he could easily afford the best medical treatments available. In addition, it gets injected into the throat with a bullet. You would think he might kill, but instead, there is the magic bullet clear his tumor. You read this right, a BULLET hit out the tumor. <br /> <br /> For ... Character of Naidu: Perhaps only part of the movie was his comedy.
