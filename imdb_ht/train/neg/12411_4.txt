There was a lot of sinister really great products in the sixties - but this movie certainly is not one of them! It's a shame The child is not as best as it works in a decent idea that takes in a couple of horror stories of success. We have the idea of ​​a vengeful child, who worked well in classical films such as the bad seed and then we have the central zombie theme, which of course has been the backbone of many a successful horror movie. The plot is basically this: young girl blames a charge of people for the death of her mother, so she goes to the graveyard and rises to death to take revenge (as you do). This is all good and good, except for the fact that it's boring! Nothing happens for most of the movie, and although it's picking up the end with some nice gore; it's not enough of a final justified sitting at the rest of it. The film was obviously shot on a budget as where to look cheap and all the actors are garbage. There's really not much I can say about the movie in general as there is not much of it. The child is a quarter succession succession quarter and I certainly do not recommend it.
