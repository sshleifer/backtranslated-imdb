A friend once asked me to read a scenario in her that was optional by a movie studio. To say it was one of the most stupid and asapid scripts I'd ever would be a bold lookout. But I never told him that. Why? Because of a world where films like "While It Out" can be green-lit and attract an Oscar-winning star like Kim Basinger, a lack of character, content and common sense is no guarantee that it will not be sold. br> <br /> As many other reviews have been pointed out, "While It Out" is a scruffy under-writing woman-in-peril movie that abused Basinger housewife pursued by four easy cracks on Christmas Eve. Each fatty is legitimate, from the weak and bad dialogue to the jaw-dropping effect of logic, but Basinger is such an exciting actress and the quote is not without promises. Here is a couple of things that hit me: <br /> 1) I do not care how much we are supposed to think her husband is a jerk, the house is a mess and toys. Since child abuse has been made for children to pick up after themselves? <br /> 2) Various rallies are rallied everywhere except Hollywood, where they usually only balance the balanced sounds on the screen. <br /> 3) Make sure the movie is stupid. But these are unmistakably the "scandals" I sat in where women are described as pleading, negligent victims of male sadism. Stupid or not, I find it refreshing to see a woman getting better at his tormentors. <br /> 4) I like the finish! 5) Even though an earlier review invented this phrase, I really think that this film should be retitled "The Red Tool of Doom."
