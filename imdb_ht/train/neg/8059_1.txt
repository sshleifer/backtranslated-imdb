This film concerns a young girl, Cassie, (Melissa Sagemiller) who leaves her family and heads off to become a ninth college. One night Cassie and her friends decided to go to a wild party with lots of drinks and dancing and Cassie is riding with her boyfriend who loves her, but never told her she liked him. As Cassie drove, a car was stopped in the middle of the road and she was able to avoid an accident and as a result there was a blood loss in life with her boyfriend. Cassie gets very emotionally angry and she has nightmares that cause she has delusions about her boyfriend coming back to life and meeting people trying to kill her and she struggles to find out who his real friends, who want to die it will and will survive all of this whole horror therapy. Cassie's dream was made love by her boyfriend after she died and she found another guy in her bed and said he asked her to make love. This is a way out movie, and not very good at all.
