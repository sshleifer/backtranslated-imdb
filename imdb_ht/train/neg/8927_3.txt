Myron Breckinridge (Rex Reed !!!) gets a gender change from a physician (John Carradine - drunk dead) and comes out like Myra (Raquel Welch). She then decided to destroy male masculinity (or something like that) and the proceeds taught film stories in a college act run by lecherous John Huston (not asking) and broke up a young happy couple (young, beautiful, hunky Roger Ms. and Farrah Fawcett - yes Farrah Fawcett's). They took a great novel by Gore Vidal who was unfilmable, and, of course, tried his movie. They also hired an English guy with an anti-American drug attitudes and hired a bunch of actors and skeptics (Welch, Reed) and embarrassing old professionals (Huston, Carradine, Andy Devine, Jim Backus, Mae West), throw it all together with .... SURPRISE !!! An absolute disaster. The film received an X rating in its release (it was lowered to a R), especially because of a really tasty scene of Welch sodomizes Rusty (Roger Herren) and a scene from which Welch attempts to have sex with Fawcett. <br /> <br /> The movie is very scattershot ... Scene jumps all over the place with those who say and do things that make no sense. It's not good at all, but I've never been bored. <br /> <br /> Acting varied wildly ... Reed is horrible ... really sad. Huston wet the landscape again and again and again in an extreme nauseating. Which is actually not bad as Myra but its line makes no sense for you never know what to do in it. West is hardly in the film (a blessing) and it really kind of hearing a woman almost 80 year old crap about sex. Roger Herren (whatever happened ...) was very young, beautiful and not as bad as Rusty. Fawcett is OK. <br /> It's hard to find things to say about that ... you just look at it in disbelief. A must see movie - believe !!!!
