KING KONG VS. GODZILLA (1963; which I note has rated BOMB) was my introduction to Honda's cult director's work; this one is not necessarily better ?? It's just that I've learned to be more tolerant towards lowbrow intrinsecrative fare! <br /> <br /> Here, we actually get two Kongs for the price of one: A giant ugly and dopey-looking giant and a robot variation of it looks even worse! The Cycle animal lives on the island of Mondo (!) ?? where she shows to fight a couple of other monsters, and befriends a trio of people. Of course, it falls for the blonde heroine (and well); In fact, more intriguing is a fatal femme of cahoots and genius warriors? call Dr. Who and Athletes look at anemic and cape usually associated with a vampire !! <br /> It kidnapped King Kong and hypnotizes it in order to retrieve the X element, which is integrated into the ice wastes of the North Pole; Apparently, a giant giant is more waterproof in radiation than its mechanical counterpart (and, to ensure its complete co-operation, Who even captures his three 'companions')! The female agent then has a change of heart, helping the heroes (one of whom, typically, is a freelance American) and who died by Who. Kong eventually overnight and make it to Tokyo, where he has a final confrontation with the robot. The doctor is running the destruction of the sub in his sub? which, upon a request by the Dreamgirl Kong, is summarily trashed by the giant Mark.
