This movie should never have done. From the wrong animation make, to further acting act. I'm not sure at what point people behind this movie said, "Ok, look good! Lets do it!" I was in awe of how to truly seize this movie. At one point, which can very well be the worst point, a computer generated sand saber of gold fell from the roof to wrest the idiot creator of the cats in the mouth ... uh, ooookkkk. The villain of the movie was a paralyzed sandstone that died in minutes in its first appearance. The other two managed to kill a handful of people before they were burned and shot down. Then there is one random wait for victims of the jungle ... that scared me for one reason. Will There Be A Part Of? God, for the sake of people everywhere I hope not. <br /> <br /> This movie was more garbage. From credit score dodging points in the slide show ends.
