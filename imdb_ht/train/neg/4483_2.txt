I'll admit that I liked the first one, and he's really looking forward to the end. <br /> <br /> I left down. Ensuring the special effects were technically amazing - but they were not credible looking. She looks more like a cartoon. Well, I admit to sympathy 80% of the Chase scene - but the fight with all Mr Smiths? It was too obviously animated. <br /> I can accept it all. What I can not accept is that partial non-action was crap. Whenever Morpheus opened her mouth, I knew I was in for a talk that went on forever and meant nothing ... <br /> I was also disappointed with the little sketch that existed. What this movie told us that there was no truth in the first film (except on the existence of the uterus). This movie was a bit like seeing the episode in DALLAS where you find that all the previous season was a dream. I want $ 7.00 back!
