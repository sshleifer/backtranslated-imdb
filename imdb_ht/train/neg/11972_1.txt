The first ten minutes of "Just Looking" really dictate the most direction in this movie. Lenny (Ryan Merriman) is a 14 year old boy living in New York in the '50s. She has a burning desire to see people who have sex. Who is the best person he has in mind? Well, her mother and stepfather of course! How nice. Unfortunately for Lenny, he was caught before seeing nothing and sent to the summer to stay with his uncle and his uncle's wife. Lenny's next plan is to see his uncle and his wife having sex. However, the wife is quite pregnant and is not currently sleeping together. Then Lenny makes a new friend. He and his friends spend most of their free time hanging around a couple of girls. They have a small club where all they do sit and talk about sex. The problem is ... it does not make in an innocent, spacious 1950s sort of way. I have no pride by any means, but I found it rather disturbing to listen to these kids talking about masturbation, blowjob and anal sex. This kind of practice can work in a movie like "Kids" (1995) but in this movie it just seems perverted. <br /> <br /> Gretchen Mol is utterly wasted here like Hedy, an ancient arm template that becomes the object of Lenny's carnival desire. Jason Alexander needs to stay as far away as the director's chair as possible. "For Best or Worst" (1996) was terrible and now this. What a waste. 1/10
