This is one of the worst films I've ever seen *! It is bad, even in the standard television movie standard. The plot is diabolically flawed, and the names known in this film are wasted on confused, uncertain characters. I do not know how the director managed to keep this excuse in a movie together - it is that bad. Reports as a 'thriller movie' thrill - it is certainly terrible. There is nothing surprised about it. And it could make you Psychological damage! The initial opening scenes held these promises - a possible engagement on whether the soul is just an aspect of the brain, but the utterances that follow the car-crash scene are beyond belief. No matter how hard you try, you could not care less about the characters. There are many ideas that have been poured out on this film to better a collage of sentences disconnected from Chinese philosophers, and at the worst movie would actually make you go to dead brain! <br /> I bought over 300 movies on DVD, and this is the first one I'll get my money back on. STEP CLUB.
