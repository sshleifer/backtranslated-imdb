I had the pleasure of watching this movie early and I said I thought he was going to be boring and wondering how they could ever improve on the 1984 version of Bachelor Party starting Tom Hanks, which I thought was pretty good ... I was good ... In all honesty I thought it could be better ... Be sure to have some funny moments but it just did not seem to hit the mark with me ... The act OK with the scenario very well followed the original, but I think it could be so much better ... This movie I'd say is for teens and teens at heart; full body of women, alcohol and sex ... It's just another typical run of the mill part film made over and over again. 4/10 is my vote for this one.
