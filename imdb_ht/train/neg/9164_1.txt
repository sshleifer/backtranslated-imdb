I must prefer this not to say I'm a big boyfriend. Hence I really wanted to like this movie. So I write my thoughts to save the rest of you into the disappointment I felt watching it. The last year tells the story of Li-Ann's destination that falls to Jeremy following and commits to meet each year's growth. A very romantic site, based on a great short story and a cast that does not feel like watching another Jack neo flicker. Then why oh why is it so bad? First of all, I felt that the filmmakers thought they had shot a music video, because they chose to replace storytellers with all true emotions and cheesy installations, predictive actions and clicking lines. I am both upset and embarrassed being one of the first in Singapore to watch the growth years, but those of us in the cinema would agree that muffled complained of the creative-deserved performances spoken merchants. My hope was to watch a romantic movie that would surpass Forever Fever, the Singaporean romance comedy so far, and the years that have not even come close. Some blogs have called him the crap years that are harsh but ultimately true. Do not waste your money or emotions like I did. The film will make you give up on love forever.
