Boy-girl loves artifacts / sequences and songs, only this time it's the punkette and it is the right arrow. Movie-buffs are out there like this movie? He has fans? I must say, the coil idea ... "Grease 2" is a really blunt venture that does not even have the courage, moxy or absolute gall to take memory from its predecessor down to flames (such as "Mash 2" or "Exercise II "). No, it's whimpers together in slow-motion and often just play dead. It looks like it feels cheap, and a big throw loses in the middle of the room and handles flaws. This was the first time a substantial audience received a glimpse of Michelle Pfeiffer and, although he did not embarrass himself, it's a worthwhile role. A misfire on the lowest level. NO STARS from ****
