As some other comments show, this movie can hurt you, when you are a toddler. (And that's probably all it's good for). <br /> However, if you're older, this movie only does one thing: bigger sucking - and so I do not mean acting, its soundtrack, cut or s.th. so. I simply talk about the "plot" (if you can call it that). <br /> <br /> I do not want to give any more than needed (if after reading this, you really still want to watch this movie) but if you graduate In any school, this is just a great insult to your intelligence. When watching this, I was stunned most of the time, because what happened was just that stupid. This includes: <br /> -for the unity (an evil unions association) <br /> - we are just supposed to believe it's wrong. Is it even wrong at all? if so: why is it wrong? <br /> - The mark of evil in the form of a tattoo <br /> - There is no need to impose this on the people, so why the hell (no pun intended) are they doing it? <br /> <br /> - The invitation of Christ in your heart simply as lip service <br /> - because nothing anybody, who in this movie is considered "a real Christian" ever doing, besides saying stupid prayers. So ... just say that prayer before rapture and you are saved - no matter what! <br /> So, rating 1/10
