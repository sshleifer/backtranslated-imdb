Absolutely the most boring movie I've ever spent my money on. This was a bad choice for all those great garbage reputations. Boring! boring! boring! Each character has been described in less way than inspiration. No talent acting shows - judging a party. Alec can play realistic characters normally, Gwynyth has made himself look ugly for an unrewarding party, Annette needs to advise on how to choose the films he chooses to play in like to make all the big stars that have left me shamed in the path In fact, they were all inclined to be smothered into a feature that leaves much to be desired in entertainment. "Running with scissors" leads the public to anticipate great acting in a movie that suggests having strains and deep emotions. There was not one moment when the cast could show any interpretation on the screen. Maybe it was the fault director ---- regardless.
