I never saw any of Spike Lee's films, just as the trailer never caught my interest. I saw, and admired Denzel Washington, and the work of Jodie Foster, and they have several of the DVDs. I was, however, entirely disappointed with this movie. If this movie is any indication of Spike Lee's ability as a director, my advice should "get a job," and stop wasting time and talent from others. <br /> I am surprised if some of the other IMDb comments look at the same movie as I would see. I can only assume that, from the lovelorn van reviews, the adoration of Spike Lee was the blind in the banality of this piece of work. I only pay $ 2.50, in a "second run" theater, and always feel I'm wasting my money. <br /> <br /> IMDb "Trivia" page tells it all ....... <br /> <br /> * "Shot in 39 days" - How can you expect to shoot a big budget " blockbuster ", (like the promised media hype), in such a short time? Do not be surprised to have such a weak performance at all. <br /> <br /> * "Ron Howard was the first to go directly to the film ..." - He could do this project some justice, given more time to do so of course. Though the writing was atrocious, the quote contained some merits. <br /> <br /> OK! maybe not. I'm uninhabited! This movie was so upset with pitifulness, unplausible scenes, and disgracefulness, that maybe even he could not have done much of it. (Hey Ron! Be sure to thank Russell ... Good call!) "Jodie Foster filmed her in three weeks." - And it was shown! His portrayal of a "fixer", who makes the people's problems go, was as incredible as the script he gave. Did he even want to be there? Other <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> would be better kept away ... or else? <br /> <br /> * When "Frazier Detective", (Denzel Washington), the bank enters the verification of no corps again, how many bank robbers, without a gun, would have "directed" a cop, much less "left" a cop) back from the front door, allowing the police officer to walk behind him? <br /> <br /> * Det. Frazier later claiming, was given the thief "all the reasons to shoot me." Why, then, in brief reading, did he not even try to expose the thief's face? This might have the answer that he was looking for ... a thief would have shot him just to prevent later identification. And why did he get "Steve, Stevie, Steve-O", (accomplice the thief), long to come and help? <br /> <br /> * I understand that these were not robbed of your typical bank. They had a different agenda, and did not want anyone injured. But the cops had no reason to think that they would not. They were a desperate situation. Why then, when two of the bad guys stepped out to "pick up pizza?" They were not taken down. (First, how many thieves would come out without using a hostage as a shield? Is this Spike Lee version of NY City, or the SNL?). Taking them down has reduced the bad guy's numbers, targeting up their plans, and the remaining robbers would have most likely been given. If not, there should be at least few bad guys inside. (Give SWAT something to do, or send them home!) * Which police department in this country would allow Madeline White, (Jodie Foster), just Walz right in the bank, and discuss a problem with theft, that he would not disclose them first? He had no authority, no governmental qualifications; And besides, this was after all, "already" a hostage situation ... add one more? <br /> <br /> * Why would not the CEO Bank, (Christopher Plummer), just have destroyed the documents confronting a longtime? Screw sensibility! The diamonds, it could be sold. Who was that "schmuck", (the character, by the actor), and accent in Jersey, who, readily, volunteered, said he knew the recording was "100% Albanian," but he himself did not can speak it ..... SIR! Put your hands down! And his ex-wife! What a "sick" he was !!! Both were totally unbelievable. <br /> <br /> * When suspect interrogation, why did it. Frazier, always bothers who was obviously not part of the heist? (Ie - said the elderly woman she could go, and then she could not, then could; then , could not?) Give me a break! Who, after seeing the bank robbers asked for the hostages to put on jumping jumps, could not inferior escape plan included coming out of the bank pretending to be some of the hostages? <br /> <br /> * Near the end of the movie, a fake wall was constructed in the spare room, behind which Clive Owens hiding out for "a week" ... where did the materials come from in? (the drywall & pole). It was also to be assumed that they cut into the sewer, so he could relieve himself. The bank employees did not complain about the center, all week long? Hello! <br /> * After such a reliability; Since the documents were "handed over to the robber, what kind of" referral "was Ms. White waited to get out of the CEO bank, seeing that he was now to be a target for blackmail, due to his failure? <br/> <br /> * And last but certainly not least, what's with the "Glide Electric" that Denzel did? HOW STUDE! Was this supposed to "settle" him to lead these guys right? He looked, rather, like a man who jumped a ride on a shopping cart, while trying to prevent a bowel movement! "Cheeee Zheeee" !!!! <br /> <br /> Other than the mediocre scheme; lousy script; bad actions; and overall durable LED ... yada, yada, yada. <br /> <br /> We hope this will provide insight into the movie to help others decide if they will waste their money or not! <br /> <br />
