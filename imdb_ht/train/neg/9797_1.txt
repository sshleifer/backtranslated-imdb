Nowadays it is sort of a tendency to look at all shows from beginning to 90 as classic (people are so easily blinded by nostalgia these days), and while some of these shows were / are undoubtedly Well, this one is just crap. I watched this show a lot back in those days since she got a lot of reruns on TV back then, and as a kid I did not like it. Even an old 8-year-old can see the number of people in Power Rangers overacting, and how much the special FX-sucked back then. When the show does not resort to the 'battle'-scenes are painfully, it's plagues the viewer and this soap-opera is needed on a group of teens and their little social problems now and then. I do not know about you, but I did not give a rat ass on any of this at all, and basically filler it until they have 'fought' some dude again into a very cliche of foreign costumes and fireworks or some toys - robot. You never feel 'involved' in some ways with this show, and the fact that most of the actors act like having really no interest at all besides the strollers just improving lack of feeling. /> There is really nothing memorable about this show, and its wonderful surprise is that it has received many turn-offs (Beetleborgs is a good example). All it is just a quick way to make some money though. I challenge any 'fan' tell me what exactly means from episodes that are supposed to be so good because I could not find anything that is even a little appealing to the kids. I guess that most of 'fans' of Rangers may be telling me that I "just do not get it" anyway, or something along that line. I really do not care though; This was crap back then and still crap right now.
