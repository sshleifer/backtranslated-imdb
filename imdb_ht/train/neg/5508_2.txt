Tim (Gary Daniels) wants to desperately break into serious TV reports. When a job was required, she was fired. Her lovely handsome girlfriend (Elizabeth Hurley) says sayonara, too. Coming home, Tim surprised to discover his home has an uninvited visitor (Christopher Lloyd) from Mars! Calling her Uncle Martin, Tim soon try to help her new friend surf life on earth. But Martin gets into trouble everywhere he goes, from the toilet in the laundry room and more. Lovely Lizzie (Daryl Hannah) finally sees an opportunity to make time with Tim, but the course of true love does not run smoothly in this case, either. Soon all of the television will follow Tim, hoping for a story about a true stranger. What does a man do? For those who love the old television show of the same name, and Bill Bixby and Ray Walston, this film is not worth the tied proverbial boots. It really, undoubtedly terrible, with no plot and a reliance on supposed special effects that fall flat, too. Daniels is okay as earthling but Lloyd is simply awful as the alien, overacting up a storm. The rest of the cast is adequate, as is the costume, wear, and detailing details. Even if your children see the cover and beg their films, convince them to choose another flick of the video store. Sure, children and adults will find this movie a mammoth, so opt for a night at the museum or around the world in 80 days instead.
