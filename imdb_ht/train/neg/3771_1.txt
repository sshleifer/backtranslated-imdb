This has to be one of the worst films in the 1990s. When my friend & I watched this movie (the target audience was targeted) we just sat down and looked at the first half an hour and our jaw touched the floor of how bad it really was. The rest of the time, everyone else in the theater just started talking to one another, leaving or generally crying in the popcorn that they actually paid their money had workers and looked at this weak excuse for a movie. It must have seemed a great idea of ​​paper, but on film it seems no-one of the movie has a sign that goes on. Crap aji, costume crap. I can not get through how embarrasing this is to look. Save yourself an hour & a bit of your life .........
