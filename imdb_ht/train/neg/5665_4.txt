This rough brutal adaptation in short story Borges is typical Cox. Its strong sense of visualism is, as usual, undocted by half the heated hustle acting most of the cast. The film is definitely in the surreal tradition in the Mexican period Bunuel, and appears at times as a poor man taking over Lars von Trier's Element of Crimes. Cox's apparent opinion for one take, cut off, and ambient sound recording all works against the film's effectiveness. Worth a look but ultimately disappointing.
