This movie has some nice sets and Albert Finney does a good job as the ruthless father. The movie fails because Jennifer Jason Leigh is too barking like the daughter and has no match for Olivia De Havilland's far more nuanced, mature rendering of the Heiress (1949). The fascist film feminist conflict goes against the hardest conclusion of the novel, Washington Square, author of Henry James, really parodied feminist in some of his other novels. As a fan of Hollywood old and great literature, I found this film very disappointing.
