My wife and I both agree that this is one of the worst movies ever made. Certainly in the top ten of these I've watched all the way off. At least "Plan 9" was enjoyable. <br /> I really enjoyed "Christine", "Dead Zone", "Firestarter", "Carrie", and some of his other films. I did not care much for "Cujo" (only because the sound was so bad on the versions I saw and I often could not say what people said), or "Pet Sematary (Pet Cemetery)". > <br /> But this mess was a total mistake in every possible way. The "Creatures" themselves looked like a 9-year-old. (No offense for 9-year-olds). Even "one-piece material" made you groan and did not remotely entertained.
