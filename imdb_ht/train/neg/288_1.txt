There was nothing of value in the original movie, this one was even lamer. The fact that I even found it to rent was absolutely amazing. Anyone connected to this movie has to be high on something! So what was the story line? What was the girl? The viewer was supposed to find the story line in the first four minutes of the movie. Unfortunately, I tried several times to watch it. I even borrow a kid from someone to get some feedback. Kid said she was stupid, and she was four years old. I find that possibly some credit could go to the film director, as possibly some of the shots made the movie more than a movie B. That might push it. I liked the theme song. Good thing it was only a dollar, it was worth it. I think you could enjoy the movie if you were high as the cast and crew would do. Is legal skin in France?
