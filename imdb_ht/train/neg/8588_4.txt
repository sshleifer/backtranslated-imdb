Revenge of the Sith starts out with a long, impressive sequence of impressive action, then becomes really boring for the next hour and fifteen minutes, and the same terrible dialogue with math machinations that have plagued on the rest of the prequel series. The only thing that improves the procedures is the slow - and I mean slow - build-up of what we know will be the birth of Darth Vader. But then finally comes, it's pretty all right. Not great. Not even good. But pretty all right. This film was largely over-praised because it does not skip the high sky like the previous ones. Instead it's just turgid, dull, and routine. But you have to say, wow, these CGI settings are really impressive at times. Is the Battle Lightsaber? They are all a disorderly disorder. I think the dark side took hold of Lucas when it started these prequels and no one noticed. This will make a ton of money, but thanks to it, this once-worshiped franchise has been knocked down enough. I saw the show at 12:01, and then I heard a group of very young children say, wow that was awesome! But everyone who has more than eight complained the same thing: I fell asleep among them. It was kind of boring. I just thought the birth of Darth Vader would be better. So, told us all.
