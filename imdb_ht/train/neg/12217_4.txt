As Indies budget low goes, you'll usually find that you get what you pay for, and let me just say, I did not pay much for "Frightworld" ... <br /> <br /> Writers / Directors : David R. Williams brings us the story of an abandoned entertainment park, besieged by the vengeful mind of a serial killers. Not a good site, but executed with a savvy of low budget mistakes. The camera work tries to be too stuck to his audience, not always being used to worrying rapidly-cutting to cover the fact that they really have nothing to gory or scary to show us. This becomes evident right to cut off the bat, as we are introduced to the ta-killer, and soon realize that (acting) is the most effective thing ... After a temporary title of tragic times we have brought back in time modern, yet acting is the same. "Frightworld" generates some unique scenarios when displaying scenery from indoor-fun, but with a very long time running time, it can not save the movie out of it from the medium to hell. Some mediocre nude, but not much for Gore, which is virtually grace saving for these types of films. <br /> <br /> Fans of Real Real Movies B can find something in interest here, otherwise, do not spend much money.
