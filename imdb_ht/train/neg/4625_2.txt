How can 4 out of 16 voters before giving this movie a 10? How could more than half the voters be given a 7 or higher? Who vote here? I can only assume it is mostly children - very young teenagers. The fact is that this is a bad movie in every way. The story is stupid; The act is difficult to think of as acting; Characters are characters; and the dialogue is awful. I saw one afternoon rhyme on the Sci-Fi Channel. In the sad event that it is ever reconstruction, I suggest you read a book instead.
