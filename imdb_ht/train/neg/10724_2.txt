This is the perfect example of something big will be awfully bad ... hence, can I advise anyone watching it? Well, I was January required by the fact that at the competition was tiff (I still can not believe it was) .. and I only stayed until the end because the director had for a q & a section. also anything but interesting .. what's it about? The very first half (worth watching one) features three characters: a hooker, a musician and some kind of official .. the first lies on their profession .. But the third is the actor in the liar .. the second half (done something else..that ruin a good evening) includes some old breasts and heavy drinks .. but maybe you'll see it completely different ... the tiff jury (have been drinking vodka?)
