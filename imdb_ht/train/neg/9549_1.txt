I asked why John Wood did not play Dr. Falken until I watched the movie. BAD scheme, bad science, bad act and in general a bad movie. Please do not watch this movie. Rent the original "War Games" if you feel nostalgic. <br /> I did not like the bending of the beat-terrorist-conspiracy conspiracy idea of ​​either. In the first WO.P.R film was built because Russia had 1000s of headlines pointing to US.A. In this movie the idea behind the computer killed terrorist in their previous training is a threat. Aside from politics, one of the best films on the movie was the highlight that even a stupid computer can grasp the idea of ​​the war impediment in the end. No insight is offered in this movie.
