Gentlemen, sexy women, many swearing, and a most compelling monster that rises from the depths of a polluted lake. You would think "Monster" would be fun ... but it's not, really. It makes Tony Tony Eisley and John Carradine stars, however, and in my book that makes it worth watching at least once. In an interview with "Fangoria" in 1987, Eisley recalled that Herbert Strock has led many of the film, but a record by Kenneth Hartford - who only led the foot to present his children Andrea and Glenn (portrait of the character named Andrea and Glenn, to a particularly inventive turn) - receive full credit. Considering how horrible end result, Strock was probably happy that he was not credited! "Monster" has the look and feel of a mid-to-late television movie late-sixty, which is why I like to leave it on the background of each so often. As his entertainment fell flat on his face, but as a reminder of another age and a kind of film-making disappear, it's very effective. The only thing missing is a chasing machine.
