Why Hollywood feels the need to notice the films that were so brilliant first (The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Hills have Eyes) but it is remarkably worse why Hollywood feels the need to notice those horror movies that were not brilliant to start with ( Prom Night, Horror in Amityville) Many such original remakables fail in creating atmosphere, character or any genuine crisis at all. Prom night is so flat and refreshing it's hard to look, but for every reason. It is a wrong activate, massively refreshing and ultimately breakout that fails in everything it feels to do. It's clear Hollywood movie is dead. Even the likes of Hills have eyes and massacres of Chainsaw Texas managed to ruin the franchises in style with bucket of blood and a decent plot. Prom Night is usually blood and I will not even mention how bad the draw is. His inability to kill the assassins is identified to make that the youngest superman film ever since error ... the original. One of the most notorious slasher films in the 1980s is back to terrorizing filmgoers and the notion that proves just how awesome dance high school can really be. Donna Keppel (Brittany Snow) survived a terrible tragedy, but now the time has come to let the past and celebrate her senior bullets in style. <br /> <br /> When the big night arrives, Donna and her best friends are preparing to enjoy the latest high school blowouts by living it up and held until dawn. But while Donna is willing to look past her nightmares and to a brilliant future, the man he thought he had escaped forever had returned to a last dance. An obsessed killer is on the loose, and he will kill anyone who tries to prevent him from reaching him one and only Donna. <br /> <br /> Who will survive to see graduation days, and what will Donna do when he is forced to confront his biggest fear? Scott Porter, Jessica Stroup, and Dana Davis co-star in the slasher renewal that will have Tuxedo-clad young people nervously looking over their shoulders as they carry out the dance floor. A plot that will probably put you off will see it. Witch if you ask me is a good thing. <br /> <br /> Without much to work with, McCormick gamely tries to tighten milk from the most banal in situations. At one point, a girl turned into a floor lamp (a lamp!) And McCormick tries to pump it up in a jump-scary moment. Desperate times really call for desperate measures. There have not been such many shots in wardrobe since the last IKEA catalog. In the era of the hills, My Super Sweet 16 and catch a Predator, there is probably a wild film, afraid to be miners from commoditisation of glamor and mania to climb the society with juvenile beauty. This is not movie. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Final verdict? Avoid all prices. Nobody likes Prom Night, it's even a disappointment for people who usually enjoy hack-work remittances. Consider her absolute sheen of blood or frights. One night you will be in a hurry to forget.
