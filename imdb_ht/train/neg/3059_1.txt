All my rights recently had a chance to rent this and watch Santa Claus conquering the morning. Although the children were more sadistic at SCCTM, I should say that Santa Claus was a much worse movie. As a spanish placement in Spanish 5 we all had to look at it. I'll tell you, usually when we watch a movie we all just talk to eat, but not for that movie. Everyone just has to have open jaw wondering what's wrong Mr. Pitch will do next. Ta Merlin help Santa Claus!? or does his kidney robot come and save the day? I would suggest renting it because it is the biggest piece of garbage I've ever seen and I love it for that. : D
