The film is somewhat tiring. It's mostly a silent film, and the great o story is given in a series of voice-overs. While doing a silent film like this is not such a bad idea, this is one of those movie films lacking in dialogue with the recurring scenes early to make it simply tedious. You do not understand the reasons for the teddy until well in the picture, and then it's too late. The first 40 minutes of film is something of a slow piece of Mexican soft porn, and unimaginative soft pornography. Later in the movie style in the first 40 minutes begins to make sense, but it's too late, because then the audience is lost. There are some beautiful locations at the National Autonomous University of Mexico. I often wonder why more films are not injected. The campus is built on the edge of the lava garden that borrows the campus a very otherworldly feel. My biggest problem with the film is that the director / writer did the movie as he wanted to see it unacceptably for how a viewer who does not know the story will see it. You can not ignore the hearing when you tell a story.
