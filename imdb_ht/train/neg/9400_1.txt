It's very unfortunate when a movie like this is done. A great deal of work and money was put in a movie that is the best amateur. These changes shoot at, there are obvious mistakes that can be easily corrected in a second take, and the sound is inimitable. So much can be done with this video movie. I guess they run out of time, or video. <br /> <br /> But keeping shots have a distinct amateur feel.
