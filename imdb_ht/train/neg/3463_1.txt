I saw this movie the other night and I have to honestly say it is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. The act is just, but the plot is totally ridiculous. Is a murderer born because of all the "energy used to make the movie" and if the movie is burning the killer will die? How incredible is that? The characters were underdeveloped to say the least ... for example, all of a sudden the man mentioned "Do not try to fill the movie because your mom could not?" So, we're supposed to go along with this? We had no idea he was her daughter until halfway through the movie. The movie really was not spotlight on anyone, we did not know anything about the main characters who survived except Ringwald's character was a whiney actress, the guy was on the series when people were killed and Raffy was wants a director like his mother. Do not really dive into who they are. Looks like these things have just been found in the killings. The whole plot is entirely too weak for my taste and I was very disappointed. Anyone who enjoyed this piece of crap, obviously needs to learn something or two about making films. I can not believe anyone would agree with the stars or even work on this picture. It's not funny, it was not scary and was clich√© of the whole movie. I found myself predicting what would happen before every stage, believing that I was not hard at all to do. It is a shame and I deeply regret I wasting an hour and a half watching the chaos. 1/10.
