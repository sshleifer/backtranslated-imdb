* Sigh * Let it give us Finns a stupid mind, blow it out of proportion and try to walk it as cool. Lordi is a lot of mediocrity at best, and one GIMMIK will find you only so far. <br /> For all that you marketing idiots out there: this is the reason for minority minority who is often encountered when Finland tries to export something. <br /> <br /> Lordi is not afraid. Lordi is lame. Lordi is over. <br /> I want to excuse the rest of the world for this plastic-faced idiocy. Sure, they won the Eurovision. <br /> No, wait - they won the Eurovision. That's it. I rest my case.
