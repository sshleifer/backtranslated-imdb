This movie is horribly acting, writing, directing and producing. But it's somehow it's actually semi-timable. This SEMI look. <br /> The story (which little has) does virtually no sense too. Barney drum characters are only real funny relief in the film and become tired after about 30 seconds. Many of the Canadian supporting joints can be found in TV commercials. None of them have gone to anything else that I'm aware of. And of course Sally Stallone's even less talented brother well ..... = = <br /> <br /> Trivia: She was filmed almost entirely in and around the Claremont village, Ont. (about 20 miles north of Toronto) I recognize many local landmarks / intersections / buildings. I think the Drive-in scene was filmed in now demolishing the "Oshawa Drive" just before it was torn down.
