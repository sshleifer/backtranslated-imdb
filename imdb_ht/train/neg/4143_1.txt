As myself and my other half are great fans of our horror garbage we could not resist getting a movie with both the big ones we were thrilled! However for a 2004 movie with a Rip off cut in Freddy vs Jason this is a shame! The worst movie I've ever seen but worth a look for a laugh if you can sit in it! The act is terrible the effects ... well I could do better on my camcorder in fact it's so bad they only bother to put up on the zombie faces and leaving course but but no story line, strange regrets that make no sense to terrible script! <br /> <br /> "you broke my teeth!" from a vampire "you broke my cigar" was the answer from those who seemed uncle Jessie from Dukes crossed with Santa!
