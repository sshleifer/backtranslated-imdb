Last night I decided to look at the prequel or I must say what's called prequel in Carlito's Way - "Carlito's Way: Rise to Power (2005)" that went straight to DVD ... not surprising. completely .. and I mean completely S & KS !!! Kidney in time watching it and I think it would be a pure kidney time written on it .... I do not understand how De Palma agreed on this sh # t-a product film ... except for only a fact that I tip my hat ... Jay Hernandez who plays the young Brigante .... Remind me how De Niro got in the shoes of Don Corleone's young Brandon show in Shadow II ... but the difference The Niro was amazing and even received an Oscar for her !!! Jay Hernandez well has bowel for trying a young Pacino .... too bad for him I do not think he will play in film again and in the way after I watch this sh # $ movie movie, i sat down down and watch Carlitos's original way to get the bad taste out of my mouth.
