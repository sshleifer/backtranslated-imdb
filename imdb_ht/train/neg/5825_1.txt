This has to be one of the worst movies I've ever seen! There were people who left the theater, others were falling asleep (ok, it was a late night show) ... This is a movie there is no sense, one of those who can do you never want to see an out in mainstream photographs again. I would like to look make-off in this movie as I deeply interested in what goes on the minds of the authors of these garbage. Are they laughing when they create all this ridiculous or they actually think they're doing something interesting? I wonder ... The band is terrible apart from some instrumental tools that remind you of a previous Bjork album. Even if you're a fan of Bjork's music, stay home. It is the best thing to do. Little, small, beautiful pieces of music have no reason to go out and submit yourself to this torture. God! ...
