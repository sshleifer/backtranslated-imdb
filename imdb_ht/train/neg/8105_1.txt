It's hard, yes, but I call 'em like I see' em. <br /> I saw this in late 80, and it was really one of the most terrible films, boring I ever forced myself to look. <br /> Yes, the movie is nice. Czech settings are really stunning. The political group is catchy, but unlike even "historically historic stories" (eg _Dr Zhivago_ (qv)), this one fails to make important policies in the story, or even interesting. <br /> Sure, Olin and Binoche are beautiful. But this movie manages to make the same "erotic" plodding scene and slow down. I'm all for romance, but this movie was so boring, I started to expect the Russians would shoot them all and put an end to my misery. <br /> I'm sure I would read the book, the story would be a bit more meaningful. However, life is too short to spend any more time on this one.
