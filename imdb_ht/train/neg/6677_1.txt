After reading the first 5 reviews on IMDb I was very enthusiastic about this movie. But it's really a horrible movie, the total time you see the alien is about 5 minutes (the rest of the movie is cheap suspicion), the act is on the head of the story, oh boy, that story? <br /> <The story does not seem to go in one direction, first to take the alien (after 7 years! they finally succeed), then they do not know what to do with it (after 7 years?) and even want to release it (why hell was it taken?). Then the girlfriend, who acts is more on the head, wants to walk away from this madness, then suddenly it is not, then again, he does and then he does not. Then they come to the conclusion that kill the alien will kill all human race (and remember, in all the years no other people see these permanent permanent settlers established) and what to do? They tortured him and blew a bunch of foreign peaces. <br /> This is my first review of IMDb, I'm a very lazy person who does not write very soon, so listen to my warning: this move is not worth your time, do not watch this movie.
