An idiotic dentist found that his wife turned away. So there is no new history line here. However, the authors managed to create a stupid, disgusting movie. If you like to look for vomiting, or see a dentist who imagines that he pulls his wife's teeth out of a sort of horror, goes see (or rent) the movie. If not, go to another (MY FAIR Lady, anyone?)
