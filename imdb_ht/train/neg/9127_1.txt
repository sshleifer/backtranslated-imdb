Ok so here's the basic scheme. It is 1933, Peter Sellers is Dr. Fu Manchu, a 168-year-old Chinese man who lived quite a long time. The film opens with his birthday in which he celebrated by drinking a special elixir that (even the movie never mentioned) extended his life. Well on this occasion, the elixir is maliciously falling into an assistant (Kato if you remember the movie Pink Panther) and ordered his minions then go to 6 rare items to make the elixir. This created a world man hunting at which henchmen finished stealing museums of diamonds and adventures in London, to meet Dr. Fu's nemesis, a retired Scotland Yard detective Nayland Smith, also played by Sellers who tries to stop him from which is supposed to be a funny comic adventure. <br /> <br /> This was apparent latest Sellers full movie feature that he did before he died. The terrible tragedy is that it was in it. Sellers who are such a gifted comedy and have memorable 'funny' memories of panther and particulary movies in the film 'The Party', is nothing but the content of this movie. This movie was absolute torture to sit down and I could not even finish it. It's completely DIES and I kept cringing while watching Sellers performance. After coming to the great work of 'Being when' a year earlier, I mean how it can do this and how did this thing get done? Like someone mentioning the first 10 .. 15 minutes are ok, but then it's all about ... <br /> Avoid like the epidemic. <br /> Rating 1 out of 10.
