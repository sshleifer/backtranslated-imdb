The idea behind this movie was a good one. Too bad he was not writing well. Sidney Poitier's distribution as agent FBI was a good idea, and he did an outstanding job. Tom Berenger, on the other hand, only knows one emotion of most of his movies, anger. Kirstie Alley's character could be a great, and even showed some possibilities once, but the writer really let you down to his role especially a discouraged woman. This was completely consistent with the strongly independent character it was supposed to be. I do not care to act Alley anyway. The film should have finished over fifteen minutes earlier than it did. Director of the cow's milk circle before the final incredible action. I will keep this in my collection only as an example of Poitier's performance.
