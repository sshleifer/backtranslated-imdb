An illegal immigrant resists the social support system that causes dire consequences for many. Well-filmed and acting though the story is a bit strained, yet the slowing slowly really lies on the conclusion. The feeling of losing in the big city was effectively targeted. The little person lost in the big corporation is something that we can all relate, but I can not endorse the way you see this movie.
