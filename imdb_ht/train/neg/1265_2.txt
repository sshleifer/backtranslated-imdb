I first did not want to watch this film, so the trailer gave the impression of a common movie and too much hope ... but as I recently had the pleasure of discovering the starters "Mensonges et trahisons et plus affinites" was very well-directed and written by Laurent Tirard ("Seniors" in my "principal loan"), I changed my mind and decided to try it, thinking that "lending would be primary", would be as good as "mensonges .. "And it is absolutely not .. The scripts are not bad, but it's not as well directed as" Mensonges ... ", the actors are not as generous (especially Charlotte, as boring as it usually is) as Edouard Baer or Clovis Cornillac, and too honest, I still do not understand how these crap can have such a success, even with such a casting ... Anyway, the story may have been a pretext to create many interesting cemeteries, but it is Not as good as the "Mensonges" Tirard ... though he writes by him. Easy, prompt, and lazy work.
