I hated this movie. It was absolutely terrible, poor, poor, PITIFUL acting, REAL REAL REAL criminal stupid who did not even laugh funny school (unlike the first two home alone movie that was very good). All the boobie traps are weak, pathetic excuses for wrong thinking copying from the first two that just mean that those who wrote this movie were just lazy because the checks did not go above 20 bucks a week. This film is absolutely disgusting, it's not worth even renting. In fact not even watch it on t.v.! Go through your eyes in a most useful way by seeing their first two! I'm happy to give this star 1 (out of 10). Just trust me when I say, if you loved the first two, and you are not a complete stupid person, you will not love this movie, do not watch this movie !!!
