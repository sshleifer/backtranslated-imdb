I read the book a couple of times and this movie does not follow exactly as it should be. I could leave this slip, it is after all a movie. However I have serious problems with the environment in the movie. Nobody liked to mention that this movie and the book it based on are based on current events that happened in Nebraska. I live in Nebraska. I grew up in the city that this film is supposed to be based on. First of all, the "small" city that is talking about how the environment is, is the third largest city in the state. With a population of about 50,000. Grand Island is the largest city between Lincoln and Denver. The second landscape for the film is wrong. Grand Island is at the bottom of the River Plate. Very tiled and very few trees. I tried to watch this movie, but it made me angry to see my city being treated so badly. This was a real event. The big section of the city was wiped out. In the book they talk about cycling from Mormon Island to Fonner Park. I guess you might be if you do not mind a ride of 15 miles each way.
