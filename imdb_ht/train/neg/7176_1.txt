I have nothing more to say but it was terrible. I can not imagine why Helen Mirren and others were part of this degraded disorder. But if certain actors do not want people to question their sexuality then maybe they should avoid doing more of these films. There was at least one view that left me curious. Just my opinion. SHUDDER to think that was going on what was being cut out of the movie. SHUDDER asked what went to the minds of the actors who made this movie. The drugs reflect on the thought process and voyeurism that went to the director himself. As I stated before it a degraded disorder. It's not funny. As Ebert told the movie Caligula and Malcolm McDowell, It's not a good movie, it's not a good story and it's not even good porn. YEESHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH ............
