I think I agree that a lot of comments are here to be false. Though the film is not necessarily its badly lower than average. "Black remains" is basically a Ghost movie and a quotation of your own ghosts and your evil haunting emotions. The movie begins with 2 story inter-webbed wounds that even later are not tied together. A couple lost their babies to get squeezed in bed. They move to a country house to run past and guess what ... is the haunting house, kind. From here on Black stay start off very slowly and some awesome moments (the first Ghost Ghost Ghosts and the flashlight sequence also worked very well). OK, then ... Woman sees the ghost of daughters, other ghosts who died in accident or suicide appeared, man trying to solve secrets of past homes, women become depressed, strange quarrels appear. It's pretty much all there, but the premise of it being their own emotions are beautiful, so you wait for the twist. There is no twist, you are just confused by a story story haunted house, the strange neighbor, a totally pointless creepy prison and the dead daughter dropping along with a photo-mind reminds me a lot of the "flying". The end is ridiculous because when you start and finish a movie this slow down with its lively piano music included some hoards of ghosts at once that looks like a zombie flick, of course just to return to slow down slowly and piano music. <br /> <br /> To make it short ... Staying black could be a fantastic ghost story scary if the script was not trying to go around and reach anywhere. For many stories mushed together that just makes no sense and contradicts the basic atmosphere of the film. And besides ... please never use the abandoned prison again. So tear off and in this case it even makes no sense at all. "Hey, there's this hard creepy prison, allow the shoot." I guess a lot of ingredients in black tea have been thrown into the mix like this.
