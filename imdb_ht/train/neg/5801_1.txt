Ivan (Valeri Nikolayev) is a bitter, cynical journalist who investigates the unexplained. He traveled to this small town where he said a witch (Ita Janm) is terrorizing the community. <br /> <br /> Her car and take shelter in a small building, and meet a beautiful, mysterious girl. Suddenly he turned to a demon and killed him, and the city asked who murdered this woman ... whom I guess was the witch but I'm not entirely sure. Ivan is now being chased by his spirit, or something, and he has faith, or something, beat him. <br /> I really hate Christian movie. They are usually filled with lame actors, stupid scenarios and minimal effects. Not to mention that this is not just a Christian movie ... but an alien one as well. The voice-over actor for Ivan made the movie more funny than terrorists, because it is so high up and whiny. You will not miss much do not miss out on this movie.
