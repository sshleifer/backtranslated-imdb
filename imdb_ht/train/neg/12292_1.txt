We brought this movie as a joke for a friend, and it could have been our worst joke. The film is barely watchable, and the act is terrifying. The worst actors ever used by Hasslehoff provide a substandard performance. The plot is ashamed and at the point we were so bored we were wondering what the hell was going on. It tries to be really in place, but it's just ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Just awful
