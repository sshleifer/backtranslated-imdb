There is nothing new here. All the romantic-comedian scenes staged, even down to the sprinting taxi from the airport to stop the woman flying away. The only thing that's saved is the act of Alison Eastwood & some of the minor characters (blink and you will miss Gabrielle Anwar), which obviously had some fun. <br /> <br /> Turn her when the couple are in bliss, and you will not have to go through the inevitable pain.
