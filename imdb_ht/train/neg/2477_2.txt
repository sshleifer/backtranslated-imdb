If you want to know the real story of the Wendigo, I suggest you pick up a copy of Algernon Blackwell's original story. This movie was not only bad but there was nothing to do with the book. <br /> I love the book when I read it as a kid (In "draft heating" by EM Freeman) and was so excited to see a movie based on it out. I was so disappointed when I finally saw her. Another thing is that there were too many PCs (politically incorrect) subscribers throughout the movie that had no place in the movie. When writing the PC book does not even exist. <br /> My suggestion is not waste your time or money! If you see it on the video store shelf leave it there.
