Try to compare or represent this "swill" as anything "Hitchcockian" is an out-n-out attempt to deceive Hitchcock fans to wasting $ 7 on this movie ... Swak Acting Weak Story Swak script. <br /> There is no real suspension, no emotions. You wait all of the weakness of this movie for the big settlement or even any payoff ... You're leaving thinking, what the heck was that all about. <br /> <br /> And please, enough with the move to make "alternative life" HIP and politically incorrect !! ... I can not recommend this to anyone ... Do I mention how weak the act is? Williams has done a better job as Peter Pan and "Mork". But that was much more innocent times
