When many say it is "the worst movie I've ever seen," they tend to say that virtually any movie they did not like. However, in nearly 700 cinemas I can remember ever see this one is one of two that I've gone far to feeling persistent and angry personnel. This is my first movie review, by the way, and I'm registered with IMDb just for rivaling this bad movie. I went to see it when it was in the theaters (myself and two of my buddies were 3 out of 5 people), and after 15 years I can not remember much specifics, but my attitude toward leaving the theater still clear crystals . <br /> <br /> --- Spoiler Alert --- <br /> <br /> Oh, where to start. Fat deficit leaves at the altar, goes on skiing weekend, meets the blond bomb that takes an interest in him, takes him home to meet the family, they are all cannibals and it is the main course, hideous pathetic of a dramatic escape , kicks off all the Master and runs with the girlfriend's girlfriend, and live happily ever after. Puke. First, the gags are so bad that it took me a while to understand that they were trying to be fun, and that's a comedy. Special effects, which some people have, look like they did 15 years earlier. The great dramatic ending was so hokey and wrongly acting that he was almost unbearable to watch (he knocked out the whole cannibal family and racking laying in the lawn, which stood Tom and Jerry style when they were on stage). I'm sure there are many, more, but I have no intention of seeing it again for a receiver.
