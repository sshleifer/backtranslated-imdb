You can often say a movie did not turn out as it should not be used in heavy at a narrator. This movie features this device at all. Richard Jobson does not entirely content to write directly and even finances some of this movie adds to his credit by reading extracts from his own semi-autobiographical writing that combines with some nice editing frozen edges on what is a depressive story that he owes make mystic for the genuine art-house. Kevin McKidd puts a good performance. Everyone else is okay. <br /> <br /> Budget contingent means that all the scenes are shot in daylight though most are obviously meant to be at night, though if you know serious alcohol are primarily operated on the day so, for me he adds a touch of realism. <br /> <br /> The funniest part of this movie is a waitress who fails at the age of one in the odd 20 years that falls between his appearances - a more extreme version of the McKidd issue that has gone through 18 to 30 without changing clothes. Beni.
