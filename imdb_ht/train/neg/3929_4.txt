If this is all the Watchowski has to offer in terms of a story back to the Matrix, than I really have to question the claims of all the fans who believe that the movies are intended to sign up on a deeper level. The second Renaissance, while visually stunning & beautiful is, history of wisdom & comics. How often have we heard the story of people relying too much on technology, people are all-too eager to fight, people basically destroy themselves? There is nothing new here. And I have another question. Considering the scheme of the second revival, which does not make the cars the good guys ?! Cars are oppressed for generations by the extreme wicked people. They fight back, win their freedom and seek to establish a harmonious peace of mind with the people, who reject them in favor of all-out wars, which smart cars have inherently. If this is the story back, then we would not be rooting for neo, we would be rooting for the cars! People were cruel and oppressive, while cars were courageous and attepted to be compassionate. Since I do not believe that the Watchowski is intended for us in favor of the cars on the people, I must believe that the Second Renaissance was simply a misguided attempt @ creating a story back.
