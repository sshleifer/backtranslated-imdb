The act is good, the women are beautiful, and the guys are beautiful, so if you're looking for that well-off soft porn, this movie is for you. Otherwise, you will waste your time. The motivation of the main characters, in particular the eponymous lead, is often a mystery. He could just tell the truth - the truth as presented in the film, not necessarily the historic truth - and would like his lover to be killed in prison for a rape he did not commit. Did he protect his father, who went half-cocked, as it was, when he was anxious to instruct a bad suit? Did she protect herself, and her sudden reputation of anxiety when her only art seemed to have problems? During the trial, this woman was strong-backed back to our eyes. Conversely, his girlfriend, who starts as a narcissistic decay, becomes a selfless hero during the trial. At least his motivation is clearer: he killed himself for love. Of course, since no good paper has to be punished, we said he never saw it again.
