Jean Pol Godard in Marxist's controversy is as close to an incomparable movie as you are most likely to see in an international respected movie. Bits of political theater, mind-boring and indifferent ideas, interspersed with the "Sympathy for the Devil", featuring the Rolling Stones in the studio. <br /> <br /> The process of developing the song from Mick Jagger plays a demo on acoustic guitar, in the backing vocals being recorded at the end, is fascinating, and is worth leasing this movie just to see the bits and stones. Almost half the movie is devoted to this, so thanks to the miracle of chapter stop, you can skip all the scarce political scarcities and just watch the stones to put a song together. <br /> When I had this on laserdisc, I vigorously tried to look it all but I did not see how anyone can get into it. I finally gave up and just chapter-jumping my way into the Stones segments.
