I'd rather have 20 root roots than going to this movie again. The annoying Prince, Myles Berkowitz, has been wasting nearly two hours in my life with this chic pseudo-cool piece. The only fun thing in this whole mess is Samaha's obnoxious mate of patter camera on tits and ass. Berkowitz takes a great concept and grinds it into the dust. It's typically done and done, in an apparent effort making it seem noble or funny. It's not. I rarely feel that a film was a waste of films (or tape), but this one is eligible for this distinction. If a date suggests seeing this film, run.
