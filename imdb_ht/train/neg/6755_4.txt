Maddy (Debbie Rochon) is a mentally unpredictable young woman with a troubled past that gets more than she's negotiating when she goes to a pool party and a nice work colleague. When her date with her friends are jokingly told they belong to a Murder Club, Maddy takes it seriously and moves straight to `Level 3 'by bashing the brain in a woman in a parking garage (for denting her car!) . But Maddy is also the only one waking a plastic mask and killing other members of the group or having someone else lose it? The plot of this movie (originally titled "MAKE EM") is very poorly conceived, full of holes and spiral completely out of control before a comic, out-of-the-let-twist ends. Some of the dialogue is outright stirred. I did not have a problem with Rochon's performance, but dropping into support was atrocity. However, I managed to sit down at this full moon full moon release. There are lots of skin and blood and it's the perfect type of flick to sit around with a group of copies and select apart. Horror fans can also enjoy them from Brinke Stevens and Lloyd Kaufman (as Debbie's parents) and Julie Strain (an early victim). Notes: 4 out of 10
