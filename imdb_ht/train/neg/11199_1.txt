The turgid speed of this film is numb to any shock that it might give. There was no real suspension. Most of the characters were insipid. The Irish chesty priest was as lame as the love interest. Interest is misleading. The girl being chosen to give the movie's sensuality might be better. The central conflict of the main character was uninvolving. This film is totally devoid of positives. It's like a tedious exercise by someone who did not want to go to the gym on that day, but did anyway.
