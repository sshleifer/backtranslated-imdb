This film that was released directly on video should bring a warning label that it is dangerous to human health and power issues to the terminal boom viewer. It is yet another clear, evangelical "rapture" religious film and the good guys (believers) suddenly disappear and the bad guys (who do not believe) leave behind. It's an interesting concept, especially since we see it happen on a flight captured by a non-believers who have a sinful offense and a stewardess aboard (useless to say that fisherman does not disappear either!). Unfortunately, with all pilots being nonbelievers, the plane did not crash or the film would have been miserable. Even if this might be interesting without the religious religious heaviest, as a whole movie of plodding makes one gag, the act is terrible and the obviously computer-generated simulators are very fake looking. Plus it is yet another shot in Canada that claims to be New York City. Spend me ... I'll just read the Bible.
