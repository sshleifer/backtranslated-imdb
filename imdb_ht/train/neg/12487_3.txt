This movie was a great disappointment. <br /> I take the opposite opinion of the critics. This is not a case in the material by being up to the level of the actors; Here the actors (Bette Davis and James Cagney) are simply not up to the level of the material. Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert were all big as Davis and Cagney, and watch how it happened a night turned out - a classic ever. With a very similar story, Davis proves that he has no talent for comedy (good for her that this is just about the comedy she has ever tried!) One-note performance Davis' petals, but not one of the nuances of Colbert's act at It happened a night. Cagney, who was a great comedy actor, just looks out-of-synchronization and listened to him, Davis. The script provides some decent lines and gags, but the delivery looks best suited to drama than comedy. <br /> <br /> Part of the problem is the soundtrack, which, like the delivery of Davis and Cagney, seems more appropriate to a light drama than a comedy. Jack Carson, who has played the same role throughout his career, has more ability to handle very similar material. In a typical justice supports Eugene Palette's role to deliver a respectable performance. In a slightly different role as an old western religion, Harry Davenport is very good. But in one of its poorest performances, William Frawley is quite disappointing. Her constant characteristic of fictional cops is a poor effort in irony. I really love every one of these performers, and it's a shame that, as an ensemble to achieve no more chemistry and no better results than the bride has become C.O.D.
