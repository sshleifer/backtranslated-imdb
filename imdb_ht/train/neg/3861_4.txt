I'm not a big fan of rom / coms at best times. A few were good (checks for a Insomniac), but this one is just more of the same, but less. <br /> With a time running at 100min, I expect more than 1 laugh every 30 min. Only real street sales are when strangers and instinctivly friends help Lee's character. <br /> All I can say is AVOID. I gaurentee have at least 10 other movies on the rack that deserves you $$ <br /> 3 in out 10 (And only my cos is a great fan of Lee)
