Starting a sex cast that looks likely to be so, this "movie" is yet another flick candy bomb that amazes me how this was released. I have no problem with horror and flash slasher in particular, in fact they are my favorites. But when they do this, it really takes the monkey and it does not surprise the genre of such a tough time. The story is like Clich√©d and without imagination as possible with a bunch of people in a cabin from the woods being slashed and hacked up by this zombie ghost / ghost. It's not the story that sucks the most, it's acting aggressively and dialing, home made direct quality and a horrible soundtrack. Not to mention scrutiny and some incredibly lazy films made - these morons are out in the clear day yet we mean that it's midnight ?? What the hell thought to the director and this move? What, it was only one day all this movie in? He was afraid of the dark? (Does hilarious see a cop walk around in the daytime and a torch acting as if its black nut, though) <br /> I guess the positive side for the actors are similar to those who work in the local supermarket so At least they could possibly escape from this movie without being noticed. I'm sure one of the "genes" plays Bingo down the local pub - but it's 40-45. <br /> <br /> Anyway, good for a laugh, but just another dump of movie and time.
