I desperately want to give this film a 10 ... I really do. There are some movies, especially horror movies, so the budgets are good. A wise epidemic that can apply corn cobs as lethal weapons ... definitely suits this 'bright budget' system. Depth of the film is definitely its strong point and twists and turns it apply, keeping the audience in the corner of the seats really driving the climb ... ninja ... PIBERTY-rendered ... pre-thirty years old adult student ... non-cowboy cartoon ... wise-cracking ... child-of-a-bride scarecrow in the limelight as the creepiest horror icon of the year. All I can really say is, 'you can dig it' and recommend watching movies like Frankenfish if you enjoy this sort of hilarious horror. <br /> <br /> (What did the HELL smoke? '
