I felt dead in the brain, I'll tell you. This is the worst movie I've ever bought. (in my ignorance I thought this was the movie of Peter Jackson in the same name). Their performance is so awful they are ridiculous. Special effects have not stopped the test of time and looked lasting. The script encourages the kind of television movie, staring at the middle distance type of acting. Looking at cast as if they were taking lessons from Joey Tribbiani, they have only one look, and stick to it. Plus I've never been confused by a movie until I sit down to watch it. This is a dream or conspiracy not so terrible that frustration sets in within minutes. Avoid such a epidemic.
