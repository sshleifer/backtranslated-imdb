Where to start? OK, do not compare this movie to fight clubs for a start - ridiculous. If it was even a patch on battle club, violence, blood, gore etc would be more obvious and realistic. Secondly, this movie has no football factory - which is so much more real (and Danny Dyer makes Nicholas Nickelby look like an embarrassment). Fair enough, the scenario is quite decent and the scenes fight quite choreographed - with a decent finish I might add. But the movie on the whole is poor, badly bad. As people mentioned the accents should not spoil a movie - I agree - either a simple filing mistake, or a lack of effort in coaching the voices that caused the movie to be irritating all the way through - it was obvious to scenes Only a few Americans / Geordie played the role. Do not get me wrong, good looking guy, who looks great with a skin - but no not a football hooligan. I could go on forever on how ridiculous the football scene was - the 'false teaching' situation. Also, when the GSE will play United up north, they go on the train waiting for only 3 of them - makes no sense - that's a real organization of gangsters and thugs, which is described in the movie to be some mickey mouse cult in about 5 people. In terms of accuracy - did West Ham and Milwall not play for the last couple of years in the championship together? Hmm, ten years OK. And I'm sure 'Anyone' could just waltz in a Milwaukee PUB. Basically, a very poor movie who will love if they have little knowledge of real football, and hooliganism. If you actually love football and are intrigued by the midfielder of hooliganism, you'll simply feel as though this film has insulted your intelligence. Ross George
