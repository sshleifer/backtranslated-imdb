There is no getting around it - this movie is terrible. I saw old Christopher Lee / Fu Manchu cinema, I'm familiar with the characters and his earnest origins, but it's still godly. However, Peter Sellers's genius still illuminated and painted him in Nayland Smith, with echoes of sadness, tragedy, and couch strength through a stoic facade; It's a performance I put on Cushing's paintings and paintings in Van Helsing but made in a tenth of the cumulative screen time of the Cushing movie "Dracula". If the movie was made into a more serio-comic vein like BUBBA HO-TEP by way of the TV showGers 1960, this could be something special. If you are a Fu Manchu or Peter Sellers complete, this is something you need to see, but it's a pass for anyone else.
