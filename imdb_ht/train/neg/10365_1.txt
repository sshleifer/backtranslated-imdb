Mad. This would be thrilled to burst. What is a piece of crap. Terrible writes, the characters are less than credible. Terib Schlock !! Sticking some B stars in a very tough post writing to try and give it a little credit, but it fails miserably. If I did not have ten titles on this movie I would give it a word word review, it starts with 'sh' and ends with 'it'. Terrible end, delay. Who writes this crap. The movie movie is so flawless, weak as if they had no idea what to do with this story line, or they just ran out of money. Most likely due to the number of cameos in this film. It is good that these actors are on the way out, because this would be a career killer. Good thing for those who hardly anyone will see it. At least not one important, as future investors. It could end up a thousand different ways, but as it is, I feel lured out of my precious time. <br /> <br /> Do not bother with this one, you will feel like you wasting time you can never get back.
