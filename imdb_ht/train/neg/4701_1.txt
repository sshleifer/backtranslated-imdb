It's terrible how some people can get away from things ... This is one of these things over there again ... And I hate things that are not good ... Why can not we have more TV shows and movies that actually have a history and excellent music and are well written and actually about something? It takes many people to make this movie, the series, and the band, all possible, and those people all waste their time ... It seems that the strips are getting smaller and smaller ... I watch that as small as they were, and I thought they were 5 or 6. It's sad that the kids are doing that young ... They're still too young ... Performance takes a lot of work, and they have lots of things need to do with their lives ... The idea of ​​having a very young band is terrible ... They need to stop having such bandits ... And I do not like the idea of ​​all, nor the kids themselves ... They are very harassed, very young, and their names are the "Naked Brothers Band" people involved in this, and the people who support this all have lost their minds ... Whenever this band shows up on TV, change the channel, and petitions get it banned ... <br /> <br /> And I know that this is a very boring comment, but you get the point ... <br /> <br / > This Six Band .. Find The Dead Of It ...
