Avoid the USA version. It is with added US footage and the worst dubbling you ever heard probably made by New York enthusiasts. The lingerie is so bad that it sounds like Mystery Science Theater 3000. I think a black guy from the Bronx makes Chiba's voice. I could not watch the movie all that bad. Instead of this American version look great Chiba's like the Streetfighter or Karate Warrior.
