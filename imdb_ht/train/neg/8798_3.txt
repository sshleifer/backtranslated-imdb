I love a movie that has at least one pastel in a story. This does not happen in this movie. It is a series of vines with no joints. <br /> There are scenes of someone collecting pineapple boxes. A woman with a blond wig does not remove her sunglasses. This woman throws at others at the start of the movie and we never find out why. It disappears completely after about 30 minutes. There is another woman infused croissants cleaning a man's apartment. There are endless scenes in a fast food joint where California's Mamas & Papas are largely overplayed (I used to love this song). The dialogue is especially concerned with food (pineapple, salad chef and drinks). I suppose most of the actors have gained weight during this movie because they have eaten fast foods. There is no passion in this movie because there is no history. This is pretending to a romance - it does not have any such thing. I just wonder why I did not hit the Fast-Forward. I kept waiting for something important to happen ?? it does not. Perhaps that's the only consolation of this movie - scene moves so fast that it misleads you to assume that there has to be a revelation in the whole nonsense.
