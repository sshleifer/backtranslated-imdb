I will not spend much time or energy on this comment. I just want to add it because all the comments were so positive I felt like I just had to let people know that not everyone is so thrilled, let alone intellectually induced by this try to create an incredible philosophy of enigmatic movies. Some scenes seemed promising, playing with visual dimensions, but could not keep the rest. I felt like I was stoned for the first time again, with semi-philosophical conversations with their fellow adolescents. What a futile attempt to raise Dutch cinema in new heights. I would like to see that Jesus is a Palestinian, without any straightforward pretense and humor, too, raising questions about life and the reality we create for ourselves. <br /> <br /> Gert de Graff is not Jean-Luc Godard or Tarkovsky and their appearance will never be.
