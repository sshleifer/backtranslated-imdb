Jean Claude Van Damme tries to save his career by ending the Universal Soldier. But did this movie save her? I think he goes to hell, after his death. <br /> <br /> In the first minute, we see the inside of a facility, where you can see the bad guy in the movie. Scary, huh? But not as scary as the act (the details are followed). <br /> <br /> Then we see Van Damme and a black girl (do not remember the name ... well it does not matter anyway), trying to escape from some muscle-men. Of course they are new universal-soldiers. More muscels, less brain (just like the movie). After a while, Van Damme defeated Goldberg, but then the "mission" was canceled. It was just a test (Is this movie a test for our nerves?). It seems that Van Damme is working for the government on the new Universal Soldier Project (who saw the movie first to think that this is the most illogical thing, that yould Van Dammes characters could do). But it is an end. And a "story" has come. Ah, I forgot. He has a daughter. Very important for the "story". Well, after about 20 minutes, a super computer heard a conversation about closing it and left smoking projects. Of course the cube gets mad and activates all soldiers to kill everyone. Van Damme escaped from the facility but the computer sent some soldiers to hunt him (He wants Van Damme as a soldier - because he's the best (really?)). And guessing that, Goldberg is one of the hunters, who has always been a funny sentence for the hearing before it gets asskicked. Funny? Yes, just like the rest of the movie. <br /> After some "story", Van Damme tries to save her daughter (in his wife - the reporter of the first movie). He comes to an ultimate show where Van Damme fights the guy bad and you can see the most expensive scene in the movie all (please for yourself. It's just too funny to say). will see that this movie is a waste of time. <br /> So do not look it up. But if you do, hold a suspicion with you!
