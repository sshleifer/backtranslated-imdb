I saw this film a few days ago and gamely flying while scary parties. I must admit, I found it very decent ... until I started thinking about what the characters said. Logical Problems: <br /> 1. His companion, which seems to have a nice dude fit, makes no sound while being dead. Do you think he might have at least tried to take the killer? <br /> <br /> 2. When the remarks made that the gym teacher is "SOOOO in love with Lisa," I almost scream at the screen. When your best friend's family spent a teacher who was in love with her, you did not comment as if you had half a heart. As soon as Nash asks the uncle how many exits to have at home and the uncle catches on that may have danger before, would not be the smart thing to be Donna, companion, aunt, and uncle in a car and drive far , far, then cook with the HRT and police force so that the killer has no way to get out? <br /> I could go on. And on. And on. Basically, the scheme was decent, the characters were not filtered enough for you to actually feel any sympathy when they were killed and there were so many errors. This movie might be good for teens, or young couples just looking for a fun night. If you do not consider all the goofs, it's a mediocre film.
