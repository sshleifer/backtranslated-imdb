First of all, yes I'm white, so I try to break lightly into the ever delicate topic of race ... anyway ... White Hated Black people = BAD, but black men Hating people = OK (because apparently we deserve it !!). where am I starting? I wish I had a good thing to say about this movie about the scene of comedy unintentional: The infamous scenes were ice cubes and co. Get in a fight with some really big, really strong, really really upset with pairs of neo-Nazis looking forward to win !!! the neo-Nazi where twice the size :), and the chase! The pursuit is priceless ... This is not a movie about race, tolerance and understanding, it does not save ... this is a racist movie that re-affects all the cliche stereotypes, the white wimpy guy who gets manhandled by His black roommate automatically transforms into a skinhead ... cmon simply awful I'm sorry ever to see it. <br /> <br /> Save your time and the obnoxious experience of a wrong writing, wrong acting, picture subjects and clearly partial, if you are in the subject, go with Rent X American History, now that a movie
