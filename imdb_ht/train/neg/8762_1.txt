A scientist (John Carradine - unfortunately) found out how to bring the dead back to life. However, they return and face in marble. Eventually this all leads to disaster. <br /> Bars, totally predictable 1940s outing. This fear me funny when I was a kid but just made me right now. I had to struggle to stay awake! With an exception, the act is terrible. These boring active bits! We do not have much. <br /> There are some good things about this: Carradine, despite the script, actually gives a very good performance. And there is a moment lit creepy involving a ghost of a great Dane walking in the walls. There is also one of the worst-looking knockouts in movies. Still, none of this is fun enough to sit in this. Avoid.
