Charles Bronson continued his 80s slump and what could possibly be his worst movie in the next decade, if not ever. In it he plays a detective who goes through the length of the tramp down a puppy who has kidnapped an Asian girl and is now selling it to the highest bidder. It's a shameful attempt in action and is probably the most depressing movie ever made. A lot of people think death wants to be followed by Bronson's worst movie. The deaths they want to succession were not big movie but they were in most cases completely made with many lookouts. Kinjite however is a completely assaulted thriller that is punctuated by means of thematic racism and child welfare. It really is a rephrensible film and all it has gotten worse by the fact that it tries to preach a "Law and Justice" mentality that too rejects really say nothing. Indeed the movie begins with minor sex being cut and bronson then anal violated the pedophile with a dildo. The Chicago Theater I watched this in just gasped off the disease at this stage, only to wasting the illness of the pimp to violate the girl in this movie. It has no other point than exploit and really the movie has not been well written enough to climb above the OS level and deliver something that might work. Bronson looks more like these, but clearly this is quite too repugnant to save. I want to point out that I think Charles Bronson is the coolest actor ever, but this effort is ultimately his worst. The sequence of actions is also poor. <br /> <br /> 1/2 * from 4- (awful)
