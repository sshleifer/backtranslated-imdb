Movies such as these are original to what Rock Rock Orient stations are what music used to be like - repetitive, boring, and pouring into all the original energy by a corporate corporate committee. I am pleased that Aragorn was not characteristics as a hopeful psycho by this P.O.S. Back and watch the 1971 version, count the things that should never be included in a modern version, and thank all the divinities you worship that someone somewhere in the past has had the balls to write and shoot a movie original concepts that were not based on someone else's ideas, and did not pass through a corporate board before seeing the light of day.
