Col, space captive on space death row, managed to destroy a space craft and escape from the woods of America where he and some new friends get trying to escape from the 'Alienator' a cyborg girl killed car. Fred Olen Ray's best film career, "Hollywood Line Head Hookers", this one can not help but feel like a bit of a disappointment. Just as low budget as this movie is, but not almost as fun as I was with it. None of the actors really stand out in me The film is well for the undisriminating viewer during an afternoon Saturday rains, but that's pretty much all right for you. /> My Class: D + <br /> where I saw it: Thriller Thriller
