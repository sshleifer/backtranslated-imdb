The first five minutes of this film showed potential. And he went right out of something possibly decent in some sort of illegitimate comedy. The best part is that I could not stop thinking of Supertroopers thanks to Joey Kern. I would recommend watching this film for the sheer fact of learning how to not make a movie. There are many scenes in this movie that make one just stop and ask whether to throw it all together with crew just stop caring at some point. What amazed me most about this movie is that it gross over $ 22 million in the box office and only cost about $ 1.5 million. Congrats in the lion's door so they could pull the one's one.
