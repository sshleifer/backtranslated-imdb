I do not know why I take time to review this movie this time. If you stick with it long enough to hope that at a satisfied conclusion ?? good, bad, or surprising ?? do not do that. It finally fizzles out after stiffness, formula, diagnostic predictable and acting. Indoor scenes are so strenuous that you think if the camera has zoomed out a mile more you'd see the lights clear. The costumes, the hair-do, and the manure sets, pressed, and immaculate. Are we supposed to imagine common people really living like that in the early 20th century Arizona? Comparing other reviews to Sam Peckinpah is a reproach to Peckinpah: at least the director draws his violence in the context of disruption and destruction. The fetal throat is extreme exploding explosive from wooden imitation of bad guys and nail manicures. Huh?!? I can believe that Heston thought he could do something worthwhile with this movie. (He finds his weapon braid in his cold fingers.) But Coburn? I would never guess why he signed up for this travesti. Want to see a movie on the end of the West as we knew it, the end of Westerns as we knew them? See the SHOOTIST or UNFORGIVE again. The last hard men are a mockery of a psychologist in the West.
