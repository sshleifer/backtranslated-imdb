No? Did not think so! Well, in this case all you have to do is stay far away from "Do you want to know a secret", as it's just over the useless post-"smile" Scream and absolutely no redemption value so. The very ridiculous plot; The characters are unbearable mute, the gore-negligible factor and the whole thing is just plain boring! As you can drift out of the title already, this movie is especially inspired by "I always know what you did last summer", as the events take place in an environment similar to the motivation of the assassin are even stupid. Why anyone wants to steal ideas from junk like "IKWYDLS" is a complete mystery for me, anyway. At least that movie can depend on the precious shelf of Jennifer Hewitt Love, whereas the girls in this junk, apart from brainless, are also very terribly unattractive. One year after the assassination of her boyfriend, Beth Morgan, her new adult waterfront and four other college students went to Florida to spend Spring Break on a fancy beach house. The assassin did not make a move all year round, but now it follows the Posse in Florida and starts the butcher also leave behind the titular message as some sort of business card. You really do not need a horror-expert in order to quickly figure out which face hidden behind the unspeakably ridiculous mask and attempts the writers put on the evil track are outright embarrassing. Since the draw is so thin, most of the film is purely irrelevant, including the sub conspiracy regarding the incompetent police force Floridian and the 'mysterious' FBI inspector that seems to have a personalized score resolved. The inexplicable assault on screen (you do not hate it when it occurs?), No even any freeware to enjoy and you better do not get I started on the quality of the dialogs. The crap of crap like this only makes you realize that the delightful spirit of slasher 80 goes for good.
