I'm a big fan of kapoorma kapoor and govinda. I watched this movie after I saw Fiza, who was absolutley brilliant. <br /> There are bad movies and there are movies that cr * p. but this movie just takes the biscuit. <br /> We were so annoyed that we were conned out of paying our money to expect a decent movie. <br /> <br /> Avoid at all costs, do not even rent it. <br /> <br /> 1/10
