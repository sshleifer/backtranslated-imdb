Between 1937 and 1939, Twentieth Century-Fox made a ton of Mr. Moto films. However, towards the end of the series, it was obvious that the studio was "flying the shark", so to speak. This phrase indicates that a TV show has passed its prime and executives in charge decided to host the show by basically changing the formula. For example, and the "Brady Bunch" they presented the 'annoying Oliver Cousins' and 'family relationships' to introduce a freak baby who has grown six years into one season! With the Moto films, they would fly the shark by introducing funny relief because they thought that these smart films are needed to be re-tools. In the previous movie, Warren Hymer played an annoying wrestler. And, in this movie the character Archibald Featherstone appeared. Featherstone might just be one of the most annoying examples of comic relief ever, as you keep hoping someone (preferably moto) would kill him just close it up !! Although it was supposed to work for the renowned Scottish Yard, it shows all the intelligence and leakage of a damaged brain turnip. Again, her scene was blur and unnecessary and Peter Lor just looks pained as she stood there, she watched this buffalo "acting". It's so bad that it really destroys what could be one of the best Moto films due to its smart scheme. <br /> <br /> As for the plot, Queen Queen of Sheba is discovered at the opening stage. Moto, now more of an international policeman than the amorous character it was originally, is on hand to protect the precious item from being stolen. In a big twist, several thieves all attempt to steal the crown independently with each other. <br /> <br /> Overall, the movie is looking but also is sufficient evidence that the Moto series should be completed here. With WWII approaching, the films could not survive much anyway, as there is a sympathetic Japanese leading character simply would not have been accepted in the U.S. or in the allied countries.
