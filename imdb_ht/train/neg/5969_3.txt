*** SPOILER *** Do not read this, if you think about watching movie, although it would be a waste of time. (By the way: The plot is so predictable that it makes no difference if you read this or not anyway) <br /> If you are wondering whether to see "ugly coyote" or not: do not do that ! It is not worth either the money for the ticket or the VHS / DVD. A typical "Chick-Feeling-Bon-Flick Movie", one could say. The plot itself is as deep as it can, a ridiculous and uncritical version of the American dream. Young charming girl from a small town gets a great success in New York. There are some desperate attempts to give film to any depth failure, such as the "tragic" accident of the father, the "difficulties" of the relationship with the violet and her boyfriend, and so on. McNally (Director) tries to excite the audience's pity and sadness puts no chance to succeed in this attempt due to the bad script and acting funds. Especially Piper Perabo completely failed to convince one of the "Jersey" to fear songs before an audience. Only good (and quite funny thing) about "Coyote Ugly" is John Goodman, who represents little rain in this film. <br /> <br /> I was very surprised, that Jerry Bruckheimer produced this film. First "Gone in 60 Seconds" and now that ... what happened to big movies like "Rock" and "Con Air"? That was true Bruckheimer. <br /> If you are looking for a superficial movie and good looking women just have a relaxed evening, you should better go and see "Charlie's Angels" (it's more funny, entertaining and self-scary) instead of this cops. <br /> <br /> Two thumbs down (3 out of 10).
