I bought this DVD for $ 1 at Walmart. After seeing it, I might just return to the store and try to get my money back! The only reason I gave the movie a 2 and not a 1 is that the story has a few novel story elements, though it really never got to the level of being interesting. This film has all the earmarks being made for driving-in theater theater - ultra-low budget, amateur acting and a liberal dose of sex (for an early 60's film). In fact, I wonder if the reason why the movie was made was a quick buck and because someone knew some of the strips could be used as extras. The film is about a wacko doctor who wants to transplant head off his girlfriend on the body of an unsuspecting donor. Most of the potential donors are scandalous skanky or a model - with only real goals in the movie is titular as they remove most of the clothes. However, they hold too much on making the movie even worth looking for the naughty bits and the movie is not quite awful enough to deserve watching by angry bad movie.
