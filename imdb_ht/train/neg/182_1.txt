This is the worst end to the face of the world of movies. Once again it has not done so. The killer always kills for fun. But this time he is killing people who are doing a movie about what happened in the movie first. Which means that it is the movie that is stupid ever. <br /> <br /> Do not watch this. If you appreciate one precious hour during this movie, do not watch it. You will want to ask the director and the person around you what makes him do it. Because it just does not combine to make the original of acts of horror, action, and crime. <br /> Do not let your children watch this. Teenagers, teens or young adults, this movie has the impact of people's impact.
