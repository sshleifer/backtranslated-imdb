Hunters chasing what they think is a man in the jungle, though the audience sees it is a werewolf. The hunters never seem to realize this, because after shooting it, it seems normal when they decapitate it. <br /> <br /> A physician transplanting the eye of a man who lost his own in a laboratory experiment. This guy, Rich, gets sex with her nurse (Stephanie Beaton) before she even gets dressed off. After leaving the hospital, she found her husband cheating on her too. When an automobile smoke flashes over an amateur painting in a moon (with a fake tree branch on the front), it becomes a werewolf! His torso grow bigger, divides his shirt, and it grows a giant werewolf masks on his head with red light in the eyes. Her pants remain intact. The mouth was wet unconvincingly, though some sort of robotics (or hiding) of eyebrows gave him a baleful look at times. <br /> Despite the costume of poor werewolf, there is a fair amount of blood and gore, and people are fairly well done. There is even a very good decapitation later in the movie. However, when a man falls from a height, executes the wrong job. <br /> <br /> Rich has a friend named Siodmak who is some sort of occult expert, and she also accidentally stumbles through a boy and embraced named Androse who is also an expert. They try to help him a little. <br /> <br /> Rich murder that made him wrong. A policeman investigates the murder and try to hit on Beaton, who does not care much for lesbian scenes so there is nothing out of it. <br /> <br /> Well, but between the stripping and bloody gore, and a by-tailed combination combine (sort of) the most dangerous game with the hands of Orlac and the Wolf man, it's a bit fun way. Available on its own, or in the box put Scream Queens Vol. 1.
