Bashki should be congratulated to try to convert one of the great works of English fiction into a movie, and then slumber to this attempt. The animation was poor, the characters seemed ridiculous, the music was overwhelmingly incredible, and the film was a blitz ramshackle in the first book and a half of the prince Tolkien. I can always remember my absolute undeliverment for the movie when I first saw it. Now I realize that any attempt to convert a book into a tied film is failing in many ways, simply because of the medium, but this movie, regardless of the source of the story, is just plain pathetic. Bashki can be much more.
