There are times when finishing a movie one wants to have a refund for the time just passed. This was one of those moments. I almost gave up and only 15 minutes left to keep ... and I wish I had ... <br /> The machete that a man goes from a straight-laced, controlling life to one of complete and irresponsibility spinelessness It can never be this quick one. From a graduation celebration to predict the completion of Tristan Price (Jesse Metcalfe) of privileges and cultures allowed himself to be seduced by a woman, not violence, and no idea to change substance. Of course, parts of women are understood by observing the beautiful April talent (Nathalie Kelley). But for a penny in for a book aspect of the drugs, violence and dedication to someone she just met is impossible to understand. Frankly, besides being able to starve in Nathalie Kelley and Monica Keena, this movie has no kind of royalty. Save your money, save your time ... do anything else ...
