This movie was bad. Bad act, wrong direct, bad writing. But it was not bad in a funny way. It was bad in a boring manner. I watched the "Surface of Air" because I thought it might be a laugh. It was not. Do not make the mistake I did. There are many more enjoyable ways than an hour and a half as watching dry paint or reading the dictionary. Seriously.
