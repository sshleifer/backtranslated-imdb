First of all, I said I worked for Blockbuster and saw quite a few movies at point it's hard for me to find something I did not see. When taking this into account, I want everyone to know that this movie was far away from the worst movie ever made, it made me bake for my boss daughter Gigli, and any other junk piece you've ever seen. BeLyt must come out of his mind, I've only found one who liked it and even they could not tell me what the movie was about. If you are able to decipher this movie and tell me what it was about you have to either be the writer or a fortune teller because there's in any other way someone could figure this crap out. <br /> <br /> FOR DOG's Love STAY!
