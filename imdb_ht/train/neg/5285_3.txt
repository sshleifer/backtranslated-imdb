Somewhere, on this site, someone wrote that to get the best version of their work at Jane Austen, one should simply read them. I agree with that. However, we like the adaptation of great literature and current writers to bear in mind that without good writers, it is difficult for the actors to carry their roles in life. The current version of Jane Austen's PERSONNEL shows us what happens when you do not have a good foundation in a well-written adaptation. This version does not compare to the 1995 version of Amanda Root and Ciaran Hinds, which has been well-acting and maintaining the essence of the era and the constraints on the characters (with the exception of the parade rare & kissing at the street scene in Bath). The 2007 version shows a twitty twinkle-like Anne. The other characters have not developed so much that is a crime, consider how Austen was able to paint these wonderful characters and some overly precarious. The sequence of events that made sense in the novel is completely over, and Ms. Smith, inside bedridden and poor poor walking in Bath - - twittering away, as many of the characters seem to have done. The strength of character and the intelligence of Captain Wentworth, which was his love Anne in the first place, did not seem to be writing at the Wentworth Rupert Penry-Jones. Ciaran Hinds had more substance and was able to transmit much more with a look, than P-J could do and ask him. All in all, the 2007 version was a disappointment. It seemed to reduce the novel in a hand-wringing, costume melodrama of contradictory worth. If they wanted to bring extraordinary modern emotions to Austen, they should do what they did with the adaptation of Shakespeare: adapting it to the present. At least "Bride & Prejudice" was taken out of the historical and local settings and was fun to watch, as was "Clueless". This was not persuasion, but they did not know what else to call it.
