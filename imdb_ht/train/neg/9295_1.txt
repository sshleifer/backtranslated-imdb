I was very surprised how bad this movie was. Nice cinematography and beautiful landscapes can only take the movie too far. I was hoping for a reunion of heroes, but this is a lot, worse. <br /> <br /> This movie is why kung fu movie has got a bad reputation in the first place. No credible character (even in the cartoonish world of movie cinema, these ridiculous characters), virtually no scheme, and ridiculous ridiculous stories. <br /> <br /> This movie is so boring and so frustrated because it reminds you of trying to play a game with a child. Whenever you think your comic battles make some sense, they invent a ridiculous twist that makes no sense ("Ah, you only think you got me with your super power and 10,000 rifle weapons, but I ate my vitamins laced with plutonium and Teflon, so your rifle weapon does not work and I'm invulnerable to your super power .... tap pipes there is no single infinity PLUS trade. ") Children can continue with this blank, because they Do not really care whether anyone is listening because they have a fun time. However, for the VIEWER, especially the adult visualizer, this film has long been worse than a bout with bad fuel. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> If you have a knife at you back it hurt unless you are on PCP , in the case of kung fu you are not strong, (b) if you repeatedly fall on your back, with a knife in it, it will hurt more and make more damage, unless it is a false prop, (c) when you get stabbed in the heart with a knife, you die, especially in ancient China where there is no permanent emperor around the corner, (d) kung fu fighting does not last for hours while 3 feet of snow falls, and (e) Sometimes it's worth while explaining your character and motivation. <br /> In any event, go hero look again, because at least in its own little world it is understandable.
