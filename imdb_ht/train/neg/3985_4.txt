Flat, ordinary thriller on a conniving woman who deceives everyone he allegedly loves in order to strengthen his bank account. Nicole Kidman plays Tracey's deceptive, married and doting Andy (Bill Pullman). When an old school friend named Andy Hill (Alec Baldwin) gets up as the resident's surgeon, problem is not far behind him. <br /> <br /> Script failed in that it does not carefully develop the promotional tour of an effective, tantalizing thriller, and the serious lack of character motivation, background and development to let the whole show happen. None of the castes can generate interest in their character's character, especially Bill Pullman, whose own inexplicably curious Andy is impossible to believe. <br /> <br /> Poor director Harold Becker is leaving trying to resurrect an impossibly dead project, and he can not entertain any of it. By the time the secret of the assignment reveals, you just will not take care. At least the cinema is good at Massachusetts. Also stars George C. Scott, Peter Gallagher and Josef Sommer. <br /> <br /> Sunday, February 25, 1996 - T.V.
