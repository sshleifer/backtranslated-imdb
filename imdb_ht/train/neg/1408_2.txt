I did not expect a lot of this movie, after the terrible "Life Is a Miracle". It seems that this film is ten times worse than "life ...". I have the impression that the director / writer is just playing with the audience: "let me see how much you can (audience) support". The dialogues are empty, ... scenario is minimalist. At some point, photography is really nice. Some sarcastic lines are semi-funny, but it's hard to really laugh during this "comedy". I laughed myself so they could watch the movie until the end. If you can raise yourself above this principal fiasco, you will find good acting in some legends (Miki Manojlovic, Aleksandar Bercek), and the excellent performance of Emira's son Stribor Kusturica .. In short : too bad for such a great director! Emir Kusturica is still young and should be top-rated movies. Instead, he chooses to make this budget-low budget-for-me-private, and arrogant attitude towards the world trends and negligence toward his old fans.
