Well, I was stuck on the fact that to sell EVP as the real movie was basically lying down with me from the go-go. I thought that hell, I do not believe in vampires but I still love Dracula so I could live with this. However, even with the accepted film is just not very good. It's completely done and act, but it does not really take you at all. There are several "jumps" moments, and I just looked at them and thought "yes, I did not expect that" without actually jumping in the slightest. <br /> <br /> Also, the resolution does not make sense. If the force behind this is able to do things it looks, then why does hell need to use a proxy? Plus, the end caption was absurd. They obviously put it as part of "giving credibility to film by claiming it to all real" stuff, but for those tasks it really needs to be at the start. But they can not put it at the start because then given the draw away ... sticking it to the end just to make it stick out like a sore throat.
