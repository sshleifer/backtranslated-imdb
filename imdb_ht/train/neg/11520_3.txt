I did not enjoy this movie at all. For one, I just got it bit and vulgar, for no reason. He also felt it's misogynistic (against women.) too, the movie really does not appear to be about anything, and I did not find any of the likable.really characters, does not seem to have any point in it all. My lips miss something, but for me, this movie is pretty much a waste of time when I was can do something more productive and enjoyable.like using my face like a pin cushion. James Garner is in this thing, as C.Thomas Howell and Shirley Jones, and James Cromwell.all are wasted here , and I'm sure this was a low point in each of their respective careers. Jennilee Harrison (from the later years of the Company's three) is also in the movie, and it is nice to see it in a woty that does not ditsy.but other than that, it can not rise above script la mediocr. For me, tanks are a 3/10
