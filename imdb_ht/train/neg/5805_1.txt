Anyone who saw the original should go out and destroy this obnoxious remake. Alex Baldwin is trying to imitate Steve Mcqueen late in a word to note the word just does not work. While Baldwin has done some admirable work this is a flop from start to finish. McQueen had charisma, never tried to compete with a star. As for Kim in the role of Ali McGraw enough said. McQueen looked dangerous, menacing and credible as Doc, the movie was excited and thrilling, Baldwin and company made this in a comedy, I laughed to the sole and only time I saw this movie miserable. With that obnoxious hairstyle for Michael Madsen who is one of the most exciting and credible actors today! Are the makeup makers there for Michael, what they thought. If you want to see the movie-made way it was under the direction of Sam Peckinpah to find the original!
