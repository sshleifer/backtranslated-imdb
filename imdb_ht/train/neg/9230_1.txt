I should qualify this title, now that I think about it. Checkout is not totally worthless. I had the opportunity to see it twice, and the second time I made a big laugh at the movie expense. So I guess it's worth something for that. and also refreshing for the painful pain it caused me to look at my first look. As another review outlined, this movie hacked in every sense of the word. Not one thought originally entered this movie (which commented below the originality of the quote entirely devalued me). The movie is nothing but a long line of clicks that are nervous and paraded around as a movie. It is definitely not the next clerk, it is definitely not original, and it is absolutely not "good, clean fun." The movie is the absolute agony of the layman (after seeing it the first time, the second time can be quite funny, in a sort of insulting way). As I was looking at the theater, it was obvious that almost everyone, prohibiting perhaps the elderly, was completely bored or painful by this movie. While some of the scenes were particularly emotional, such as where Nick chews out her mother, the audience was actually cringing because she was so badly done. I even heard a loud * man in the theater, something I had never witnessed. I do not care where you are lucky to see this film, be it in a festival movie, or in an independent theater, or wherever you are. Make yourself a favor, skip this movie with a vengeance. unless you are like me and just can not resist the opportunity to see what can really be the worst movie ever made.
