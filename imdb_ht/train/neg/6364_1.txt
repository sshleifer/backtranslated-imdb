Absolute garbage, worse battle scenes than a 20 year old windmill movie movie or American ninja etc. <br /> <br /> Truly actually acting, not a gap in the movie all its as a cast into wooden sculptures. /> <br /> Watching it just for how really bad this movie is, it may have been acceptable in the 80s, but this is a 2006 movie, I do not have much love for this movie as it was not born in 80s. <br /> If you like real movie movies then check out tony yea in backwards back with the protector, these are good martial arts films. <br /> <br /> There's a laugh and look at this today you can see the innocent humor in how its manure is.
