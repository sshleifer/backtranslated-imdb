This is yet another bad movie that you should probably avoid watching. The plot could be a lot "thicker" than it actually is and it would be best to do as a blockbuster blockbuster film. <br /> <br /> The act of leaving something to be desired, even if you can not properly put your finger on what it is. <br /> This is one of those you watch on late night TV, perhaps on USA, simply because you can not get to sleep. Watch it if you want but do not expect too much from it.
