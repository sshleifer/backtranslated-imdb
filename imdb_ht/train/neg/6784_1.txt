I tried to watch this movie twice and even then quickly send the irritating parties but still could not do it in the end. <br /> I do not understand how this movie * really * got any good reviews. I think these people provide these good reviews are just trying to hype the movie for marketing purposes. The reviews seem very unrealistic and it looks like a job inside, making things more pitiful. Movies should take real positive comments on their own steam and do not understand them! <br /> The act was reminiscent of a cheesy porn movie, and not in a funny way. I do not mind low budget movies and bad acts if they know how to work with it. <br /> I found the lead character to be disappointing. Her facial expressions and humor were unbearable children. I thought this was intentional to make the scheme of women seem more enjoyable and unfounded, but they were even worse. <br /> <br /> The script was also very awkward (his late employer's speech business) and the unfunny sarcastic remarks. I did not find anything picked up on this movie other than some of the attractive women. <br /> Never felt that a rating was this scam. I was interested by citing it, but scared by everything else. Of course see it if you want, but I just did not want anyone else to get their hope up / wasting time. <br /> <br /> Maybe it's just me ... Probably not.
