For those who would like to see this movie? I would say, go! Without the narration it might be a very good movie / documentary. But the music, the narration and some of the story lines apply to make it very difficult to look for an uncertain person like me. After several animals, the lives of several seasons each come to the feeling that it is a soap we are watching. But the melodramatic point of view just does not cut it for me, moreover, if a predator finally catches up on a Hawks (one left exception) the camera zooms or jumps into another scene. I wonder why this happened, if they showed the reality, why cut off the scenes of a melodramatic fairy staying? I think the moral is important for the mass of the crowd, to cause it all: it would be a waste to destroy this beautiful planet.
