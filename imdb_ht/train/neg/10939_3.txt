This movie has some of the worst acts I've ever seen! Some original scenes like nails come in the floor. This nail shovel catches these bad guys. The rest of the film degrades as you go. I can not believe that this film is not even in movies below 100 of all time. I can not believe that there is end! The next crap movie that I want to watch is R.O.T.O.R. Could R.O.T.O.R really be worse than this? <br /> <br />
