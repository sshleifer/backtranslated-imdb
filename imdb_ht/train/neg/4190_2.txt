I saw this movie a few months ago in the city that appeared as the movie Greendale, which is the only reason I went to see it. Another site that has just sent me an email announcement in a rehearsal show that the first was sold out with people being turned away. His editorial comment in the front is a good summary: <br /> Unless you are a Neil Young fan or live in / near Greendale (if your letter does not know the real name), skip this movie. It is mostly an ego trip for the cinema. It has no discernible scheme, the music is simply OK, and too much of the lyrics is unintelligible to make it impossible to follow that little little of the scheme can have. <br /> I do not need to put in a spoiler officer because there are no surprises giving away. <br /> I would give this a 1.5 / 10, but that's just for the entertainment value of seeing the locals made in a movie. It was not worth the $ 6. I could rent a video camera and drive around "Greendale" and make a better movie myself. If you want to see a good * * environment-movie movie with no scheme, go Koyaanisqatsi to rent.
