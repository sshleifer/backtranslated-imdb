Considering the original movie version of the 'haunt' is in my top ten film at all times' I approached this adaptation and twopidition. I was right to be cautious as this movie is a poorly-written writing and seriously executing ancient tosh , all of these Prints should be disappointed .. The original was scared to me as a kid for a reason! you do not see anything ... Robert Wise has used innovative camera-work with superb lighting generate awesome and this is why it works there. The shame of the new version is that it depends on the smart and special effects of pyrotechnics found out of AB Still sad is that the ingredients were (actors like Liam Neeson, Catherine Zeta Jones) do something different. This movie should only look as an example of stuffy studio!
