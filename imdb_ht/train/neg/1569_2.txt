Weak draw, easy to operate cars, and discourage character fumbling. At first I thought this film was made during the sixties, since the photo quality, as well as the storyline and drama seemed to take in an old Kojac episode. When I checked and found that he really did as late -97 I was amazed. This is by far one of the worst and younger (thriller) movies I've ever seen. If you read this, be advised, if you see it you waste time when you might do something more interesting, such as watching dry paint.
