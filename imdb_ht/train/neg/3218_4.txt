I found this movie to be an interesting study of causes and effects but little more than that. The basic draw follows life a handful of people and how their actions (deliberate and otherwise) affect the lives of others. The first movie holds great promise but I feel it does not save on its promises. It's too much time spent telling the audience about chaotic theory and too little time actually showing it. As a result, I never got a true feeling for any of the characters and never made a good connection with them emotionally. At the end of the film I had a "so" attitude over all of them. The strongest direction of character development would make this movie a lot, but as it means it is simply so-so
