As a person who lived in, and still remembers that clear decades, if the current '70s were half of this funny and (semi) normal, they would have been so much enjoyable. Current children in that era did not act or conduct anything close to as bright-eyed and normal as these kids did. The nation's nation was still under the influence of hippies and drug cultures all that '60s rebellion that it implies, especially in the behavioral department; petulant, emotional, self-esteem, disability, unreasonable in them - none of the characters show any of that. <br /> Someone compared to "Happy Day", and I can see why: Both sitcoms took place 20 years before the actual time they were broadcast, and both offered only textures, the ruptures of the era Real, not even close to the full scope of it, just showing obvious things - the mods, games, music, and so on. For those too young to remember, or they were not born then , trusting me, 70 were not like that, any more than "happy days" was like the current '50s, as "M * A * S * H ​​*" did not show life to a medical US Army base during Korean War, etc.
