Not a very good movie, but according to the information it is very accurate in describing torture techniques. The purpose of the film was to show the brutality of NK POW camps and that's effectively enough, and frankness surprising for the time. Whatever technical faults exist (and there are many) do not look at this you will see a forgotten corner of a forgotten war and some very embarrassing things - yet embarrassing because it made north of the DMZ and not in Guantanamo Bay. > <br /> I do not think any of the Korean veterans brought her torture when running for office, and if you watch the movies like this one and Chop Hill pigs in the Vietnam movie comparisons. I do not know if it was the people of '54 being trapped in the WWII concepts (boys tend to wisecrack) or the war or that, but it's interesting to see this from the same system 16 years Later it would be to make movies like "Go Di Spartans".
