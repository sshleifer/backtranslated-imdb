This is the only movie I've seen made by Uwe Boll, I knew it's probably the worst director ever-ever movie-based video game also that "House of the Dead" is one of 100 IMDb bottom. But I always wanted to watch it because I'm a big fan of the game and I wanted to see what made the film there that made it so bad. After watching it I agree that it is crap, the movie had no history. In the first 15-20 minutes there was nothing but young topless girls with no brain running on (for a moment I was asked are brain-dead zombies? Or do the girls?) Then , in the middle time zombies have popped out of nowhere and started attacking people later a woman started shooting them I mean it takes you one place then the other every 5 minutes. Is it supposed to be a comedy, or horror? or both? Before I knew it I fell asleep in the second half and rose during the end credit so I did not manage to watch all of it, that's a good thing! The movie is a true true of the classic game, Uwe Boll please do not make any more movie. Thanks!
