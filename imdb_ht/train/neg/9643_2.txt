Below average film and poor music consider a movie based on music ??? Ordinary Script & Direction and full of inaccuracies. Salman Khan was in his usual act. The performance aggression deteriorated with time as it seems, especially its styles as a Rock Star were pathetic. Ashin was just a showpiece only. Overall I felt like I was wasting my money in movies. Salman Khan remains as immature as 10 years ago compared to Aamir Khan. There were many songs in the movie all boring except "Man Ko Ati". The most important song of impressing the UK Music Sponsor was more impressive. "Khanabadosh" can be very well understood by an English Music Sponsor. The other movie I've seen last week was "Waking up South" that was simple story of love slowly and good direction & act despite average music
