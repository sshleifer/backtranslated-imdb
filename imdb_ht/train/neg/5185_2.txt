A complete waste of time <br /> <br /> Halla Bol is a complete waste of time. The script and dialogues are wrong written, the direction is mediocrity and borders to act on hammy. This film was clearly aimed at the crowd of Rang De Basanti but it fell far short of the brand because it does not have one of the components that made RDB connected to its audience_great, terrific act, good direction and a message powerful social who has never prophesied, but they show. <br /> <br /> Compared to the near-chief, Halla Bol takes a step-by step by resorting to scenes as the hero takes a sink on the Persian Rage's carpet and advises the hero to set down the bullet to a no less! All of this would be acceptable in the 80s when there was a decline in film quality and bad movies such as DivyaShakti and Phool Aur Kaante became big hit, but film-making became more subtle and thoughtful at the end. <br /> <Rajkumar Santoshi is a capable director and appreciates that he wants to give a social message to each movie he does, but maybe he simply does not know how to do it! It resorts to sermonize without a care like the audience's intelligence to understand what it tries to say. Maybe it should just focus on entertainment and leave social messages in Rachysh Mehras and Aamir Khans. Even if you do not agree with all that I say, you will agree that in all the screening you will think Rang De Basanti has been much better and Mr.Santoshi should leave industry-bashing at Om Shanti Om. Industry bashing? That's right! Santoshi has shown the industry as a back-biting place, bitching and couch in casting that the hero happily indulges in with a Curiously starlet called Sania. Some people will think that these portions show the real figure in the industry. Do not believe everything you see! <br /> In all, raise your voice against movies like this and do not spend your hard-earned money on this bomb. <br /> <br /> from ****.
