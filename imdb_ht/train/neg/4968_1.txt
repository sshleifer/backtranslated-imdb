I was expecting the movie based on Grendel, the book written by John Gardner in the late 1970s. It was based on the Beowulf season, but said from the perspective of the monster. <br /> Whatever you may think in Gardner's book, a movie based on the Beowulf season should not be allowed to Grendel, when it says nothing more about the monster beyond the few scenes in which the CG Monster shows that there is nothing more than a modifier Predator. <br /> <br /> On top of this, the writers should also be punished for lowering up the original story so seriously and contributing to the continued growing ignorance of television mass audiences across the US. Typical Hollywood to get this wrong. <br /> Very irritating with a complete waste of time.
