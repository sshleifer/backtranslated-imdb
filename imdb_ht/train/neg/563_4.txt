Will all good stories be "improved" and added the Broadway music corridor? Apparently people who can not come up with their own conspiracy think that classic literature is just for the looting. I confess that Oliver Twist and similar stories are not my favorites, as it is certainly true that Dickens often writes things that let you considerably bummed out, and that was a great example of just that ... So, Of course, taking this serious story and adding music to music with his camp and every character from Orphel boy to pretend to minus Bobbie and his sudden uplifting? Argh. Find me a basin. <br /> <br /> The four stars in my rating from casting, which I could compare to that of my Fair Lady. Each of these films has a cast that a game version might be proud of, but then they must go and have to sing (see the complaint above). Unlike My Fair Lady, those singles here could actually do so and mercifully killed our singing voice at Oliver Reed (forgiving if I made mistakes, it was a little bit longer). <br /> <br /> My biggest complaint, I declare. Why embarrassing everyone except the really cynical does not wear unusual songs in a perfectly good story? This rarely had a good effect. Usually it breaks down the story. He did with this one. The jury still comes out on whether this story is worth saving, but with all that gadding over, it's impossible to say.
