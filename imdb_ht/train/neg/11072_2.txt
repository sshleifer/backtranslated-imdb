See on TV late last night. Yeah, I can hear what y'all say about this one. It is likely to be categorized as one of these serial stereo-typical TV sets. In all justice, the story line has a fine twist, and you might shake it, "Well, this is not what I hope." But as a movie, well it is not easy to spot an elked element. Casting, acting, working cameras, cars, costumes, settings, script, names, nothing to congratulate. Rated R Oh, this scene. Do we need it? This is a movie that you can watch it, and then forget that you even look. And what was the title anymore?
