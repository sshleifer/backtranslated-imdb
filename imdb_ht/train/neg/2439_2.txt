"Intensive Care" by Dorna von Rouveroy is unlikely to be one of the worst horrors ever made. This extremely cheap dutch slasher film is featuring some gore and lots of absurd situations. A George Veteran veteran horror is completely wasted as Bruckner teacher .The act is unfortunately, the action is slow and the scary is ridiculous. A famous surgeon has a car crash. He lies in a seven year coma and then wakes up and goes on a blood rack .. " Intensive Care "is clearly influenced by American slasher movie including" Halloween "and" Friday 13th "series.The hilarious killers and the dialogues are painfully stupid.Many if you are in the right mood you can give this piece of garbage a look.You will laugh until it hurt and this one-you can believe me!
