I saw Arthur (TV series and books) years ago and never been fond of the very show (if you are a fan of this cartoon, sorry if I drip it for you, but this is actually what I think ) .There are many who love it, but I did not. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Her DW (though the name was spelled), and DW is an ADHD (or ADD) like 4-year-old sister at Arthur who was sometimes asked (which might be why Arthur was annoyed and His routine, like his imaginary friend and his collection of stuffed animals, etc.), Arthur's friends have acted as adolescents instead of like in the Arthur books, and their parents, well, they did not care much. <br /> <br /> The best cartoon was Rocko's modern life, not Arthur (no offense).
