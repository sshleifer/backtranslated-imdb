This must be one of the worst Swedish films ever made. <br /> It is embarrassing that such a bad script allowed them to become a movie and show in movies as recently as 2006. <br /> <br /> I have never seen many visible products sponsored in one and films at the same time. It should not be obvious. I can not understand why many actors even thought the same idea must be visible in a movie like this. If I had no respect for some of the actors known in this movie before I saw the movie, it went for sure now. I've heard that there will be a movie followed in this one and I can not understand how this is even possible.
