This solid movie film is actually one of the best Renny Harlin's. The story is very routine, but the atmosphere is what makes it alive; In fact, the ghost story is almost a reflection. The real reason comes from the prison environment itself, and Renny H. spare no details to show us how bad the conditions are inside that crumbling, sinking, rat-infested old hell (and a sadistic leader, too!) Viggo Mortensen is excellent as usual in the lead role, supported by very authentic captives (no nice boy in this cast.) Horror fans should check this one out.
