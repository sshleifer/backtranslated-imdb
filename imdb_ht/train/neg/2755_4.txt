This is the sorriest collection of clich√©s, sniper along a straight line, with no memory or any decent way of acting I've seen in a long time. Canibalising scenes from Star Wars, Reign of Fire, Godzilla, Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter, went for a whole war of intelligence in viewer. Was this movie good? It was not a movie at all! Even if it does not go so low to actually be funny and achieve cult status as a comedy, the movie offers some laughs. The trick is to set the scenes copied in the original movie context. Gandalf can be funny Korean speaking, the Basilisk looking hilarious snake if you compare it to a kitten and evil smashing can give a lot of fun changing returns and ideas between Sauron and Jaja-Bing, or whatever his name was. <br /> Bottom line: Any fun that comes from this film is completely dependent on the state of intoxication and imagination of the viewers, not on the director / writer. Shame on you, Shim!
