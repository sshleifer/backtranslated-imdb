I almost call HBO and ask my money back for the month just because they've been awning this movie. I can just see the movie exits sitting around going, "Okay, we need to come up with something in just like Home alone, only we'll add a bunch of cash to the kid, hire cut-rate actors , and oh yeah, we'll make it much less funny! "Okay, maybe not the last part, but that's basically what you've got here. Not even worth to see if someone else rents it. And as a movie for kids? Forget it. I would not let my kids see this, not necessarily because of the bad-taste jokes, but because I do not want to say, "What did you think shows us that the tied piece of garbage, dad?!?! "
