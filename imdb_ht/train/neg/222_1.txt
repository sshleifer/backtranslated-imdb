As a single woman over 40, I found this movie very insulting and abusing one woman over 40, not to mention all other women, at any age. It was a sad, attempted attempt by a man to write and directed a "Flick Chick", and he failed miserably. Andy McDowell is not much of an actress to start with, but given the non-existent "scheme" (I hate even looking at it as a plot) in this, he did not have a chance. There was no character development, no reason to feel sympathy / sympathy for any of the characters, and no attempt to make the movie in any realistic or credible way. Then there's the mandatory male-fantasy of a woman women right suddenly decided to give lesbianism a try - PLEASE. <br /> <br /> Not only do I wish I could get my money back to the DVD rental, I also want 112 minutes of my life back. What a ripple.
