Show this is terrible. How is George wanting death in his mother funny? This is terrible. Parents are obviously awful and children should take on child services. The daughter is a witch and a B and the son is just a complete roast. George is not funny, especially when he speaks loud and obnoxious in Spanglish. Ernie is a loser, but at least I was chuckled at him a few times, but especially in how pathetic she is. George's mother, Benny, in a terrible character, despicable. Sure, her husband left her, but how anyone can laugh at how he treated George as a baby beyond me. Can someone explain to me how great George's head was funny? It's not that great! I moved out of the characters because they were too horrible and would take hours to write to me, honestly, not enough care. I care enough to tell anyone looking at this and wondering whether they want to watch this show, that this show is a malicious crackdown for a sitkon, and it's not worth your time. <br /> I give it 2 start, because the wife is very attractive.
