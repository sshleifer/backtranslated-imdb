I do not know why, but after all the hype on NPR I thought this was a new movie ..... All the best footage was used for BBC Docs and NatGeo projects that you've seen if you are interested in nature programs ... it has been repackaged and narratives of sappy and sub-dramatic music for Disney taking advantage of Earth Day-there are great moments, and it's always nice to listen to Darth Vader ....... oops, ... James Earl Jones talked, but I was hoping for a movie to break ground, considering the new technology camera used to make this film ...... it was sanitized for a childhood hearing, so one can actually see better footage free on youtube .... i feel that we are for something like crushed ground like Koyannisquatsi (sugar) and this movie is certainly not read
