Black guy becomes wealthy white guy, and rich white guy looks to embrace hip-hop culture, and most of the "funny" moments of this movie play in this. The problem I have is that it does not work and almost never works. <br /> OK, so no one would expect Lance to grab a body like that and suddenly begin to act like Charles Wellington. That would be too much to ask. I'll give it. But at the same time, it goes too far to the other direction. I'm supposed to imagine a wealthy white guy raping and stuff that's completely up, playing like he's a bastion of hip-hop culture, and who just * accepts him? And what about Sontee, who falls in love with him as a rich * white *, though he does not care about his money or power? This is so incredible it is not even funny. <br /> I just could not stop disbelief and I could not finish the movie. I added one extra star because it made me laugh, even tough, a couple of times. But I just could not get to get past all the "white guy doing hip hop" thing that has never been well done in any movie I've ever seen trying it out. This was no exception.
