Wow. I've seen some really bad movies in my time, but this one really takes the cake. It is the worst movie I've seen in the past decade - there is no exaggeration. As a U.S. Army veteran in the war in Afghanistan, I find it almost impossible even end up watching this ridiculous movie, not because it brings back memory - far from it - but because there was absolutely no attempt at "authenticity" must be found anywhere in the movie. Not so sweet little things. It seemed like it was written by a 8-year-old child who received all his notions of war (and behavioral soldiers) straight from comic books. The film was made in Honduras, which should have been a sign, but even that can not fully explain the atomic output value of this cliche-ridden piece of garbage. <br /> I could try to list all endless technical faults, but it would normally take forever. From the former unit patch that has not been seen or torn since WWII, with character's characters, such as "ColCollins" (torn by the character "Colon Collins"), which was actually spelled using the reverse, mirror- Image "N" in the Russian alphabet (by the U.S. alphabet) the list just goes over and over. Uniforms, equipment, draws, and most specifically the behavior of the characters themselves - each one scene was just shock-filled in ridiculous flaws, blunders and clich√©s completely expected. <br /> <br /> Neither the storyline itself nor the characters were the least bit credible or credible. It was all infinitely sad, in the extreme. This was obviously a movie that was meant to appeal to the boy's pre-pibescent boy, and I have little doubt that even this movie would be completely absorbed. <br /> <br /> In films, this movie has absolutely NO qualities redeeming at all. It's a total waste of time. I would strongly advise anyone to read this to pass this waste; It's really not worth wasting a moment in your time for.
