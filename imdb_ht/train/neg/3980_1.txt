No, I do not cry. If they ever propose a movie idea, they should be chased out of the studio. I'm serious. These films are exactly the same in each one and are only composed of traveling to foreign places, having a problem that are easy to solve, hoping to be popular, and getting new boyfriends. Think about it. If you ever saw a movie start with a different scheme, contact me and tell me her name. These "movies" are poor excuses to be on TV and go to other countries. There is one reason why the movies never went to the theater. I'm sure when they were really young and did some O.K. Movies, some boss bought all the rights for 15 years, or something, so that now they're, what, 17, can make movies in other countries every time they want to use money the studio. Let me advise you, stay away from Mary-KATE and Ashley! It is for your own good!
