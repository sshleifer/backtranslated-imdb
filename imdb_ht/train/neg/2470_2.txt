I've seen many horror shows during those years, such as Nightstalker, who faced Wendigo's legend, so I was looking forward to an angry spirit that caused destruction to add flavors to the Halloween season. Man I made mistakes. The movie all creates this sense of event on happen that will be scary and creepy, but then delivers a very simplistic story of revenge and murder on the loss of some property. Do not scare - not! This movie has a lot of common and Cold Creek Manor, another total loser. It gets harder and harder to believe that Hollywood puts forward on scary movies, since they rarely come in with the original and spooky anything else. What idiots pay for such a movie movie have to be made? Return to the board drawing chart, and do something useful with these millions of greenbacks you have to throw.
