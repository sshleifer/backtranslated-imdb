An ensemble of refreshing and unlikeable twist characters and turning their way through a delicate draw that would be interesting if only you could bring yourself to care. This "twist and turn" I speak of referring to the story (with all the suspense of a recipe for casserole tone) but the inability of the director to keep the characters face even remotely centered in the frame. On the other hand, Angie Harmon has many nostrils and ears left. <br /> <br /> Only the real surprise of the movie is the great names they are convinced to do it. Considering this movie has never been released in the theater despite having an all-star cast, you might be inclined to think something stinks. <br /> <br /> And indeed, it does.
