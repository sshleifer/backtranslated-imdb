Bad plot (though good for a B-movie), good scene fighting rhythm, in most a 5 out of 10. But there is something that bothered me about this movie: how does Mariska Hargitay never talk? In the TV version, she shared intimate moments with Jeff Speakman, even a kiss in a field. But in the regular version (video), most of its scenes are off and never talk at all. This bothers me because he does not just take a girl (though kinky) point-of-view movie, he also makes the final shot looks creepy. This film would be best kept in his scene, because at the scenes at least he has a personality, one that undercuts everything that Speakman says.
