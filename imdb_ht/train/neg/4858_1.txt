Why in the world would anyone make this piece of waste films? The first two cinema cinema zombies were stupid enough, but this took the cake for the worst of the trilogy (maybe at all). Todd's letter is still the director, but not senarist, which is not a negative or positive, considering it just as untalented as the guy who wrote this one. The word is too heavy depending on the f-word, which is used somewhere between 200 and 300 times in nausea. The act is about on par with the latest of these Bloodbath films, so naturally, it's some of the worst I've ever seen. Special effects are better than the last 2, but they always look godawful. The plot has become too complicated for its own clean, and it has been on some government experience to go wrong with zombies being produced. Also featured cryogenically frozen mutant zombies and school kids who know how to travel time, leading to one of the most idiotic endeavors I've ever seen. After the movie she goes to outtakes, which is strange because this whole movie is an absence. Only see this fun in it, because if you go through this with a serious idea, you might perhaps kill yourself. <br /> My Rating: BOMB / ****. 95 mins.
