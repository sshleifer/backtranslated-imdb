A different look at horrors. The styling differences between American and Russian films are interesting. However from my American perspective this movie just was not good. The protagonist, Marie played by Anastasia Hille was not a nice character and I had a hard time identifying with her. It was unpleasant most of the time and confused for much of what little time left. Also too much time spent in bringing it to the main place in the movie. Then, a long time before any real suspension build. Once it happened it seemed the volume used as the main effect was more annoying than anything else. The concept was more original than most direct-to-video cinema and they did not use sex to make up for a thin sketch. All in all I would recommend it for rent, but not for theaters.
