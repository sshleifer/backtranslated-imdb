I first learned in Wendigo many years ago in one of "Story Stories Alvin Schwartz" story: according to the story, Wendigo - after calling your name in the wind - drag you together, and then pull you up in the sky and pulverizes you. While it sounds like a very rare notion, Schwartz's story turns him into a coherent justice idea. <br /> <br /> The movie "Wendigo" does not. It basically consists of each clip clip: family moves to new homes and strange things begin to happen, anyone who is badly asked for it, and everyone was best listening to the old Indian guy. I have seen this thing many times that I do not bother to count. <br /> <br /> Anyway, avoid it. Patricia Clarkson and Erik Per Sullivan (Dewey on "Malcolm in the middle") made far better than that.
