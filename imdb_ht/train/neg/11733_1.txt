I'm shocked that there were people who liked this movie .. I saw it at Tribeca and most of the audience laughed at it in scenes that were not meant to be funny. I felt bad because the lead actress was in the audience, but honestly the movie scheme needed MAJOR review .. did not even make sense, one second question characters that exactly it is that they're snorting .. next The scenes are hopelessly addicted and figure out how to do it ?? Also, the finish just take the cake .. I will not spoil the magnificent conclusion .. but it's pretty much blended in with the rest of the horrific sketch / script ... see this movie for comedy if you must ..
