Just another example why Stephane King's books should not be made in movies. (Even Carrie, one of the best, is ruined by the adaptation from screen books.) Mostly the story revolves around a fat lawyer, always on a diet, who "accidentally" kills an old Gypsy woman. In court, with the help of the judge and local police chief, he came off, though the accident was sort of faulty as he had not paid attention as he drove. The father of the dead Gypsy woman puts a curse on the 3, and our main character, Billy (the lawyer) is getting slim and thin in the day. Even if the movie holds with the book, for the most part, and with your typical king you end, the act has swallowed and felt compelled. We went from one scene to the next without much of anything in between, sort of like reading acts in a play. King himself made a comedy in the movie (sort of like Dave Barry), which strengthens my belief that the authors should be just that: author. Leave actor actor. Not that anyone in this film was so great. I saw the biggest characters in the movie where they were better.
