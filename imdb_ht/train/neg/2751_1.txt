I hate the same amount of time it takes to write 10 lines on this atrocity. Hyung-Rae Shim is the likely movie-maker that is not a capital offense or he should be killed twice for writing and conducting this disaster. I'm surprised that this movie has a budget of $ 75m, but is actually happy in the sense that it was such a great flop, that Shim will hopefully never get another film to the rest of life and, therefore, , do not waste any more of time filmgirlers. I would think that the actors would have come up with her lynched by now. <br /> <br /> With the effect of available resources, a big movie can be done with this budget. As usual, the failure should be located at the very beginning with the terrible script and story. "Transformers" was another visual feast with a weak script, but this made it seem like "Citizens Kane".
