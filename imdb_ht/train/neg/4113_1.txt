I have to end up watching a movie once I start, no matter how bad it is. This film was agonizing to sit down. The "brilliant" bullets, reporters and "ninjas" like moving, the way the bad guys shoot hundreds and hundreds of bullets and only looks to hit innocent spectators, the predictable and evil acting results were just awful. Like the girl who finds the reporter of her friends apartment and goes to "what the heck you do in here (hold a stick)" to "hey, you pretty, wanna @ # $%!" In such 1.2 seconds .... Just bad .... Save yourself an hour and forty minutes and go play with your kids (or dogs)!
