The original 1965 Japanese film "Gamera" http://pro.imdb.com/title/tt0059080/ was essentially an upgrade to the darker, less kid-oriented Gojira (Godzilla) for the 1960s sensitivity. Gamera, of course, is a giant, flying, flame-throwing torture that literally consume energy - not quite as great as some versions of Godzilla, but generally the same way in most ways. <br /> This version of the original movie has been edited and recited by Sandy Frank's notorious. And just like the American version of Godzilla ("Godzilla of the monsters"), the "Gummera invincible" gets more than just the wrong spelling. American scenes are not nearly as ludikrous and annoying as those additions to the great Gojira, but do not really add much to the story either because there are little follow up on them. The movie starts with promise, has a few scenes worth of character development, and has enough personality to create some tension outside of the main draw. Once Gamera appears, however, the movie starts down to a fairly run-of-the-film movie cabinet. <br /> <br /> The act is good enough - even the American add-ons are OK. The direction is very good for this period and genre, and the special effects are not bad at all for the time (all thumbnails). Some of the sets and backdrops are actually pretty good. <br /> <br /> The biggest problem here, of course, is that there is little nothing original about this movie. Gamera, however, develops a more unique personality in her later film - most of them are worth seeing if you are a kaiju fan.
