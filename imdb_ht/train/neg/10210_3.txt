Hard to believe that the director of Barbet Schroeder once did the majestic and very funny Maitresse (1976), and now only seems to do the "no numbers" Hollywood stairs. This is very lightweight John Grisham material, crossed with the plot of a TV movie. Bullock is Cass Mayweather, a feisty investigator and independent crime specializing in serious assassinations. Ben Chaplin is his law enforcement partner Sam Kennedy, and together they make a comfortable duo. Not bad, when two unruly collegiate colleagues (Gosling and Pitt) decided to send them on a run of wild goose - do not plant very smart and deceive legal evidence in a crime scene. <br /> <br /> Fair enough, but while Bullock and Chaplin failed to create any spark, we also have endured a number of melodramatic subjects to illustrate an important event in Cass's story. Then, of course, shots are often in a log-side cabin where there's absolutely no doubt the OTT must be set. Oooh ... the atmosphere. <br /> Look at any episodes of CSI instead. It's the point and far more interesting.
