If asked how I would define the words "Shallow" I would answer "Look at a Jerry Bruckheimer production". If asked how I would define the phrase "wasted the potential" I would reply "Look at a Jerry Bruckheimer production". Bruckheimer outputs are almost always ensured that fire hits in the box office, but almost always receives criticism from their critics. On top of myself I can only think of an OFFICER AND A HUMAN and black HAWK down to get a lot of critical reputation. <br /> <br /> CRIMSON TIDE has also got some reputation denied from criticism, it`s certainly one of Bruckheimer`s best films that we are not saying so much. The problem I had was the storyline that sets the story: The Russians are fighting the Chechens and the dispute spread across Russia that leads to an ultra-Russian nationalism to take on a nuclear missile base and threaten the West if they interfere. Perhaps ending in the cold war had everything to do with it but I found this set up very compelling. It did not help in some geographical errors such as the French Foch carrier in the Med (would not Foch's best positioned in the black sea?) Or that the newsreel exhibit consists of familial footage featuring conflicts from the Balkans, first golf war and even Vietnam. Once again the "Very compelling" adjective of my mind. The story improves somewhat when the story is appropriate - A fight in additions regarding the order between a submarine submarine commander and his two numbers - come underway. Director Tony Scott does his best as the cast, but the problem still lies in a compelling scenario. The worst thing is that if this was done in the mid 1980s when WW3 was a real possibility - Probability name - this movie would have scared me, but after the cold war ended so there was danger of Nuclear Wars that mean CRIMSON TIDE has little impact.
