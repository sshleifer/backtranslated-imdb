What's the point to review a movie like this? It's great suffering and anbarrassingly bad, not even in a way that lets you enjoy it. <br /> <br /> Movies like "Little Man" squeeze me. They represent the most dramatic movie. This movie was made for a bunch of 18-24 year old dipsh * t frat boy who the studio hoped would come out and see it on opening night before word fruit comes out as it was bad, so That the movie can quickly recover its investment. One hundred other filmmakers and great ideas probably could not get the movies made because the resources went toward doing this chilly little bit of vomiting.
