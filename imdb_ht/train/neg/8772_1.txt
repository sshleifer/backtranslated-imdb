There is nothing new for me to say: 4 hours of the dead and over at the same mountain. The cast was stellar, but unfortunately the producer / director / editor / god was goofed. He should eat outraged (if not for his own sake for those who died in Kargil), hired one of these brilliant Bollywood directors, hired a real scriptwriter, hired a real editor, hired a musician who had not been reported and it's some way (and those who seemed to have listened to some malicious version of "Apocalypse Now" on some cheap Indian drugs), hired a real professional crew, threw all the fireworks, saying a real story. Unfortunately, like the bigwigs of the American Army, the decision was terrible for his actors and terrible for his audience. We all died on and off. <br /> <br /> Please do not do that again, Master! Sushma Kathmandu, Nepal <br /> <br /> In the near future an American director decided to glorify the Gurkha regime, suggesting he was hiring more than a Nepali to represent the team. Surely there are many Nepal working in Bombay - the last count was 40,000 to half a million.
