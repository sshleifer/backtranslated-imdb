It as absolutely incredible to me that anyone can comment that this film is not preachy. It is not only provocative, but absurd, stagebound, dramatically straight-jacketed, and painfully overwrought. Watching it, one feels like a 8 year old child was punished by having written "I will not become a fascist" on the board 100 times. <br /> Now I understand that he did during the height of WW2, and he intended for a brave conviction of Hitler and his terrible suffering brought about, (which anyone would all-heartedly applaud) and I'm sure it's well taken the mood of the day. But it is presented in such a way, an immediate, over-obvious, sledgehammer, it fails abysmally as a work of art. <br /> <br /> The only good performances here are from Paul Lukas, which brings sincerity and intensity to his role as a slowly heroic anti-fascist; and Lucas Watson as the amusing sick grandmother who slowly comes to realize how dangerous the world has become. Even though the roots of their roots have been imposed on all kinds of difficulties, the ridiculous children are shown as well-behaved robotics. They do not even remotely resemble real human beings. And Bette Davis, a great actress, here is so one noble dimension I cringed every time he was on screen. Reading each word, each gesture means that they are transmitting how SUPPORTIVE and understanding it is in the SACRIFICES that her husband did and great what he fought for, that he had to be hooked to get a painful electric shock if he leaked allows no hint of doubt or shadow surface to paint it. <br /> So, yes, this is a very imported movie, just not a very good one.
