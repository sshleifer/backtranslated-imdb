I'm a fan of Columbo, especially on a rainy Saturday, and it was fun to see Oskar Werner after Fahrenheit 451, but this episode missed a lot. The original plot and twisted drawings were obvious and could be evaluated in advance, even years before the modern detective show of today. But it was fun to see the crazy canoes and modern "electronics equipment" and, of course, humorous suburbanite humor poking fun in modern art for sale. The high-tech home is a Jetson or Disney version of Tomorrowland, and the pleasure of writing writers invented these "gizmos way-out". <br /> <br /> If its sunrise, go play, as there are many better Columbo episodes. Still, we should be grateful for TV Cable that these episodes are being broadcast.
