Does HeidiJean really see this movie? A great Christmas movie? Do not even close. Mat, Afli and completely lack of imagination and heart. I continued to watch this movie asking who hell thought that Carly Pope could play the lead in this movie! The woman has no detectable personality and provides a completely substandard performance. Baransky was great as usual and gave the modicum only in the exciting thing. Probably his involvement was the only reason that this project was green lit up to begin with. Maybe I'm hoping too much for a movie forever to play 15 days out of Christmas, but I'm sitting in this mind thinking with a different director and a Recovery JJ with an actress who at least could give this sympathy could be a nice little movie.
