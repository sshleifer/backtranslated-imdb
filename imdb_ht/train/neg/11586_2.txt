A nightmare on Elm Street: child of dreams <br /> <br /> This is a bad movie. There is no escape. I love the series and I think Freddy is probably the best character ever in horror movies. But even being a fanatic I can not help but see this movie is the same. There is even an effort to build an interesting story with strong characters. From now on they were just giving up. They do not even try. The production of course, is expected for a few dollars more easily. <br /> <br /> The story does not grab your attention. So simple it is almost absent. <br /> Alice, a survivor of Part 4 is now pregnant. Freddy is coming back to the baby's dream. At the beginning we learn that to stop her Alice must get her mother. And that's it. <br /> <br /> The story advances gently since there's little trace means it turns pretty boring after a few minutes of bad and terrible acting dialogue. In fact, only one thing is frightening, acting since death is not even a little cool. <br /> <br /> The characters are so refreshing we could not care less for them. <br /> <br /> Girls are as unattractive as possible. All dropping to remind me of a bad theater theater theater. I saw the best actor in the school play. It is embarrassing really. Lisa Wilcox still managed to bring some class to this. She is beautiful, sexy and has some talent. But the material just did not let her shine. What a pity. <br /> Stephen Hopkins works is nowhere close to Renny Harlin's bright dream of Dream Master. She tries some imaginable shots near the end, but that tensions Harlin and Craven create well in movies before they can not find anywhere. <br /> <br /> Children of Dreams is just another inimaginable fan. It's the kind of movie that gives horror series a bad name. <br /> The end for Freddy's scary times. It's too sad to see him now. A clown is not funny. A bad joke. Goodbye to Freddy.
