The first time I watched Cold Ka was after she ran for about a year on Danish television. At the time he came to the TV he nearly drowned in 4 or 5 other American crime shows revealed about the same time. <br /> I saw it and I was bored to death. The subtle actors and face of righteous upright and moral have been a pain in the back. The whole quote has given a lot of money a team of investigators to solve murders dating back to 10-20-30 or even 60 years seems so easy. The time is also a factor as there are only 50 -60 mins telling the story that means finding a just break in the nick of time to settle the case and bring justice to their family members, if they are still alive . This combines with the "personal" issues and relationships of the investigators who are there to be time to let the show a complete mediocrity. <br /> I give her a 2-star rating because of the music I'm at the end of which is really the only reason for watching it .... which you then of course will not do like that is TOO lame one reason for watching this crap.
