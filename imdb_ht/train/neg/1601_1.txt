Stereotypical throwing up into slasher cops falls off short as supposed to be fun. Gerrit Graham, Michael Lerner, Zane Busby, and in fact the entire cast is totally wasted. Blame blame is a lot, and each line punches well telegraph. The dumb materials one comes at a fast pace, and almost every one falls flat like a broken grape. The music numbers only contributed to the boredom that lie in and satin for the whole movie. Another negative is the claustrophobic environment entirely in the walls of a discarded high school. Avoid this and seek one of the really funny films "Lampoon" like the "Golddiggers National Lampoon" - MERK
