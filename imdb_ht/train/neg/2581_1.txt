The first to get my own personal feelings out of the way let me start by saying that I hate so-called comedy where every single character writes and plays like they were so stupid that you wounder if they're all the result of inbreeding. /> <br /> Now I'll say this I've seen the first three American pie cinemas and while they were not the most amazing cinemas that I've ever seen were all right (and the chief outright compared to three "The American Pie Presents" movie), I still feel compelled to ask what the hell they thought when doing this movie? <br /> I also had some other questions. thought that this was an acceptable use of money studios and production resources? <br /> Who approved the last script (and who smoked when it was approved)? <br /> <br /> And finally why anyone thinks it deserves to be released to the theater where the average cost of admission is between 10 and 15 dollars depending on where you live when it should have gone straight to is the discounted blockbuster or Wal Mart? <br /> There is much wrong with this movie that I can not write a really comprehensive review of it because it would exceed the maximum permitted words on this forum so I will just handle the bigger things that are wrong with it . The draw is generic unenspired and stupid with the characters all about as exciting as watching dry paintings for eighty minutes but the biggest thing that I can see is wrong with this movie is the actual one. <br /> While most of the cast is Talentless namers name that will probably be forgotten in a few years, <br /> the one and only big names in this movie are Eugene Levy who spend almost all the time reading is on the screen with this smirk knowing about his face that says the viewer "I know this is' not funny and I wasted my talent but hey I get paid for it so who cares about it" does not even try to do any of his jokes funny (it really deserves better than this waste). <br /> <br /> As I mentioned above most of the rest of the cast are awful though some of them were really great TV shows, Tyrone Savage (from the classic Canadian wind to my back ) play a character that is unbearable and irresponsible (there are things that he could teach tropical skin diseases) that you almost want he would die a slow and painful death on screen, Christopher McDonald (NCIS, Law & Order) just hanging around screen and waste what talent he did was not in this movie. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the next movie in this series will be just for a soft core pornography and a story line so they can get around the MPAA and get a rating R this movie goes all out with nudity vulgarite The unnecessary and unattractive sexual content that it should have gotten the X rating (the evaluation board must have been drunk or drugs by reviewing this movie for its rating). <br /> It is interesting that twenty five years ago when Wes Craven submitted a nightmare on the Elm Street MPAA for a rating review to force him to cut twenty five seconds into feet (I believe he was part of a scene death that had a silicone casting in a breast in it) to avoid getting an X rating and it had no other choice but to make it or the movie would not have been released, but this kind of untold garbage onslaught can get the R rating today because it's all done in comedy names, if this movie was a drama or horror movie and this kind of content would have a great feel about the content and it would havegotten the daunting X rating. <br /> <br /> The last thing that really annoys me is the writing, this movie is written to play out like the wet dream of some twelve year old kid with a very bold sexual fantasies youthful and extraordinary crabs, almost every situation exponentially supposed to move the th corpse of this movie calls a draw together so telegraphed that any smart viewer can see it come a mile away and with so-called characters are just stereotypes Stereotypes of stereotypes, never mind the repulsive sexual and constant sexual needs of the sexual orientation of sexual feelings it feels like this movie was written by some incompetent first-year hack in a class movie lecture movie film. <br /> <br /> The time and short of it is time to kill this series before it gets any more crab and offensive stupider, this pie filled with road apples.
