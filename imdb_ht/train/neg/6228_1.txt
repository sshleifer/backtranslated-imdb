This movie is incomprehensible bad. It starts with several random explosions and then cut into a puppet sock in a T-Rex talk (!) At the hearing. He goes back and forth between puppet socks and animation at all, probably because the movie makers could not pay live actors. I'll spare you the long, controversy, relentless plot that drags this pitiful film for a 85 minute brutal. <br /> One of my friends found this very rare video in a fun shop somewhere sold out of b-cinema printing, and bought it for the sole purpose of making fun of it, but, As it turned out, our intervention did not recuperate. This movie makes fun of himself better than we could. <br /> I think "The 9 Space Ed Ed in Ed Exterior" was the cheesiest movie of existence, but left it in Japan / Lego machine / puppet sock outside it. If you see this movie anywhere, buy it without hesitation. It's very rare and worth much, very good laughs.
