One can cope with historical inaccuracies, but this film was just too much. Virtually nothing that was even close to truth, and even for the era, was seen as comical. <br /> In the ford defense, she appeared on an old talk show, which she operated on the story as told by Wyatt Earp's real, who was obviously old, senile, and replayed scene in his own way. Earp told the director on the stagecoach, and how he planned to arrive during the stagecoach arrival, so despite the fact that other historian claims, Wyat himself alleged that he had been cautious. <br /> This movie shows Earp as an honest man, and also his brothers. History does not exactly say they were or they did not. Most people like to interpret a bit of trumpet and anarchy of the characters, but that's nothing new. The truth is probably closer to the fact that this law has remained in GUNFIGHT at the OK Corral. Men who saw it as a career, and believe me, in the ancient West, you did not have time to think about too many other things. <br /> <br /> Characters that do not exist, characters show dead in choirs that really did not, all doing this a weaker movie. It is further weakened by Maturity, who really did not make a convincing doc. It may be the worst choice to throw away forever for Doc, but at the same time we must remember that the greatest movies were closer to the era and closer to a feeling for the truth. After all, ford found first-hand information from Wyatt Earp. It is also weakened by all predictable events involving the Mexican girl. Hollywood was highly Nazis in those days, and ready to kill in brutal women in very predictable fashion to show their patronage of Hitler's idealism. This occurs in most movies until the eighties. It is not an excuse, and it does cheap the art, however. The actors who play the earps do well, and Brennan is still a thrill. In fact, Mature can only downside acting in this flick. Still, it is the weakest in the old OK Corral films.
