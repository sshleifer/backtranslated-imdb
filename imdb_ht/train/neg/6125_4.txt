This movie is the best Derek couple ever made and if you think this is a recommendation then you have not seen any of the others. There are usually the ingredients: it is just as wrong to act as the other efforts, we can watch Bo disrobing or audition for mosquito T-shirt competitions quite often, the story is just idiotic ridicule, and the movie takes its head too much seriously. Then: Orang Utans in Africa? <br /> But it has a few things to go for it. Bo looks great, their production value (sets, costumes, etc.) are good, and this greatly improves its camp value. In a strange way it is actually quite funny, simply because it tries to be serious and fails so seriously.
