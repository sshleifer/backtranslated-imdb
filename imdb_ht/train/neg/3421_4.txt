Star Rating: **** ***** Work Just missing the mark *** This little bit in between ** Set back behind * Hole <br /> <br /> Some plutonium disappeared and some those very nasty Now there are ways to develop a bomb capable of destroying wholesale - so Josh McCord (Chuck Norris) and her kid shield Deke (Judson Mills, an actor different from previous films) with assistance Josh adopted Daughter Jennifer (Jennifer Tung) puts out to stop them. <br /> This was another film that dealt with terrorism one year after the events of 9/11. Filmed in 2001, Norris himself even commented afterwards how wavy line is drawn in the film resembled what happened in downtown New York that day, so there would be people who'd been in the mood for a movie where Norris and side kick kick some terrorist ass if nothing else. In addition, it's as being substituted as nothing Norris was ever in. It makes you wonder what the original did guarantee an end in the first place, and if if this one could be a Man 3 President would be out sometime soon. <br /> If you've seen one film Norris, you really see them all and there's really nothing new or unexpected happens with this one, but at least you know what you're getting, and , as I said, it might have been just what some need to let in some steam. **
