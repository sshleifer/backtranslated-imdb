"It's not like great mechanical game," says an early character, commenting on "jaws". Well, "Blood Surf" would only want to have an animal as compelling as shark in the series "jaws". In other words, the special digital effects of this film are terribly. Act and direct them not, either; They seem more suited to a deodorant or bust-gum commercial than in a horror movie. The attitude of people who worked on this movie is despicable not only for the genre but also for the audience. Saying you "liked" this movie only encouraged filmmakers to offer us more of this crap, plus destroying the genuine poor genre. (* 1/2)
