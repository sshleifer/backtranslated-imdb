It was Freddy's last movie (and it was for more than 10 years) - you would think they would try to get a good movie. But they turn out to give us the worst of the series (and that he says a lot). The plot has made no sense (I seriously can not remember it), all the main characters were idiots (you really wanted to die) and Freddy's creativity wisdom was even worse than normal. Only remotely good bit about this was a short (and comic) comedy by Johnny Depp (the first movie "Nightmare" was his first). Also I was originally seen in a theater being the latest section (Recovering the Freddy child) was at 3-D. Well - the 3-D was lousy - color faded and the image will be in and out of focus. Also, the three flying skulls that were supposed to be scary (I think) had the opposite reaction at my hearing. CONCEPT was laughing laughing. Look even worse on TV at 2-D. Sanseless and stupid - very dull. Skip this one and see "Freddy vs Jason" again.
