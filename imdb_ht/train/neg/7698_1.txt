Can I give this a minus rating? No? Well, let me say that this is my most aggressive movie I've ever tried to watch. He was sick. Boringus Maximus. The plot (?) Is well hidden in several sub-levels of nebulosity. I rent this movie with a friend and, after about thirty minutes of hope it would get better, we decided to "fast forward" a little to see if things would get any better. It never gets better. This movie about some dude is getting kidnapped by these two girls, interesting sound, but, in fact, it's just a do. There is nothing even remotely interesting all the time is happening. If you ever get the chance to watch this, do yourself a favor, try "NINE PLAN in space" instead.
