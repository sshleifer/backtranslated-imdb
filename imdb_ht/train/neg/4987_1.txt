This movie is so bad and it gets worse in all imaginable fashion. It's not just the poor to act with the script or is it the lame and the wrong one one wasted on watching it. What really puts this movie in my room in shame is apparent in the difficulties that writers and producers do with the movie to try and make it funny. The actress replaced Jean Reno's descent is old and learns her lesson in the movie first to add a new girl to be married. Almost all of the original extras and gossip returns however time this makes me want my eyes look out to support me because it's a good movie filmmaking. The turtle of cutting the constant cameras and shots of any scene in this movie can put the viewer in violent convolution. This second film takes the original success and drags it out of its coffin and parades the corpse from the public square and perversely degrades not only the original idea and her legacy, but our intelligence as well. This film unlike the goose spruce could not fly so she had no draw from the principal to return for a 'necklace'. There is no script since it was apparently written and added to everyday. There is no attention to camera or vaccine in mind. Poor lighting and special effects make for the sake of doing so. This film would not even have happened for a movie film in Basic Movie 101. What this pile has happened to no one can say. It was a huge investment to read and it appears that no one had the strength to put this abnormal cruel mistake out of our misery. This movie has only one good part ... its end! This movie is the # 1 worst movie ever, finally the "Howard Duck" is no longer the goose.
