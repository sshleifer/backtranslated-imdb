I was intrigued to see how a little-seen movie 2008 was somehow won the Oscar for best photos in 2009 and so went to see the Hurt locker. Unfortunately, all I received for two hours being invested was the fake confirmation that this film won purely award for the purpose of the screen. <br /> <br /> The direction and visual style of this movie are some of the weakest you'll ever see. when it was not yet occupied by another bourne Identity and Self-Identity, it bothered the "unidentified camera" visual, and showed off all the features of a second opera day-to-day opera in terms of launch. <br /> <br /> The "plot" is filthy, characterizing them as well developed as to reject Beetle Bailey's funny strip and dialogue scenes - under circumstances where the film gives up on being "minimalist" and for no The reasonable apparent one or two soldiers in chatterboxes - some of the worst ever recorded. In fact, the actors do the best they can in the circumstances, just not enough to obscure how bad the project is. The whole movie has the feeling of it being intended as some kind of "mockumentary" that the clock was stuck in humor and thus re-modified as best they could as well as to pass it, like a serious drama .. <br /> <br /> if you spend two hours on this movie are two hours you will never get back, and two hours wasted that you will be sorry for the rest of your life.
