It's not often I watch a movie that is as obnoxious as this one. I continue to look, every minute hopes that this was intended as a joke only to get it meant to be seriously taken. Well, as seriously as this genre request. <br /> <br /> The act was disappointed with the harshly convincing and candied situations. If a film was made in 1920 (for example) and had the quality of Hide & Seek (rope) in the direction we would think that movies back then was naive. As it happens, this film was born in 2000 and I still see a movie in the era of silence that has as little charm as this one. <br /> <br /> Definitely not for the movie-goer serious. /> <br /> [Not worth a rating]
