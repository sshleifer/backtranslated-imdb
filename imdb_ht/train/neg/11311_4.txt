I vaguely remember Ben from Sci-Fi's day last of the '60s, I did several interviews with Bio of Dark Actress / Actress, most notably Ben, Mistress Fay Spain, and Jody Fair, who played Angela in 1961 at Young Savages. Ben was one of the people in a known low-key Sci-Fi in Chicago, 1970, when I had a nice chat with him and his "career" and life. All of this was published in some now-forgotten fancings of the day. Wish I still have copies of these interviews but over time, and any of these people surely would not remember me throughout so many years later. Ben was a really nice fellow, equip a living (disadvantages in those days did not even pay the guests, unless, of course, big-name stars, and even then paid was a bloody couple Dollars, at best! Good know Ben always alive & kicking! How to make a remake of animals, but 50 years older! Ugly then uglier now!
