I collected TRAN SCAN from the library and brought it home. We considered taking a trip from east and thought it would give us a sense of what it was like. The movie was a total waste of time, if I went out to buy it I would call it TRAN SCAM when I saw it cost $ 49. The DVD ran for 8 minutes and showed a roller coaster ride across Canada and my stomach feel sick as they climbed up and down and around the curve and the film at high speeds. <br /> <br /> There have been a lot of feet probably shot on this and you would think they might have made a better product. If I did this project I would give more, stay on the road signs to let people know where they were and delayed the location of the landscape. To make a movie like this it would have been 60 to 90min. Oh yes it was said to have been in the stereo, the movie was all a rusty sound from sped up sound machine, thet could at least put some music into it. <br /> <br /> If you want a good cross Canada movie watcher Rihanna / The National Film Board in Canada begins Buster Keaton (one of the latest films she has made) in this comic movie Buster Keaton gets on a trackspeeder train in Nova Scotia and travel to British Columbia
