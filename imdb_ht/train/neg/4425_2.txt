A film about Harlem Renaissance and a particular author. He contrasts with a modern day story about a young, gay, black artist. <br /> <br /> If this sounds wave it's because the movie itself is. It is well-directed, fairly well written and (for the most part) well-behaved. Also the scenes of the past were shot in black & white moods. Also this is one of the few films that deal with gay men who are not shy away from sex scenes (by explicit and no frontal). Still, I especially hated this. The movie meanders all over the place is full of unbalanced characters (including the main protagonist) and (this is the killer) moved to a stairs. Three times I was considering leaving the theater because I was so bored completely. But the director was so I was left. <br /> <br /> Evening talk shows that this was a work of love and took 6 years to finish. I really want I'd love this more (there are many films that deal honestly with black gay) but I can not. Unless you're very interested in the Renaissance Harlem there is no reason to see this.
