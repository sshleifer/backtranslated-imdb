From the very beginning, the political theme of this movie is so obvious and heavily released, that the result is entirely predictable. Any good book on screen screens will advise stratification of characters, incorporating archival characters, and three acts structures. In this movie you will find none of that. Police are the baddies, and they are shown as deep, incompetent and distressing. It never seems to reach the musicians in this movie that police could be honorable citizens who see the police join as a great way to contribute to the welfare of society. <br /> <br /> The viewer has no opportunity to make up her or her idea about whether Ned Kelly is a good guy or a wicked villain. The film opens with him being arrested for stealing a horse, but we have no signs of being guilty or innocent. We see him walking through the door in a gaol, but only knowing that he was inside for three years when we heard that many later in some dialogue. This movie has many shots in Ned looking at camera with a serious expression. I found the movie a real chore to watch. It is the direction for modern films, and this one puts me on watching any more.
