I hate this movie! It was not like the book, and just thought about it to make me angry. If you watch the movie before reading the book, then yeah, it's a good movie. But the Book of Kings was AMAZING and this film had nothing like it. I mean, the general meaning might be sort of similar but most aspects of the movie are completely different. Finish for example! So in the book it's very intense and Danny and Wendy escape seconds before exploding the hotel. but in version versions of this horrible movie like taking them into a stupid maze ... yes, there is no maze in the book and there is no reason for it. Another part made me angry was that Jack just killed Mr. Halloran! what heck, it is basically hero of the book and just kill it in as it did not matter. In general, it was just bad that the film was so very cut.
