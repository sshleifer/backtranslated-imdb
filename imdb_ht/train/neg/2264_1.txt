To prefer this review, I must say that I was, I suppose, a little curious about that movie .. However, I probably would not see it was I did not have my arms slightly twisted. My opinion, this movie shows just how people lose their time. In my eyes, the worst thing about this springer phenomenon is not the kind of person on the Jerry Springer Show acting as they do (which in itself is eminently reprehensible), but that many people are so curious and excited to watch and hear about their lives (yes, I suppose that includes me .. regardless of level it's true). If you do not praise this kind of behavior (as some say) at least at least we can subtly corrupt our minds and / or deny ourselves to this kind of behavior. <br /> But enough soapbox (sort of). Here's thin: The movie has an R rating, and while it can only be worth it (I did look far in some scenes, so I'm not completely sure), I feel an NC-17 (tip of the hat in other reviews) could be a little more appropriate for the immense sexual content (a cynical might comment that the movie was just one big excuse to show sex on the big screen). The plot is very rare, binds together the stories of an absolutely dysfunctional family with a black stereotype black group that will appear on different Springer shows. In the end, the movie leaves one with some resolution- and springer speeches about the need to see the real world (obviously as seen in its show). I agree with him - it's important to know how the world really is so that we can look for positive change effects. Having said that, let me tell you-very beautiful look at the world in a new paper or the news to see it, but let's not shell out good money to support the kind of sensationalism and perhaps the formal titling by Springer seek us.
