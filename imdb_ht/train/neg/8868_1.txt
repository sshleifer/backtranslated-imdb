Absolutely one of the worst movies I've ever seen! The act, the dialogue, the manuscript, the sound, the lighting, the drawn line. I actually can not say anything positive about this, although I love Swedish movies. The fighting scenes are ridiculous that it is impossible to take it seriously. But when the lead character just happens in his shirt, while dodging bullets in a strip bar, I'm not sure if he supposed a joke, or if someone really thinks these are the ingredients of a good movie? Regina Lund is the only half-descent actor, but she disappears in a flood of troublesome pronunciation and incredible reactions. It leaves you fears that someone actually spent time with money on something like this ...
