The summary is pretty much summarized it all up. This is nowhere near as original as the original. With a script written by both Stallone and James Cameron (at the same time he also wrote aliens). Most of the action was written by Cameron and political aspect written by Stallone. <br /> <br /> Sly was in the best fit physically as she did this with Rocky 4 and she looked at great shape or jacked up the eyeballs on steroids, depending on your own opinion or opinion. <br /> <br /> Rambo starts in jail and is visited by Travoman Colonel who asks him to attend a special mission that would earn him a presidential pardon. He eventually agrees to go to the briefing camp run by Charles Napier playing a Washington suit trying to pass himself as former senior military to complain Rambo. <br /> <br /> The mission is to find out if there are any missing POWs still alive in Vietnam. Rambo chose as the camp she was checking was where she had previously been a prisoner himself. He said he was not a rescue mission and he will only take pictures of the rewards. <br /> After a bad attempt at parachute from a plane he lost most of his kits, meeting his contacts (which turned out to be a beautiful woman) and traveling down rivers and pirates in the camp. <br /> It finds that there are still inmates and deliver one. As the 3 runs out of half the Vietnamese Army on the ships of the rivers are betrayed by the pirates but Rambo kill them all and are forced to carry on to the pick-up point after footsteps are rammed and blew up with ramboes almost over board. <br /> <br /> Rambo is betrayed again and abandoned as Napier's reminder to the reminder of the rescue helicopter. It is clear that Traitors return to base for fighting him that no survivors have to get. <br /> <br /> Steven Berkoff turns up as a Russian Colonel Spetznatz and Rambo is tortured and eventually only night to be chased by more Vietnamese twitters and Spetznatz. Killing many of them, Rambo finally steals a helicopter and delivers most of the prisoners to return to his base. <br /> It resists the urge to kill Napier for abandoning him but destroying Sant Ops. <br /> A weak and very weak scheme ends up like rambo walking in the sunset as a free man.
