I saw 10pm. which shows and I must say that this movie had nothing special. Although I did not let the theater want my time back (as I actually did not pay for movies yet) I did not really get any kind of redeployed. <br /> There was a few lines and that made me chuckle, but mostly the movie seemed to consist of rampant fan services in the smallest (in mind more than age as this movie rated R) male audience. The fan services seemed out of place and rather distracted as well. I know you all want to hear Samuel L. says his infamous line, but let's be honest, it's a whole lot of hype for very little pay. Only really awful part of the film was the CG, which looked very nimble and did not go well with the action live on the screen. <br /> Now, I'm a reasonable man, I knew going to the theater that I did not want to be seen "Casablanka," and I am at least thankful that this film is an original (albiet inane) ideas and not some re-do or franchise turns. However to be honest, if you're not part of these cults you are probably better spending your money elsewhere and seeing the movie either in a second theater running in a few weeks or renting it within a few months.
