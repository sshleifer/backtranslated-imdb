While this trip certainly does not live up to its predecessor, it has more than its share of memorable moments. My personal favorite, just after laying waste in a city block with her "Cannon videodisc", we see an end up in Nimoy's face. As a salt tear from his left eye, we know in point that Nimoy is more than just a car killed. The viewer can not help but pull in his emotional turmoil, and we understand that already affected it was only a facade. Absolutely shine !!! The sex scenes show a nice, carnal balance, but not pornographic. And I felt I had a very good understanding of how to work the Magnavision Videodisc player. Too bad has not been produced in more than 25 years.
