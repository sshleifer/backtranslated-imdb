Well ... the movie was a fun look. The main problem with this movie is the fact that it goes against everything that most vampires do not respect. Like vampires walking in the sunlight. Even though there are parts that just make you enjoy the societal style of making movies. A scene where a vampire gets stabbed and screams "That's okay hurts ... It's really stuck." Then there seems to be missing scenes, but you get used after a while. And there are sequential random dreams that really do not help with the plot. Come to think of it, nothing really makes sense, but I just got a bunch of friends and watch it twice to get the full effect. Come to think of the scene of battle being scared, and the zombies were just fun to watch. Slowly as I write more in this I like this movie more. But you know, all of you can not expect Schindlers List but it's a fun look.
