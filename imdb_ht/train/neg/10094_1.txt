My little sister and I are self-proclaimed film horror movie. We've seen just about everything, especially zombie flicks. Now we've seen a lot of good zombie cinemas, and a lot of them are even bad. This BY FAR is the WORST movie I've ever seen throughout my life. Not only was terrible, but the special effects, graphics and ever-made "zombie" make-up was the worst I had seen. If you can even call it make-up (black eye shadow around the eyes), this is totally proof that you should never judge a book by it to cover. Cause the cover of the film is the only thing sweet on. Do yourself a favor and do not look at this picture !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I was so determined on this movie I went as far as putting a sticky note on the inside of the movie before I went back to his movie saying "This film absorbs, does not waste your time, returns now" hahahhaa i pa wants anyone else to waste a good movie night on this POS movie! I do not even know how he got the ratings that he did, would be in the negative
