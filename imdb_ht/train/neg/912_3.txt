... for one of the worst Swedish cinema ever ... forgive me for being dull. <br /> First of all I did not see the first one (I was bored to this reason for watching the 2nd before the first), well I hope the first one is better than this was filled with strange weird scenes and pretty weird changes, For those who saw this and think 4/10 is high (belive me so do me), but it made me laugh a few times, because she so badly so bad and I still laugh at the punk who came up with this idea, what's next "Det sjunde inseglet II". Sequels are not based on novels or books by turning out large frequently, and this is a perfect example of one. <br /> OK I'll be honest with you: I was laughing a bit, she got a few decent jokes at her and slapstick humor. But do not buy it, rent it. Just let some other idiot do it or download it. <br /> 4/10 This movie will be remembered and the director is probably laughing out already.
