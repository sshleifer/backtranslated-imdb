I remember this show being on the TV when I was a kid back in the early 1990s, and there was this rage about kids having soaru jumps made kung fu on another and riding around in plastic dinosaurs. He was called Power Guard. I remember that the little ones would go to strike with each other and then the shirts and items from the show were banned in many school districts throughout the country because this shows teaching kids how to fight each other to solve the differences. <br /> I never really thought of this as a show, especially when best shows like the Turkish played on Fox Kids. Most older people still look guard power in a ridiculous and scandalous way, and it's not hard to ask why. The foot is ridiculous at best. The colored guard suit looks like things you would work out in with dinosaurs look like plastic nonsense. Then you get into the act, and of course these haircuts really deterred. All the guys run around with earrings, half of them are carrying the 90's mullets, and they always wear the same clothes every day, and then switch to leotard wearing power guards. <br /> <br /> The games are especially ridiculous as well, and the joke of many late show show host shows. With two of the worst movies ever to do, and I mean two of the worst movies ever made are based on this show and almost every criticism trashing both the movies and shows they were based on. /> Power Rangers is nothing more than a bad TV commercial for especially bad game merchandising. As an adult, I do not look at it loving, but rather as another embarrassment in the 1990 kids show, fashion and gentlemen 'men.
