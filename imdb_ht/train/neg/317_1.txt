This was the worst movie I've ever tried to watch. In the first 15 minutes, there was nothing to keep my interest in this film. I was on vacation at the time, and had a lot of time devoted to a just-for-a-fun-in-it movie. The condom we stayed in had this movie in stock - to have had it from the store $ 1 or something. <br /> <br /> If you love Adam Sandler, this is nothing like any other movie he does. This began with a good quote and then just got worse. There is nothing even remotely funny in it. <br /> I watched a lot of movies, including some I did not care for. But if you decide to waste your time on this movie, do not say I did not warn you.
