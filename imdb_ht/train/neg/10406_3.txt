Warning: This review has minor defeat. Well the writers of the first tremors are officially out of mind. I'm a big fan of the first movie and the first two are very good for straight to fare. Tremors 4: The Legends Begin, however, is a very dull movie. Where the heck is the Graboids ??? <br /> <br /> Due to the relative lack of Graboids in the first 90 minutes I am convinced that this entry in the series is supposed to be a "character study". Unfortunately there is no interesting character in the movie except for Billy Drago's character that gives too few lines, too little to do with the end of too much time the little screen. What saved the 2nd and 3rd cinemas was the presence of Michael Gross as Burt Gummer. Every time there was no action on the screen you could rest assured that Burt Gummer would be interesting to listen to and / or watch. However in this movie Brit plays Hiram Gummer a very poor and boring substitute. <br /> <br /> On the more side of the graboids (Dragon Dust in this movie) are on the screen to look good, but that's about as good as it gets. <br /> I was impressed when I saw that 4 quake was appointed in 101 minutes. Pretty good for straight to video. But after watching it I'm sure that this film is a good 15 minutes too long. There are stretch times in dialogues that are boring and not more drawn to any. Was there a hurry to get this movie done? I think not, more time could and should have been spent on the script. <br /> I think I hit a gold mine when I saw the tanks 4 pack for sale and .... tremor !!! What lucky I thought, pay for # 4 to get # 1 for free. Well after watching tremor 4 I like to think that I paid for the original and got this mess for free, I can not imagine paying a single cents for tremor 4. For fans of the series it is best to forget that Quake 4: The legend starts even exist. <br /> <br /> Tremors 4: The Legend starts a 3 percent rate from 10.
