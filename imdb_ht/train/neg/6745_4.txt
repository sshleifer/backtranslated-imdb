This is a low-budget style movie "Call". "Maddy" is a new worker in an unnamed office, where he meets and starts a relationship with his co-worker "Chris". During a hot tub, Chris and his friends convinced Maddy to be part of a "Murder Club" where everyone killed someone for their kickoffs. When maddy loses it and kills someone for real, hijinks incurs. The film looks good, and there are the requisites for this genre and budget levels (stripping, gore, maybe a few cameos from slightly larger stars than the cast), but after the roll scroll, you will Ask yourself why you spent 80 minutes in your life watching it.
