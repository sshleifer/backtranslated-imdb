I have two good things to say about this movie: The scenery is beautiful and Peter Falk gives a good performance (considering what he has to work with in terms of dialogue and direction). However, that said, I found this film very tedious. Watching dry paintings would be more fun. It looked much longer than 97 minutes. Starting with the open sequence, where everyone is talking about each other and Paul Reiser will repeat everything that tells him about the phone, the movie is annoying. The film is full of glitches and shtick, not to mention endless incidents of acoustics flatulence by Falk. Also, the director seems to have had difficulty deciding whether or not to aim for laughter or tears. Some sequences touch, but they're all playing for laugh. If schmaltzy, sentimental, and "beautiful" appeal to you, you will love it. But if you expect something more substance, see a different film.
