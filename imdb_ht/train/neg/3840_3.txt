I would hear about this movie shortly ago from a friend and he recently got it on DVD. There was a lot of anticipation and excitement as we would both have heard that this was a scandalous movie, really scary. How shame I was ?? VERY GOOD !!!! Apart from this scene (we all know that bit) NO was passed !!! I was hoping to see the woman in black a few times and for doing a few more jumpy jumps, like appearing in the window or walking across the room or something. <br /> Almost all the comments here say what a scary, entertaining, atmospheric movie is. I just did not see it I'm scared. Perhaps there is a difference in what people find scary in the U.S. here in Britain. A great let down after all the hyped reviews :(
