This was not Trainspotting or Guy Ritchie movie. It was a great wannabee. She wanted to be a noble, nervous-laughter, urban-loving movie affirmation, but it's more of a camera kerk, chaos. It's a lot easier to imitate something else, than to create a real story with real characters. From the beginning I could not care less about the characters or what they had participated in .. They were always still hit, pissing, or crying about each other. Only, there was no substance to what they did. Dialogue between the characters means to be hip, reveal, rather than outward, and one scene after another is predictable. I know there are viewers out there who really liked this movie, so I might be wrong.
