What happened? What we have here is fundamentally a quotes and plausible with a decent and talented cast, but somewhere the movie loses it. Actually, it never really went away. There was a little excitement when we found that Angie is not really pregnant, then find out that it is after all, but that was it. Steve Martin, who is a very talented and usually brings a lot of a movie, was terrific and all his characters were not even close to being important in this movie, other than doing it again. I really want to see more interactions between the main characters, Kate and Angie, and perhaps try not for a better comedy, which unfortunately he did not, but perhaps a drama and comedy component. I think if the movie did so it could be very funny since both the actresses are quite funny in their own way and sitting here I can think of many scenarios that would have a riot.
