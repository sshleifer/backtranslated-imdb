My wife and I really had high hopes for this movie, but it was a great disappointment. It was a native American version of Mr. Magoo. A pathetic father who fails in everything he tries, e.g. fishing, hunting, in a way obvious to his family's subject of wild imagination. His "vision" is not only ridiculous but in the process he lied to his son many times on the various obvious things. Words can not express how bad this movie is. Children and wives are very real to make the movie even sad. I do not get the humor ... unless you like to laugh at others who make a fool at themselves. I did not find how this could come for awards. Save your bucks, it is not worth the rental.
