This film is about a group of five friends who rent a cabin in the woods. One of their friends captures a virus that feels good chicken. Suddenly, friends turn to another in a desperate attempt to keep from dealing with the disease themselves. <br /> <br /> "Fever Cabin" is a horrible movie. For one, he tries to have many genres at once. Is it supposed to be homage, a slasher, a black comedy, or a scary film and unwitting comedy? Nobody can say. There's a serious scene at first and a second change, it turns funny. When the movie tries to be funny, the humor is quite bland, except the finish. I loved the end of a lot. <br /> But apart from the end, I was very disappointed and disgusting. Violence is valuable, more looking away from the screen than being scared. The tone changes in every scene, sometimes funny, sometimes scary, and sometimes quite random. In fact, you see a girl doing karate in slo-motion. What should we find in this? This girl would bite one of the characters. Did that mean to be funny? I do not know. <br /> Some of the performances were decent, and many were quite amateur. I did not care for most of the characters. I liked the draw but the execution was performed horribly. As a horror movie, I did not know what she was trying to be. I did not find it funny, tense, nor scared. In the end, you're left indifferent, thinking, "What am I just was in?" Unfortunately, you will never know the answer to this question.
