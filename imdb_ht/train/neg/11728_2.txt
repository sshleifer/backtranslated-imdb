Have already enjoyed Wesley Snipes in several action flicks and I was expecting a lot more, even at a score of 5.8 IMDb, the movie failed to entertain and even though the story is slim and unoriginal, the act is most unfortunately slim and go Imagine a "worst case scenario" playing in "strong" feelings accompanied by some bad act ... by your waist this movie Ã­nt fun, if you want to cry it might suffice though, even if your tears will cry because of Wesley Snipes in the movie tragedy action wannabe comedy ... <br /> I give this 2/10 it really was awful, if you want to see a decent movie go see shooter or rent it, all the things this good movie is not.
