What was Producer / Director Stanley Kramer seen in Adam Kennedy's novel with Kennedy's very miserable storyline? Is there a few pieces left out on purpose? And what about Gene Hackman, Richard Widmark, Edward Albert, Eli Wallach and Mickey Rooney? What have they seen in this very unlucky story? <br /> Why Candice Bergen, who gave a terrible performance, accepted such an unpleasant role? <br /> <br /> The Domino Principle wants to be on the same footing as the Parallax View or the Manchurian candidate and misses the brand by a wide margin of breadth. A big misfire by Stanley Kramer.
