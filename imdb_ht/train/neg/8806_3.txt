How does this ripoff of "When do you" ever get to be so much loved? People say it's proof that someone decent, honest can succeed despite the lack of intelligence. They're wrong. The movie is proof that luck is everything: hope your friends invest all your money in Apple and not Atari; Expect your shrimp ship is one of salt from the sea when a storm breaks; hope you do not die in shock when you are injecting buttocks and not in the back; hope you do not get AIDS from your wife. This film is also politically archaic - all those who rebel against society's corporations lost their feet, make drugs, beat their girlfriends, or die young. In addition, the placement of this film (Nike and Dr Pepper) is cynical. An emotionally manicured film that is very, very empty.
