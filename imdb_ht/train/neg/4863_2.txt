Why oh why not by blockbuster movies simply stick to their selling point? All of the movies, young and old, have seen animals talking about jokes, and also made that we were all happy ... then just as lost in space, came up the two courses killers - plots and feelings. Who really cares about what happened to the tiger or if Eddie Murphy has got up with her daughter? Not me, that's for sure.
