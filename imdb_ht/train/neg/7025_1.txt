I wish I could give this film a zero, or even lower, because sadly what it deserves. I honestly never walked out of a movie, but this one was so terrible that I could not stand another minute in it. Please, please, please - for the sake of mankind- skip this movie. If you want a hot lesbian movie that you can really dig through, this is not it. It has unattractive, undisputed drive, chop structure, ridiculous dialogue, and it is absolutely compelling in every way imaginable. On an absolutely basic level, it failed to entertain. Everything about "Mango Kiss" is so stagey, it is worse than any movie I've seen. As if that was not enough, the movie all relies on constant (and I mean CONSTANT) voices on narration. Script writers may also have written a novel, because they insist on saying everything, instead of showing it. We are just supposed to assume that Lou and Sassafras are the best of friends and have a special connection, though there is no character development to illustrate this. Also, this movie continues to feature new characters after the first five minutes, and not in a natural way, but in a freeze-frame of the characters and their names written on the screen. There is no introduction, there is no development of any of the characters. We do not really get to know any of them. <br /> This is the most amateur movie I've ever seen. <br /> I'm a gay woman, who watched this movie with my roommate (another gay woman) and we both found this movie to be a depressing representation of movies. I start thinking that lesbian lesbian and gay is a lot like Christian rock - it does not matter how atrocities are, people are always flocking on her, and her champion, no matter how poor the quality. Please do not rent it !! Instead, let's promote the production of gay movies and lesbian quality of renting "But I'm a Cheerleader" or "Fire" or "Heavenly Creatures", instead of swallowing whatever the tripless targets in the gay community (ie Queer as Folk).
