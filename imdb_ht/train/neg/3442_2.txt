I rent this purely movie about the fact that the cover appealed to me. However as soon as the film started I was sorry. It seems to use a video camera home to shoot this movie and let a child do it. They also use proper ghostly figures and try and frightening forms but I found myself laughing, I could have put that together myself and doing a better job in it. As for the plot I felt that he had some really good idea, but because of the dodging lines and in some cases acting was covered. He had no direction. <br /> I did not want to sit at all because it caused me physical pain to watch her, but I always finished what I started so I took a deep breath and let it carry on . Definitely 98minit in my life wasted. <br /> I would save yourself embarrassment by knowing that you've watched 'haunted pirate' and found something more fun. I'm a fan of movie horror films but this was a great disappointment I thought nothing would be worse after 'Terrorist Toon' but this made me reconsider. A let down in its genre. <br /> <br /> * from ***** (the star is for the ideas of worst worries are coming for them)
