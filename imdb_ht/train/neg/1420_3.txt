[I've seen this movie once late on a public television station, so I do not know if it's video or not.] This is one of the "Baby Burlesks" (sic) that Shirley Temple was done in the early 1930s. It is hard to believe that anyone who would leave their daughter in this movie little movie that today can be considered as the "kiddie porn" side. <br /> <br /> Shirley Temple Star in a throw that probably has an average age of 5. They are all in diapers and are in a saloon serving milk instead of alcohol. The "Money" is in the form of lollipops. Shirley plays a "femme fatale" sashay up to the bar and talks to slogans who comment on it (!). But Shirley does not really need the lollipops / cash because her suitcase is all from other "men" .. Meanwhile a little black boy makes a dance suggestion on a nearby table (!). <br> <br /> What a strange movie. . . Baby using racial dialogue plays adult roles in a saloon. Who thought this way anyway?
