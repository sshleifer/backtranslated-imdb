Difficult to describe this one - if you were a fan of Russ Meyer's movie back in the day, you'll be happy to see Haji is still looking really hot, though Forry Ackerman has not varied properly (what he's doing These movies are nevertheless? If I go to him with a camera it will be in my movie?). It was a wonderful fun site - a superhero of giant mammals is his secret weapon - but sometimes he did not pan out for the whole length, and jokes were on an average level with Joe E. Brown comedy ( or, Abbott and Costello if it's your thing) - basically just bad puns. Still, I found this movie fascinating to watch, and for more than 2 reasons. Good job, but still a tribute to T-shirts.
