I just saw this movie yesterday. <br /> <br /> My girlfriend wanted to see her only because of Richard Gere. <br /> I feel I'm wasting my time and money and told her girlfriend the last time we go to see a movie just because a certain actor / actress is in it. I hope she learned the lesson because I had trouble keeping her in place. As I, since I had already paid, I wanted to see the end at least, just in hoping something good would turn up, but I did not hold my breath, and luckily why I would be the victim of the movie just the same thing. <br /> <br /> This is not a black and white film, it's a black and black one. The main character (Richard Gere) is almost as bad as his recording, and all sexual offenders describe as criminals unbelievably hard and bad core among them really really pretty bad. Speaking of a clich√© and the exploitation of a typical US phobia. <br /> <br /> The actress Richard Gere has been as good as usual, but the blonde girl is supposed to replace her with the best crazy crazy. Totally compelling for the job. The film tries to exploit a popular theme and give it a cheap, dramatic, and sensational turn that's just real. They just use sexual offenders as an excuse for cheap violent acts of murder, vigilant beating, rape and torture - something that seems almost free. They even have a wolf attacked people in the movie - how can you get it. <br /> I pick up the movie will not come out of the USA and will go straight to DVD. That's what he should have lived in other countries too, but because he's in Hollywood and Richard Gere just showed it. Believe me, without Gere, the movie is not even worth a movie B-series.
