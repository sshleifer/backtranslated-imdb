The wind is a movie about a guy who tries to lure girls into her new wind, in order to seduce them. The only thing this movie does not weaken is precisely describing the wind turbine in the US in the late 70s. It seems that it was totally made by enthusiasts. It is rubbish, but I liked it! I must admit I'm a fan of 70s garbage! Expect this one to make it in the bottom of IMDB 100! <br /> 2
