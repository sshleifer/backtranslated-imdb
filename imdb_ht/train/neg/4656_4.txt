Unremarkable and unmemorable remake of an old, celebrated English movie. Although it can be overly illuminated as a total disaster (which is not), it never builds any tension and betrayal of its television background. Richard Burton sleeps in his role, and Sophia Loren's close (in this movie) figure does not show much passion, either. (**)
