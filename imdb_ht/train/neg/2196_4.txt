Brain (or head) that would not die is one of the more reflective films to exploit the early 1960s. It is very difficult to imagine how a script that skillfully sexist could write without the intention of self-esteem. With the terms expressing repeatedly by the female lead, Ginny Leith - a perplexing head to keep alive by car, I Vs and Clamps - seems to confirm that the movie was meant to simultaneously exploit and criticize sex stereotypes. Shades of Helena are under-rated. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The dialogue is hyperbalist, over-dramatic and incredible, and the act is simply OK (but not consistent). Why did I give this movie a 4? Because some thought clearly went into it. I really do not know what the film point was really trying to do, but it seems clear that it strives for a very noble and raw sort of horror (without the blood and intestinal hearings today expect). Another unique and interesting aspect of the brain is that there really are not any heroes of this movie, and none of the characters are particularly feasible. All considered, this is a fairly painful and disturbing look at early 1960's American pop sexuality, from the viewpoint of a woman holding alive despite her missing body after that would be a fatal car accident . Her lover threatens to sew a fresh, quality, body on her and forced her to continue living with her. It is understandable that non-plussed by all these things and forcing them to treat a friend of an animal that is almost as mischievous as his companion. Oh, there are also some vague references for the 1950s / 60s to glimpse on the evils of science fleeing amok. <br /> <br /> Recommended for female scientists and graduates of sex studies. O / you do not recommend.
