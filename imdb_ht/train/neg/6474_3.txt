This was the first end I would see (apart from Back to Jafar) and I honestly thought before watching it that it would be close to the original. I was horribly disappointed. <br /> The story was, basically, the first script with a few extra characters and the situation turned around. Ariel and Eric have a daughter, tunes that are not satisfied with life on earth. She wants to become a mermaid. However, Ariel has kept her past from her daughter because she wants to protect her and when Melody finds out her anger and upset. And she decided to run, and she became a mermaid. So he is happy to swim around, and Ariel sets out to find him-like a mermaid. <br /> <br /> The story does not sound too bad to write down, but the likes and repeat of situations from the first movie are just too obvious. And adding the fact that tunes are, in general, very annoying, and the movie becomes almost unbearable. There is also a whole load of other new-Ide and Dash characters being two of them. They are not too bad as the characters themselves-just try not to think of Timon or Pumbaa! The songs left many also want, they just do not have the same magic energy as the song from the original was made. The animation obviously did not have a whole load of work set in it either-in part of jumper, and not much imagination used for the character movements. Another piece of advice-try to forget about Ariel's original characters while watching this movie. Beautiful, rebellious, curious teenager has 'all grown up' in a bland, boring wife and mother, and her trademark hair hair all tight. This is best seen if you have never seen the original - you have nothing to compare. <br /> However, all in all, it could have been worse-it's not as bad as certain other sequels, like Cinderella II. But it's not the same league as the original. But it for your collection if there is nothing else, but if Disney goes on like this, they will lose all the older fans.
