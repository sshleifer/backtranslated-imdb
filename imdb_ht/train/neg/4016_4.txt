There is a DVD released in the UK in 2002 Code HRGD002 on the cover, no ASIN, VFC 19796 on the disc, no IFPI code in the interior rim. <br /> <br /> Probably a straightforward transfer from VHS. <br /> There is not much point to comment on an adult film. But this one has a minimal scheme, and the characters are credible. It has been shown in the United States in normal movies. <br /> I saw it in Pensylvannia's way back in 1975. As it deserves somewhere in an Encyclopedia of Movies. The DVD has no special features and no translation, and it was probably made using a VHS tap as source
