I started watching this movie with my girlfriend. After 5 minutes I was alone. <br /> I succeed in the end. It was a aching experience. <br /> I love jean hugues oryad, but I think he needed to eat, like us, and so he accepted to play in this movie. <br /> There are only 5 characters, and the rest could call 'art' or something that I could not express, but that I did not understand at all. <br /> <br /> The only worst movie I've seen was crashing, but I'm pretty sure now that I have enough experience to watch it successfully again. <br /> <br /> good luck !! ; o)
