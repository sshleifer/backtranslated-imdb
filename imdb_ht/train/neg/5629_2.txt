I just rent (yes! I pay the money to see!) This movie. OMG. It is one of the worst films I've ever seen. As another review put it, Ms. Colagrande, get out of film, PLEASE! Please never make or appear in another movie! The lady has a chivalry charisma. No, that's not just the hinges, which probably goes much further for him. He does not know how to act; It affects a disgusting look ALL time (reminds me of my still-disgusting little-sister in Europe). It's not good; it's not nice. There is no real story. And the correction! No, I could see! It's very bad when you watch a movie and, just get through it, you press "forward forward" on your remote, and still nothing happens! I mean! ..... I kept involuntarily screaming, "Cut! Cut!" What they thought? Well, obviously, they thought they would make a movie together and get PAID to make love on the screen! Pretty good deal for them; nice raw deal for the viewer! I think I'll throw it now.
