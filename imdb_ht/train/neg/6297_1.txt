I am a great fan of Martin Amis, on whose book this movie is based. Unfortunately the director was able to translate the book into the screen. The novel is well-posted modern and highly artificial of its wildly blocked characters and the disintegration of traditional plot lines and character development. It is a hilarious test of human greed, excess and empty of one of the most moral of British contemporary writers. The director of the movie has completely missed the point in the novel. In his hand, the film screaming at breakneck speed, is delivered to every tricky injection shot with angles 'odd' camera possible. It is like Ken Russel on acid, and suffers from the self-indulgent director to cranking up to one hundred. By the same (short) glimpse of the gorgeous Christian Penis Penis Penis was enough to save this movie miserable for me. Abysmal!
