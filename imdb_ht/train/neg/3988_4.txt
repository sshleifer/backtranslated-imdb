In short: <br /> <br /> Spike Lee clearly abounds on her head. He thinks of racism-ism, media and heritage, consumption and capitalism, religion, sexism, 'hetero-sexism', drug warfare drugs etc .. clean is great. I think it is a blessing that more and more people are choosing to criticize to examine fundamental aspects of our daily lives; Our silent and invisible force governs our society. However, just because Lee is making movie constraints by making her a good movie maker. <br /> <br /> What comes to all of "Jungle Fever" is a superficial understanding of these socio-political forces. This is largely the result of two main failures: <br /> <br /> Firstly, Lee is simply trying too hard. It seems to be desperately trying to accommodate each political / social statement it can think of in the 90mins. And as such, the end result seems confused and irresolute as it allows itself no time to develop characters that can fully incorporate the ideas he hopes to present. So it has been used stereotypes and we leave with rushed testimony with very busy dialysis. The end result is very scenes and unrealistic .. Secondly, do not try to make statements about these a variety of functions of society, it seems there is no concrete or original interpretation of social / political issues presented. What comes at all is a puddle that does not mean. You feel that she has purchased a textbook elementary textual sociology and spewed out all 500 pages. These are very problematic because the art of sacred film is and the work is transformed into a loudspeaker for the voice in the voice of the cinema . He is able to distance himself from the work and allow him to speak for himself. It functions as a piece of art or a political sound argument. Still appreciating Lee brings these important issues, I must say: Two thumbs down.
