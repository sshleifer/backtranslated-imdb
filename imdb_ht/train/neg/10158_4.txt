I could not help but think of behind the mask: the increase in leslie vernon (a more massive movie) when watching this because of the realistic feel of it as well as the great innovative idea. this could be a GREAT movie. The act is ... in some of the actors well. from others ... it's downright horrible. <br /> <br /> that's aside the idea is great and the format is great. The story is very good as well, though often suffering from great in mind logical thinking. <br /> <br /> nevermind that right? It's a horror movie after all .. <br /> I really want to see this remade ... I really want it to be the fantastic movie that he wants to be. (and you can not really blame their mind behind the movie for this) this is obviously built on a string string budget. and the fx really hurt the movie in general. <br /> <br /> big movie. ... if you had to swap out for some better acting and a little better fx. <br /> <br /> Those who wrote it should keep going though, great idea here.
