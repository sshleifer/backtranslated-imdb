Having heard many people ravage about this movie I thought I would give it a go. Apart from being extremely slow, I do not mind as long as the dating is worth it, but it's just not. As many others have said there are many inconsistencies and many of this movie just by true rings. The reaction of the 4 men changed from trauma, horror to finding the body to fill out the fish indifference. Surely if they were the kind of people who would go fishing safely, they just reported the body and said they only discovered it after fishing trips .... why on the ground tied the body of a tree, go fishing and then tell everyone you found the body 2 days already? So hard to watch a movie knowing that the behavior of the main characters is so consistent. As for the rest of the townspeople, well you would think at least one of them might show some curiosity about who actually killed the woman! The body itself is naked except for the knickers .... Which scenario leads to that? If it was violated then why still the knickers? If it has been violated and dressed over, then why remove them after that knickers bar? If it has not been violated, then why take all the clothes in the knickers bar .... let yourself and the evidence throw off? I really can not think of any realistic scenarios that could lead to that other than killing someone in flying clothes so you can fill up your stomach sales stall! Oh its surveillance but only fair and only because, despite the poor script, the act is strong.
