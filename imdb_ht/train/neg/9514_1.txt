Please solve me in those movies that teach us that crime is fun and justified. This couple with a blank script and an intense desire to be a Farrelly or a Coen brother, plus their lives in yet another group of supposedly high school age acting out Dawson Creek-brand youngsters are scared to complete with a GenxYZ band which is woefully trying to make the movie "feel" cool and, we have intense and serious saturated. <br /> <br /> This is not even roll-down 'Ferris Bueller' ... I'd rather look at a traffic light change. <br /> Only one scene stands out like anywhere near worth the price of admission: when the girls Betty mask meets a friend friend builder Nicon Richard. It's a surreal moment. Priceless even. <br /> But for the rest of it, I'd rather have a toothache. At least I can apply some Benzocayin (tm) to stop the pain.
