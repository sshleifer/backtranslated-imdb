Jan Scott (John Wayne) and partner Kansas Charlie (Eddy Chandler) are friendships that make their way to the Rattlesnake Gulch Rodeo. Scott is a pretty fair competitor, but he finds that unless he wants to accept twenty five cents on the dollar in price money from a croaker developer, he'll have to collect his spread of gunfire. Well, the bandits of Pete (Al Ferguson) and Jim (Paul Fix) decided they would like the rest of the rodeo to take; They shoot Farnsworth developer (Henry Hall) and make it look like Scott and Kansas Charlie are the killers. <br /> <br /> Wayne and Chandler use a gag running in the movie where they're about to go through it and points on various trivialities. Each time Chandler takes a wild swing, Wayne foot stomps him and hits him funny. <br /> If you are very attentive, an ad has been the ad Lipton at one of the scenes of Scott's favorite interest (Anne Mary Kornman). <br /> <br /> Later on in the movie, buddies are framed once again on a stage flight. Having a change of heart and seeing the mistake of his way, bad guy Jim wants to become clean and confess the sheriff, but Pete shoots him down. While being patched up, Jim tells his story to the doctor and his sister Anne. In an incredible scene, Anne walked right through a gunfight between the good guys and the villains confronting the sheriff. The "Desert Trail" is one of John Wayne Westerns' blanders from Lone Star Production during this era. Noticeably absent are George "Gabby" Hayes and Yakima Canutt, one or both are usually to be seen in these goats. If you are a fan of John Wayne though, you'll have to view it once, but that will probably be enough.
