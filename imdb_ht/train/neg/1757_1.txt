Do not get me wrong, Dan Jansen was a great speed skater. If there was one guy who deserved his gold medal at the Olympics he was Dann. <br /> But how it may be that Bill Corcoran has made such a bad movie about incredible story of Dan Jansen, because the real Dan Jansen story is really incredible! Especially when you look at this movie in the eyes of an athlete everything is wrong, the road to Matt Keeslar and other skate actors, their techniques, the dimensions of the speed oval, it is all wrong! Shame on you, Bill Corcoran, Dan Jansen deserves better, a lot better! <br /> <br /> 1 out of 10
