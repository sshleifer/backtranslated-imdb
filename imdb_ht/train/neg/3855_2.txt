The only redemption of God is Little by Larry Miller. It seemed that the film was trying too hard to be "Something About Mary," but I did not even like that movie and it always falls short of those standards. The actor who played Paul was great, but Selma Blair is stuck in the sort of intelligent character. James Brolin was great, but Paul's father seemed like he was trying too hard to be the character of Randy Quaid from the National Lanpoon Vacation Cinema.
