Karl Jr and his father are now running an army on a remote island. They took a trio of men stumble on the island. Who after a while fighting back. (well survivors) This one has blood that does not stop, gore and carnage, which would be good if any of it looked remotely, or if the output did not seem to have been done with a worth of weeks to save up lunch money (I can overexxagerating it was probably just a couple days worth). The lurid double did not bother me as much and I suspect if I really drank, some of it might have been a little funny .... maybe. But as it is, the merely 78 minutes movie still felt way too long ago .. Oh I do not know ... 78 minutes. Do not waste your time. <br /> <br /> My Class: F <br /> <br /> DVD Extras: Bonus Movie: "Zombie '90: Lost Extreme Disease"; and trailers for other trauma-o-rama release films
