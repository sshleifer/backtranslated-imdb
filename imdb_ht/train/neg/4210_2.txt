Richard Tyler is a boy who scares everything. He does not like to ride his bike or climb on his house tree because he knows what kind of crash can happen to him. So, one day he is riding his bike, and because he starts raining, he decides to wait in the library until he stops raining. In the whole story takes place. He experiences all kinds of employees and in the end he's not afraid any more. But the whole story is incredible and as good actor as Macaulay Culkin could not make the story much better than it is.
