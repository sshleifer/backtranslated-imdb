As a hungry fan of Cary Grant, I hope to watch this movie with shouts and laughs, as AMC bills it as a comedy. I've never been more upset with a movie! Cary's usual candy and their effortless comedy are AWOL from this entire film; it comes across as exaggerated, bored, and just by himself. Mississippi's character amongst one of the worst stereotypes I've ever witnessed - its accent is very exaggerated (and incorrect, according to which part of Mississippi he claims to hail from), and each time he delivers a line, he in several decibels higher than any other cast member. Mississip tried to make himself stand out in the movie as a lovable, country-bumpkin goofball, but in the end he managed only to detect from the already weak scheme. Mansfield looks more like an obsessive blow doll than a Hollywood sex kitten, and while she is never known in Hollywood for her ability to act, this film shudder that she never had this ability to begin with. Ray Walston's character has sugars and finally comparable. For four people on shore leave, he left the plot I had ever seen. I watched this nightmare until its very end, and while I'm not going to be spoiled for anyone, I'll tell you that it's the most absurd you'll ever see. The film tries to induce patriotism with a sense of debt to fight people, but the film misses this point totally because of its weak and weak cast lines. Sorry, Cary!
