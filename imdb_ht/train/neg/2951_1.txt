Do not see this movie if you appreciate your idea. At the end of our collective look, me and my friends estimate that each of us loses 5% of our brain during its course. The only person involving and making it was not the crazy clinic was wearing the designer. <br /> <br /> Most movies leave a bad taste to your mouth. I realize now that instead of a feeling of riot, this film has elevated a deep hatred from me. I hate this movie very, very much. <br /> <br /> Some may say this movie does not mean that they have to be seriously taken. If only he did not take himself seriously. But it does. The plot is a heated version of the radio-esque universe universe melded and the cheap tire suits so prevalent in bad dinosaur movies. The dialogue is not only small and meaningful, but often literally painful. Whoopee Goldberg does not even try, but George Newbern as the voice of Theodore Rex is like nail on the soul. And whether its Juliet Landua and it off again on British accents or Richard Roundtree (aka Shaft) as the Blunt Commissioner, you will be flowing to an ever increasing sense of disbelief and despair. <br /> I recommend this movie only to anyone who wants to see the depths of the sort that mankind can fall.
