I feel like I've just watched a snappy movie ... a very good act, taut, hungry and horrible things! A two liturgical pervertion in the most fundamental and all-inclusive sense of the word, sexual violence and torture, rape, decapitation, incest, corruption, live burial, and abuse, abuse, abuse. Do not deliver it all. And I was entertained. I could not stop watching. What does this say about me, about people doing and acting in this sort of thing, and a world that has become so desensitized that eventually real mournful films will be the norm. And I'm neither puritanic nor humorous, I do not try to hide from the existence of darkness, and I definitely did not rule a life to protect, but I'm ashamed of myself. AND I'm sorry to see my British cousin drag the subject to sting my tribe way to do. It does not have to be cozy, but does it have to burn through civilian casualties?
