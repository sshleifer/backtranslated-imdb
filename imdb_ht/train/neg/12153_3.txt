Mass foods were just another movie trying to make a little money off of the zombie craze that will be around, mainly due to the popularity of movies such as Land of the Dead and the Resident Evil series. <br /> <br /> It starts at a TV station, which is guarded by the military, and reports that the Lazarus virus (zombie) is near to prevent them and the city will soon be free to do their business again. The problem is, this is totally false. Zombies are running rampantly and only a small minority of people they know. Among them are Torch (William Garberina), the camera man, Sherry (Rachael Morris), the female anchor lead (which for some reason listed as Shelly Play on this website) and Roger (Patrick Cohen), military escorts . Torch and Sherry are against lying to the people, but the station is being run through secret service (or some other government agencies) and they are very censored. This film gives herself a pat on the back on the box-cover saying "We hold FASE masses to a higher level than any of the three of these dead films" by George A. Rombero. " The source of that quote has lost all credibility to me. Let me just say that this film is BAD. I do not mean bad as I expected more (I obviously was, though) but I mean bad in that I could not find any kind of loyalty to the movie, whatever. Act in all parties either on iron or too much wood. Does anyone remember the lines or are they reading in cue cards? I can not even think of what the best part of the movie was or the best actor / actress. There really was not one. If I gave a nod to someone, I would say Roger, the military escort was probably the most interesting character but that's really hard to say. <br /> I should recommend to pass on this movie, despite the very good box cover (It's what originally drew me to the movie). 3/10
