I got this as a turkey film and I was not disappointed. <br /> <br /> Interestingly - in general though much of other cinemas it was clear that they worked hard to act this badly so constantly on all this movie and out accidentally left slipping some degrees of acting. <br /> <br /> Draw - being generous I could say that the scriptwriter started originally with a plot but did his best to ignore it. The plot breaks down faster then a Chinese hit computer <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> it fails to shed with any rhyme or purpose. The majority of lines are not the most amateur characters in amebleik. The script worked hard to ensure that no managing characters found to be considered memorable. I watched other movies where the extras were more interesting and memorable. <br /> <br /> Special Effects - ROTFLMAO !!!!! It was short bus special <br /> <br /> Direct - until you can come up with your own ability to direct copy the style of your favorite directors otherwise you will only make chess like this. It's good to know that your friend / family has given you 10 stars for this movie
