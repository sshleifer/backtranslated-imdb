One of the worst movies I've ever seen. Acting was terrible, both for children and adults. Most of the characters showed no, little or not enough emotion. The illumination was awful, and there was plenty of ups and downs on the time of the day the film was shot (At the river scene where they just found the ships destroyed, there were 4 shots; the sheriff and dad in the evening on the ships, Jillian and Molly in the evening evening, the rest of the day * when it is supposed to be in the evening * of the river bank, with the doctor, Beatrice, and Simonton at night, but not in the evening getting off the chips .) The best act of the film was probably out of the sheriff, Cappy (although there is a slip of character when the detector beats * Whatever this is when the dead, it eeps * shows Cappy died, still move while it can still be heard noise, and while the nurse besides his pulse checks manually, then it shows the pulse again, and after it finally dies.) I guess it will not be perfect because it's an independent movie, but it can always be better. Not worth looking, honestly, even for the kids. Would be good to look something good, like the Lion King or Toy Story if you're going to see anything you'll remember.
