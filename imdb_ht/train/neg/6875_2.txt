Types drawn in erotic scenes, only to achieve this was one of the most amateurish and incredible bits of my movie ever seen. Sort out as a high school film project. What is Rosanna Arquette thinking? And that was with all those stock characters in the rare assumed Midwest town? Pretty hard to get involved with this one. No lessons to be learned from it, there is no glittering click, just vibrant and ridiculous (but lots of skin, if that's intriguing) videotaped nonsense ... What was with the bisexual relationship, out from nowhere, after all heterosexual encounters. And what was with that absurd dance, and everyone plays their stereotypes? Give this one a pass, it's like one million others in bad, wasted movie, money that might have been spent on starving children or the help of Africa .....
