I normally do not take the time to comment that some people read, on some movies will see. However, in this case, I feel I must warn everyone who might consider wasting time on it. I just finished watching it only five minutes ago. This is, quite simply, one of the worst movies I've ever seen in my life. The act is terrible, a scheme is nonexistent, and their output levels are the best poverty level. I know that even a low budget film can be great, but not this one. There are only things that could save this movie for the horror fans' reason - more on screen grenades and slaves! The total amount of three times that this occurs is screen-screen. While it is effective and reasonable disturbing when it comes to - especially the end stage - there is simply not enough of it. The movie is just too long for its minimal content, too heavy dialogue, and therefore almost impossible to watch. What's up? To put it all in a nutshell and spare room, three girls irresponsible and knowledge go out driving in an isolated area where more than 20 girls have already been kidnapped and murdered. Cars, of course, break down, and taken to an old boring house staying in three foolish - one of those is the psychotic assassin. All three are eventually murdered, one by one, off-screen, after which looks like an eternity of boring, slow-paced story. As I said, these things are just worth seeing even once they are killed. Please do not buy it or rent it just so, and not be fooled as I was by the box art articulate and movie description. Save your money and your time.
