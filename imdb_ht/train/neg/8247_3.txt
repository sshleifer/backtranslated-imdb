But another British romantic comedy that hears all over the world seems to have a ravenous appetite for. This weak effort is an unintentional parody of the genre - all the classic clich√©s scenes here from ridiculous idiots elaborate running after trains to declare one's love. Characters are one-dimensional caravans saved for love-hewitt who managed to bring some movie to the movie. These threats threaten spiral from control of the plausibility department as the film progresses; Our suspension of suspension of our beliefs has finally come crashing during the preposterous finish. If you are looking for a Bridget Jones, Notting Hill kind of experience will not find it here.
