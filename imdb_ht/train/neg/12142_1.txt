Please, for the love of God, do not look at him. Now that says, I know what you think, can not he be bad? If everyone says it as bad as they say, I have to watch it! Do not do that! It will be like looking at a terrible accident involving baby and a gasoline fuel! You will be scarred for life ... the image will never leave you! I could only watch this half an hour before getting serious. The act is the worst I've ever seen, and I've seen barbwire !!! If you risk preventing your eyes from renting this movie ... do not say I have not warned you! The coverage and scenario are a trap !! Zombies? Satire? Shaun of the dead was great! This movie must be the same .... right? NON !! Write = direct crap = trash action = there was no act. Still not convinced? Then forever your soul will suffer !!!
