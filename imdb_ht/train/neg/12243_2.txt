San Sur AKA Krocodylus is a fair movie that has a humorous cast including Dax Miller, Taryn Reif, Kate Fischer, Duncan Regehr, Joel West, Matt Borlenghi, Maureen Larrazabal, Cris Vertido, Susan Lafrik, Archie Adamos, Rolando Santo Domingo , and Malaysia Amayao. Acting by the actors is fairly good. Emotions are fairly good and some of it is surprising. The movie is filmed fairly well as well. Things even go for the movie music is fairly interesting and the movie keeps you going to the end. This is a fairly thrilling film. If you throw in the movie, monsters, giant animal films, films, thrillers, mysteries, and films then I recommend you see this movie today!
