Ivan Reitman is something of a savior. The most tired scheme (Ghostbusters, Evolution) comes to life from his talent. Even its occasional flop (Six days, Nights seven) shows signs of life and humor that make it worth watching. So I was ashamed that riding was not able to take an original justice scheme (man superhero, superhero, great power-supplying revenge), and its form of something enjoyable. "Girlfriend" is an exercise of senselessness. Draws one-trick pony is long in the tooth after the first 20 minutes. The movie can not decide whether to be romantic comedy or superhero drama. The result is a flip-flop film between both, and the aspects that are very well done. Uma Thurman is head, as usual, and Luke Wilson pulls her role too, though her antibiotic filler quickly grows tired. What's even more maddening is that, in certain scenes (like when a very turn on Uma knocks a box in a wall), you feel a witty, rooky riding opus practically screaming to get out. But seconds later, the magic is lost, goes as quick as the superheroine whose movies disappear in almost every way.
