low to low boring ...... this is the next battleground in science fiction slumberness. Gene Francois (aka general statute of the hospital) has a role as a reporter and that in itself should tell you that this movie must be bad .... there's Ben King (an award winning academy) in this stinker and some other decent actors. You need to ask what belongs to decide to make this movie awful. The music dramatically got up and down like it's a dramatic story. Even if you pay attention to the plot is impossible to follow. Their effects are mediocre as well and seem really dating. All actors speak in a monotonous voice and have no realism in their dialogue. I could go on and on how this is a bad movie. At least with Earth Battlefield it's so bad it's funny but this is just a bit I'm g. Avoid otherwise if you want to lulled in sleep.
