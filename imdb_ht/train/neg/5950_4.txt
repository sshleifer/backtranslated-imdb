My first question after seeing this movie was, "Why is the LIAM title?" If the intention was to tell a story from the boy's perspective, it was not carried out well. Of course, there was formulation of camera angles at boy's scene, but many of the critical actions took place outside of his field of view. Having a "primary" character can speak (obviously suggests the mute, without power of a child) makes it difficult to give that character much depth. Melodrama is defined as: "dramatic or other literary works characterized by the use of stereotyped characters, exaggerated emotions and language, simplicity of morality, and conflict" LIAM adapted this definition to a T. is the viewer to hit on the head and the typical stereotypes of the fire and sulfur of the Catholic Church in the marble school march and the well-food priest saves money from parishioners. (A stereotype that gets very tired.) What's more - Jewish characters are lenders and factory owners! Many of the movie was predictable ... Who did not think we would look at Theresa scrubbing the bathroom after her mother said she said "No my daughter would rub another woman's bathroom! " I'm a fan of British realism if he does well. In my opinion, LIAM is not. <br /> <br />
