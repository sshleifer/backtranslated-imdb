This was a creepy movie movie; I found the music so effective. Mario photos taken in the village were also unnerving. However, I had three issues with this movie. One is that the lighting was very black so some of the time he was told to say what went on, but this could just be my copy. The second is that the very beginning does not explain very well and I still do not know what was going on there. The third problem is that I did not understand the finish, but apparently some people do. Of course, there are also the usual issues of those who do stupid things, and the male lead is pretty 70s. All in all, look but not even close to being a favorite.
