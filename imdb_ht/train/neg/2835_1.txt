The derek seemed to struggle to get rolls for kissing after "10". <br /> I used to work for a sailboat park in the Florida Keys. One day, the script for "ghosts can not do it" was circulating among the trainers in the "fish house" where food was prepared for dolphins. There was only one scene where a dolphin - supposedly Bo Proposal (or the Dolphin Kiss), asked "go get egg." Reading the script, we -lauuughed -... <br /> We did not finish finishing making any portion of this movie in our facility, although our dolphins were in the "Big Blue!" <Brr /> <br /> This must have been very close to Anthony Quinn's life. I hope he has fun in this movie, as he certainly did not do anything for his legacy.
