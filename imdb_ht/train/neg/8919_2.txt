The first time I saw this when it was taken as a suggestion from my TiVo system. I love Danny Elfman and thought she might be interesting. On top of that, I'm a fan of Max Fleischer's work, and this started out with the look and feel of his 30s drawing. With both of these, I thought he would keep my interest. I was guilty. Just a few minutes later, and I had the button fast forward. I ran through it in about 15 minutes, and thought that was it. <br /> <br /> And I read some of the other comments here and figured I did not give it enough of a chance. I recorded it again and looked at it. There are 75 minutes in my life I do not get back. <br /> I can not believe there are more bad reviews. Personally, I think it's because it's difficult to get to the minimum line of comments 10. How many ways have to say that's a waste of time? The movie comes across as if it was made by a few high school junior kids ready to scream the world and think they can be with breasts, profanity, and jerkies. Characters are flat. Parody of the "Swing Alphabet" is lame, essentially cobbling the melody, getting into A - E, striking the obvious layman an "F", and then there is no idea where to go. The trip to the intestines of the landing is expected not to work the first time, let alone the following. <br /> <br /> Across the board, the movie is all you would expect from someone trying out "Stone Park and South Park" without the ability to determine what and not funny. This would be fun if you're tall. Otherwise, it's not.
