This title looks more like a movie exercise than a movie that should have been released to be seen by the public. For Dafoe and his wife he had to be fun working together in a movie for the first time, without taking into consideration that people can actually watch it. I felt like it was 90mins wasted as I expected anxiety for a draw to develop, or even begin. <br /> Try to fit this movie in a genre and you will not, because it lacks a start, middle or finish. I've seen 'movie theater' before and this does not even come close to being artistic, abstract or original, it just seems to me to be completely pointless. <br /> I think he speaks for himself when the only people who rated this movie a 10 were below 18 age groups. No doubt for the constant sense of erotic scenes that the movie has insisted on sending us. This is if you can call it erotic. It certainly did not have any taste.
