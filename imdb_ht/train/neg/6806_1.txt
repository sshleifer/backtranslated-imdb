In addition to the technical errors .... <br /> How about a deadly female assistant capable of killing, all by himself, 4 out of 7 the terrorists (including senior sailors), 2 of people without even using a weapon. Then it lands the plane perfectly. We're not talking about Sigourney Weaver or Linda Hamilton; We are talking about a regular, scary, well-composed flight attendant. : D How about the leader in charge of the squad / rescue squad, he has a full evidence (according to the logic of the script) plan to sleep-gazing everyone and having someone in his team flying the aircraft. Only he decided at the time of the moment to change their plans and instead lead an attack on the terrorists, blazing weapons, do not know where the terrorists, or how many, and do not hide a position of advantage, so that All of his team gets easily wiped out. Yeah, this used the old noggin. Only later decided to use the gas to sleep anyway. And it turns out to be useless for all intensive purposes. <br /> <br /> Bad as this movie was, though, I could not stop myself from looking and wondering, what next? : D I can not help but imagine all the excellent script writers think themselves, it's not fair. lol! : D
