This movie is so bad it simply challenged reality. The film is the best grade school material, the acting is pathetic and the director should be forever removed from films in any form. So bad he can not even look as comedy as something on the lines of showgirls. The only thing this DVD was going for was the art covered. <br /> All that I can write to those who do not have the woe is to make yourself a favor worthy in advance and do not waste your time or money on this piece of waste. If you want to see a movie for the comedy aspects, there are many more worthy of this domain than this garbage.
