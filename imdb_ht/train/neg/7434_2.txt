If this is based on the true-life relationship, as indicated by Ms. Curtin and Mr. Levinson, I am thrilled I do not know them personally. This is painfully slow, and both characters take stupid pills liberally throughout the movie while singing in theme songs played in the ground. Many stupid scenes and stupid people do not make for a comedy.
