Vampires Vs. Zombie was not the original title. It's actually ... <br /> <br /> Nasty lesbian semi-vampire and two zombie When you hit by car: special guest appearances by Bob the curse Gypsie-Witch and her dog, random women and special powers and school Catholic Girl Short Koko Zombie Ear. <br /> <br /> Also on the box: Warning: No scheme - only the writer and director will understand the end, or anything else in this movie. <br /> <br /> Seriously though, I like bad movies. I love vampires. I love zombies. Hell, I enjoy the lesbians. This movie combines all three with a wave of confusion (or non-existent), lurid (I mean really dialogue), and random STUFF and those who have nothing to do with anything (or make them ... I did not know what the world was going on). Oh, and I can not forget the 'oatmeal zombie' flour in latex gloves (yes, the movie makers were so cheap they could not even cover the zombies of oatmeal and paint). Either way, the result was this BLOOD CREDITS movie, if you could even call it that. <br /> Is the end supposed to not make sense? The vampire was really nurse and the other girl was really a mental patient? Where were Vampires Vs. Zombies? Hell, where they were the vampires at all ... you really could not call any of the vampire girls. Whatever. <br /> Never rent or buy this movie. If you are really curious ... okay, I'll understand. Seriously, even lovers of BAD movies will not be able to stand this one. It should be number 1 on 100 below.
