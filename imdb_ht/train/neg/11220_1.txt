For a movie and many promises she was disappointing, unknowingly aware and acting out between horrendous and incredible. The work was more dull in her than Swiss cheese and it's the worst clenched end I've seen in a movie for some time. The final scene would have torn my heart out, if the movie all had never been so painful to begin with. I was annoyed! From the very first scene - one was left wondering if the sister was trying to get out of her twin for help, or simply scare her to death that would be best for the audience and save us at two hours Worst act I see at date. It was a horror of the true meaning of the word.
