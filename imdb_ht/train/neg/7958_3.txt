The protests run in a linear mode; Expect no quick-paced action, and neither you will find yourself with low back breath because there is simply no sitting-on-the-corners. <br /> <br /> There is not much of a grain, so do not expect one either. I would not blame the act - the show would have been much worse if not for Wu's act that was only favored to save the movie there. And oh oh cute girl too. <br /> <br /> The humor is at best, weak, and the show must as well pass through as an anti-drug campaign that employs tactical trauma tactics (esp at scene and Zhang) to tell you that We already know - that means drugs crush their families, heroin drives you crazy, it is not so easy to wean off, you will fall into a vicious cycle. <br /> know it may seem quite a bit harsh, but I feel that the show is far from seamlessly with a little patchy (* SPOILER ALERT *: Take for example when Andy Lau brought in police station : what we've just said 'oh we have all the tapes and proofs against you since 1997', and that's how it's been caught .nope, there is no chase-machine action, just a jump-of- Scene, what kind of Wu's weakening role as an infiltrated in the first place.) I suspect the lack of creativity is attributed to the fact that it is after all, a production of Mediacorp Raintree - a Singaporean film company production.
