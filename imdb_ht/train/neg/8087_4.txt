The movie lacks credentials and helicopters that did not exist until the 1950s. But no woman would do what was done here, even a woman before the women's movement in the 60s and 70s. On the only portion of the film that you might believe in was that Germany would want to know where the landing would be. Ignore for the moment that the British captured all the spyware, but even if they did not, they would not have one roaming around like this just to reassure the Germans that the landing would be in Calais. It's not one important thing that the movie does not work. It is the accumulation of all the wrong things that make the film fail. Bad guys, bad scripts, no attempt at authenticity (at all) all combine just to make the movie fall flat. Generally speaking speakers should fade into the carpentry. The suspension comes in with the spyware asking if the information is valid or not and worry about being detected. On this one game that was on from the start. This spy did nothing but spying. The only chance you have to find something with some credibility and instyle some suspense can read the book.
