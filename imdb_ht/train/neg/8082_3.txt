It was one of those late night "It's" I saw things. Sometimes they are many. This one was awful, but it really should not be. <br /> <br /> The movie has a really good cast. How can you weaken when you have Charleston Heston and Jack Pallance? We are talking about Oscar winner channel here. It has good effect. She even had some really good tits! And I mean nicely shown, full of breasts and nipples full and at one point even some beaver. But he did not compensate for one missing ingredient - a story! The plot was funny. I do not mean the sun's "solar crisis" explodes, but that's bad enough. It was the rest of the thing - oh so stupid and totally predictable evil society things. People just STANK! No amount of good boat or cool space action or battle scene can be found around that one. <br /> I saw the members cast even incredibly good. I saw beautiful fiction movies that had miniscule and budget. All the differences in the writing.
