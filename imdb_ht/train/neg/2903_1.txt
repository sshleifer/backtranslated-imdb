O darling. This film was sub-titled "When Writers Go On Strike!" What a stinker. I was expecting really high for this, especially after reviewing IMDb, which made me wonder about the overall IMDb system overall, but that's a separate question. I loved Steve Carrell of Anchorman, Bruce Almighty, the Office, etc. So I was expecting so many things. To say that I was disappointed by the year's exaggeration. There is much to do with this movie, but I'll confine myself to (a) implausibility of any kind of behavior as such people do (Aerobic mass workout? Which planet is the real life on?), Clunky The script (a murderer in love?), and the fact that the character of Dan is so incredible, you find yourself asking what the girl sees in her make it fall in love with her? This film was completed popping up with clunky dialogues, cracking directions, ridiculous series-scenes and slow, slow, slow. We would have walked out after half an hour if we were not with my parents, who did not get out very much and did not like to waste money. Unlike the musicians in this movie, who would better send all the cash spent to make this movie in a fireworks - that would be more fun. If you like movies, avoid this as the epidemic.
