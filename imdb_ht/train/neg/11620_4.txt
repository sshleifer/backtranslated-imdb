I gave this more than one 1 because I thought there were some moral lessons in this story and it provoked some thoughts and comments from my wife and I. Acting with the dialogue was mediocre and I must confess I was out feeling like I was beating on the head with this God, who and Christ is our Savior. The movie and the story line did not need it. If, as I am, you are a retired Catholic or Christian avoid this one it will make you nauseuz. The film did a great job of demonstrating the thin line between being a good citizen and how someone could become a potential stalker focusing on what might be.
