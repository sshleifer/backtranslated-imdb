LOL! Not a bad way to start it. I thought this was original, but then I discovered it was a script in remark 1976 KING KING. I never saw KING KONG until I was 15. I saw this movie when I was 9. Funky movie music is getting stuck in your head! Not to mention the theme film by the Yetians. This is the worst thing I've ever seen. At the same time this movie remains a separate grail to B movies. Memorable quotes: "Take a jerk and go to bed." "Put the Yeti in your tank and you have power yet." I remember seeing this movie on MOVIE MACRABE hosted by Elvira. There is a scene where he was like KING Kong in back! In King Kong she grabs the girl and climbs up the building, but in this movie she bumps down the building and the girl's grab (which has fallen)! Also around this year, there was another MOON PEKING MAN (1977) rope from Hong Kong. There are a lot of traveling scene scene and motor body parts. This movie will let you laugh. It is like I said, just another king KING script. Rated PG for violence, language, thematic elements, and some scary scenes.
