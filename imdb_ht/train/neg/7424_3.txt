Very, very humdrum movie tickets here and Stella Stevens take directions from someone in the backyard (it does not take me long guess who he was) in Old Nevada Town outside Vegas for a money heist at Hotel Circus Circus in Las Vegas . Stevens led her girls' gang to three, and find out to be acting faster than they were anticipated. Despite some good looks at Las Vegas in the 70's, very average yet credible acting from most involved, with a draw and potential line, Las Vegas Lady lays a big big egg. It looks forever for the movie kick in gear, and when it does make it just sputters here and there and never really speed up. I was a little disappointed with this movie. Sure, I did not expect anything great, but I at least thought this could be one of these own OS movies from the 70's or something like it. Do not even close. No one dies. There is a lame gunfight between critics Stuart Whitman and George DiCenzo officer, one year before his Grand Performance as the Bugliosa Prosecutor at Helter Skelter. Gunfight has all the suspense of watching a cascade. There is one punch with one head hit with a blunt instrument. Beyond that there is nothing in terms of action. And as for girls, do not expect much to have either. Stella and her girls (both very talented, many in the sauna and bathing. What do you see? There is nothing but a flotant side. Stella puts these beautiful bodies open to her real talent, but I would Love it would be a bit more open and its performance. In this way I could write one thing that would recommend the movie. Not, it was not to be, and I have little to say in favor of this movie. It's not a horrible movie in any way, it's just nothing to go for it either.
