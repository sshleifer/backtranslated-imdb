This is one of the worst films that I've ever seen throughout my life. I wish I could travel back in time and do the following: <br /> 1) Find out where the "movie" "War Games - The Dead Code" was filmed 2) See the original WARRIOR game and my current computer knowledge AND the eyes of a 1983 preteen. 3) Break into the pentagon computer in the 80's with knowledge and perspective learning and memory. 4) WHOPPER RATE at NUKE where the address in the minutes DEAD CODE before its first day of filming 5) Come back to the present, have a beer and get Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones to "flash" my memory in all events, especially my original look at the "Dead Code" 6) Make Another Beer and Watch WARS GAMES 7) Be happy until next bad remake of a good 80 movie. <br /> 8) Are i Had forgotten that Jar Jar killed. I'm not sure if I should travel in the future for that. Maybe I need access to a wormhole.
