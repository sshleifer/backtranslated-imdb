Chan Wook Park is nothing if not invented. I'm a CYBORG, but OK is full of enthusiasm for fun little blooming techniques and some mind ideas inviting in between. Trying to walk in the tracks of love in Marc Caro and Jeunet (CITY OF ALL CHILDREN, DELICATESSEN), Park embarks on an awesome, lighthearted story that is a radical departure from his usual morbid fare. Hardly one to be flawed for his ambition or vision, it is truly unexpected, then to see the whole Park's effort to add up so much. <br /> I'm a CYBORG, but this OK looks amazingly subtracted from itself as it goes along, and the end result was a fraction of the sum of its part. The first is pledged, the gags are abundant and offset rich humor but it all miserably fails to create any sense of connectivity with the audience. The characters are beautiful and original and played with gusto by the cast, but try as I might, I could not bring myself to care for any. <br /> <br /> SYMPATHY FOR VENGEANCE LADY was a misstep, indicating perhaps that Park had overinduled itself a little, but it still managed to show some of the unique flare director and wake up in an impressive movie, was easily forgiven. None of the confidence to ensure that they were asked JOINT SECURITY area or SYMPATHY TO MR. VENGEANS is obvious here. I'm a CYBORG, but OK is leaving me so completely unengaged I keep myself instinctively fast transferred from time to time (more regularly as the movie progresses). I gave the lady a 5/10, and in that measure, this probably deserves no more than a 3. For the sake of the time, I will generate: 4/10
