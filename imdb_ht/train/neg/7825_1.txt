I guess this film is a fitting tribute to the superman movie first, as it is just as crumple and painfully long as the original. <br /> After an opening scene consisting solely of vigilant visual intergalactic, the credit pay homage to the same-crumpled-looking-for-the-time couple quick-moving futurists in the original superman movie. <br /> Then there are some more cherished things. Ma Kent sees some kind of bad ruckus on the farm, and spends a good portion of my life gently walking up to some debris in the garden. Then superman sneaks up on it and faints. <br /> Our next catch up with Lex Luthor in a very close-ups scene of an old lady as she dies. We do not see Luthor's face until the end of the stage, an early example of driving the movie to leave no hackneyed rock unturned. Lex Luthor is a guy who does not like Superman because he is not human. Also, it probably does not like people either, as the movie occasionally features some kind of plot on Lex Luthor's planning to kill most of the Earth's population. After a while, Clark Kent shows back to his old job (I forgot to mention, he went on a five-year trip where nothing happened). Then she finds out Lois Lane has an illegitimate kid and is Cyclop dating. He displays so much that he loses control over his super strength as a limit that he accidentally breaks a photo frame. <br /> <br /> At this point we see that Miss Lane is on some types of jets attached to some kind of craft space. It is some kind of important event on account of it is on TV. Then we learn that people in a monitoring room monitor this event. There are also those who watch it on TV and there are pilots in the cabin. The film then reminds us that people are involved by cutting between them for most of the summer. As the events leading up to the inevitable disaster began to build, I excused myself to find a soda. I accidentally walked back to the theater and watched the film on Al Gore showing slides in its entirety. I tried to find my way back to Superman Returns, but I somehow wandered into Prairie Home Companion, which I looked twice in a row. Then it was time to stop messing around. <br /> I walked back to the theater first, found my chair, and looked up to see that the next Lois Lane space shuttle craft was almost over. Still, she seemed to be taken forever, so I wandered into the theater, met a girl, got married, raised a son and sent her to college. While I went to my son's graduation school, I remembered I should probably check in on Superman, so I excused myself and ran back to the theater only to learn there was no need to rush. It always takes about half an hour before things go wrong for Lane Space Shuttle. When they did, Superman saved everyone, which was very cool. <br /> <br /> Then there is a superb place superman turning really crap and start quiet Lois Lane and his family with its x-ray vision and super-audience. Then she tries to get her to cheat on Cyclops, which looks like a good guy. <br /> Meanwhile, Lex Luthor is involved in some kind of contest to show all possible generic behavior before the movie ends. I forgot to bring my scores with me (they gave you one of the doors), but I think it was damn near one hundred percent. I hope he has the million dollars. At this point, things begin to gear up for the finest nourishing final. I think perhaps the projector was broken, on account of the movie seemed to be in some kind of village for a while here. I remember seeing quiet things growing out of the water, Superman getting sick, Superman getting better, back to the quiet things, he was sick again, no wait, it's okay again. bad guy moves: crying to his girlfriend a little. <br /> <br /> Then Superman died and returned to life. I thought the film was over, so I left. <br /> <br /> Eighty years later, the home nursing home where I lived felt a bit frustrating. I realized I left my sweatshirt back to the theater, and I went to retrieve it. When I did, I was a little surprised to find that revenue has become no longer. I tried to ask some of the viewers what I missed, but most of them were just skeletons and gray hair by now. <br /> I sat back in my old chair and looked as Lois Lane puttered her home for a while. Then Superman showed up and started quoting the beginning of the movie, and since I've already seen that part I thought it was okay to leave. <br /> So, this is my review to become. Oh, too, if you like jokes about people who eat dogs or jokes about one dog eating another dog, you'll love this movie. On the contrary there are two jokes like that in it.
