I can not trust this blockbuster blockbuster. It was SO BAD. I was totally fooled by the box art. DO NOT DO! It's not worth your time I promise you. I do not know if the positive reviews for this flicker were a joke or that. I am so shameful. : (<br /> <br /> The description on the back of the box does not match! The girl who has the voodoo does about it is a stripper. who wrote the description for the movie even scrambled to watch it! Those positive reviews had to be a joke they just had to be .. If someone actually loved this flick then I lost all faith in humanity And I do not even find myself starting on the story compared to the title. You're the fact that the movie all done all in 2 places. Or that the cops did not even have to close in real uniform. Why would I even says that? Who cares about the cops uniforms? Compared to the rest of the uniform film were spot on .. This film is a reproach of the genre of zombies and all its fans.
