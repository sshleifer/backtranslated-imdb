Probably someone heard of Alberto Tomba. An ancient policeman, an ancient sky champion, and now a tender actor. "Alex L'Ariete" was planning to be a "mini series" TV, but the Italian TV itself refused to show the movie on its channels. Now, one, believe me, ridiculous movie. The script it simply hilarious (it's supposed to be a dramatic movie), something like a 5 old kid. But what's really happening to you from romantic acting: Alberto Tomba, who actually was not credible as a policeman himself, plays a very funny character: a special Italian police operation specializes in breaking open doors! ("ariete" is "ram"). This super-guy is trying to save a cute little girl life (a real italian showgirl TV, married to singer Eros Ramazzotti): pretty, but absolutely inept in the act. Lose this one and make yourself a favor. A movie that is a shameful Italian movie industry: only John Travolta at Earth Attack was closed.
