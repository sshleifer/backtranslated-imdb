As someone who reads the book, I can say that this is largely inferior to the great American version of Gwyneth Paltrow. There are several reasons for this. Firstly, Emma is too unpleasant. Yes, it's flawed, and it's not the easiest person to love - but the viewer should not rightly start to contemplate it. Secondly, Mr Knightly is wrong. His breasts and melancholy in this version are best suited to a Bronte or Gaskell adaptation than Austen, and throw the mood into the whole "cut" artifact. Third, Samantha Morton is too strong an actress to be relegated to Harriet's role; and why did he look so sick? Harriet is supposed to be blonde and blooming - does not look as if it will be brought in by the intake of the next stage. Fourth, the structure was mucked up and cut off. In the end, when Emma decided she likes Mr Knightly, he comes across as absolutely baffled because this narrative has not been well shown and brought together throughout the film. Now, what happened, exactly, with Mrs Elton's accent? He was out to sound like an American actress trying to suppress his own accent at the outset, all out the American half way, and then returned to English in the end. Finally, this drag to the end. The book and the big movie version ends with the wedding of Emma and Mr Knightly. This version jumps to confusion after the announcement of the wedding without actually showing us the ceremony. <br /> <br /> All in all, an attempt rather casual. Read the book or rent the Paltrow version instead
