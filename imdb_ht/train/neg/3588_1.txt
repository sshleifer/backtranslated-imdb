Follow-up to 1973 "Tall Walk" continues the real-life drama that surrounds Buford Pusser's Tennessee sheriff, but this slick plays as a TV-movie bath. Bo Svenson takes on the lead role of Joe Don Baker, but it's too mild to the party; It comes as a country singer ambling with a stick instead of a guitar. Good actors supported like Richard Jaekel, Luke Askew and Robert DoQui end up with very little to do. I would give the one-star movie to prohibit its good intentions, but the scenario is a transparent and lazy mass of predicament routines and the production is cheapjack. Was followed in 1977 by "Final Chapter-Walking Tall" and in 1978 by the TV movie "A Real American Hero".
