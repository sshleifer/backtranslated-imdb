A group of friends comes face-to-face with a family of cannibal cannibals also in the beautiful German land. 'The' family mutant 'competition is almost old as the hills that franchise are inbred often call home, so any director attempts to suffer new life in the genre needs to come up with something special special in order to impress . With barricades, Timo Rose tries to provide the well-worn routine of a Teutonic twist, by transplanting action in the Black Forest and giving it the German low-budget Splatter treatment. The result is a very very, but totally unbiased effort that has made almost unwatchable thanks to some obscure addressing decisions ?? in particular, the use of non-stop in fancy filters and irritating technical correction. Rose does not opte to use every trick trick to its correction software to offer it, then barricades might be a reasonably fun gore-fest: cast inexperienced reasonably well; The effects of their blood are good churning; and there are one or two crises and even some well-conceived creepy moments. All of this, however, is completely ruined by the terrible-camera camera, scary corruption, and the huge gimmickry visual shock used to give the film the grief that is so inexplicably popular with movie-makers today. / I give barricades 3 out of 10 peppers for the weird gore, including a diligent scene where a guy is forced to drink acid, loads of nasty wounds caused by a variety of sharp fuses, and some very good hammers decan.
