I saw this movie with low expectations and was not disappointed. It's so bad that it's actually funny in a very critical way to pay. <br /> <br /> Gael is absolutely awful, I mean it just can not act, period. It should give up now, as acts are clearly not her stuff .. Co-stars are on the same caliber, I'm sure my 5 year old cousin could do a better job than all of them! The director should be disappointed to have his name on something so ridiculous. Somehow I do not think an Oscar is on the cards for this guy. <br /> I never wrote a comment on IMDb, but this movie was so bad I felt compelled to do so. <br /> If you get the chance to see this movie, do not 0/10 if there was a 0
