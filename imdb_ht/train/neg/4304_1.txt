This is a anti-Serbian propaganda film made for television. <br /> <br /> "Muslims are good; Christian Orthodox Christians are BAD." That's the message. Use "entertainment" to get through a propaganda message is nothing new. <br /> <br /> This movie puts it on thick. br >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> >>>>>>>>>>>>>>> 500 500 US down arrow from the Germans in the Second World War. <br /> <br /> Churchill decided to betray Milhalovitch and put British backing behind Communist Tito. Roosevelt followed suit and as a result, after the war ended Yugoslavia was delivered to communist Tito. But US Milhalovitch militia has been smeared by the media ever since. The film is part of the Anti-Serbian propaganda campaign that was engineered by George Soros and its International Crisis Crisis (ICG) which resulted in Kosovo's "War" in which Serbia was bombed by NATO because of totally false claims by ICG of "mass graves" in Kosovo filled with "victims" of the embarassing Serbs. The fact that there were no such grave tombs with the Albanians (Muslims) had no business being in Kosovo Serbia are the fact that most of the media will not be printed. <br /> I chose this movie to watch because one-phrase descriptions on the video cover look interesting. <br /> Imagine me disgusting when I discovered I was misleading to rent another branch of the propaganda machine aimed at Serbia. <br /> <br /> Instead of this propaganda one should make a movie about the unwillingness of Clinton's administration to come clean with Congress and the American people on its complicity in the delivery of weapons from Iran of the Muslim Government of Sarajevo. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I will not hold my breath waiting for such a movie.
