Do not get me wrong, the movie is beautiful, the stunning shots, and the material is dramatic. However, it was a great disappointment and I actually left upset at what Disney did. <br /> <br /> The planet Earth BB was all of the highest and more. It was subtle. He had a general sense of balance and showed the full circle of life and death. There were tragedy and triumph, loss and win. He was swinging. <br /> <br /> Modify Disney on Earth is not one of this. They tried to make it a movie we Americans would talk about. They made it DRAMATIC. They put a note on the music scroll. They made evil predators. They did WALWN wrong. They showed each meeting as negative. He tried to be suspense and in place, but at the expense of the lesson in balance. The film was an hour and a half of negative paints and only about 10 minutes of positive. <br /> I am all for preventing global warnings, but this was on top of the political junk and the environment. <br /> This is something else, I went to see it on the big screen, but it was disappointed in the photo quality. She looks better on my TV at home. <br /> If you want to see something like this and get the whole picture, go out and buy, rent, or borrow the BBC's Planet Earth series. It is best lesson, better sound, and (if you have Blu-Ray) pure photo.
