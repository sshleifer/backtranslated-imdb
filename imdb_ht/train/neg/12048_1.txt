I walked out of about 6 movies all my life. This was one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I do not know how I sit in an hour of it. I had to be in a night coma. I saw it in the theater when it came out 8 years ago. I could not even remember the name, but I knew Penelope Ann Miller starred in her. It must have really affected me to be wasting time I comment on it today. Yech! Vomit! Barf!
