Cheap and manipulative. This movie has no heart. <br /> It also has dire dialogue, convincing characters with a preposterous, or rather non-existent, storytelling. It just lurches out of bad worse in a cynical effort to key some kind of emotion out of a frightening and quite irresponsible nature! <br /> And the HEDGEHOG !!!! How many cheap shots can a movie take? The hedgehog, by the way, gave the most convincing performance and look at this minute-minute-athon. <br /> <br /> If you've considered watching this movie, do not. I'm sorry but I can not find a single feature of this movie. He notes a big, fat zero with me. Strictly for sub-Dogma knicker-wetters. Yawneroony! <br /> Still, if you liked dancing in the dark ... <br /> <br />
