This has to be the cheesiest, stupid, the most delayed movie movie ever. It's a complete joke that's the same surface of the theater. This is sort of like watching the Ness Loch monster in the rural America. This movie deserves to be cast into a bathroom and completely forgotten. John Carradine, ashamed of you. People who participate in this stomach trash motel need to be lobotomized. Tann! Maybe I give them too much credit. I'm sure they were lobotomized before the filming. How else can one explain the utter and absolute stupidity that this bucket of crap includes. Do not waste a minute of life you are watching. Do not even waste your time sending a review.
