I read from the papers that W.Snipes were broken so no wonder it would take part in low budget projects like Contractor.He is just the next star star to join a growing club: the penniless stock stars in the 90s (Van Damme, Segal, Lundgren, Snipes). Here's the lead star in a flush of cheap action shot in Bulgaria (we are supposed to believe that the place is London, as only a complete moron might buy that) The story is one of 1000 other movies: retired special forces good guy gets hired by the government again to do a wet job afterwards the government wants to get rid of him - good guy gets away after killing bad guys (was that a stake? guess not!) The star of the movie: girl The little (Eliza Bennett) outperforms everyone else at the cast! A star is for more one star for eye candy Lena Headey, making 2 stars. Only for snipe snipe fans! Everyone else: avoid!
