... except for Jon Heder. This guy was film tackle at all. <br /> <br /> The plot sounds fun. A 29-year-old slut girl (Heder) is still living with Keaton who is going to meet a new love (Daniels). Daughter daughter is jealous and worried to lose his comfortable life and tries to sabotage the relationship. He also met a girl (Faris). I really liked the performance of Daniels and especially Faris, but anyone who cast Hader would be best to sell hot dogs to the beach. Heders annoying performance, which would be a good thing since it plays an annoying guy, problem is it's a bad actor that makes this guy likable in the final. At the end you still wish you can personally punch the guy in the face and you're upset about the end. In the future each film and this guy will be no go for me!
