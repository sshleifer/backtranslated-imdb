If this guy can make a movie, then I'm sure hell can be one too. <br /> In fact, if you hire me to make a movie for you, I promise to do the following: <br /> 1) I will add more naked women. This movie was no. I think cheese B-class horror movies are only rented because of the traditional exploitation of the female body. I would not want to let my viewers down. <br /> 2) I will avoid making too many scenes where the hero wakes up to find out it's just a dream. I think HorrorVision had about 4 of these scenes. And, considering the film was only such an hour long, the dream-to-film-length ratio was quite high. And, if I decide to make a sequence of dreams, I'll ensure that the person wakes up without clothes. I mean, who sleeps in leather pants? <br /> 3) I will not rip off any movie like Star Wars or the Matrix because I'll know my budget is small and I do not want my mask to despise for big-budget Hollywood movie by adding satirical references to them me. <br /> <br /> 4) And finally, I will not mix modern technology with the undead. I mean, a palm pilot can only be so scary ... at least turned him into a rolly-polly monster before the screen blown up or something. <br /> So, if you're looking for the highest quality of your next horror production, count on me: wanna-b-movie director extraordinary.
