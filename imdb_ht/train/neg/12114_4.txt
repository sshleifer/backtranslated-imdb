The strangest people living in a city go on their lives. There's licker a guy who adds everything, a dump diver that finds a body that he takes home to live with, a crazy girl and a doll dress like her, a guy who wants to cleanse girls in the wicked ways ... offbeat in the extreme, this shot in black and white film is better and out the color. The monochrome takes the edge of the two steps from feeling home movies. Like a Troma movie, this movie is fun to adapt and begin, but its especially strange for Weirds relief and soon become a cramped leaf since one you see the upsets set you can kind of guess where it will be a lot of time-not always-but enough so it does not have to be fun. (Even though I did not see the cleanup come). Send a shot if you have nothing else to look and you are waiting for the next set of Golden Girls from Netflix.
