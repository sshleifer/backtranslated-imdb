I remember rather enjoying that a few years back but coming to it again, I wonder why. I guess it always looks good with the girls doing well but guys instead leave the side down. Why oh why in many English films about sex we have there are those who snap about the beautiful girls together? What is more of this begins to predictably enough as a gender farces similar to the concession film, but about a third of the way (while we are starting to enjoy the presence of May Me Lai's beautiful) the movie asks us they begin to take it seriously. Not only that but the central club and Cannabis sequences are very forced and just look vile. In short this is neither as innocent nor intelligent as it seems intently. Richard O'Sullivan, perhaps as a central figure, could help but I decided to be one of his worst performers. Just worth it for the ladies.
