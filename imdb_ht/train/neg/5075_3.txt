The animation was good, the imagery was good, although not entirely original, however, the story was too long, too confusing, and dramatic way. After an hour I could not wait to find it on with. With many characters who have nothing to contribute with plot elements that either come from nowhere or go nowhere this film really was not one movie at all and would have been best in as a short series or possibly two films. If you like this kind of typical story maybe you'll love it, but frankly, I was spoiled by more creative stories that actually have some sort of fool message. Going to rent a movie Miyazaki and watch it twice, you will find more ways out of it.
