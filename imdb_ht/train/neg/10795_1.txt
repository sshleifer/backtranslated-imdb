Someone say shaq the stick is good at basketball. This movie was not even fun on a stupid level. In this shaq film plays a genus that lives in a boom box that is not an original genius in a boom box instead of a lamp. It is supposed to help a little boy play by equally annoying the Franca cappra. This movie has the most flimsy scenario since the water world, the act was awful and I think anyone who likes this flash would be afraid to admit it.
