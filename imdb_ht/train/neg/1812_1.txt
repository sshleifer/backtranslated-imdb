Go immediately and rent this movie. It will be on a bottom shelf in your local video store and will be covered in dirt. No one will touch it in years. It may even be a $ .50 special! It's worth ten bucks, I swear! Buy it! There are not many films than they can compare with this - the celluloid version of which goo is formed at the bottom of a litter case after a few years. Yes, I gave it a '1,' but it really deserves much. 1-10 scale was not done with things like this in mind.
