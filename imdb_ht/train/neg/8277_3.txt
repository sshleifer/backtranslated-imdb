This could be incredible, but this movie has grown to $ 878,138 in Russia! It shows in almost every movie cinema and still runs! Well, I have no idea why distributors put their eyes on this particular "film" uh, which has almost no screening around the world. That's some kind of enigm! Haha! Perhaps it was based on the fact that another film, "this promise" and Paris Hilton, were also released just like DVD almost everywhere, had great tests in Russia and grossed over $ 1mln. In addition, both movies have a lot of promotions, as there were banners in the city, advertising television and so on. Speaking about film, I would say it's dull and absolutely boring. It may be best, really. Even if she has Jessica Simpson.
