.... this mini does not get better and age. I saw this and its end when originally broadcast, and my dear others were thrown. In early 2002 I had anticipated romance for both WOW and W and R and was even more impressed. I then decided that I saw both again and investing $ 200 more on the DVD series. I also looked at the minister again in painful detail and realized I did things backwards - I should have bought the novices and borrowed the DVD. <br /> <br /> Do not believe it is abysmally bad? Read the novels and see for yourself. Do not think this is dating? His screenshots for someone not old enough to see it originally broadcast and look at the reaction you get (warnings - reactions from those people vary from looks to stomach laughs). This mini - Dan Curtis himself chose Ali MacGraw and Robert Mitchum. Yikes !! Quality production, scoring music, dialogue - was a great story turned into a soap opera late 70 by an overly-ambitious producer who was overhead. Things were dating the minute it was completed. Two of these two ministers were great when original streams and those of us who saw them then tug in a nostalgic string that reminds us of the younger days. IMO - this mini does not almost live up to its reputation and seriously disappears.
