This is probably the most boring film, worse and useless I saw last year. The plot is meant to have some philosophical aspect to appear to me as a very bad copy of the womb, with many clich√©s: copiously heavy Lone, good looking, psychologically disturbed, sleeping with his weapon ... + pretty hard worker and shy, but good looking-to-scientist, you add a conspiracy of 2 cents and you have me, robots! I was terribly disturbed by the obvious brand advertising such as FedEx, Audi, Conversation etc. This movie feels the commercialization and they tend to be more a poor ad space that unfortunately will not end after 30 sec. I would not recommend this to my worst enemies, if you have some spare time, watch a good TV program instead or better read a nice book.
