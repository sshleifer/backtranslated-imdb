Here's an independent movie I really wanted to love but eventually could not. The lack of script (boldly proclaiming in the main titles) really shows off and saves the photo. The story is a nonsensical mess that is not worth trying out. I quickly became bored in 10 minutes, then suffered from the rest of the first 40 minutes - hoping for the best - before hitting the chapter stopped (mercifully) to get to the end ... even non was worth the extra effort. OZARK SAVAGE clearly tries too hard to be smart, raising its best sequence from the wrong 2 mal and the matrix. As a result, there are plenty of OZARK SAVAGE that have not been done before, and better. This film would have been much more fun than a short 10-20 minutes, but as a feature, it just feels padded and forced. Of course, there is no money in shorts, so I fully understand the financial reasons that I assume motivated it has stretched from 75 + minutes. Director Matt Steinauer shows great promise, and I wish him luck.
