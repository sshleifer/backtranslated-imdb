This serial is interesting to look like a MST3K feature, but for today's audience at all. I was really surprised to see the year she did as 1952. Considering that fact alone makes this a solid (modest?) 2 in my book. Cars used by even contemporary look, they look like things from there 30. It's basically Cody (delivers the lone world? Sheesh speaks about a reproach of everyone else, like the military), anyway it's Cody In her nipple ring flying against grabber and daley of mute ss henchman moth who sport sports with a casual lamma gun that is lame in its own right, enjoy. If you want to watch a really nice set of flash Gordan, it's full of rockets that attack each other with a good evil nemesis and also good looking women, this is not the one. And Flash made 15 or so years before this crap so you can give it some slack. Something made in 1952, that's bad, worthy a 2. Nuff said. Give it a 6 if you watch it as an MST3K episode, these guys have some fun fun with it; A tweak of nipples here, a tweak and I'm flying! And now, as an added bonus, I bring you song captain Cody Theme as originally sung by Joel and her two character Tom Servo and Crow aboard the satellite in love for the episode eight episode Planet: <br /> <br /> The singing of credit is very starting); <br /> <br /> (TOM SERVICE SINGING) BEGIN ORGANIZER OF YOUR KODIS ....
