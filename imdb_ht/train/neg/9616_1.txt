First of all, I was doubtful to just look at the DVD box and read it saying that it was about the bunch of young people gathered in a lake where they would get done or something. Any movie that has a site like this fails miserably, as a slasher movie, except for the first Friday of the 13th. <br /> I wanted to get up and stop watching the movie at least 10 times, but I just kept thinking that he had a little better. It was not. Generally, I think each movie has something that you can take from it. This is nothing. <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor, and find something constructive to do for 80 minutes. Like, give yourself paper, or dirt.
