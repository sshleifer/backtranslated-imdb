It totally defeated me why Godard has taken so seriously - and One Plus One is a great example of his incompetence as both a cinema and a 'scholar' polemicist. It's hard to credit that Godard actually believes all that Marxist and Maoist side. Anyone half of the brain could work out the bankruptcy of those 'isms' and how many people were destroyed and they continued to destroy as Godard had made his film supported. As a moviewriter, ask yourself: would you have boring voice-overs reading tedious political diatribes at your audience, and then when you could not think of anything else to do, lay another voice-on in voice First, who lost its cost after the first 100 words in any case? Brilliant, Jean-Luc! As for Godard insisted on making a movie with the Rolling Stones: of course he did; you would not? The only guarantee was to get mad as absolute to see in the first place: the genius of the stones to eclipse a talentless and political party idratically put loose and a camera. The brochure scene was not worthy of the worst theater itself, and it was an insult to the intelligence of even the youngsters who used to play in it - as they can easily see. Copping-out does not allow friendly criticisms to claim that all this artless crap was a satire-movie-satire satire is no more than a safe get-out offering people who clearly see Godard's poverty in intelligence and despicable outcry to his audience. Ironic that Godfrey's friends friend, Truffaut, and Night Americain have made the best movie ever on film, and Godard did the worst with Le Mepris! Behind Godard did not choose the stone's track of sympathy with the Devil. It just happened to be the track being working on when the 'movie' started shooting at Barnes Olympic Studios.
