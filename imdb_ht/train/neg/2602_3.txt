Drew Barrymore keeps seeing his change-month all over town and he really starts getting a pain in the butt. <br /> <br /> After Dee rents a dish from a hack writer, her encounter with 'Drew in the other' gets more often. Writer-dude feels that it's her responsibility to snap 'the real Drew' from her stupor, so she does what she can to help including her seducing her as soon as she has some free time. Not very interesting, and even less scary, but Drew is sexy as usual, especially when it gives a group of construction workers the rude finger ... yeah Drew, that's hot! <br /> Best scene just might be where Drew real mom real life, Jaid, and a great kitchen knife ... hmmm ... and how was your day?
