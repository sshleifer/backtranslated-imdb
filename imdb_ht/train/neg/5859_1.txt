Turkish Cinema has a big problem. Directors are not interested in the global cinema. They are local and folklore, but want to be international. This brings the kitsch results such as this movie. <br /> <br /> Movie has jokes translated into Spanish from Turkish and they have no meaning for non-Turkish audiences. Even for Turkish audiences after 10 years. <br /> <br /> Players, even Ferhan SENSOY have a worst act than average. They act like puppets. <br /> <br /> The movie was shot in Cuba, but there was nothing in Cuba yet. So, Cuba thought like a banana republic. <br /> Waste of money, waste of time.
