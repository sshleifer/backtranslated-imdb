The idea was frightening, the actors were incredible, the story could have been very scary, but the writing was poor and there was no depth. I could not really get into this movie. I could not feel for the characters, there was a lot of cliffhangers, and the movie just ended very weirdly. Was it a happy ending? I do not know. Was it a sad end? Again, I do not know. You let the theater feel satisfied. The film was so full, but could not. Just because you can edit, does not mean you should, right? I would not really recommend this movie because you just can not say that you left feeling the movie as it ended. You'll just be confused. Believe me, you will probably thank me if you do not watch this movie. <br /> <br /> 3/10
