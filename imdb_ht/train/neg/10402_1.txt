Well ... my quake, the original began in 1990 and I found the movie quite enjoyable to watch. however, they started to make Tremors II and III. Trust me, these movies started going down on their right after finishing the first one, I mean, assassins donkey ??? Now, only God himself can answer the question "why in the name of God would they create another one of these voltage dives in a movie?" Tremor IV can not be considered a bad movie, in fact it can not even consider an epitome of a bad movie, to live up to more than that. As I tried to sit down though, I noticed that my eyes began to bleed, and I'm hoping that the girl from the ring would crawl into the TV and kill me. Did they really think dressing people stared at the other movies up as if we were from the wild west would make the movie (and the exact same) any better? Honestly, I would never suggest buying this movie, I mean, there are cheaper ways to find good things.
