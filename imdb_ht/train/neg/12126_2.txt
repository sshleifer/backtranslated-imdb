Here again is yet another movie Diane Lane where he cheats on her husband. Is this the only role he knows how to play? This time she put in 1969 and she cheats on her husband and blouse. I am not surprised because so very predictable. Then her husband gets mad and throws the letter. I would not be surprised if he joined the letter as well. I would not be surprised if she lay down with the ice cream man because this is a very boring movie. Then, after sending letters, she said sorry and she saw the blouse again. Duh. Then, while doing it with her, her son gets stung by the gypsum. My mom always tells me not to throw stones into a wasp nest. This mother's mother did not have time to tell her that she was too busy with the blouse.
