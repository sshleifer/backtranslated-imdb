<br /> <br /> The film "jar" is unique because the titular gnomes are actually good guys in this awful story of nature going awry. You see, these poor bullets were mutated in the pollution of evil people and do not mean to do anything bad, they're just bullet-balts and sharp teeth that eat meat and poisons are espresso, but bullets no less la. The real bad guys are the people, who either actively try to destroy our beloved balance, or overreact when they meet them. <br /> <br /> For example, take the scene where the guy puts on the full glove of bullets. They were just hanging out of a comfortable work glove when out of nowhere giant came to them, and they reacted instinctively, defend themselves and bite the guy. Now, instead of seeking medical attention for his sluggish mortar, this guy runs around his joker shouting like a fool, rubbing some very volatile chemicals, starting a fire, knocks a shelf on top of him, and he cut his own hands - then the fire and volatile chemicals mixed with his home exploded. How can you blame on the bullets? <br /> <br /> This movie depicts a portrait of people younger than favorable. The characters in this movie include the mute sheriff who hates everyone, the hick hick that means his dog, and the lump sidekick whose wife is at least forty-five years older than him. There are also a series of drunken youngsters <br /> <br /> that get attacked while copulating, and we have to see the thin-haired thin men '. Meanwhile, there is a guy who looks like a demon Leslie Neilson who sells "You do not have the authority to declare happy birthdays!" for some reason. Finally, this parade of awathsome rounded out to the guy from the classic MST3K "Pod People" whose face explodes after eating a slug-lace salad (another easy to avoid fate blamed on their useful, harmless bullets). /> People are described as greedy, stupid, racist, alcohol, and, in an unusual scene, as would have been violated. In the movie climatic scenes, the wicked people try to burn the bullets that cowering down in the sewers, Well, since they are idiots, people are successful in shaving up the whole earth. They only do more harm than the bullets ever made! <br /> If you hate people, and I know I do, you'll appreciate "jar". If you're a fan of bad movies, you'll also appreciate this crapfest from the director of "Pieces" and "Pod People". There are enough acts, unusual, logical drawings, special spiral effects, freeware scenes, and poor dubbing to keep your attention.
