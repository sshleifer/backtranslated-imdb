I've been a fan since his first album. This movie is a bad one. Performances, except for one by Rufus Wainwright and Teddy Thompson are simply awful. These by Mat Wainwright, Nick Cave, Antony, and Cocker Jarvis were particularly annoying. Even one of McGarrigle's sisters was ruined by this harmony called Mat Wainwright. <br /> I never saw my wife up and walked out of the room on a movie before and I found I quickly sent to their performance to go to the few interview interviews, which was also hard to watch due to the work poor cameras. There are many who could interpret Siren Cohen's songs, Jennifer Warnes, KD Lang, Billy Joel, Aaron Neville, and Willie Nelson come to mind, but those choices for this performance were just awful. <br /> <br /> Hoping that there will be another attempt to capture Leonard Cohen on film that will illustrate his insight, talent, and intelligence.
