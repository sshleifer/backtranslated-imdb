It's hard to believe that this is an end to Henry Fool. Difficult to believe that the director and the actors participated in both movies. While Henry Fool is worthwhile, witty, funny, grim fault is slow, boring, and does not go anywhere. Where does the understanding go? I'm decomposed. <br /> It's 10 years since I saw Henry Crazy and many of his dialogues and scenes are still alive in my memory. Faulty grim is painful to watch. This is not the fault of the actors, who is good (Parker Posey) or great (Jeff Goldblum) - the blame lies entirely with the plot, the dialogue, and even some of the filming (low budget has no excuse ). A great disappointment. <br /> <br /> Sorry, I could not pay attention to the plot, I was so bored, so disappointed ... if you enjoyed this one you can not enjoy Henry crazy many ... The two movies have absolutely nothing to do with each other ... there is no continuity of personality to the characters ... it's all a fond pastime fraud in Henry Crazy to watch the end. <br /> I change this now - Henry in some sort of prison with a Taliban?!?!
