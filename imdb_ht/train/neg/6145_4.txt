Although I saw "Gymkata" in a theater style back to '85, I could not remember anything in the scheme except for wave images of Kurt Thomas running and fighting against a series of rocks and deception regarding the finish. > <br /> After reading some of the other comments, I picked up a newly released DVD copy once again into the world of Gymkata. It seems that this is one of those films produced during the '80s that would go directly into video today. The movie stars movie Jim Kurt Thomas as Jonathan Cabot, recruited from the blue to infiltrate the nation of "Parmistan" to join and hopefully win the "game," a suicide bloodsport sponsored by the Khan who encouraged his people to not cry what sounds like "yak power." The purpose of the mission involves the Star Wars war system. Jonathan is trained in martial arts by Princess Rubali, who never speaks or leaves. Once trained will try to mix in with the locals by wearing a bright red sweater and shooter in blue and white. Needless to say Cabot finds himself running and fighting for his life along the stone streets of Parmistan, on his way to a date and destiny, with the game. Star Star, Kurt Thomas was ill served by Robert Clou director, who he looks never ever on the series. The so-called script is just that side of the incompetent. See other reviews for many runners at all. The city of crazies has a good moment, but is ultimately ruined by bad corrections. Fini ... meh. Still have the germ in a good action adventure here. A Hong Kong version of more vicious and fast action may be even very good.
