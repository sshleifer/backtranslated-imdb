This game was made by Sega. They were done by Sega I did not expect much, but I did not expect this junk either. For starters the camera angles work against you in this game. The motorcycle is your means of getting around. The motorcycle is the worst part of the game. Every time you run something you just stick and you do not move. You never fell on the bike or wreck for this matter. The main character hardly talks even though he has a voice that suits him. Graphics are terrible. You ride through trees on your bike. The camera makes the enemy's fate impossible. This game would not even be worth renting.
