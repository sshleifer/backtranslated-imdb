Honestly I can not understand why this movie rate so well here, nor why Bakshi himself thought he was his finest film. I'm a big fan of Bakshi's earliest work - particularly 'Lou Trafik' and 'Wizards', but frankly 'Wizards' (1977) was the latest film she was doing. Then he turned to the main, starting with the Lord 'Lord of the Rings' demons and then knuckling down with the sword and Sorcery heavyweight Frank Frazetta, for 'fire and ice'. <br /> <br /> What can I say? The story is some, the animation is TV quality - I emphasize it's remarkably worse than its 70's - and whereas 'Wizards' were real imagination, quirkiness, some gorgeous background art, and an underground , adolescent tenderness, 'fire and ice' is just designed for boys 14 years old, and with the intellectual curly of Robinson Robinson on Mars. <br /> Yes, if you loved the Gor books, you might like this. In my view, this was just another blip in the slip of quality after 'Wizards' from which Bakshi never recovered (though it did some TV lately justice lately) <br /> 4.5 from 10
