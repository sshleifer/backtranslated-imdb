This movie is terrible. Not offensive but very predictable. The film follows the life of a small town in the Mid-60. The father, the director of the school, is going through a mid-life crisis. Join a great teacher in the big city that begins to challenge her students' minds and some thought-provoking things, such as thinking for yourself. The principal does not agree with his teaching, but it's nice. You can connect the points. Her teen daughter (Winona Ryder wannabe Tara Frederick) is eating with the small town life and she wants to live. It gets some bad advice, hanging out with some bad boys and apparently family planning has not been taught at his school. Chokan! Seeing the director Paul Shapiro was mostly working on television, this film plays as a more adult version of a special post-school or a very special episode of one of the most Mundo sitcoms.
