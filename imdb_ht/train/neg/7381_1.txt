Well, first, Seagal's voice is armed over for 50% of the movie ... Why? Because apparently it has been rewritten the script and history as they have been shot and need to change their dialogue for continuation of history as they have multiple versions. From the very beginning, you just scratch yourself because the hops are not just troubling, but they make no sense. When I got to the end, I just scratched my head to cause the movie was so pointless and the finish did not even make sense. <br /> Avoid such an epidemic. This movie made me stop watching Seagal straight into video cinema to cause them to get worse and worse.
