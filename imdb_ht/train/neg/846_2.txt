This has to be, by far, the worst worst movie I've seen in the last 20 years. When I saw that Michael Madsen was in it I figured he might not be too bad a movie since he was in some pretty decent movie, and he was a very nice actor. WON! No one should waste their time on this movie. I quickly send to 80 percent of it and I do not feel that I missed something.
