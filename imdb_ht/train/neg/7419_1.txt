This movie was awful and an insult to the viewer. Stupid script, bad file, boredom boredom. <br /> <br /> In the usual tradition of Hollywood, the United States government is shown as always wrong. Communist-sympatizer nuts in Hollywood, most of them are like mute as a rocky box, like the lone Eugene McCarthy love and picturing him as leader in a vast movement. The truth is that at that time he was considered a marginal character who had been exploiting a legitimate concern of the Soviet Communists for political benefits. Oh yeah, and the U.S. brought about all those Nazi wrongdoers. Like Werner VonBraun, without whom we would have no space programs. He actually loved the Americans and became a big advantage in the country. But the irony is that the foolish people of Hollywood, a lot of people who are unknowingly living a fantasy existence, still believe that the government should run EVERYTHING and give us everything we want. And yet, this is the same government that they always show as a bad consumer in such films.
