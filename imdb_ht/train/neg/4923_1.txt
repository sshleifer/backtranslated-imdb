This has to be one of the worst movies I've ever seen. This film has nothing positive about it. Some of us actually love this movie! I saw a lot of Dracula movies and I loved everyone that I saw, but when I saw this movie I said to myself, "What's the hell of this?" What a stupid movie. Now they have Dracula become who he is because he is Judah. For those of us who do not know who Judah, he betrayed Jesus Christ and later he felt guilty he was hanging himself. You must be joking. This is the reason I dumbest ever heard why Dracula was wrong. Who asked for a reason anyway? What a piece of ** this movie is. Who came up with this excuse for a movie they should beat. Even the Dracula is awful. If you ever saw this movie you would not even think it was Dracula. Wow, Dracula 2000! Is this title supposed to impress me? Do not waste your time or money on this garbage.
