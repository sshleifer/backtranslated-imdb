The female lead was a terrible actress who made the whole movie mediocre. She smiled too much when she first went in front of the camera talking about her daughter. This should have been the police suspect it. I would have been consolate in identical situations. It seemed calm as for a mother who could not find her daughter. It was as if he did not even have the movie. Jennifer Aniston would have played the best part. And it would make a lot more money for such a controversial, important topic. Everyone else was excellent. I do not know where the lead actress is but I hope he has some lessons to act.
