I could not believe my eyes once I watched this movie. There is no point in it either then and without violence. Unlike other scary films that have been handled with a meaning in this film is just blood, gore, and killing one after another. This movie is not interesting at all, there is no meaningful plot or story line, nor has it an intelligence in it. The blood looks very fake and this movie in general is pointless. Do not even waste your time with it. It's just an hour or two of mindless violence. It has many scenes without fear of just plain riot. This is probably the worst horror movie I've ever watched out of all the horrors movie I've ever seen.
