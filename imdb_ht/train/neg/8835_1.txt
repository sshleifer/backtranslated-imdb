Before I watched this movie, I read a review here that states that this movie might be one of the best films ever! ha ha scene at the scene of the tension is growing well ... of the annoying characters of this movie. From the gibberish talk girl and trying to drown the little boy, to the killer just run over without notice (and who was the guy at the beach talking to the little boy !?). Things just seem to happen, and go unanswered in this movie. As I watched it seemed like the film went in one direction, then just did not go anywhere, but in a new direction ... and over and over ... <br /> <br /> The act is great, but the writing is terrible. Each character, in each scene, says or does something so incredible, unrealistic and the reactions of the fellow cast / expense are simply strange. There is no resolution of the problems developed throughout the film, making it confusing and finally a great waste time.
