Here's a review for people like me. This film is absorbed in the beginning of the end. I threw popcorn into the screen and resorted to a fun MSF2000. The horror scheme about fascinating luck and it depends on the sort of people who are supposed to be clever. The lead falls for a man and he does not reach him that he might get conned ????? And it's rich ???? And it is a famous psychologist ????? Come, people. He went into the bar at just the right moment when everyone was meeting talking about her conning ??? That was so scenic that he felt like slap in the face of even half-witted movie viewers. Rain people should insult. I also admit that I despise Mamet dialogue with the kind of passion that some people have for meat-eaters, war-starters, and fur-brushes. My hate is so complete that it challenges logic. But I'll give him a shot. That it does not suppose sound real is fine. I do not care. It's that everyone speaks the salt. Mamet can not create characters; All he can do is tell his voice about us relentlessly from different actors. No wonder his actor is so wooden. They're confused about everyone being the same character. (However, film later improved it.)
