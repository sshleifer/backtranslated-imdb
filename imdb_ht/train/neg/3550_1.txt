I run a group to stop comedy exploitation and I'm just over the past 2 months hearing their horror stories from comedians who tried to audition for, "Last Funny Stand." If they do not have a good silver, then they do not even get a chance of audition so much more than 80% of the comedians who turn up to reject them before they can show anyone that they have talent! If they do it at an audition, I said it's "pre-determined" if they get a second chance. So what the TV audience sees is not the best comic in the US. <br /> <br /> If the comics make it to the show, then many of them do not get IMDb credits. I know that because I made the credits for all 6 seasons, "Last Funny Standing" and I do not get paid for producing producers. It's really a shame. A month ago, I asked, "Last Funny Stand 7" on Facebook why the producers do not give IMDb credit and I was banned from Facebook page !!! I'm not a comedy so I do not have a personal pole in that. I just want people to know the truth. I do not like to see everyone exploit and that's why I helped the comedians. The comedians get exploited on HBO, BET, TvOne and other cable networks but NBC is a great THREE network so those in charge should be disappointed to allow this exploitation to happen.
