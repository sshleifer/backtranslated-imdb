This film is about a young scientist who creates a serum that re-animates the dead. He first used it on his brother when he shot dead in a drive. His brother then infects the other gang members. In some zombie scenes they saw very slowly and in other scenes they run very fast to make little sense. The act is mediocre but the story does not help the movie. The makeup consists of blood on the face of the zombies. The budget for this movie I'm sure was very limited. I believe that the film could best have made the story more original and a better budget. If you can not see a good zombie cops do not see this one.
