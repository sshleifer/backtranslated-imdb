I'm a Batman movie back and TV fan. I liked the show (new and old) and I loved all the movies. But this movie is not the same as some people who expect it to be. In my opinion, it is a big down. I think the problem was she had no drama. Batman: The Mask of the Phantasm and Batman Beyond: The Return of Joker has a lot of drama. and Batman & gentleman: Sub zero has some drama too. Also, I think this movie is for light for Batman. The only scenario that looks a little dark is the big fight and bog in the end. Anyways, it's a Batman movie okay. But I would just rent it.
