I saw this movie once, and I thought it was OK. Then my friend at work says "Look it again, it's best". So I did. And my surprise, she was the second person! There's a word limit, so I'll get the ball rolling here. The scrubbing scene was all so stupid. Why on earth would anyone WAIT trigger the explosion ??? - The characters here are even remotely removable. Not for the first time, not the second. <br /> <br /> -Oh, and the last time I checked, a car does not explode out of a single gun shot, nor can a great fire be laid out with a small fire extinguisher ... where the 3/10 viewers actually watch the movie ??? The camera is so unstable, I can barely tell what's happening. This opening scene with the robot had my stomach off-set, the rest of the movie was not much better. <br /> <br /> -The whole sniper. Brother McManus (from the "Boondock saint") rolled their eyes, it was so stupid. First, why was the guy planting his weapon where someone shot? In addition, why would it spend a lot of time cleaning the bullets, breaking, targeting and not getting injected, when there was so much disruption going on around him? -SAS RUNNING type instead of staying and fighting back ?????? Huh ????? Do the soldiers ... gay ... ??? I did not mean sound homophobic, but honestly, that scene was so ridiculous. <br /> <br /> -Too long for its own good, but too short for the amount of material stacked in it. Bigelow seems to think that the more action, the better. It seems that it is wrong-movie is all unneeded action scenes dropping into having to distract you from the lack of a central draw. I know Watchmen is the longest 163 minutes, but at least that movie did not drag. This movie, on the other hand, does, and for it, feels it again. <br /> <br /> The only good thing was Renner, who was satisfied at best. But make yourself a favor, just skip this, and do not give in to the hype.
