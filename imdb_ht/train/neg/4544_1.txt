This movie is just not worth your time. Its reliance on New-Age mysticism serves as its only semi-interesting distraction. The plot is one that has been re-circularing countless times. <br /> I was only encouraged to even spend time in putting in a comment when I noted that some tried to propose this drivel reputation. Motivation and objectivity are dubious, since they encourage you not to watch the movie cinema, but in its intentions message of New Age awareness. So, it should be well for some twenty to thirty Christian Evangelicals, or Islamic fundamentalists to vide in positive reviews about movies / TVs that support their views? In spite of poor quality of production, or lack of truth in any of its assumed historical bases? I hope not. <br /> I'm sure the followers are coming right behind me to say things to flowers about this movie, in spite of the truth.
