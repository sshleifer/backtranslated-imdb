In all movies (and I'm a movie graduate, if that's worthless to you), this is the worst movie I've ever seen. I know there are probably some people getting worse out there that I just have not seen yet, but I've seen that, and that's the worst. A friend and I rent it one night because Denise Richards was on the cover. Talk about being young and delayed. It's unbelievable! His role was incredibly small! How does it make it on the cover! IMDb does not even list it in his pornography. This movie was so bad, we wrote a little note in the video store when we returned it and slipped it inside the case. It reads something like "please save your more customers by having to view this complete and totally bad movie!"
