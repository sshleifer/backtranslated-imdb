The "Sexual Addiction Diary" is a minor attempt at a serious drama on sexual compulsiveness. Probably a movie marketing scam, this flicker film is a stylish shoot and a good throw and little others go for it. Underline, "Newspaper ..." would have us believe that our adult sex characters have the dumbest wife of the world, a stable baby on the side that has nothing better to do than to drop their underwear for her 'in his whims, and no work in spite of being a restaurateur. At best, this flicker could be good drama. At the worst, cheap softcore. "Newspaper ..." is neither silk nor anywhere in between. That's the one for the dump. (D-)
