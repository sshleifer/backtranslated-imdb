A bit sad and useless in duvet (duvet, but fluff). Badly scripted, with timely and timely dialogue. You do not care if the characters (indeed, though the actors themselves) live or die. Little favor or charm, little action, little point in the whole thing. Perhaps some of the range and settings are interested - these gaps between the frames of all the buildings can be true in the way life has lived. Meet the foundation is necessary and distracted, and the character Hoppalong Cassidy himself is both boring and inept.
