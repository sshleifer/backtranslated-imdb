There were many sex movies or movies giving bad reviews that I really liked. This was not one of them. <br /> It was overacted and used the camera technique that made me feel like I was watching a soap opera. It was ludikrously predictable and take most of the movie to go away then let you ask "that's it?". Once I decided not to take the movie too seriously and look at her from a purely point of view she became more enjoyable. This is one movie that would wound up on MST3000 if it was still over.
