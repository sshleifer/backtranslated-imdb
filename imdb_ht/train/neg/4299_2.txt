This is one of these awful, sex-driven B-movies that could not be played anywhere near a theater. Women running around dressed in scantily clad band "Bunny", a very fat woman is the touchdown of many jokes, and they all work in the restaurant in an old room man, who has an oddball son (Jim Hanks , who of course Tom Tom), whom the man wants to get "laid." Hanks is actually sort of good, but this movie goes nowhere and has no point. One must ask why he even did? But because of Hank's performance with a fun moment (but not more than a few), he has received a stellar "2" from 10. I think I was being nice, though.
