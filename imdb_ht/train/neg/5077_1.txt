It was pointed out in a post now deleted from another IMDb user that anyone might see the "Medusa Touch" should be warned about a scene of surprising reminiscent of Sept. 11, 2001 in New York City's terrorist attack. But I hope anyone reading this will consider this warning. Despite an exciting daylight (producer Elliott Kastner produced "Harper" and "Goodbye to Long"; co-producer Arnon Milchan co-produces Oscar-nominated "Confidential" and John Briley's screenwriter had an Oscar for "Gandhi") and a International cast, I found the "Medusa Touch" to be a heavy-handed, unintentionally laughing riot. It was a bad, horrible writing and messing act. He tried to capitalize on the genres of telekinetic genre. The movie fails on counting counties. Please consider "Carrie" and the "anger" (both directed by Brian DePalma). There were two fun and exciting thrills that faced the same matter.
