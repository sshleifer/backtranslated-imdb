I love Chris Rock, but I feel it is wasting in this movie. The idea of ​​remaking the sky can wait is good, but the filmmakers follow the plot of this turkey too close. When Eddie Murphy pulled Doolittle's doctor and Professor Nutty, he re-made them totally - so they became Murphy movie / car, not only warm rumors. That's why they succeeded. If Chris did the same, that could be a better movie. Laughs of the few come when he's doing his standup routine - so he might as well have made a concert movie. It would also be much funnier if the white man whose body he lived was a truck driver or hillbilly. So why does Hollywood keep junk like this? Because people go to see it - because they love Chris Rock. So give Chris a decent script and give us the best movies! Noticed film that was not good in the first place!
