From the opening and stage dialogue, I knew I knew I was in for a rafting train. Did not want to look, but he could not turn back. If it was not for the best eye candy in this film, I would give a star. The fact that the interaction between character and behavior behaviors was so far sought, added by poor direction and terrible stories to make this film nothing more than a low budget disaster. Money is definitely not a necessity to make a good movie. But this movie failed so horribly there was no chance to unwind. <br /> <br /> If you were stuck out of the woods, your child's best friend died of an unknown illness, other friends dying around you, trapped in a strange place, what would you do? <br /> <br /> A.) Run away from everyone and try your luck on your own. B.) Having sex with your girlfriend's friends. C.) Take a warm bath to relax your legs to include your legs. D.) Bash yourself your child's best friend and life-long break with a shovel. E.) All of the above. <br /> According to Eli Roth, none of the answers are far off. In fact, all are possible and well represented in Cabin Fever. The total lack of reality and logical attempts to explain what people would do in traumatic situations to launch this movie in the bun bin in your local store. Stay away. Stay away.
