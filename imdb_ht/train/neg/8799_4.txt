Kudos of patience at Paul Muni, who spent hours and hours in the makeup room every day to watch the part of Zola. Muni was one of the biggest stars in the 1930s, and I wonder how many people today -pump than classic movie films - know nothing about it. It was a giant in the business for at least a decade. He could win the Academy Awards for this performance, which would give him two in a row, as he had to play Louis Pasteur the previous year. My own opinion is that while he was trending over a bit, I still thought he was one of the great actors in the "Golden Age." Whatever part he plays; You've riveted the screen watching it. <br /> <br /> Unlike the role of Pasteur, I thought this story hit a little too much of what we saw in the last 60 years: go further to make a liberal hero. Even in 1937, Hollywood could not suppress his disobedience to the police or the military, here's a point telling us how these "corrupt" organizations are. Creators just love it when challenging and beat officials. In this sense, this movie is a way to its day since we've seen this great time since the 1960s. <br /> However, it must have noted the facts to support this story. It also does not in any way reduce Zola's achievements as a social reformer, to eliminate for certain misfortunes. Good for him! I wish they had spent more time showing, than focusing on one trial.
