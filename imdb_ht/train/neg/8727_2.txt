Let me start from saying I can enjoy just about any bad Italian horror films or jungle exploding cats from the 1970s. Seriously. This one was downright horrible. There are too many elements that Martino tries to inject and any of them work (except for this croc-go-wood) very well at all. Some ignorant Westerners, of course, who set up a resort in the jungle somewhere. I do not even remember where it takes place ... how sad is that ... Basically, people come to the resort to see their native tribes and ceremonies, but eventually they are angry 'Alligator God' in the river that time That's the amount going on a rampage, killing some vacationers and some tribes. Sounds good, yes? Well, do not get your hopes. There is minimal violence up to the end, the special effects are so bad it was like a kindergarten to make them and the love story is thrown in sad. <br /> There is seriously a few scenes where it appears to put up an underwater camera in a pool and throw a game gaming, like an arrow, into the water and that would suppress the gator attacked. I do not cry. In another specially crafted effect, a Matchbox van is targeted by the incredible sinking Gator, which all of a sudden is five times the size of a van. (Some minutes ago, he was only big enough to eat someone, but now he's got a big cargo van ...) It's really pathetic. Only the other flick I can think about when the effects were so bad I was pulling out of the story was Captain Mattei Bruno, "Rat," what with the plastic rats on conveyor belts and those who did not fear. /> <br /> Normally I would say anything Sergio Martino was a solid must-see but this one is a must-pass. Waste time and definitely not worth buying for the price of $ 15 + stickers from No shame. This is a shame. <br /> 2 out of 10, kids.
