Oliver Hardy wakes up with a hangover and soon learns that her uncle will come to see new wife and baby's. The problem is, they do not exist - Ollie apparently made them up! So it's up to him and his pals to locate a lady with a baby that will agree to pose as his family. <br /> <br /> This is not a particularly unique story idea, as I've seen at least a couple of other silent shorts and this exact draw. The best of these was Bobby Vernon's NOT left me. It's better than one TOO MANY - probably much of this was due to a decade later - when comedy became a bit more sophisticated and less counted on free sluggish. Now, I'm not against physical comedy, but in some slapstick films, people start shooting wildly weapons, kick and strangle each other, etc. with little provocation. Unfortunately, at the end of one TOO many, it's exactly what they do. None of it makes sense and it was as if they would just run out of story ideas. <br /> <br /> Overall, not exactly an important milestone in entertainment. There's just not enough worthy regulation watching it unless you're a fan of obsession fans like myself.
