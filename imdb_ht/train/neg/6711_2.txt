1993 was the year. This was long before Phillip Seymour Thomas won an Oscar. Who knew I would be supplementary to a movie with him? I was actually an extra paid "My Boyfriend Return," shot in a neighborhood in Austin called Georgetown, TX. The original title was "Johnny Zombie" (Thanksgiving producers had a change in heart!) I was in the theater scene. I ran out to watch the movie the day he was released in the theater. It is more of a comedy than a horror movie. But ... for a good laugh, you might want to check it out. Nothing is even close to "Dawn of the Dead" or even the "Shaun of the Dead" quality, but the cheese factor is good enough. kiao
