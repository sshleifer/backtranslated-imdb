If you like a soap opera soap show this is for you, as far as I'm concerned it does not work for me and after watching 3 episodes I just can not watch it again. It is boring and slow and for a show that the timeliness is based on 100,000+ years ago if you base it on the Galactica battlestar timeline to the earth to make sure you seem to have the same thing around like the years 100,000 old Chevy Truck drives down the streets and people watching the 100,000-year-old popular brand name LCD LCD TV. It also goes even with the rest of the sets as well on the show, there is just so much of today stuff that involves it does not neglect, I think they could do a lot better in a job to get around that problem And yes galactica battlestar was some of the same issues but not as bad as bad. As fare as the rest of the show it is not nearly as good as BSG was and it is a poor late end ??
