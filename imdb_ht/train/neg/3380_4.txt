Michael Bennett and Broadway show Nicholas Dante run for years, but proof of his power and charisma is lost in this movie adaptation, most likely to stem from the choice of directors (Richard Attenborough, as far as B-way as you would can be found) and lead actor (Michael Douglas, who plays a director choreography-like a corporate multiple attorney). The thin story, on a grueling audition for a Broadway show that gets into a therapy session for actors-dancers-musicians, is pushing right up on us, with loud, brazen brush talent. There is nothing that modulates or subtle, particularly a ridiculous subplot on an ancient dancer returning to the theater and head up with Douglas old-flame. Excessive hopes are full of promise and grief, but the personal stories of bitterness are a little embarrassing; This match, Attenborough's sluggish rhythm, spells disaster, and even the most popular songs now fail to break into the artificial packaging. * 1/2 from ****
