When I started watching this movie I saw the dude from Buffy, Xander, and figured out how beautiful it was that he always made a living acting in movies. Now, a strange movie I can stand up to, giving them a good dose of strangely as for example David Lynch movies, twin picks, lost freeways etc. And you sort of to be in the mood for one. This one however has made me mockingly remember the crazy websites about having on the theory the plot that makes absolutely no sense. I mean to come on the Nazi people who conspire with America to make a layman Trinity of evil power? I was surprised they did not mention the hollow ground in this movie with Hitler flying saucers and lizard people. Maybe if you were 60 grams of heroine and this movie she would make some sort of sense, but seriously I do not condemn drugs as I do not condemn this movie. It should be burned, shredded and forgotten just so good ol 'Xander might get another act to act. He did not act him though, that was OK, but the script just did not make any sense. Padon.
