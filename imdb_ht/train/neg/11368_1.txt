This movie was more effective in persuading me to a Zionist plot than a Muslim. And I'm Jewish. <br /> <br /> Someone goes to school journalism? Read an editorial? Freshman years speech? These alarmist statements, presented in a palatable manner, might prove compelling. But do not offer no recognition of possible opposing arguments, either resistant (or any of the) solutions, some sources and each of the dubious origins, make the argument an ineffectual diatribe. <br /> <br /> And greeting says - I would not want anyone to let the theater any belief in this racist claptrap. <br /> A good lesson for me - and hopefully a precautionary story for you - actually read about a movie before seeing it.
