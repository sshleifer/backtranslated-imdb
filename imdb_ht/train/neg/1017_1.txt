Oh, I love God. This was terrible. There are bad, then there was this. This movie makes no sense at all. It runs all over the map and it is not clear what it says at all. The music seemed like he was trying like Batman. The fact that 'Edison' is not a real city, take away. Since I live in Vancouver, watching this film and recognizing all the places that made it unbearable. Why did not they make it a real city? Just writing was 'Tillman' in which John Heard did a fantastic job. She was the only actor who played her role most truly and is not on the top and campy. It was actually a shame to see John Heard play as a big bad guy and a lot of time screen, and the movie has a smashing. Too bad. Hopefully an important person will see it, and at least give John Heard credit where credit is due, and hire him as a bad guy again, which is where he should be. on the list A.
