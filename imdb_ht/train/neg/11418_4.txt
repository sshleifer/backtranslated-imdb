Joel Schumaker is directing the script he wrote and has a Georgetown degree group that is confronted with adult life situations. The story line is a creepy disorder, but some scenes are actually good. There are a lot of talent wasted and time here. The cast is more impressive than the movie. Featured are Demi Moore, Rob Lowe, Judd Nelson, Andre McCarthy, Emilio Estevez, Ally Sheedy and Mare Winningham. The most remarkable were McCarthy and Moore. Lowe is quite obnoxious. Coming to age is not so easy to damn.
