I chose this DVD to store the dollar. The DVD was about 2 for $ 1 shelf, but since it was Michael Madsen in it, I thought that since I've never seen the movie I bought it anyway. <br /> I must say that I did not like the movie. The film played more like a documentary or an advertisement for religion than anything else. I found that using the director of flashback did not add to the story line for me. I'd rather see the story line in chronological order. I will not send him as one of the other commentators, but It may be quite a while before I would consider watching this movie again. <br /> Who knows, since it was Michael Madsen's first movie, maybe it might have some archival value in some future dates.
