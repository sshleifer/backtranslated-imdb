There were so many films I could not sit in. I made it to Battlefield Earth has no problem. But this, this is one of the worst movies every time they have to do. I understand Whoopi Goldberg tried to get involved in it. I do not blame it. I would feel ashamed to have this on a resume. I belive it is a rare occasion when almost every gag in a movie falls flat on her face. Well it came here. Not to mention the SFX, look for the Dino and the control cables hanging from it behind the end !!!!!! Half of the movie I was always looking for a plot. I never found one. Save yourself the problem of renting this and save 90 minutes into your life.
