Have you been surprised by Sandra Bullock's performance in Miss Congeniality, and I decided to give Murder By Numbers a shot. While they are decent in quick, self-eradication, Mr. Bullock's performance in the "serious" role (see Hope Float, Speed ​​2, 28 days) leaves much to be desired. Her character is at the same time omniscient, confused, and sexually maladjusted (the sub-plot of Sandra's past comes across as useless filler that does little develop her character already deep). Both young boys have been decent performance, although their legal expertise and my-assault expertise can be communicated by stupid mistakes called "We Made It!" Chris Penn as the all-too-obvious suspect is wasting here, as is Ben Patlin's signature / partner partner / love interest. <br /> <br /> *** Spoilers front *** Mediocre acts aside, the largest flaws can be drawn to a television-to-week scheme that never has you totally purchased by the murder motifs in place At first, and as mentioned, the stupid mistakes (vomiting up a rare food on the scene of murder, an all too practical and framing of the school janitor, the two boys hanging together in public, a love interest for friction practices , etc. etc.) cause the look to go from being intrigued by being bored and humiliated by the bandits. The finish was forbidden "By Numbers" and was probably the most disappointing aspect of the movie. Using the current-cliché tactic of almost showing the scenic scene at the start of the movie, and then completing the audience in how we arrived at the moment, the ultimate surprise performers do not have one and missed any of the so-called intelligence films to pretend to come to its conclusion. A concept is a bit promising, but poorly executed and weak in almost every way. * from ****.
