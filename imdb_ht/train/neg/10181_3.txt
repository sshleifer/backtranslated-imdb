This movie is so bad it's funny. It's Scott Backula star as some coaches, but that's not important, what's important is the big black fellow who plays 1st base. The first it has to be at least 75 years old, always still playing Minor League Baseball, second he starts out the movie in the outside despite being unable to walk, let alone run. Coincidentally baker's coach moves him first to cite the fact that when he tries to run it remains at the same place for too long a period of time. Backula shows more brilliant coaching strategies at the end of the film, (SPOILER), saying his star player "downtown" hit a home run, clearly "downtown" to see this as a good move. He hit the house running and won the game for his team, a minor league squad played the Twins who was the class of the students in the movie. Now, if only Tony Muser, manager of the Royals, should be as smart as coaching as Backula and telling his players simply striking a home run in each of the rods, the Royals could never end a left-alone guardian he lost a game.
