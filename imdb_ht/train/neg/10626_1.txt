This documentary is based on sponge cake as soon as you place any REAL evidence on its integrity to sink in a great pile of crap for example Bart Sibrel claims to have had many illumination sources because the shadows appear to be crossing if that could not have had two or more shadows for each object when Apollo 11 went to Van Allan radiation belt to pass the 30 min by 90 min to claim in the documentary and received a more dose of radiation in a x ray. <br /> <br /> Seriously doing some research findings that really happened by leaving this pile of crap in a documentary mold to your opinion of what really happened
