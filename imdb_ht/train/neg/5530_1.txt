In the numerous issues with this movie, the worst is continuity; and re-editing it on VHS for a collegiate cable channel many years ago, I tried to figure out what exactly went wrong. What seems to have happened is that they actually build a longer film longer and then cut it down to watch the theater standards. How much more? They fill in all the holes in the plot as we have it would require three more hours of narrative and developmental character - especially to the fact that the movie we do is just to slow down and take it seriously for seriously. <br /> This staggering; What were the Halperins might have tried to accomplish here? The previous film, "White Zombie", was a successful budget attempt to duplicate the monster monster Universal Studios monsters (Momi, Dracula, etc.), and as these closely attach to the zombie mythology that people in North America would know from popular magazines. <br /> <br /> The revolt of zombies, in contrary, seems to have been intended as some allegories for the policies of modern warfare. This would not only explain the opening, and the change of Dean Jagger's character in a megalomaniac, but it also explains why the zombies are not actually doing much of the movie, besides standing around, looking awesome, and waiting for orders - Only The allegous soldiers, not the undead cannibals we all have come to love and hate in zombie films. <br /> I am equal to any of my influences for modern wars and policies - but I think a movie should be fun first, and only later, perhaps, education. And definitely - a movie about zombies would be about zombies. <br /> <br /> Surely one of the most rare movies in Hollywood's films, but not one I can recommend, even for historical value.
