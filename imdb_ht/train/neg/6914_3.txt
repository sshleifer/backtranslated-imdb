I saw this film shortly back (while working on a trailer for the movie production company) and it was tERRIBLE. Hewitt is mediocre at best, Hopkins's phone performance (but still lies away from Hewitt at the scene together) and Alec looks bored. Believe in this: you should avoid this movie like the epidemic if it ever gets released. It seems to go on forever as the tired draw unfolds at a snail's speed. It is unfunny relentless, the cinematography is wrong and the direction is pedestrian. Alec Baldwin should go to film school if he plans to run again. In terms of his acting, his character is totally irritable, making it impossible to root for him. Dan Ackroyd is very funny with the surprising makeup of the jury near the film's end is beautiful, but this film is just plain terrible.
