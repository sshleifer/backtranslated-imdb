This movie was on-hyped way. A lot of viewers, who thought this was "amazing" must have been in old school cinema, to cause the movie is all set in the past. At first I thought the movie was just showing something in the past, so I was hoping to fade like a lighting like the characters passed, but it just will be. Basically this was a movie trying to mix the future with the past, and the 2 does not mix very well in this movie, even with special effects. You can actually see blue screen the actors were working with. There are too many movies out there that do exactly what this film has to do, so there is no reason for criticism of this film hype to say "it's the greatest movie ever to do". It's just crap on a stick. He also did not help that the story line was sooo wrong. I do not understand why Hollywood agreed to this movie was produced, and I do not understand how actors / actresses in this movie are willing to be in a movie like this. It's almost as if everyone read the script and forget to print it fine ... "It'll all be done on a computer." This was a movie that should be on a movie network, because nothing about this movie was revolutionary. I am very angry with myself to pay the money to see this. Whatever you do, do not waste your time and money on this movie today or tomorrow.
