Quite frankly it seemed like seven hours of boredom as well. What is it? What about Will Smith that I just can not stand anymore? I guess it just seems too hellbent about being taken seriously and get an Oscar. I understand how this bias is, but unless it has undergone some new lessons I can never see it have one. It's a great name and therefore generally confused with being a talented and diverse actor. It's just not. I give him credit for trying so hard, and they could weep in the drop of a hat. That's about it. Seven pounds were kind of an eyeroller for me, right from the start. The call 911's suicide did not intrigue me in any way. I was not curious to know why she was called to suicide herself. There was absolutely no surprises. The best I can say is that Will Smith and Rosario Dawson have some decent on screen chimi. Also, I do not know her name, but the mypanic woman did an excellent job and her role as a scary wife and beating. Woody Harrelson had very limited time screens, but I'd say he stole the show whenever he was over. <br /> At all, just a lot of runs in the unoriginal mill. I could not help ask myself all the way why I care about any of these people. Never once felt sorry for 'Tim / Ben'. He killed himself with a jellyfish? Was the only survivor of a human injury 8? Geewiz..didn't see any of that comes ... <br /> <br /> 5/10 is nice to generate.
