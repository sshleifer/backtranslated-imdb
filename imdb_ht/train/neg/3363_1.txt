The original movie (dated 19) did not show any "monster", it just suggests scary "things", this version however shows all aspects of a "sick minded" patient, including the special effects . <br /> <br /> The "Mystery", as presented in the original movie, was the most feared part: one simply did not know what was causing strange things to happen . When they show the figure in the "old man", this Mister disappeared. Even worse: special effects (crying kids are facing) is ridiculous. This is a stupid remark, too obviously spectacular even must be closed as frightening as the original
