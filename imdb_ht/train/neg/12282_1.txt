This was one of the most boring "Sinister" movies that I've ever seen. A young college has a nightbreak epidemic that includes spirits in Alcatraz. Try to deliver a mix of "Elm Street Nightmare" and standard vampire fare in the form of a video video bad video 80s, this movie has been blocked full of bad acting and a slow moving story. Although, as a bad, and often radio movie (digging those mullets with the horrible dialogue), it would be good stuff for bullies for an episode of Mystery Science Theater 3000. Do not be fooled by the proud mention of the movie being the 1987 winner of the Silver Scroll Award by the Academy of Sisi, Fanatas, and Film Fiction, or Devo contributed to the band, or Tony Basil had a part of the movie. It's a giant disaster, though one and a few followers (see the other IMDb comments for this movie).
