I downloaded this movie yesterday through a Quality website was a quality! I watched the movie with high expectations (though I knew it was a flop), especially as the movie has superstar Amitabh Bachchan playing the role of a rogue. Even though at least actors like him would do some value in their roles .But unfortunately Mr. Bachchan failed to impress as this villain proved that nobody can compete with the AMJAD KHAN magic trial of the RGV re-lining the past to succeed royally! Sholay, the old one is an important milestone in American movies and an all-star cast, cultural dialogue, stylish movies and a brilliant band that is still a hit and present generation too. A good actor such as Ajgan Devgan's Ajax was wasted and performance was average.Prashant Raj, a new one does not know what acting is. Nisha Kothari has proven he is one of the worst actress we have and I do not know how it is still in the RGV team Urmila & Abhishek seen in a song with no excitement and passion Mohanlal tried to better and work the Susmitha Sen was my good somehow to love it working in this movie It was a total carnage of the original Sholay
