I wanted to set up with a lot of spring-spring action films, but in general this was due to the fact that most of them have reasonable rules (ie fresh special effects, exciting twists, funny comics, Steve Buscemi, etc.). This movie, however, had no of this. All we got was the cheap thrill in several minutes of Eva Longoria's fragments (a problem in Maxim is cheaper than a movie ticket). There is a nasty shortage of trace, suspense, back story, character development, continuity, etc. I would get in specifics but quite frankly I've already-perhaps wishing to forget most of the movie. The whole time I was in the theater, I was kicking myself for not just spending the afternoon watching an epic 24 on DVD Save your money on this one, as. Unless you really, really, really like Eva Longoria's cleansing.
