He allows her friends to come in and suddenly she's all right to use the profanity as long as she's not in front of the kids. This is a sad state of affairs regarding gangster rap. You knew where this film was titled. <br /> <br /> I literally laughed at the end when Bassett accompanied her son's funeral burial, saying that while his life was cut short at age 24, he became a man .

That scene in the classroom tells a teacher as a sanitation worker, he will earn more than the teacher is a perfect example of what goes to our school. Lack of utter and utter respect for the teacher. East Coast, rival western gang rap rivalry never explained completely.
