My husband and I bought the Old School Sesame Street DVD for our daughter and I must say, I do not let her watch the new episodes on TV because I find all the annoying characters. Baby Bear and Telly? OMGosh, how nasty and useless haze can someone think of for the 'skits'? Elmo? Give her a rest by all her love kids, once again, annoying and not teaching my kids ANYTHING. Mr. Nude? what a rejection. I think once I turn the 'new' show on it, read and I've left dumber than before. The show was definitely taking a wrong turn. I remember Yip Yips, Kermit's Breaking News, 1-2 2 The Little Doll, the Mumford Magician, Bert and Ernie, the Grover Waiter, all the great EDUCATIONAL sculptors at Old School SS Sesam Street suffered a direct hit of boredom and dumbness since Jim Henson in the 1990's. The show is no longer the educational, interactive and interactive educational it uses. I find the new versions simply annoying annoying and full of useless non-educational brabber. How to go to SSS producer / writer is yet another cartoony show for parents sitting non-creative, non-exercising their children in front of them to get out of their hair. For every producer / writer: I suggest you whip out the old muppets and start gluing content similar to those in the first Sesame Street. Lord knows I'm sure not want my baby to talk like Baby Bear or Elmo.
