Yes there are great performances here. Unfortunately, they came to the context of a film that does not seem to have a sign of what it is doing. During the first 45-60 minutes all of the music takes place as a realistic performance. Immediately, about an hour, the characters, until that point, have always spoken to each other, suddenly start singing each other. For more convenience things, a little further, from nowhere, they actually do about 15 minutes of singing-in dialogue, then seem to drop that idea and move on to something else, like a The number that starts at a jazz club and a drummer with two electric guitars suddenly turns into a completely orchestral piece with a massive string string section. On top of all this inconsistency in how to use the music, it is inability to clear the composer actually writing music in the style that is supposedly described. While the first couple of pieces made of Imitate the 1950 Motown Year, the rest of the movie is just (bad) Broadway musical shows. Then there is the biggest silliness off of a group to make a mockery family of Jackson and Eddie Murphy morphing from Little Richard James Brown Lionel Richie. When she started channeling Stevie Wonder I could not help laughing loudly. This was clearly one of those films that made me appreciate how little time I have the earth and hated that I wasted two hours in watching this movie.
