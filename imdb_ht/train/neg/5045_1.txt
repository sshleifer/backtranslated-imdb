Claustrophobic Angle Camera That Does Not Help The Movie: Too Few Only Vaccines Which Most Most Of The Time To Get The Lowest Feel Half Feel Of The Missing Movie (Which Cut The Screen), because there seems to be significant action going on, but you can not see them. There is any way already too much confusion in the movie, so watch what makes it worse and does not contribute to visual artful. <br /> I love artfully doing movies and original camera works. I can handle deep and slow movies. But this one is trying too hard to be something weird and failed in my opinion painfully. There is nothing to find attached, to any of the characters, because they have not worked out quite enough. To work out the more necessary characters, than just custom minutes long minutes, at least with this set of script + directors + actors. I wonder if some of the act is not so good is due to the script and directors or actors. <br /> I'm going to stay away from film both written and directed by Le You for sure in the future. <br /> What an annoying movie even for someone who would be interested in this part of history, and for someone who spent time in Shanghai.
