... and in * there is no * way as clean, logical, and understandable as in the picture of this sumptuous Hollywood click tweeted tune. <br /> I'm 27, and I spent 16 years in my life struggling with delusional phobias and paranoid delusions. Like the main character of the film, I was successful primarily because of logic: because I kept thinking about them and about keeping delusion away from reality, and knowing what was really going on and what was not. In the end, I was really successful because of medicines, by the way, but I certainly escaped madness because I knew before I was taking medication the difference between what was real and what was not. So I feel I can tell you that this film is a total fraud. Not only does he cheat with the story of the main character (who was not faithful to his wife, who was bisexual - something really important here), but especially, it shows a comfortable, appreciated look at schizophrenia - which is totally lacking the point. <br /> <br /> Schizophrenia is a structure yourself, not a disease. An schizophrenic * by * a "normal man with a disease", it is a person from early in view and feeling things different from most people: for him, things like time, space, and personality people are not solid things. It feels low, it can change, it can mutate, and maybe even disappear. To cope with this, a schizophrenic has a wealthy, imaginative, world-class interior that "normal" people do not expect - but it has been trapped in it because it can not relate to most people, and his world becomes poorer poor until it ends in an empty, delusive end dead. <br /> <br /> This is very different from what's shown in this "cure" ridiculous, worn-jerk movie. It should be very frightening. People other than the main character should appear strange, weird and absurd, as in the Lynch's "Eraserhead", for example. There would be * really * impressive, weird, gross hallucinations, because that schizophrenia is all about. It's not about * details *. <br /> I mean, look at "nude lunch", "Highway Object", read P.K. Dick "Martian Tan-Split" or "Ubik", watch "The Cell", "Perfect Blue", "Black City", or play "Alice McGee's Alice" on PC, and you can have a vague idea of ​​what it's like. Do not watch the film "feel good" of the month, with banal situations, clearing characters and visuals, and stinging trim traces. The "Cell" is the most accurate film on top of a schizophrenic, its vision and its inner consistency - it is violent, weird, confusing, and very, very scary. <br /> <br /> Again, Schizophrenia is not about the details, it's not a clean, tricky tune trick for you. She jumps into your face and will not let you go: wall falls apart, people turn into strange hostile creatures, you feel like you go back in time, you're not sure you're who you think you are, everything feel it. strange, abnormal. Believe me, this is more than what's shown in this soap-like melody
