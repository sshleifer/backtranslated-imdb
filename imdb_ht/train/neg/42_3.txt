In the three titles from Jess Franco found their way to the Nasty DPP's Official Video List (Devil Hunter, Bloody Moon and Woman Behind Bars) this is perhaps the least worthy of notoriety, being a dreadfully dull merry clownker matte very small little by little amazing gore, a free rape scene, and naked loads. <br /> <br /> Gorgeous blonde Ursula Buchfellner plays movie star Laura Crawford who kidnapped by a gang of kidnapped captives and taken to a remote tropical island inhabited by a wild tribe worshiping the 'devil of God' that lurks in forests (a great, nude, swollen-eyed native who loves to eat the hearts of nubile female sacrifices). Applying Laura's agent to deliver a ransom of $ 6million, brave Mercenary Peter Weston (Al Cliver) and his virtual green pilot trip to the island but encounter problems when bad guys try a double cross. During the confusion, Laura rescues to the jungle, but runs straight into the arms of the native island, who offers her up in the gods. Franco steals in its usual torture style with this ridiculous effort and its unusual commercial brand: spit gore, nuclear cinema, quick zoom, many crotch shots, out of focus imagery, sound effects awful, and shingle-fisted. The result is a terrifying mess that is a real struggle to sit in from start to finish (It took me a couple of sessions to finish the stuff), and even before the sight of the appetizing Buchfellner of all of natural glory it is not enough to make me review this movie in a hurry.
