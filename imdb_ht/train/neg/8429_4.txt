This film would not offer anything new to a genre that has traditionally portrayed the history of religious beliefs by the 20th Century / Pre-WWII politics of India, where the British and modern traditions are bad and authentic but honest and true Indians are good. Surely such cliche's reputation in the British rather than now. <br /> <br /> Apart from the drama that combines the second part of the narrative film is predictable, the act is pedestrians and two dimensions, and eventually in direct and inimaginable. <br /> The story really needs to be flesh out and would certainly have benefited from another half an hour of screen time giving the characters and narrower more depths and giving the viewer something to feel some investment in. <br /> At all, rather uninspiring. Oh and Linus Roache just can not do tragedy - go cross-eyed and emotional pain just do not work for me!
