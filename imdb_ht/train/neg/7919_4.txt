I found myself very caught up in this movie, at least at the start, and any credit I provided this movie is Lacey Chabert, it was fantastic !! But that's where it ends. I seem to be very good at figuring out who the assassin, and I love it when a movie is able to fully inflate me, but I felt out and out lying, they are always taking you in one direction and Then suddenly they decided to go in a completely different direction to the end, they did not give any hits to it all, that does not lie that writing very bad and planning, someone did not think of all! <br /> I felt the movie would be best if they were stuck in the plot that the lead you on, they also seemed to no answer, why Jane (Mary) burned home to the teacher. <br /> It's a great pity as I felt it started out as a relatively good movie.
