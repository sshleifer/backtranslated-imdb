I simply give this a three because it fulfilled what my buddies and I hope she would do: enjoy. <br /> I was not stupid enough to rent this thought it would be a zombie movie up there with love in Romero or Fulci, but I rent it for being a laugh. <br /> If you are looking for a movie for entertainment, or a movie make you shake your head off embarrassment, go for it. This is perfect for junior- "Mystery Science Theater" fans, but the only downside is that it is so bad, it makes fun of itself. <br /> I personally, think it is a shame to relate to this in any other Hollywood title that we can know, because when a movie absorbs like this, it has its own genre.
