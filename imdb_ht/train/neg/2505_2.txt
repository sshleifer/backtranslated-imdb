I've seen enough of both Little Richard in interviewing and performing with the poor Pigeonholed Leon's performance in these 50s / 60s pics of music pics that Leon was not the right actor for this role. Leon was as straightforward as David Ruffin in their temptation, but failed to fully take the sense of Little Richard in this movie. <br /> <br /> Miguel Núñez Actor played Little Richard in "Why hurt in love?" It was a much more appropriate choice, it was pulling over the powerful but weakness character of the musician. <br /> <br /> If their performance is compelling then the movie will be as good. And this is what happened here. Glossed on or missing entirely is the LR forest of homosexuality and voyeurism. What are the "temptations" did well to capture the band's growth, warts and all, this movie lacks a wide mark. <br /> <br /> What goes on with Robert Townsend director who started in well with the "Shuffle in Hollywood"? He is a talented, humorous guy but he has not delivered anything near this first effort.
