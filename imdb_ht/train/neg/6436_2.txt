I'm kind of someone, so I gave this movie a 2 instead of a 1. It was without a doubt the worst movie I've seen in a long time. There were plenty of drawings and the most interesting areas that touched upon what Jesus really wanted us to know, glossed over and instead we gave the visual heights of sadistic punishment inflicted on our heroine (Arquette). All the total crucifix in the first 15 minutes would be more humane in both his character and the audience. The act was barely there and the direction was inspired. And, if I saw one more drip in water or pigeon flying toward the camera, I could start screaming stronger than Patricia.
