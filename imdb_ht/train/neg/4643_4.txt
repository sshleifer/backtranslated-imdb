I rent this movie on DVD. I knew that the movie would not live up to what he promised me on the back of the case, but once I saw that Leatherface (Gunnar Hansen) was in it, I was renting it. It starts very well, with the premise that the mourning films have been revealed on cables. However, the main character has nothing about it to make you feel sorry for it too, and at the end of the movie really let you hang. There are ways too many questions unanswered. There was a big scene at the end that totally took me by surprise, but in general this is a lot of sub movies, but I guess it was worth the $ 3.99 rental fee.
