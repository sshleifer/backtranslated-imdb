Pretty prequel disappointing the first two films, he has no suspicion of the first or the interest of the second. By concentrating on the men who 'run' the cube, it basically takes away any of the essence of tension inside the cube, as we simply do not care about the characters inside. Many of the film is simply boring, and it only gets really awful with the introduction of superior glass eyed and green-eyed seafront. And, though, it just goes down to the top-top hilarity. The finish is fitting though, tied it back to the first one in an indirect way. The script is awful, mediocre in the best act, and enduring direction. A much less track-up.
