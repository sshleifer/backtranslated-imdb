** SPOILERS ** KHAMOSH is totally unrealistic, lacking a draw, and has basically just done to see stars show themselves. The most suspense scene in the movie was when Shabana Azmi is in the shower and then we see her TV playing the shower scene from PSYCHO. This film actually expects users to believe Naseeruddin Shah's character has a good memory to remember where certain injections have been fired and how many! <br /> <br /> *** SPOILER BEGINS *** <br /> <br /> <br /> In the end, the killer rubbed his bowel to Shabana Azmi long enough to allow Naseeruddin Shah's character to run up shoot it! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Shabana Azmi said, "Oh sh-t!" In general, a movie baaaaaaaaaaad! <br /> Rating: ** from ********** (2 out of 10)
