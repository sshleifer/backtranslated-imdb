In theory, the films should be a form of entertainment. While this documentary excludes and other experimental forms of film-making; Most movies, special genre movies, should not only tell his story or message, to entertain their audience target in some ways. All this just says that in my opinion a bad movie is not a movie and low output value or low-budget, a bad movie is one that is boring. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Hellborn or Asylum in the Divide as recognized in the U.S., is a bad movie simply because it is just not involved, and irremediably boring and tiring. While it has a very good quote, it is just wrong to develop and mediocre the act does not do better things. On the other hand the film probably could be a B-fine film or even classic, but here's just a bad attempt at making films. <br /> <br /> Director Philip J. Jones tells the story of James Bishop (Matt Stasi), a young psychiatric resident, who just got his dream job at St. but the old asylum seems to hide a secret. After the mysterious death of some patients and the constant rumors of satanic practices, James decided to figure out what is going on; only to find the incredulity of his boss, Dr. McCort (Bruce Payne), who believes that Bishop is going to be as crazy as his patient. While the quotes are quite interesting, the execution of the film leaves a lot to be desired. In an attempt to make a psychological supernatural suspense, Jones goes for the easy way out and make a movie full of stereotypes in the genre. Of course, there are plenty of great movies that are also full of refreshments; but the "Hellborn" all one is wasted and turned into a cheap fear to keep things moving, resulting in a boring and predictable storyline. The act is quite mediocre for the most part, with one big exception: Bruce Payne gives a top-notch performance that makes the movie look dangerous in those good acting. Matt Stasi is very weak as lead characters and rest cast performing forgettable. <br /> <br /> Despite all this flaw, one thing must be written about Hellborn; It has a very good visual look for the budget and very similar to the modern-day big-budget Hollywod day "horror" production. Also, make-up and prostheses are doing very nicely with the designs for the main antagonist are quite good. Unfortunately, the rest of the special effects are terrible and outdated, making a great contrast with the make-up & prosthetics. <br /> <br /> Hellborn is a movie that has a few good things damaged by its serious flaws and terrible results. Hardcore horror or b-movie fans may be interested by citing it but it's a boring and tedious experience. 3/10
