This looks like two films: one sad, unassuming legends long on an ac-tore taken over by the parties he plays; The other a brilliant social commentary on a middle-aged divorce was picked up by a waitress. Shelley Winters is wonderful as a waitress and another business on the side. It drops heavy suggestions on the need for connection, its certificate of massage and the desire it finds in the game model. I like glimpse into her tremorous dish with a kitchen behind a curtain, and her horrible outfit seduced in stained-stitched navel, puff-crochet head cuffs. <br /> <br /> Can actors get Oscars for Shakespeare? We know Oscars to imitate disability, put a lot of prosthetics, or pretend to be upset. The Shakespearean scenes (which go on and off) are nasty and dated. So the scene goes crazy where Tony seems to distract while listening to his own voice. <br /> <br /> By the way, Anthony John is not aristocratic. He made it clear in an early stage that he used to be a chorus boy. When he mentions his father's advice, he slips into a Cockney accent.
