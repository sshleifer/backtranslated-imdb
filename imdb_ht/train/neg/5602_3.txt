"Pandemonium" is a horror movie parody that comes to more stupid than funny. Believe me when I tell you, I love comedy. Spotting comedy specifically. "Airplane", "Tranche Naked" trilogy, "Brilliant Saddles", "High Anxiety", and "Spaceballs" are some of my favorite comedy that parody a particular genre. "Pandemonium" is not the up and the movie. Most of the scenes in this film I sat there silently stunned because the movie was not all that funny. There are a few laughs in the movie, but when you look at a comedy, you expect to laugh a lot more than a few times and that all this film is going to be for it. Geez, "Call" was more laughing than this movie and that was more of a horror movie. How rare is that? <br /> <br /> * 1/2 (out of four)
