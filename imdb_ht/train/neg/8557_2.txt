I admire 'kiss on the mouth' for its frankness ?? hair cuts off and masturbation, especially in lead / director Joe Swanberg. They were not afraid to show the truth everyday "private" events. Unfortunately, the movie falls under the 'Brown Bunny' domain, though with a somewhat more developed scheme of jealousy. Yes, it's 'bunny' mirrors and a whole lot of nothing going on, or too many movie shots that focus (or sincerely unfocused) on absolutely anything ?? feet, but or parts. Again, unfortunately, I can see why this movie was released, and why people rented: real-life sex scene and full-time (equally, both men and women) nudity. Other than that, it was a complete waste of time. We quickly learn from a post-college / college pair in which the male has obvious sentiment for the girl who sees her as just a friend while continuously having sex with her ex boyfriend. Otherwise, we are undergoing daily events in his boring life: he works for his parents; He is working on a very interesting sexual awareness project on his computer. For this all to work, the dialogue has to be interesting and real act. Neither works with it as boring as watching someone driving an hour, is 'the Bunny Bunny.' The only actor who stands out is Kate Winterich, and even makes some doubtful doubts. (The extra DVD with her before a mike is actually worth seeing.) Again, I admire the filmmakers, especially Swanberg, for baring it all and not being afraid to expose themselves or shower-habits, but the the general film fell flat. It has history that does not fit the scenes, too many boring events everyday and compelling acting astonishment, other than the mere pornographic factor, why you rent this.
