It's Hard Hard to get Cliffhanger when a ski resort is besieged by terrorists and it's up to one cop, Jack (Crackerjack) to stop this. <br /> A movie B-action that borrowers in other films is good with very good action, a ridiculous plot (as always in those movies) and three fine stars. Thomas Ian Griffith as the Cop and Nastasja Kinski and Christopher Plummer as terrorists. If you do not like B-action movies this is not for you.
