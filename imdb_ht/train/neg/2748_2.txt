This movie only gets a second star because I work downtown and love to see it destroy. The effects were pretty good - I heard it was the most expensive Korean movie ever made. They were the most expensive and still absolutely trembling to make it a massive waste of money. I rent it so I will not burden too much on what I pay, but it's been a couple hours that I will never get back. trail holes are numerous. terrible acting all across the board. I do not recommend giving time to watch this movie, life is too short. If your friend wants to watch this, run away. I can not stress enough how bad this movie was. <br /> Where the hell made the dragon second out? why did not show it sooner? How were rocket launchers dinosaurs just 500 years ago?
