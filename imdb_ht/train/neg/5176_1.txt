When an independent film and not rated, like the Hamiltons, I was hoping out of the stall, cut out your heart thrust. I know that good movies do not always have blood and violence, but I read reviews, I visited the website, and I even persuaded some of my friends to pay $ 9.50 to see this terrible movie movie with me. When there is a festival called Horrorfest, I hope horror, by Dawson Creek and incestuous undertones. My expectations were very low for this movie, yet the little expectations had for the movie being shot in hell once I saw an hour before we saw the first drop of blood from someones fingers . There were many traces and left too many imagination. I'm sorry to see Happy Master. I think there might be more violence and gurus in that movie than in the Hamiltons!
