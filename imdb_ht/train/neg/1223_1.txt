What a weekend. Two days ago I watched the first half of "War Games 2: Dead Code", now "While It Out". I'm trying to come to a decision that one had gotten worse in terms of pain in my mind while watching. I guess, "While it came out" got worse. <br /> It was all said before in other comments: Unrealistic, logical etc. - The only thing I really have to add is that at some point I started to feel more for the guys than the woman because I would recommend it to a Darwin award if he actually dies (only look at the first half, so I do not know). Soon I was in Darwin award (if that's even possible) for her immense sort .. <br /> And, hey: Was produced by Kim Basinger? So he did not only know the script, but was also responsible for carrying this waste into our money, the people? I consider people garbage considerable amount of money to be wrong because the money could be used to eating and dressing quite a few people instead of injuring 80 percent of those who saw it in the cinema and giving 20 percent, which It is idiom, a good opportunity to show just how much of a fool person is.
