The situation is ridiculous, the incredible characters, the dialogue, and finish the absurd. <br /> Believe me, I'm a fan of Kevin Kline, but watching her make a pepe le pew accent for 2 hours as a gorilla supposed to be almost as fun as she sounds. <br /> <For her part, Meg Ryan is once again as perky and adorable as a (take your pick): kewpie doll, baby, puppy, cat, whatever you come to think is the cutest animal on earth . It also does not bring the slightest resemblance to a real person. <br /> <br /> This movie hit me as an opportunity seized by Amy Lawrence Kasdan and Kline vacation in Paris and the south of France while being well paid for it. So I can not really blame them.
