Uninspired Direction leaves a decent cast stranded in a nice but bold adaptation, in which dialogue seems recited rather than sincere, and slippery cash appears by the ghosts fail to round up any sense of awe or magic; Edward Woodward, as the Holy Present at Christmas Present, wobbles around on stilts and seems to be making an impression of Bernard Cribbins. As Scrooge, George C. Scott is too wry, and he never seems to really believe in it, which steals his performance in its effects. The scenes in which he showed his past have a lot of impact as if he was half-heartedly flicking in his family album. No other person seems to wear any effort, except Frank Finlay, who is chronically overacting.
