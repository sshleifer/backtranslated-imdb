PROM NIGHT (2008) <br /> <br /> Started by: Brittany Snow, Scott Porter, Jessica Stroup, and Dana Davis <br /> <br /> Draw: Three years ago, Donna (Brittany Snow) witnessed her family's death from her (Jonathan Schaech) teacher who had a bit of a break. Now she is preparing for her elderly bullets and her stupid friendship friends. Once there, they begin to die one by one because the killer escapes from prison and no one bothers to warn Donna because apparently his shot is too important to interrupt. <br /> Pros: I got a few good laughs from the movie due to the terrible dialogue and moving the dumb characters. <br /> <br /> One example: <br /> <br /> Everyone decided not to tell Donna who is strangely obsessed with it (it does not seem that great) has escaped from prison. The reason: They do not want to embarrass him in front of all his friends. Lol <br /> <br /> inconvenience: Let me start by telling me is a big fan of slasher. Usually I can have fun and even those bad. I'm like some PG-13 horror movies. TOURIST TRAP (1979), one of my favorites, was originally rated PG. I also like POLTERGEIST (1982) and GRUDGE (2004). So the fact that this is a mute slasher movie which is rated PG-13 has nothing to do with me not enjoying the movie. <br /> <br /> First of all, I had a big problem with the story. I like slasher movie that does not even have stories. At least they can be fun. This is about a teacher who fell in love with his student, so he killed all his family. A few years later, she tries to do it up to her by damaging her bullets and killing all of her friends ...? Then there were subplots that I doubt anyone caring about. Claire (Jessica Stroup) is fighting her boyfriend, she has cramps, and I can not care less. This would be a lifetime feature, not a rumor of PROM NIGHT. <br /> <br /> Then ... this is a slasher movie and terrible death scene. I do not even care that it's not that gory, some of my favorite slashers (HALLOWEEN, CURTAINS, the original PROM Nights) did not gorse but still had a lot of killing effect. Here, we have half the characters dying in the same hotel room on screen, being a woman elongated several times with no elongated wounds, and a sort of a bad face of the actor as she screams in agony. I'm sure 10 old girls were scared, but not me. <br /> I also hate the characters. Was Bobby really sensitive to Donna (Scott Porter) and I can almost guarantee you will never meet a tender companion in your life, unless you are a gay male. Then we had friends annoying Donna's Claire (Stroup) and Lisa (Dana Davis), and the sign meant Chrissy girl (Brianne Davis). If you thought the characters in DEATH PROOF were harassed, try to watch this movie. And do not get me started on Ronnie (Collins Pennie) and the DJ (Jay Phillips) who gave me the Usher flashlight performance in all of this. <br /> <br /> Ads of all these predictable turns predictable, a terrible band and a great lack of respect to the original material, and you have quite a stinker.
