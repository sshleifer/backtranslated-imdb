I saw this movie on t.v. This afternoon and I can not see how anyone can sit at this piece of garbage. It's not funny at all and it takes you I.Q. down a few notches. I know this movie is for kids, but this does not mean that the writers should take their intelligence to be granted. I bet that the writers were sitting around a large wooden table and figured out a) the word "apple" equally laughs great. b) A kid's high heel card can be dunk on a ten-foot high heeled hoop. c) Kids should always fight armed kidnappers with weapons because their kidnappers will fall for nothing and d) 3 months of karate training is all you need to beat up so-called "ninja" with swords. A good thing I can say about this movie is the weakest "gang" suburban in the world that could not scare anybody. Perhaps the guys at MST3K could use this movie for a good laugh. Do not bother with this blame-ass excuse for a movie.
