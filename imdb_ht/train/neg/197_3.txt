While being a great James Arness west, this movie has gone down like the worst movie Alamo ever made. The story was terrible, infidelity all across it, and just downright downright boots! Continue to throw the four winds. Anyone to catch the sequence of the cannon? The Mexicans were dumb enough to fire cannons that obviously had mud and ramrod still sticking out of the tubes. Come! Then there is Brian Keith's ridiculous hat! Priority must be far or something. Or just out of the ideas!
