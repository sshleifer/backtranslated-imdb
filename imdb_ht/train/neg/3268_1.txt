It is a real challenge to make a movie about a baby being devoured by wild ducks and mothers being wrongly accused of silly killers, but against all this one chance to succeed. Meryl Streep provides the performance of his life, melodramatic, overwrought, but with that funny genius that keeps you laughing like a mother struggling with the final horror. <br /> <br /> If comedies on babies are fed by the dogs by your cup of tea you might be uncomfortable to watch this, and, yes, it is an odd choice of subject to a farce but really many of the movie has nothing to do with that as it focuses on providing Streep a showcase for its Aussie and Facial accent. <br /> Throwing in a media of sensitive and sensational slam and disrespect for either the truth or ethics gives the film the chance to make the daring point that things are bad.
