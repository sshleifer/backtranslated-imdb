We actually watch this twice in the theater because we could not believe how bad it was the first time. Maybe we would miss something ... nope, missing missing from the beginning of preproduction. I actually came back to Robbin's novel to see if I could find the problem, and I discovered that what I thought was funny and interesting back in the day is now just disconnected with soft-headed junk. So the first problem with the movie was decided to do it all, and the rest of the train wrapped up from there. Absolutely nothing works - not a blessed thing. Some nice exterior photography has become steamrolled by random camera assignment of interior shots. All actors look at least comfortable - Angie Dickenson looks positively mortified - except for fishing Phoenix, who gives the impression that he is too unaware that his terrible performance really is. The dialogue is one, long, unconditional cringe. Scenes do not make sense of second and second, and the connection between them is nonexistent. But the movie is breaking eyes off, convinced that it says something deeply. <br /> This is too bad the same funny; it is simply excruciating. Gus Van Zant has made other good-and-great movies that I encourage you to see, and I am happy to have survived (and appear to have learned) this disruption.
