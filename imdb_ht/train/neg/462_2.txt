This has been going down as nearly one of the worst movies ever. Proudly act, terrible script ... and they were the good points! One definitely misses! The jokes, if you could call them, were so predictable as to be pathetic. Pamela Anderson is still relying on her body to detect from the fact that her act is similar to plastic! I sat willing to give it a chance, hoping that he would improve that, alas, it was not! If it was a choice between this and a book, I suggest you settle down for a good read! I love Denise Richards, which is why I gave this movie a go, but why she left her own cast in this movie is beyond me!
