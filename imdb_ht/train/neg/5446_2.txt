For fans of Duran Duran loyal who want to watch a good music video, skip this one. The producers decided to get creative and make this video 80 something of a sci-fi story, involving the Barbarella villain from which the group got its name. <br /> <br /> What makes this idea fail is that right among some great songs of 80 Duran Duran, confused and annoying scene taking place that shows the fictional antagonist trying to stop the group at one of the concerts . Not only does the good music repeat off, but we have to suffer from some cheap turn-off history hosted by a bad Dr. Mario. It's almost too much to carry. 2/10
