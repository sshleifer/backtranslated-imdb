It's 1978, and yes obviously has too many black players on their teams as well! Fans will be upset and certainly 75,000 seats will be full, only less happy has many black players on the field! This made for TV Super Bowl TV is observable. It's no more, but it's really surprising to throw away talent actors who make a look (for the time), probably the best Tom Selleck. Unfortunately any Selleck goodness brings to the screen is quickly trumped by "actors" like Dick Butkus. It's a funny story about super bowl betting. PJ Jackson is charged by "New York" (read Mafia) to ensure that the game ends for their favor, in this case a bet $ 10,000,000. PJ is innocent enough, and it seems there is a loose threat by buying in a few people here and there. But things seem to fall apart. Another, Lainie's unsuspecting, takes charge. For a while, the mystery of murder does not know for certain, but is revealed rather clearly in the final assassination that Lainie is the new antagonist. <br /> It's a bad movie, but look. The act is decent, and filming is OK. At least there were no funny typical 70s car chases (they have their place just not here). Just keep an open mind about past stereotiping with the cocaine era and you will survive. <br /> <br /> 2/10 (maybe a 2.5)
