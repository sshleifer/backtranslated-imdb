A group of forest guards and scientists go to the woods to find fossils. They stumble on a Bigfoot burial ground eventually (did not notice it in the dark), the scenes of the CGI Bigfoot are tied, but better than The endless scenes of talking that they are rarely punctuated. I used to think that there would just be a good Bigfoot movie to be done. But now, after many sad sad movies about the legend, I have serious doubts. To pour salt into the wound in this movie look, one good-looking girl just does not get naked at once. And while this one can be better than "Boggy Creek 2" (no mean feat), it's still sad that the best movie that is not documented on Bigfoot remains "Harry and the Henriksons" <br /> I: D
