I was really, really disappointed with this movie. he started really well, and built up some great atmosphere and suspense, but when he finally rounded to reveal the "monster" ... he turned out to be just some psycho and skin problems ...... again. Whoop-de-do. But another black film ... like we do not already have enough of them. <br /> <br /> To be fair, the "creep" is really unsettling to look at, and how it moves and the strange sounds it makes them very crap, but I'm sick of renting movies like this only discover that the monster is human, albeit a tight, depressed, one freakish. When I saw all the rat-stories early in I was hoping for some kind of bizarre discount-monster hybrid stuff ... it was like a lying down when the ramp was revealed. That's some of the stuff in this movie that makes no sense. (Spoiler) <br /> Why is the Hell Creeps killing the security guards? What's the point, apart from sticking a big sign up honking up saying "HI I'm a PSYCHO and I'm staying here!" Its stupid, and only seems to prevent Franka Potente's character from getting help. <br /> <br /> What's the hells she's eating down there? I got the impression he was effectively the wall, and only the unexpected opening of this tunnel section left his loose ... So he munching rat all this time, and if so why hang around is it so much? Why is it so damn hard to kill? It is thin, malnourished and not exactly in peak performance ... but seems to keep going despite wounds equivalent to that .cripple the non-psychic characters in the movie. <br /> <br /> Next to DVD tells us they intend to empathize and creep, but I just get her aching. It's an effective film but it wastes many opportunities that it makes me sick.
