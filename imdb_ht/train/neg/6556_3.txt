I bought this on DVD for my brother who is a big fan of Michelle Pfeiffer. I decided to look it myself earlier this week. It's a reasonably entertaining piece of two line completely separated lanes. The section with Michelle Pfeiffer was by far the most interesting of the two. She plays a rising Hollywood actress who has many unfulfilling shortcomings. It literally bumps into Brian Kerwin (A Regular guy with Kids) after driving his car to the back of it. After being initially hostile to each other, he offers his home driving as it does not feel comfortable in driving. Romance develops eventually leading to tragedy when his wife finds out. What happened to the end I was not prepared for the slender hand slowly and routine TV routes to take any drama out of the scheme. The other section involves an old Boss Studio played by Darren McGavin. This section actually has the best cast with Kenneth McMillan, Lois Chiles, Steven Bauer & Stella Stevens. They all want something from the studio boss but at the end when asked to resign, they all realize their careers will now be nowhere. <br /> It spends the time but not all that interesting and I'm glad this did not buy for me. I'm not a fan of Michelle Pffeifer but he admitted the actor only worth watching in this movie and even in 1983 he was a decent actress. In general, unless you're a fan of it avoid this as it's very routine.
