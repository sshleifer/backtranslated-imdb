Some may scoff, but there are actually a real art and making the film particularly bad. That's missing out on every fronts. <br /> A bunch of young people - women who have breast and continuously wet T-shirts, naturally - go to film "without browsing" and finish running in a 31-foot crocodile. <br /> Not only was the obviously false croc, but some of the props [notice the boat hit the particular reef] look like they were out of burial! <br /> <br /> No good, from start to finish. Do not see it!
