The movie 'Gung Ho!': The story of Carlson's Makers Island was made in 1943 with a view going up the morale of American people in the duration of World War II. It shows the best way that the cinema can constitute body of propaganda. The value of this film is only collection and no artistic. In a film of propaganda it is useless to judge judges and actors. Watch the movie if you are interested in learning how propaganda functions in these films or if you are a great fun of Robert Mitchum who has a small role in the movie. If you want to see a movie for the second world war, they exist best and purpose. I rated it 4/10.
