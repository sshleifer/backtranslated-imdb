I wish I could give this movie a zero. Cheese effect and act. The only reason to see this movie is so you can see how bad it is. Allow to start with the kid who plays Brian. What a Geek! I could not believe the mullet! Then there was talk to himself. I guess they could not just have the movie being silent, but still. Of course they had it thin-soaked too, not something I wanted to see. But Jared gave a great performance, compared to the department's special effects. Everything from the bear to the crash was something I could do myself, and better. I seriously doubted that Gary Paulsen had nothing to do with the production, seeing as the movie was not even called Hatchet. Finally, I do not think that the writer had ever read the book, seeing as nothing was the same. I think the book was great, but this movie stunk like a goat!
