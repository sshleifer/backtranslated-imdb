Waldemar Daninsky (Paul Naschy) traveled to Tibet and bitten by a yeti, causing him to become a werewolf. He is accidentally killed after he attacks his cheating wife with his lover, and is later revived by a female scientist, Dr. Ilona Ermann, who uses him to self-control experience. Daninsky later discovered an underground asylum that is populated by the rare subjects of the failed physician experience. <br /> <br /> When you heard of Naschy's death from colleague Jon Kitley, I rummaged in my collection for a proper movie to watch. In my fight, I found myself owning one but three (!) Copy "Wrath of the Wolfman". The film is in questionable video quality, the sound is armed in any mode, the movie is sort of slapstick style at times. And the American version has two favorite scenes removed. Quite frankly, without a remastered, unknown copy, I was not really getting the proper movie of his glory. <br /> <br /> This film claims to be the fourth in a long series of Waldemar Daninsky's werewolf. I suspect this is true, but you would not know this from the movie itself. The plot is confusing at times, and there's really no indication that this is a sequel. If you read the scheme about Wikipedia and comparing them with the print on the box, you will see that I'm not alone in my confusion. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the film's imperfection may be forgiven if we understand the production of hell it has passed. While floating around for years, it was only released in 1973, due to problems involving finding a distributor. And Naschy said in his autobiography that the director, Zabalza, was an incompetent alcohol, and that he hated working with her. Those are really not light accusations, and I have no idea what Zabalza had to say on his own behalf. <br /> <br /> Chances are, sooner or later you will come across a low-class version of "Wrath of the Wolfman". It appears in a variety of three-packaged and lying boxes, so you might accidentally find it and do not even know. What really needs to happen is an uncut American version, with a decent sound and mixing videos, and the likes of the actors throw back inches as far as I know, does not exist. Let's honor Paul Naschy's legacy and find his movie at a wider audience at the highest quality he deserves.
