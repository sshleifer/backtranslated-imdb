This film is mostly crap and the only reason this film is worth watching is because Jean-Claud Vam Damme star in this movie. There are some good action scenes in this movie and those are best at the end of the movie. > <br /> The act of this movie is so bad and its worst act I've ever seen with the actors 2 Bill Goldberg and Michael Jai White can not act on ALL. And this movie by far has to be one In Jean-Claud Vam Dam's worst movies she made and if u watched her in one of her great movies u should look at Blood, KickBoxer or Sudden Death. Rating is 4 out of 10.
