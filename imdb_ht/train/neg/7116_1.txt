* WARNING * possible below the bottom <br /> <br /> The movie is much more boring then anything else. There seems to be some attempts to build tension in shots that are wounded in empty rooms and empty yards, but none of it works. <br /> <br /> MST3K has done a good job with it, but on its own the movie is mostly tedious. <br /> <br /> Once the fake skull rolled out of a pile of ashes, the wife became hysterical and woozy while the husband (who is trying to drive mad wife) said in a vote with "There is no skull, there's no skull." When the real ghost-skull have the husband kept in a pickled, as if blocked between first and second bases.
