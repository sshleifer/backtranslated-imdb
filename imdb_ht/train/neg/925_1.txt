Well, this movie f * ck in the 'rules. It is without question one of the most technically stupid pieces of movies ever made. absolutely awful, but you see GOTTA. Rent this with your buddies and come up with a drinking game or just have fun, it's hilarious. With the back-stage featurette to prove it, you can do nothing with paper plates and finger painting. awesome. Well, rent it just for this one scene: the two characters are actually walking in place for about 3 minutes in a shot. The director (on the Next) says "yes, the track was so smooth it seems to be ...". yes, right people, are totally in place. it's funny.
