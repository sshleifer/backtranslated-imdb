The final film for Ernst Lubitsch, filed by Otto Preminger after Lubitsch's premature death during production, is a juggling act of sophistication and silliness, romance and music, fantasy and dramatic costumes. In a 19th century castle in Southeastern Europe, a Countess fell to his swearing enemy, leader of the Hungarian riot; It was helped by her ancestors, painted magic image into life. Betty Grable, in a long blond wigs decorated with flowers, has never been more beautiful, and her songs are very pleasant. Unfortunately, this script (by Samson Raphaelson, taken in an opera by Rudolf Schanzer and E. Welisch) is awash with different ideas that weaken mails - or amuse. The results are good-looking, but unabsorbing. * 1/2 from ****
