I gave Timecop a perfect 10, I gave this 1 <br /> Read story is very boring, and it has only little to do with the original Timecop. Many of these things from Timecop have been treated, and they are put into new stupid things instead. This story will take place in 2060 (if I remember correctly), but for some reason timetraveling is now more dangerous: confused: <br /> <br /> And the action scene has nothing to be happy about, well most of them are not ... only the first one is great ... and there are not many action scenes at all, and all are very short <br /> At one point in the story, the main character travels through time over 5 times in a few minutes ... no wait, do that twice ... <br /> In short: do not waste time watching this movie, it's not worth it
