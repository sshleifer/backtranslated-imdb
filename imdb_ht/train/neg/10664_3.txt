A very tired looking Burt Reynolds plays a mercenary battling his former boss for some gizmo those non-hero plans to sell to the "Iranian." Low-tale video nonsense by the producers of "Stalkings Night" offers some decent action feet and a lot of tight "drama" scenes ... a lack of logic and really obnoxious dialogue are the definite aspects, although the final twists and loyalty schedules could have been a debris end to a better movie. Burt always has presence, although it also means you notice more when it insults mentally half-baked "one-piece material".
