The Comedy Underground movie is probably the worst railroad debris ever seen. Luckily I did not pay for this movie, and my reluctant friend agreed to look at it again so it was so terrible, but he needed to prove to me how terrible he was. I love cutting comedy color. I figured in the least it would have it and I should be entertained. No, rather the act was so terrible, the "jokes" were very cheesy, and the plot had no place to find. Perhaps not supposed to be a plot so I can not hold that against this movie. It's very sad where the funniest thing in a comedy is an old woman whose head is hit by a stick ..... by Batman ... A man dressed in a baseball uniform touching a stick. Hilarious. Simply engineering. I got the feeling watching this film that its creators have made it and laughs hysterically with friends on it. Perhaps this was full of jokes inside us just did not understand. Or maybe it's the worst piece of rubbish ever made and it should be closed away in a vault and cast into the Arctic Ocean. Do not buy this movie!
