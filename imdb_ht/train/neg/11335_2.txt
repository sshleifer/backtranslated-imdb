I recently watched Belle Epok, thinking she might be wonderful as she had an Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film. I was a bit underwhelmed by the predictability and simplicity of the movie. Perhaps the conflict I had was since the movie was filmed now, draw a man who fell for beautiful women and eventually fell for the good girl to do many times. Aside from the predictability of the plot, some scenes from the film felt really out of place with the scenario (formerly a certain event at the wedding). At times the movie was a little preachy in his ideas and in relation to the Franco era the movie was put in with the Church. The only thing the movie went for was the cutesy moments, the scenery, and the character of Violeta being a strong woman, independent during times when women were not really associated with these features.
