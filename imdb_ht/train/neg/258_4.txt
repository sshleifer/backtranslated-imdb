This is the first time I ever saw a movie with Jamie Foxx, and I bet it will be my last. I failed to find out why it was funny, although the audience thought it was very funny when he made a figure in the camera or saying "I'll take a shower". plot is completely predictable. The bad guy comes after the good guy. The good guy has a woman, so the bad guy uses it. In between, the rulers bend up. The final scenes are incredible. You spend 2 years and millions of dollars chasing a guy, but do not work home to solve a trivial account? <br /> There is no big act, there is plenty of a plot or storyline, and shooting at making MTV style. Do not waste your money on this one. <br /> <br />
