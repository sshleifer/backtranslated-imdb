"Dahmer" is an interesting movie although I would not use "horror" or "thriller" to describe it. It is more a minority study that looks strange sympathetic to the assassin. Jeremy Renner shows serious murderer Jeffrey Dahmer, who drugs, murdered and disassociated his male victims. The film film on the relationship between Dahmer and "Rodney", well played by Artel Kay√†ru. Rodney is almost the most interesting character: the Dahmer boyfriend and who has once escaped an attack, returns to Dahmer for sex and continues to live a second attack. <br /> I think the movie is disjointed because it does little to show Dahmer's formative years, how events created the human monster we see on screen and offers no insight into Dahmer's belief that it could create sexual zombies in his victim. Roles are well played but the story is slim.
