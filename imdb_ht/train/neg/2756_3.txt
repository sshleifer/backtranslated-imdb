{runt start} I do not want to believe them at first, but I guess this is what people are talking about when they say South Korean movies have some and can even go down. After the film of wonderful fun and moving monster "Gwoemul" (aka "The Army") in 2006 - which actually succeeded in making a sharp satire from a genre of B-film - successors to Korean blockbusters became more and more More generic, even though the budgets (mostly spent on special effects) have become more and more fantastic. Are South Korean filmmakers really want to skip all the audience and volunteer investors, whose industries have been built up since the 1999 break-out movie "Shiri / Swiri", does not make a whole set of budget budgets big budget such as mainland China did? {rende end} <br /> Only "reason" I can fathom to make this movie is the most detailed retail animation doll doll and digital fluid in a Korean / East Asian-style dragon I've seen on date, for final scenes. Now, if the Dragon was introduced at the beginning and given it more personalities and goals as in the 1996 "dragonheart", the film might have been a few more kind of royalties than there are many animated dragons. Remember "Dungeons & Dragons" in 2000? No one has learned that the trick is not how many special effects you use, but how well do you use it? I hope there are more (and better) Korean legends they can use, because they just kill a lot of international interests in the legendary Korean dragon and the way they filmed this one. <br /> <br /> In short, I agree with all of the negative reviews gone before and wondering how Korean felt about having the "Arirang" popular folk they played at the very end. As a beastly feature, I'd give it at least 5 stars out of 10 if the special effects or action sequences were worth it, but I've seen many video games and better camera work and scripting (just less dragons).
