It's bad, but it's fine. it is just fun. <br /> <br /> As a comedy he is supposed to be, it's obnoxious. Not much laughs at all as jokes in the film made a million times before. <br /> It's a shame as all the actors in the movie are great usually, but none of them really do a lot. and the sedation ends.
