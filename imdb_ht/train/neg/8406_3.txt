A memorable line from a short live show. After watching the episode where my fraternity was introduced the intramural flag football team started using the huddles line to break off our offense. Instead of being ready / broke, our quarterback tells FOOTBALL and the rest of the squad to answer you bet! A fun way to break the ransom was our opponents scratching their heads as very few of them were watching the show. Using this line added a unique element of our season that I have never forgotten. We had our best season during my years of college this year and in a little way it was due to the fun that we used this line. The show was pretty much a stinker, but he lives on in the memory of 1977 Kpa Phi entramural squad football squad in West Virginia Tech.
