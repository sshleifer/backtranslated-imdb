Let's deal with it, romantic comedy is considered lightweight when compared to dramatic movies (just look at the Academy's nomination award annually). But still, the good ones are really an art form. Look at "When Harry Sets Sally", "Safe in Seattle", and classic like "Roman Holiday" and "It happens one night". I love the good feeling of seeing people who are destined to find happiness. <br /> <br /> This movie tries to construct something similar to a romantic comedy. But no one believes the romance between the main characters, and there is nothing funny to make up for greater inefficiency. Modine is past way of being a leading man - especially a romantic lead. I am sure as Executive Producer, she has the means - but not good sense - to throw herself. And Gershon ... I see the possibility of some comic talent, but there was no script and a poorly developed character. And the idea that was emphasizing the English? No worries. <br /> Others have stated it, but I want to repeat: this illogical story gets pregnant, poorly executed; The actors are terribly wrong; and the characters, well, we just do not give a look on them. <br /> A form of art is not. Go back to "Moonstruck" again.
