Let's deal with it; some dead wounded and whose souls are transferred to a scarecrow. This will not happen neva! OMFG This kid stupid kid who can not stand for herself gets her ass released by a few badge to fuck her mother. Right as he died, he appeared in the scarecrow and left his mind into the scarecrow. The drinking guy covered his death by making it seem suicide and thinking he had gotten away with it. We later see it is launching from the trailer and later earning another meeting with the scarecrow. They had a brief meeting including the drink calling him a deficit with the rebounding scuffle and "taking one to know one, loser!" The surprise toning on the building, calling it "father-o", and then cutting off the poor man. We can see how this awesome film unfolds from that. He goes to kill many people, after that. He especially killed the people who gave him a hard time in RLS and went to kill some random donkeys, just for some laughs. No laugh here. It adds a punchline to each kill, too. Each time he kills a person, he would do some karate toning and finish it off with one of his signature punchlines. In the case of someone who said to hear, he would say "Here, there is an EAR of Corn!" Then shove it up the ass. YOU can actually take an example of the movie! He just had to kill a cop and was on his way to the only murder that ever stood up for him. His father, the sheriff, called for the oven to stop, and he said "Hey, stay awhile!" and throw a dagger to throw his chest and attach it to some tree. At the end of the film, he killed two guys and thrown at the punchline "split!" and kill two guys by cutting a machete in their heads. Wowzors, this movie made me want my pants cream so bad. Maybe next time this guy makes a movie, he will not be gay.
