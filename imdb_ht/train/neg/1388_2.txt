Wanted to see this movie hoping to see some flash of Jet It we were amazed by in Lethal Weapons 4. Unfortunately too many of his fights stunting, so clearly fake that he took even that fun out of it. The flying kicks would be a lot more impressive if you could not see the wires holding it up as it flies through the air for 4 seconds and 9 kicks. <br /> <br /> Too cartoonish and very disappointing.
