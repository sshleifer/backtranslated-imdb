It was not remarkable enough to be really horrible, it was just incredibly lame. The story was not half bad, but the execution was just horrendous. <br /> <br /> To begin with, she moved too fast for our emotionally involved and what was going on. It was just rhythmically bad. The dialogue was so unmatched, just flat and boring. <br /> <br /> And the characters, almightly cripes, were deadpool boring. How Does the Hell Do Deadwood Boring? It was not even funny. It was not crazy. It was just an annoying guy and a couple of swords he did not even know how to serve well. <br /> <br /> Gambit was boring. And since it has been telemarketing do the cards just float and fly around, or super strength growth hundreds of feet in the air? And what the heck was up with all the stupid helicopter movements? I mean, we know they are mutants, but they still exist in the physical field. A round kiss employee is not a helicopter host, you can not fly by twirling super-duper fast. Which Gambit would not be able to do anyway. Neither Deadpool, especially when using it as a real-time choreographic replacement replacement. And this movie stands as proof that work wires should be used only by fighting coordinators who know WTH doing, and knowing better than to use it at each. salt. shot. as a replacement for real-world choreography. Three of the most physical fighters in comic strips (Logan, Belief, and Wilson), and some of the worst fight choreography I've ever seen in recent movie memories. It was as if the waterfall coordinator just shrugged his shoulder and left it all up to the special effects players. Then you had the break out, and all those mutants did nothing. Even the mutants shown in cells have the power (beautiful to see a nod Quicksilver), made all-out when they came out. Only Emma-really-lame-for-that-movie-frost and cyclist did something. <br /> And since Logan was so beautiful? With the stupid, "the bullet will take his memory away." Do you think Xavier and X-Men would notice the huge gully bullets of his idle skull when the X-ray of him in X1? I was sorry for man Liev Schrieber, he actually brought in a good Sabretooth considering the script. He made one of the most amazing super marvels to feel real. But he could not save the movie in his own hand in season. <br /> <br /> Seriously, this was "Daredevil" level of sucking. Descent stories, good actors, absolutely horrible execution.
