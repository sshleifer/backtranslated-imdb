If you've ever looked at the dukes in danger you know that you've never had to worry about drugs or cussing or behavioral behaviors that were seen by small children. If you saw the movie you know that is not the case! This movie was horrific! The main character to make drugs and thinking it is funny and cool is certainly not what I call entertainment. They took a wonderful show and just returned to garbage. Daisy was a little flirtatious in the original show now and looks like he belongs to the street corner getting paid for his services. I was so excited about seeing this film before it came out, 15 minutes from the movie I was ready to leave. I stayed thinking he was getting better but instead he got worse by the minute. I wish I had never seen this film. She trashed a good show and left nothing but terrible taste in my mouth when I left. Make yourself a favor, go to see something worth your money, causing it is not just a waste of money, but a waste of 2 hours in your life you will never return!
