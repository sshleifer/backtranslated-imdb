OK well I found this movie in my dad old pile of movies and it looked pretty good from the cover, but the movie actually sucked !! OK the first story and the swim was very good but it took a while to get in, then one and the boy were completely retarded! It was not even scary! Her dream sounds like a toddler's story. Then the girls news one was completely delayed too. I'm sure some people will call up the news guy and ask him to go out with you. But this one ended cool where he stabbed him and he was in the hospital and saw him on t.v and he told all that junk him. Next was that wonderful gay story about the guy who brought back those dead .. Its OMG so stupid I did not even go to tell any more about it. The last one was the best. It was not that scary but the idea of ​​вЂ <вЂ <the story was very cool .. yes yeah the girl gets owned and killed all his classmates or something. Then, when making the dreams of each other, they get to the bus (FOR HELL AHAHAHAH) and see everyone from their dreams on the bus (Ha). End of.
