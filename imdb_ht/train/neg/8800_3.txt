A collection of deleted and alternative scenes captured, edited along with added voice-over makes it appear to take place after the events of the first. Pretty fresh idea, but the scene is deleted to leave on the floor room off for a reason and is more evidence. As it's just not as funny as "Anchorman", and really let's face it that film was not exactly gold comedy either, so you get a 'movie' worse than one that was moderately funny. In my eyes that always put him one or two abnormalities above "Kick and Scream", or "annoy". Chross your finger as the "Wedding Crashers" is a return to old school form (no pun intended) <br /> <br /> My class: D
