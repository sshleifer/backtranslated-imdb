***** Probably Minor Spoilers ****** <br /> I cant say I love it, but I cant say I did not ... very pretty it's strange. It has bad stuff in it as for example a shark that came from nowhere and the worst CGI you can imagine, if I was the director I'd cut this party for sure, gave me the urge to stop seeing the rest of the movie. .. For some people it will be boring because it lacks action, feels at home at times ... Take for example a scene that one of their friends has died and the next thing to do is that? nop, do not cry ... story stories are horror to each other .. * sigh * (just after crying for hes hes) <br /> <br /> Another stupid thing was when they were talking inside the boat they were like "hundreds" of candles in front of the table ... the boat surrounded by some types of rhino curtains (old clothes covered with windows) and sofa / couches ... I thought it was mute, using with candles, but do not think about the environment, besides being in the high seas alone ... <br /> <br /> Well, some scary scenes are nicely done I liked some. Sometimes horrors work better when hiding it when it's behind something instead of the show, so this movie makes it good, maybe because it's a low budget I do not know, but it works fine for me! You will feel tense if you forget some holes like those I mentioned above. <br /> <br /> do not expect much of it! but if you like anykind in this movie look, be patient, try to enjoy .. lol <br /> <br /> (sorry about my english raw) =) <br /> <br /> Cheers
