SPERNER ALERT In this generic and forgettable movie, Lorenzo Lamas makes her usual hard guy / pretty boy act, and her future real life old Kathleen Kinmont is hot ass fucking hot chick Alexa. OJ Simpson is a detective, collapsing on her since disappearing public release. Translation: cable TV filler. No skin enough to qualify this as a guilty pleasure. The script has some gaping holes. Best / Worst Moments: In one jarring scene, OJ's partner expressed her disgust at the morgue. OJ responds that some of the bodies are very hot, or words with this effect. This necrophilia waves reference is offensive enough; but in light of the crimes committed shortly after this film was released, it is really appalling, and therefore fun in an unintentionally horrible way. I was so surprised that I laughed until champagne came out of my nose. Now is a pleasure to blame. BC
