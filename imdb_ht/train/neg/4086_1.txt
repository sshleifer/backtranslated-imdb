I've come to this movie with high expectations. I was aware of Greenaway's work and the 'storm' and was interested in an adaptation. I first wanted to change after ten minutes, but felt that it would be unfair. There was a representation of a storm, but where in your mind is a baby boy peeing on a toy boat? It is symbolic of that? I continue another ten minutes on my finger so 'off', somewhere something would capture my interest. This is not Shakespeare, it's not movies. There is a time and place for it, but I will not waste my time and there is no room for it in my science at Shakespeare. After twenty five minutes I was abandoned and ended. I then read all the comments on this website and the pretense of the movie is only matched by its defendant. 'Read a painting ..... Then put it in a gallery', 'it's a ballet ..... keep it on the scene then'. Shakespeare can do intelligence, and play performed at mass hearings, was inaccessible, and this version helps put a close bond between Shakespeare and the general population at large - and I do not think Bard would be happy with that.
