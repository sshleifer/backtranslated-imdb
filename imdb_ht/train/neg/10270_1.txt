"Indian Nightmare" is officially tied, in my opinion, and "It's dough!" FOR PHOTOGRAPHS OF ALWAYS. <br /> <br /> Seven friends (unusual looks like the K-Mart version of the "Friends" cast) collected in a coffee shop to listen to American nightmares, a boat radio show. It's hosted by a guy with a beard. This is the most interesting aspect of his show. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Chandler, Monica, Joey, and ... Oh wait, I mean, Wayne, Jessie, and the rest of one-liner drop drop all take turns revealing their biggest fears The DJ is critical. Unbekownst, a crazy nurse / serial killer is listening to ... <br /> <br /> Crazy Nurse Then the turtle races Ross and Rachel and ... wait, sorry again ... do not worry in life. These scares include stunners like "Voodoo" and were down on by old ladies and pains. <br /> Really. <br /> <br /> This movie was, in a word, rotten. Infractions to kill nurse nurses are lacking motivation, nothing to do to visualize the "jump," the finish ends, and - again - voodoo? <br /> If you have absolutely no consideration for your loved ones, rent "Indian Nightmare" with them. <br /> If you care for your loved ones - even a little - go to your local blockbuster, rent all the copies of "Indian Nightmare" and hide them in your freezer.
