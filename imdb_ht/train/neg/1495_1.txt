I watched horror movies since I was 5 years old, starting with Childs Play.Since then I saw good and bad horror movies, but this is without question, the DUMBEST movie I've ever seen ! The actors did everything they could with the material. The plot was just idiotic. Plus, it's just all Gore. I can boast a lot of blood, but that was just ridiculous! In one of the scenes, a character gets short at the rear end and chokes with her intestines! Plain asshole! Another problem with this film is that its boring and probably the slimmer film has made. At the end it's just dumb. But then again, it goes with the rest of it! In the end, when the girl gets away from the cannibal / ancestor, she gets help from an old lady. The old lady is doing tea, but when she turns around to talk to the girl, the girl attacks her! He returned to a cannibalism! Movie Retade.
