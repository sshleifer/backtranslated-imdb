This is my most sacred romance ever sit down. The perfect movie for an idle housewife in kerchief, housedress, and ostrich-trimmed mile-high mules to look in the afternoon, lying on the bushes eating candies. In fact, candies play an important role in the film. The only reason I could look at the end is that I finally could contemplate Keanu Reeves' quarters in almost every scene. In most of its films, it moves too fast to get a good look. The only rapid action in this show is Giancarlo Giannini waving his hand and emotionality in Latin - more Italian than Mexican, really. <br /> <br /> The dialogue is as stubborn as wood. Unfortunately, no bodices are torn - the hero is unpleasant perfect-habitable and moderate. The warm-blooded aristocrat ex-world stereotype family is old as the hills. What is important if they are Irish or Italian or Mexican? This is a fairy tale. <br /> I knew before the finished titles ran that this would not be the movie I was hoping for. The glowing grapes looked like the paragon of all food additions in Women's Day Magazine. I did not see his name listed, but the art director was Thomas Kinkade, who painted the millionth carnival in Irish cottages snuggled in fuchsias. This film was literally seen in rose colored glasses. If you like to wake pink and blue sky, this movie is for you! (The candies seemed really good, too!)
