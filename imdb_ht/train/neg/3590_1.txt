Low can someone shed while trying to recapture an old glory? ST: HF will be happy to show you. <br /> <br /> If you are using to see what's being done for a good Star Trek show, do not watch this. -Podge, actors' portraits of the weak characters, and most of all, the design work is downright doggie. <br /> Like watching a strong captain, do not look here! Like the strength of the Federation? Forget about it here! Starfleet is mocked by flags carrying spikes in their hair. While a seemingly insane mischief is over and within two minutes of credit show at the opening, Ensign Spikey tries to arrange a screen with an engineer. It just degrades out there. No, not uniform match, for good sake. They are too small or too big, necklace down in their chests, and TNG Seasons One and Two uniforms are mixed in with Season Three and DS9 uniforms. The strict discipline and tradition of any of the original in the lack of this output down to the treads! The only good thing about this show is its graphics, which seems to improve a bit with every season. OK, I take that. Who serves CG inexperienced? The designers of this show. <br /> <br /> Do not disturb it, it will offend Star Trek to your senses, as it did to me. Not even back to the previous show cast can save this catastrophe. <br /> I cry openly when I look at this, probably because my eyes are bleeding and my head almost breaks. That's bad.
