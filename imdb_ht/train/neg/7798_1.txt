This video is based on the Shock-o-Rama video called "Undesirable World" in 2002. How is it wrong? It's terrible, which is a '1' represented on the IMDB scale - but it's worse than that. It is good to imagine that an original written album-language could enhance artifacts - English linguistic comedy is not funny at all - but true, this is one of the worst amateur films in any genre you can see. The zombies in the movie are as slow and clumsy ever, and do not seem to have the ability to talk or think about anything beyond their next meal. However, they're also smart enough to operate crackers and bad enough to know that western taboo on genitalia will not doubt the influence of dinner table conversations. George Romero's Land of the Dead poses a zombie nation that holds a little of social consciousness; Here, the zombies are nothing more than a blank blank for the bad imagination of director Andreas Schnaas. Although without redeeming social values, and even worse, entirely missing as entertainment, zombie '90 is a bad joke about anyone wasting money on it.
