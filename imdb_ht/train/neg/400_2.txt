I rarely make these comments but I felt that I had to resolve others pain I endured in watching this movie. So stupid and implausible both in the story in general and in the details that you simply can not stop disbelief. The problem begins early, when you see a government researcher around the world in a new Porsche with food and his team in a restarant that looks like a castle, overlooking the Capitol Building in Washington, D.C. What kind of life on a government salary? Hah! It only gets worse. Towards the end, when the bad guy starts to kill at the good guys, the latter group acts so stupid that you want to die, in order to cleanse the young pool. Special effects are very good - the money the producer can buy - and the lead actors were big in other films, but the scenario and the directions here are morally. Many people asked whether there were some intelligence before the movie before (movie showgirls, vessels troup), but this movie should stop asking. It's just plain bad.
