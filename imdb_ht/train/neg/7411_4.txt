An interesting idea involving an alternative dimension inside a hospital. He recalled - Stephen Kings "Langoliers", "Hospital Kingdom" and old twilight area episodes. Atmospherically strong, the setting was great. There was also very momentous 'very loop' moments that still have self-wrinkle calls. The story had many wave references that led me to believe that all the etiquity of ensuing two-time slide / ghosts / malicious wings with a rather funny heavy metal attracted ghoul-thing should be explained. And that was black severe floors let me down. Based on my movie I give no explanation of what's behind the events. Also, some ambiguities are still expected / welcome to these types of films. Black floors took it to new heights in vagueness. I do not expect things to wrap up in a beautiful ribbon, but neither should I let it feel "Huh? .. is that it? ... Do I dose in? Perhaps I hit the chapter jumping by mistake?" Black floors left me with a deeply-satisfied suspicion that "It was all a dream" that is a shame because up to the last coil I was very much on board and enjoying the movie.
