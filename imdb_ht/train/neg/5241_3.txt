Said the truth I'm a bit firm to see all such positive reviews are not many people, which is also the main reason why I actually decided to see this movie. After seeing it, I was really a shame, and this comes from the guy who likes this movie genre. <br /> I'm surprise in this movie all completely - it's like a kid's movie and stripping for absolutely no reason and it all involves little kids cursing and swearing. I'm not all upright but that's really going too far in my account. <br /> Summary: The story about two guys was sent to the big program for reckless behavior. There are met with one child with boobs and the other is a medieval freak. Just the name itself is not really connected to the story at all. They were not a role model with or doing anything but serving their time for what they did. The story is very predictable (though expected) and the humor is lame. Have not you seen the same characters (played by Mc Lovin ') in many other movies (like Sasquatch Gang?). I think I laughed three times and almost fell asleep. <br /> <br /> Well the casting was okay after all it is one of the product scenario. And the act is so-so as expected when you watch this type of movie. With the direction, what does one expect? This is the same guy who made us Warm Hot Indian Summer, and that film also sucks. But somehow she still managed to bring in some stars to attract her lurid movie. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I felt it's not total reef out but a waste completely in time. Only the naked scenes seem to be the best part of the movie. Can not really see any point why I should recommend this to anyone. <br /> Why Elizabeth Bank? Two Topless Scenes. <br /> <br /> Against: Not funny, obnoxious story, stripping and the kids do not mix together. <br /> Rating: 3.5 / 10 (Grade: F)
