I would like to think myself as a fairly open minded guy and he takes a lot (!) For me to flu a movie but this one is without a doubt one of suckiest, the crappiest movie I've ever seen ! > <br /> I have no idea what is wrong with the people who gave it a good rating here (IMDB is usually very reliable when it comes to ratings) ... The only thing I can imagine is that people You must vote during one or more conditions: <br /> <br /> 1. While shitfaced / stoned from the minds 2. They got hard cash for the votes 3. Under the gun <br /> I can not believe I wasted a good 1 h 45 min in my life for this pathetic excuse for a movie.
