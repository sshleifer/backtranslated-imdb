I can not believe that the Indian film industry still puts out as third-rate drop as Waqt. For starters, the scenario is totally implausible ?? The worst son was thrown out of the family home as taught him some self-sufficiency. So what does he do? He's promptly going to win some national talent competition by making some jump stars in front of a panel of judges (I honestly do not play it here). In the meantime, his father is dying of lung cancer, but keeps it secret from the son, but he continues to live long enough to see his son become famous, to see his new grandson ', he also makes a new game giraffe with his own hands. <br /> <br /> The act of crite worthy of hamminess it ?? No effort has been made to try and act in any way convinced by any of the main players of this film. As usual for American films, the family lived in a huge castle and seemed relatively intact in the realms of the real world. <br /> <br /> To be honest, the main losers when the film films are made to the intelligent viewers who made mistakes in seeing such a movie. The actors, such as Amitabh Bachchan and Akshay Kumar, will still be revered as gods by those who have nothing but blind faith in Bollywood.
