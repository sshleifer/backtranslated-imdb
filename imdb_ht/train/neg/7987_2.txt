I'm sure this was one of those "WOAH!" attraction in 1982 when Epcot opened, but now it's just funny. The film is clich√©. The circle-vision is disoriented. And that terrible song at the end is grille. And I really want to have installed chairs. After much walk, all you want to do is sit for a few minutes. But when you hear a movie to see it sounds pretty celebrity! You get entertained while sitting, right? WON! You stand there for 18 minutes to lean against a little short railing. Disney should make a new Maelstrom like attraction things up and replace this dull, subtle movie. DO NOT DO. Skip it. In fact, skip to Canada as long as you are eating. Move directly to the United Kingdom.
