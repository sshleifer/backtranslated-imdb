White chicks keep on, why could not they dress like Black Chic, oh yeah, they would not look different at all. Can anyone give me a brazen movie where they were not dressed as ladies? There is no unreasonable threat, Jack White and Michael Costanza Ghosts wrote that (the other Norton Trio members have been acting as Director). In White Bean, there is no really any joke. It's just the brains to act like girls for 2 hours. There is no setup, no punch and no laugh. There are a lot of "I think I'll play some Time Crisis." At least I had (5 times to be exact). Someone said Kenan Ivory, Damon, Marlon, Shawn, Damien (the only one talent), Kim, Rakeesha, George W., and Osama bin Wayans have stopped making movies. It only wounds the O-zone layer. <br /> <br /> VERDICT 1/2 * from ****
