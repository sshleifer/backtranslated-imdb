The first, this is not where near as bad as some of the trash in the other Sci-Fi Channel has been produced; which does not mean that Grendel is a good movie, in fact, it's very bad, but it definitely has the potential to be a lot better. The flaw in the movie comes from character design, character, adds absurd to the story, visual effects, music, and for the most part: acting. <br /> When talking about character design, I, of course, meant the way our hero and bandits look. Beowulf and the other Danes seem like ridiculous vines, rather than the brutal force warrior - that our main protagonist cast is just too funny. Grendel looks like the hulk, but with tantrum tantamoz strange in its elbow. <br /> <br /> Characters are very limited. Beowulf is even from the beginning to end, however Finn - a useless sidekick - to achieve some two-dimensional, due to his romantic subplot, and Unferth gets some notions as well, as it gets less aggressive. / Many like Finn, there are useless additions to this story to make it its own, while still maintaining the source material. The crossbow that is gifted Beowulf is so ridiculous, I'm surprised the cast did not walk in the series. Besides adding, there are omissions, such as the hidden themes of Christianity and Paganism, as well as the consequences of lying. Special effects are terrible terrible horrors. Grendel and her mother Hag are pregnant sick, and as such, they are shown on screens smaller than credible. <br /> <br /> The class is overbearing, especially when a character dies. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />. No. It is actually one of the best films, though its garbage still it is, it is good garbage, making it a pleasure culprit at best. The only thing that works is the dialogue, which is still wooden here and there. I highly recommend you skip this movie and watch Robert Zemeckis' take on the ancient story of Beowulf, simply because this movie (Grendel) is only half the story, and not everything that garners this movie a review two-star.
