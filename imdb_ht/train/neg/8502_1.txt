I look at the start of an interesting movie, a passionate thriller of an exciting nowadays Madrid, but it is not anything at that, is actually a movie just interesting for the film director to learn about what does not make a movie, It's worse at other words, even the presence of an Oscar winner (Mira Sorvino) is not enough justifying the $ 3.00 dollar spent to see this movie, the act is lurid and it seems the actors were just waiting to finish each The day of vaccination goes home, it leads to nowhere and it is boring, weak and bad, would not spend time or money on this movie.
