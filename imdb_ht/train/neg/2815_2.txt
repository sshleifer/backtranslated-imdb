Poor Robert Englund has made another flop with the expense of Tobe Hooper who usually makes movies very good movies but has failed very badly in this one. Englund plays the well-known brand De Sade of the 17th century was imprisoned for her mania in pain and pleasure in bringing pain to herself as well as watching others in pain. The story is so confusing with the flip flop from one century to another and I became confused about what was going on and what was the purpose of this movie. All I saw was a young lady who had been amused by a weird lesbian who decided to keep him in mind and the girl came fascinated by this Arabia and lots of money and found that it was out of them killed him and then Englund steps from one century to another claiming to be a descendant of the Sade and trying to kill him because he reminded him of Ms. Momoselle's (spell evil) or man which he was in the picture above the Walls. The movie was terrible and surprised at Hooper to hire Englund in this film and the special effects were so fake and ridiculous, especially the part on the eyes. Englund tries to make a comeback from motion once hit "Nightmare on Elm St" using those pulls in and out needle laid out eyes eyes. Terrible, absolutely terrible.
