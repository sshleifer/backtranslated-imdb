Following the success of Part 4, another end was a natural move. However, it should stop it before it started. Alice, whose surviving Part 4 finds herself pregnant and looks like Freddy is using her unborn child to get to his victim, which of course are Alice's friends. Strange movie nightmares, very heavy on religious imagery and bad acting. Special effects are good, but the movie itself is not.
