I was gifted with this movie as it had such a great site, the friendship of three women was devoted to one falling in love with a younger man. <br /> <br /> Curious. I hasten to add. These women all draw in extreme cartoons, not very supportive of each other and conspiracy and understanding to bring each other. <br /> <br /> Anna Chancellor and Imelda Staunton could do no harm to my book before they saw this, but here they handed a clue of participation and said to swing the action between slapstick and screwball, which Do not work too well when women are all well-known professionals in a very small town. smart women spend a whole pile of time complaining lack of men / sex / lust in their lives. I felt I could do much more in giving a decent scripture and more strain, the sub-strip lesbian goes nowhere with those smoking / drinking (all 3 in the quarantine ???) were very unrealistic - even At the baby scene - baby's vice, gimme a cigarette! Right. As I said, a shame in a waste. 4 out of 10.
