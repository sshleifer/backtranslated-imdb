This is the worst movie I've ever seen, and I've seen quite a few movies. It is passed as an art film, but it is really a piece of waste. It's only one quality retiring is beautiful tango dancing, but that can not make up for Sally Potter's disgusting selfish compensation. The plot of this movie is nonexistent, and I guarantee you will start laughing at the end. Especially where it starts singing. It's absolutely real.
