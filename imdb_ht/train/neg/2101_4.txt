Bernard Rapp passed away last year and was a very cultured journalist. Cinema was one of her greatest passions (she penned a vast worldwide dictionary of film) and so she was tied to wielding a camera at least once in her life. But these films have been boosting warm rehearsals: "Tearing Up Part" (1996) in spite of Terence Stampa's performance sensation was very caricatured in the casting of the characters, "Ann Affaire De Go√ªt" (2000) was a slick affair Even though Bernard Giraudeau delivered a bad performance, "Pas Si Grave" (2003) was another let-down and "a Petit Gameplay Consciousness" is as underwhelming as its predecessor. Its comic potential exploits in a dangerous way. <br /> <br /> And however, the idea begins to predict a twirling, spiritual comedy. A couple made by Yvan Attal and Sandrine Kiberlain who invited friends are in full moving into a lascivious castle. To play with the guests, they pretend to party companies with each other. And things do not go as planned because the announcement of the separations does not surprise them. Two lovers begin to ponder the validity of their couple. In spite of lush landscapes and the promising material he had at his disposal, Rapp's undistinguished led can not manage to give life to this game with unexpected consequences. The plot follows a well-worn pattern with characters having specific well-known functions and masks being revealed about who they really are. Verbal or funny effects often fall flat. A bad correction disappears a little more to the movie and this bad habit from Rapp abruptly cuts off very sequential. Even the sincere opinion of the actors in the enterprise is debatable. They seem to be bored and recite their text to live, especially Sandrine Kiberlain. The hearing is briefly taken into a deep pit. <br /> It's sorry to say it: Bernard Rapp's movie never lived up to its intention as "a Petit Impossible Gameplay" brings witness.
