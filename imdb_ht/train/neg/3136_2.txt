There are a lot of obvious hype associated with this movie. Let's just face it, though, the main reason why anyone would look it would be for Leo and Cate, who does not necessarily the best actors in this movie. I do not say they are not good actors, I say to them stunk in this movie. The special effects were decent (and I'm going to tell the movie makers did a great job of doing the eye-catching boat), but it even has several major flaws. For example, right before the pirate goes down, you can see a blue-screen image finish behind your main character. <br /> <br /> Do not get me wrong, I love the story of REAL Titanic, but I get this movie a curse in this story. Correction was atrocious - there is no reason for any film to be more than 2 1/2 hours (with the exception of MAYBE a biographical film), and the writing and scenario was typically vibrated. <br /> I'll say that the music was perhaps better than I could predict (and not just "the heart will go" silk). There is a scene that stands out to me when the boat is going down and pounding music bass sounds. That would be very good to be the highlight of the movie. As for the attitude of all, it was very dull. I was more relieved than sad when Jack died, which I know can not be the intended director. <br /> In a black shell, I find it horrific to turn the beautiful story into the Titanic in a sou-hyped chick flick.
