This movie, for a special school after, is not that bad, and that's the problem. Nothing happens. You feel as though you are still in the classroom. A guy teaches a bunch of youth delusions how to be good ball paint player. We never found to see these underdogs doing badly as the good player is their training. They are all in the sudden turn of good players by meditating. There are too many characters and no character development. Too much time is spent on the main character and his sexy sister, it's not enough about some of the other kids. This could have been a 'Bad News Bears' feeling (original) since there was a girl on a team all boys, but there was no feeling to this movie at all. She has no feeling and leaves a dull pain in your bones after watching it, it's not fun in the bag, not fun to look, and it's just kind of ... there. Plain. Boring. Something that you would look after school before your early evening sleep. As dessert like the day is long and it was a long, long day watching this movie.
