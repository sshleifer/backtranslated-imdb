*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** Juggernaut is a British made "thriller" released in the United States by First National. Karloff is Dr. Sartorius who left his research because his money was dried up. Karloff is forced to back to France and start up a medical practice. It is proposed by a concave woman who wants to get rid of her many older men. He knows Karloff needs the money. Karloff agrees with the proposal and soon gets her husband's personal doctor. All the time, the wife is planning on the city and the local has no good playboy. Karloff finally injects the old geyser with poisons and he kicks off. However, her son (from another marriage) came a few days before the murder and found the will had changed. When it loses the weight to the wife, she goes berserk and even bites the son's hand. <br /> Meanwhile, Karloff's nurse was outburbing the hypo Karloff used to kill the old man. When Karloff finds out she does not receive any money, she asks the son's poisonous son. The nurse suspects Karloff and finds the missing hypo. Analysis shows poison, but not quite in time as Karloff kidnaps the nurse. To make a long story, the nurse rescues, gets the police, and manages to save the son who is about to be injected by Karloff. Karloff rather injects himself and dies. <br /> <br /> This movie has some good points. Karloff is possessing and playing the kind of doctors he did in the devil commandments and the man who lived again. It is peculiar, however, to see him walk around stiff and slightly hunched over. We never find out why he is walking. I suspect the director thought he had made him more disaster. The actress playing the wife 2-time releases something horrible. It has a French accent. Even if it is badly misguided, you still manage to hate it (or perhaps you hate it because it acts ...). Slightly lower than average for a Karloff car. If you buy the cinema VHS copy copy, the audio is a bit chew.
