Daniella has some frustrating problems under her exterior exterior. She starts to lose her head when she finds out about a distant relative (which she looks) that was burned for being a werewolf. She goes a bit weakly when she pants horny men and barrels out their throats. He eventually finds a man who helps include his animal interior, but when others ruin the Bliss he extract violent and fury of revenge. <br /> <br /> 'Woman werewolf' is not a very goof movie but it poses as a good movie movie. A fun time may have been by poor organs / doubles / translations and just plain cheesy in the production. But on her own it moves slowly, but it has enough nudity to keep you awake ... barely.
