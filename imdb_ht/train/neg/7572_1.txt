It felt like I was watching this movie a thousand times before. It was absolutely predictable. Whenever the story tried to get a bit twisted, every time I last something interesting happened, I saw nothing but what I hope. Like the "Bread Factory opened another facility, because there was not enough bread". In two words: Flat story, which became a clich√©, bad act, adverse effects ... Only the Russian mute anger, Vlad, was a bit funny while punishing around the wrong guys. The muscle piece was so incredibly stupid, that he made me laugh at him for a moment. I wonder why I waste my time spitting over that shame-of-a-movie ... It will not get worse (because it's not possible): D
