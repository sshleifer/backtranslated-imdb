The first movie was not bad. It was fun ... at least for me for probably all the wrong reasons. I never saw the original so can not compare the two. <br /> This movie has reminded me of the unusual Christopher Reeve Village movie of the Dane. These two cinemas have different cemetery, but this is a disgusting mood and comedy wants to exist in both. <br /> <br /> The Wicker man supposed to be a mystery / thriller / boy please do not mad movie of women. I do not know everything pagan and sacrifice was a little there. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> . <br /> Kaj is a police officer and his tired policeman is going to the uncharted semi semi left no word in his whereabouts anyone who lives in the real world. Stupid. <br /> <br /> Things get weirder when the great Amish-Inquire women who populate the snarl island in her and lie on the sides of the missing girl. Her fianc√© has no help that seems to be elusive and weary all the time. Cage stays on the island when she learns that the missing girl is her daughter, it is the lucky man to come to this island as a victim of sacrifice during the island sick sick festival. Not so cheap tickets. A tightly exposed display of feminism? <br /> I found the ridiculous film at times particularly when cats punched some women and ran around in a bear suit. I think there were too many holes in this film. I found the whole concept of angry women secluding themselves on an island without any care for boys quite fun but the way it was described in this movie was just weird. While most women have some sage hurt and angry they are clearly a form of sexism. I would have turned the film into disgust if the roles were overthrown. This movie is something to look perhaps only once or twice. It is not a thriller it should be categorical as just strange.
