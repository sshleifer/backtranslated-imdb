This was on the 30th Anniversary DVD for cereal candles, sparkling itself, but not this. Nowhere else did I see Mel Brook's name here and I can guess why, it has a lot more sense not to be associated with this pilot. My Gawd, who would get this funny. Sure you can have a race problem but for me it just was not funny, well it caused it's simply not funny. It's like the writers did not even try to be funny, just cash in on being tied up with choking cereals. Did they expect this show to go for several seasons when doing this pilot? Flat out, they did not care. It was a quick cash cow that gave thanks no money. I guess it is useful for historical reasons only, or only to demonstrate how stupid and inimaginable Hollywood writers can.
