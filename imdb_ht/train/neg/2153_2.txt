The 3-D featured in "The Man That's Not There" stands for DUMB, DUMB, DUMB! This unmatched comedy features 3-D disgusting effects that make the 3-D effects of "Jaws 3", "Amityville 3", and "Friday 13th Part 3" look better by comparison. Not to mention the film is the extreme assinin. This was one of many 1983 movies featuring the pop-off screens. Steve Guttenberg and Jeffrey Tambor were trapped in this disorder, but at least he did not kill their careers. Tambor would go to star on the HBO at the "Larry Sanders Show" and Ron Howard's office box breaking "How Grinch Stole Christmas", while Guttenberg follows this flop with "Police Academy" and "Cocoon". What's these projects instead of here in "the man who was not there". If you do, you will regret it. <br /> 1/2 * (from four)
