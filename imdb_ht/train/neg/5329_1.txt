As a true Elvis fan, this film is a total embarrassment and the script is a disaster. The movie opens with the lovely son "Stay away" and the landscape of the Grand Canyon gives hope to viewers in something special. Elvis gets to the picture with his talent is wasting great time, especially on the rest of the featured songs. I've been sitting in this movie twice, just to make sure it's a piece of junk !!! 1 out of 10 !!!
