Shame really - very rarely I watch a movie and I feel ashamed at the end. I saw quite a few of Ira Levin's adaptations - 'Rosemary's Baby' and 'Stepford's Wives' - and both of them, but this just did not appeal to me. Graphic plot - a dramatic award winning (Michael Caine) decided to kill one of his former (Christopher Reeve) and his script writers for his own success - I was excited. I like thrillers, Michael Caine a good actor, Sidney Lumet is a good director and Ira Levin's job is generally good. I will not spoil it for anyone who has not seen it yet, but I would say there are LOADS in Torsion and Turn. So its many types are hard to explain the movie's plot line in detail, without giving it away. I loved the first ... 45 minutes, before the twists and turns began to arrive and at this point my interest and pleasure began to fade out. Even though I have to give Lumet credit for the very fun ending that made me laugh loudly. <br /> <br /> The main cast - Michael Caine, Christopher Reeve, Dyan Cannon and Irene Worth - all were brilliant in their role. Though Worth obviously false accent Russia has gotten on my nerves a little (nothing personal Irene, I think the false accent of any actor would irritate me). Not sure that the character Cannon was meant to be annoyingly funny but Dyan managed to annoy and entertain - at the same time. Anyone who reads this - I do not want you to be put-off watching this because of my opinion - give it a chance, you can love it, you can not. It's all about opinion.
