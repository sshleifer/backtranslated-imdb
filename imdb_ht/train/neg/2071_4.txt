I had two reasons to watch this swashbuckler when it was broadcast on Danish television yesterday. First of all, I wanted to see Gina Lollobrigida - and here I was not disappointed. She looks gorgeous. Second of all, through reading on the film I had the impression that he felt absurd humor by unlike what can be found in Philippe de Broca's film. Against this, however, I was sadly disappointed. I found the jokes predictable (apart from a few witty remarks on the subject of war) and the characters completely one dimension. Also, the action scenes are made in a strange mechanical and unenspired fashion, with no sense of drama at all. I kept it watching until the end, but I was bored very quickly and just sat there, waiting for the scenes with Lollobrigida.
