Do not waste your time on this movie. It could be good, but the finish was one of the lamest I've ever seen. I seriously need to wonder how the people involved and doing in this movie could have watched the final scene and thought, "Yes! Now there's a finish!" and patted themselves on the back on it. For me it seemed more like they just ran out of mind! They built up the final scenes to have a cool twist, but instead just let all build-up fall flat on his face. When the last shot would be dark and I heard the music music start I was in shock - I could not believe what I saw and that someone might even call that end. The best thing anyone can do with this movie is to write down and give it some substance. Seriously, I would really like to find people who came up with one in a room, watch them in the face and say - WTF ?? !!!!
