My husband and I were intrigued by the spectacle - a strongly entrusted South Woman and a personal privacy to resolve the crime for the LAPD. The first season was due to see TV for us. Unfortunately, the stories of his personal life in the second quarter became so tedious and worthy of the strong character that we stopped watching. My husband and I were troubled by the episode where he tried to hide from her mother the fact that she is shacked. But the deal breaker was the episode where he hid his possible pregnancy from his boyfriend, but he told his boss. Why would a strong woman, middle woman do these things? The answer is not. In addition, my husband and I pick out the bad guy with almost perfect accuracy. It is almost always a white or female man presented in the scene of the murder scene or an idealized family. Does not script writer can do something original from time to time? As I mentioned, we are not viewers. We prefer to show that not betray the characters and insult our intelligence.
