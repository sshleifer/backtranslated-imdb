I agree with these reviews I've read here, and I have no word defined as a turkey like this, but despite everything, I still can find a reason for movies like this to exist. Are you remenber the happy days in which video was a prosperous business, and a lot of movies were made with the only reason to fill the shelves in the video stores? this movie came out of this period and I can imagine that was the only reason for which it was produced and the same happened with many, many, many other stinkers. Do you remember "rambo" imitation? and many slashers in Z classes? I still feel nostalgia for this period. About this movie I can say I did not waste my time watching it because I pressed the button fast after the fifteen minutes first, just get a very funny scene in which a guy has pushed an ax against head that explodes because, as you perfectly notice, are made of plastic. And on the end, well, it was so badly filmed I could not understand what happened. That's the same, I did not follow the existing plot at all. But boys, video-age was a great age despite movies like this.
