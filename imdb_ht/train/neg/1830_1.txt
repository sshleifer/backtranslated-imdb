This is the worst movie I've ever seen. I do not cry. Next time it comes over, I'll just always run myself in a wall. it would be more enjoyable to sit in an emergency room trying to explain a doctor why my brain was swollen than trying to make it into that movie again. <br /> I hope black and stiller never work together on a bad project again. Both good comedy, so I was shocking this was so awkward. <br /> <br /> if they've done it all over again, I'm pretty sure they would have decided not to do it. As before the money, they must have lost a ton. not really- because the special effects (all 2 of them) were awful.
