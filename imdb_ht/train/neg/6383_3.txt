Gayniggers from outer space are a short film about black, gay foreigners who explore the galaxy until they stumble on Earth. To be gay, their goal is to have a men-only universe in which all are gay. Therefore, when they discover women or "animal animals" live on Earth, they are at first frightened; Eventually they decided to eliminate all women on the planet and liberate the male population. <br /> An offensive title with a racist scenario, homophobic and sexist, albeit probably intended as a satire, gives this movie some shocking value. However, there are small sub-substances. As another review outlined, there are some jokes besides the names of characters (eg ArmInAss); I think I laugh once at one gay joke. I think I got the point of the movie quickly, a satire of bad science fiction, but after that I had enough; I keep wanting the movie already completed (and it's a short movie!). Not brilliant or particularly well written.
