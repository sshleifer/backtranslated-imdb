As others have been targeted outside this film is a charge of unpretentious drivel for mindless or masochists. <br /> We all know after trainspotting and acidic houses that Scotland is one of the most depressing places in the first world. But unlike trainspotting and acidic houses without a good dose of humorous or frustrating movie movies as this does not work. And even more importantly without a decent movie a movie will not work and nothing new, inspire or think provokes the script for this movie. <br /> <br /> The fact that this movie won a couple of Bafta shows how bad the British movie industry is at the moment. I thought Aussie's film industry was very bad at the moment but unfortunately the British industry is even worse. <br /> This movie is so bad I would not even worry about renting it in the weeklies section. > <br /> Do yourself a favor and give this movie a wide berth.
