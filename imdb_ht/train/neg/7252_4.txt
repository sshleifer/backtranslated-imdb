DEZYEMI is one of these independent productions, made by new evolution, but does not have all the usual flaws that shed the most films. It has a definite story, it has adequate to act, the photography is very good, the hero and the bad guy are both formidable, and the background music is not overdue. This is a New Release DVD, so people will be looking here to see if it's worthwhile. I do not know where all 10's come from, as there is no way this movie is that good --- even if you're the movie's mom. <br /> <br /> The last movie we saw in a Warner's trailer theater at J K Rawlings's many likes and excellent books, the Order of the Phoenix. In comparing the discovery with PHOENIX, considering that PHOENIX (as was made by Warners) had no history, certainly no actor director allowed the photography was horrible, and the sound-sonic sound was just a mess. I rated Phoenix a "1" because the scale does not go lower. The discovery is 4 times better - at all times. <br /> <br /> If you have the opportunity, give the discovery a chance. Remember, this is not the "Decoy 3 - Shooting" or any nonsense. It's original. If your expectations are not blocked by the crazy results "10" here, you might just enjoy the movie on its own theme.
