I must say that there is nothing wrong with low budget films, so this was not my problem with it. My problem with it is that I felt like I was watching my next neighbor's home movie. IMO everything about it just seemed like a guy writing out a quick story, grabbed a camera, and started shooting. I understand how difficult this should be effectively, but when I'm paying rent a movie, I hope to feel like I'm watching some kind of professional movie made. <br /> <br /> Jan Schneider has a great summary, is a great actor, and has been fine in this movie. Others in it were not. I understand how to be fun, and cheaper to use friends, and family as the cast, but it does not make for convincing acting. It seemed like the way he shot, he was trying to give much of the scene a more interesting look, but when writing, drawing, and acting they have to start with, the type of style is not needed, and it is a distraction . <br /> Also on a technical level, it has digital artifacts all over the place. At the first stage of all those fine machines, when a scan was slowed into them, they appeared in jerk back and forth just a little. The problem is not in my viewing equipment, (Benq PE-8700 84 "diagonal) but somewhere in production. I've never seen the kind of associate of a professional film made before. Then there was sound they did not make any voice-overs, which can be ok unless it sounded like the track in this movie. It sounded like the build of microphone on the camera.
