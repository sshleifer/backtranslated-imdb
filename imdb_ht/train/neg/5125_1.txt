As a young pastor I've heard good about this movie. Then I look at her. The act was not the best. This is forgiven. This is the message that does not: Give Jesus your life and everything will change - you'll be attacked best, make amazing catches, stop fumbling, start doing touchdowns, and even make the playoffs. All because Jesus magically turned out to be awful bug in All-American athletes. I laughed loudly when a coach quoted the script to explain Kicker's why he missed the field goal. But wait, that's not all. You will find a brand new truck, a $ 6000 rise, and you and your wife's lest and infertility will suddenly end in pregnancy - twice. Then you will win the state championship because God helps a weak kicker to the goal field to win 12 yards beyond it ever before - and in the wind, no less - all because "God wanted him to do read. " Then you will win the state championship again next year. None of this good thing would happen if the team was not chosen to follow Jesus wholeheartedly. <br /> Here's what I've taken away from the movie: God can do anything he wants to do whenever he wants to do it - and it's all about making our lives better, easier, and more enjoyable. He chooses his favorite team and helps them win games. What is the Bible that is based on this story? I'll bet St. Stephen wanted that he knew the keys to such a safe life before he was stoned to death. Someone should make this film before 10 of the 11 apostles were killed for following Jesus. He would save them all a lot of trouble.
