If someone wants to do a really, movie really bad, "Wizards of the Lost Kingdom" really lay a yardstick by measuring the depth of cruelty. Start with the Chewbacca pseudo that follows around the main character ... There are some poor traits in a white baggy "furry" baggy that looks as if it was stitched together in abandoned pieces of carpets. Work your way slowly, painfully, to more-not-so-special effects that well refuse the viewer from suspicion of disbelief. Add a gnome field (just for heck of it). On second thought, skip this movie entirely and find something else to do for a while and a half.
