OK so I was bored and I looked at him all the way through. This movie is too serious, harmless and subtle. The story is so of sugar your teeth red on the opening titles. One of the two 'traumatized children' learns about the 'Fairy' story Fairy style that frankly left me rather traumatized. It uses the Irish 'blarney' in a stereotype style to only expect Irish ones to ever see it. The goal of the children is frankly changed after the first attempt at an 'OIRISH' accent. All of them are pumping these out.
