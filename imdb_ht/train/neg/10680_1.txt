SPOILERS AHEAD <br /> This is one of the worst movies ever made - it's simple. There is not a quality buyout on this movie. The first 10 minutes are quite tricky - they actually lead you to believe that this movie will be shocking and will have you on the edge of your seat. Instead, you will spend 83 minutes punching yourself while watching stolen and wrong performing running scenes without any organization. The lake was ridiculous, it looked like an aquarium, and it was the same plant in different parts of the lake bed. Characters show advanced teleportation powers, for example Alex Thomas who fall into the lake (drink), and then finish up on his boat in an impossible position. Angie Harmon has performed a pitiful performance as Kate, which has worsened by the ongoing continuous breakthrough dialogue that appears in the last minute by a fifth grade. An example of this would be when he said, "flashlight!" in such a way as stupid that it shows the threshold of how much a human body can cringe before it marches in half. Finally, this movie editing was not the most bizarre and terrible I've ever seen. It was like cameramen being a bunch of people who donated trucks by scientists. An example of this would be when we suddenly found a highlights of the light on Alex's car. I would bet that little had no time to pass this movie editing. The finish was absolutely pathetic. The writers were obviously trying to create some sort of mysterious sketch line that made the viewer say, "oh yeah!" Instead, we'll let you see some mute paintings in a spider that somehow fits in the story line. Unfortunately, there is not a perspective of the outside millions that could save this movie from being a peasant piece of crap. <br /> I give this one .5 out of 10, .5 were out of the fact that this movie was recorded on film instead of becoming a photo book.
