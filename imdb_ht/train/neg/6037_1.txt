Moron and girlfriend do some ceremonies to resurrect the dead, trying to prove that the dead can not return to life. Not surprisingly, they are resurrecting a dead soul that begins to cut off with an ax, and the next few of the adult colleges will tell stories around a campfire. The guy and the ax turn up and start hacking up the stories telling the story. The group calls the cops, the cop sees without diving all over and thinking it's a mountain lion (!?) And soon after is axed by some distorted killer that may or may not be a ghost. The Little Splatter movie was filmed at age-ages, but where several characters brought flashlights and talk as if they were there in the night, and wanted to send a rocket signal to attract attention. A guy has a gun in one hand and bullets in the other, but does not bother to load him, then after he's finally charming, he has several opportunities to shoot the killer, but do not bother, because that would be finish the movie too early. And he threw the gun away! Also prejudiced are characters that show no emotions and do not look bit at least concerned after their friends are chopping up pieces and disgusting effects (the human heart looks like a piece of chicken meat, the blowing machine at the end has clearly been a car model) and horrible dialogues and some really ugly women stripping does not help. And in the end she tries to get away with her incoherence in saying that it was all the same inventions of the same age-old college that tells the story of campfire at the beginning of this film. <br /> <br /> Then the killer turns up for real in the past scene between them in pieces. Again. <br /> <br /> Mediocrity in its kind, good only for some unintelligible laugh. <br /> <br /> * 1/2 from ****
