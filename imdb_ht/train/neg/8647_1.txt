Amateur in the extreme. Working cameras especially overwrought - documentary camera operators do not need to turn around ALL time. <br /> <br /> The script is really inhuman, and the act is even worse. On top of that, the story is disjointed and shed - and some gaping holes in logic. At a lead point they would like to get jailed in order to rub shoulders and suspect Al-Quada workers, and thus get an interview with Osama. I found the story entirely incredible as a result of many defects. "Winx" / The role really shows a rash, boy frat boy. The only article of interest really is that the filmmakers made in reality films aside. It's really a shame to waste the opportunities to do something interesting. <br /> Who is funding this crap?
