I usually not one to say that a movie is not worth watching, but this is certainly an extrusion circumstance. The only real head for this film is Cornelia Sharpe, looking rather attractive, and the fact that this film is really short. The plot of the movie is incredible boring and goes virtually anywhere in the movie. None of the characters are even remotely interesting and there is no reason to care about anyone. I'm not sure why Earth Sean Connery has agreed to make this movie, but it should definitely go on this one. The only reason I could see to see this film is if you are a dead-made Sean Connery fan and simply want to see everything he did. Save this one for the latest though. <br /> Well, if you do not do some miracle to see this despite my review (or any of the other comments on this site), then I hope you enjoy it more than I did. Thank you for reading.
