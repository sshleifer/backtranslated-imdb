I know John Singleton in a clever guy 'cause he did Boyz N Hood, so how did he write and direct this? It's like the pilot of a bad "going to college for the first time" soap youngsters, a parade of boring stereotypes and clicks and some free violence thrown in making it a commercial proposal, I guess. Who would guess victims of date-rape dumps for seafood? Those who do not have the darkness should be preyed by a neo-Nazis group (and they might be spot-up with a black and a Jew - just to laugh!) Even the flu story of Laurence Fishburne's reactionary teacher just irritated me and I love The guy, it's like everyone involved with this movie just lost the plot. Except Busta Rim, of course. Big ups.
