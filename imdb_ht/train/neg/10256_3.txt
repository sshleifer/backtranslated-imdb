Your idea will not be satisfied by this budget budget doomsday budget; But pray, who's willing? A juvenile couple spend the current end of the world in the hidden lab of some alien masquerades as Church people. <br /> <br /> Small _apocalyptically themed outing, the end of the world has the intelligence and lack of both brio and style of peppers the same 50s as the movies. And it's not just that, but EOTW plays like a hybrid ?? Do not just doomsday but cover ramps as well. The villain of the movie is a well-known character actor. <br /> <br /> This cynical slapdash looks like a piece of copyright exploitation, which significantly '70s genre that seems today so amusingly outdated. Anyway, the transvano secret lab is some nasty pieces of deco futuristic! Christopher Lee is proud of the end of the world; but the end of the world is not in all its pride!
