I never finished this movie for a reason, it was terrific and that's just to act. I was not even sure what the movie was about TBH and did not make much sense and violence was awful. I mean uzusally I love some nude in a movie (lol) but it was just sick because of what happened. ALL characters are annoying me and he's just full of screaming loudly and the camera was shaken in parts and it looked like an end to the Blair and projects, but without any kind of good. This is one of the worst movies I've seen in a long time and would like my time to come back. I would not recommend this movie to anyone or even consider it. (N)
