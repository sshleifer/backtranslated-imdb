I'm a big fan of Arnold Vosloo. Finally seeing him as star in a recent movie, not just a bit of party, made me happy. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, I took the college movie appreciation and the only thing I could say I did not like was that the movie was made in an abandoned part of town and there was no background traffic or loie lookie. <br /> I must say that the act leaves something to be desired, but Arnold is an excellent actor, I have to chalk it up to disgusting directions and throw in support to let something to be desired. <br /> I love Arnold Vosloo, and she made the movie to see. Otherwise, I would write it as another disgusting movie. <br /> I found the brutal and necessary rape scene, but the actors who got to the end were pretty good. But the sound effects of shooting-out were very bad. Some glitches in the movie (continuity) but are negligible to consider the low-caliber of the movie. <br /> Of all I enjoyed the movie, because Arnold Vosloo was in it. <br /> Jackie
