There was no characterization of this movie and really shows how much this talentless hack led this need to learn his craft. All her characters in this movie were so incredible and I could care less. The best point in this movie was credit at the end and the shower hours long after this caused me to feel so dirty that I wasted money on this fragrant charge. Hey genius .... triads and yakuza are from different places to learn something about Asian culture. The dog scene in this felt so tacked over and useless. This DVD proves helpful I love my new coaster. So the kids do not waste your cash on this crap to buy hostels instead.
