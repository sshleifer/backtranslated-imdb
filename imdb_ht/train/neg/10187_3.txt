Stupid, mindless drivel on a plane assembled in hours by mechanics who never worked on aircraft (piloted by Burgess Meredith) chase a Porsche race car that runs on storage-old gasoline storage, driven by Lee Major, and Chris Makepeace as the runaway technology -Who can McGyver spare parts in a radio receiver that can pick up frequencies together, and somehow learn how to locate and use chemicals to make high explosives in a perfectly peaceful society. As moron as it sounds. Terrible garbage at Burgess Meredith, but Chris Makepeace can at least be forgiven on the grounds that this was only his second film.
