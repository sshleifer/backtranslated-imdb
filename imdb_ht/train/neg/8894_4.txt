This movie is funding incarnarity, a straight 11/10 on the bottom of the scale. The function of the accents as well as the tight spandex pants pants are just staggering. Yanks, although Scotland's realities can be as colorful, if you ever go there is not expected to be very much in a chance to "dance out" controversy with the locals. Also, do not try to sue local opinion of the otherwise fine art of Tapdancing. There are a couple of infectious-and-dance performers, but the plot is far cheese and linear, and the dialogue is often too weak. I also doubt if anyone would want to be stuck in a timewarped 18th-century Scottish town in the Boondocks rather than gay New York City. Perhaps it was not such a great sacrifice that priests had left Brigadoon, maybe it was just trying to get the hell out of dump. <br /> <br /> See it for the nice alternative-reality to see what a Christopher Streed Day-parade in Scotland would look like on LSD. Other than that I would only recommend it to Hollywood mental accomplice.
