This was a movie I could not wait to see! So I finally got it and I was very disappointed. For starters, the movie was so tiny about New York, just a bunch of confusing shots in buildings, streets, bridges and cafes. It really does not remain focused on magic in New York. Another thing that changed my mind was the French Film put inside this movie I know that it is a remake, but it is not a French style renewal! Anyway, here you will notice the elements that remind you of French movies, such as long and dirty scene, no or little talk and of course everybody is smoking French style! The story follows many lives (too much for my taste) and somehow seems connected to the end. I feel like there was no dedication to the characters as much as there was in their story. The film was too short to cover the single end of the individual single one. So we can see about 30 people for about 5 minutes each. And there are you having 120 minutes! if you like active scene scene and this is not the movie for you! I give it 4 just because I love New York and I liked the cast!
