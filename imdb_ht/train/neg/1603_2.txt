If it was not for the performance of Barry Diamond and Art Evans as the clueless stoners, I would have no reason to recommend this to anyone. The center trail of a 10-year reunion, which takes place in a supposedly abandoned high school (looks more like a proprietary one-year low-fiscal year), and students Disrupting the class pulled a very traumatic tour on. This student wants to kill all the class for revenge. John Hughes fell in love with her too much character, as only one student died as well as the lunchtime lady (Goonies' Anne Ramsey). We are leading to believing that horny coupled to death, but never sees something blasted! This is a terrible film that continues Lanpoon's national spiral throughout the 80s and 90s.
