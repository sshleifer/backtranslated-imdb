I have not yet seen anyone addressing this movie and I think I can be the first. <br /> It was awful. I actually did not look at her end. It was like watching a boring soap or a really good one (all the crap soaps). The actors were poor and scenarios were bad. People who rated it 10/10 have no idea what it is about to. The script was awful. 2 People have been in an angry conversation involving threats and you expect the good guy to say some really good stuff and beating the crap out of it but no. He says "If you do that ... I'll hurt you" Hahahahaha. If comedy is your thing, look away. Please do not watch this movie because ... It's CRAP !!! <br /> Summary: Poor acting, bad fight, bad script. <br /> <br /> Do not Look! Of course this is in my opinion.
