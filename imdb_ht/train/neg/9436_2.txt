Unhinged follows the typical scheme of Slasher's early 80's trend. Pretty girl in danger. I have to give it to filmmakers who used a helicopter for some of the early-trip-vacations, or actually think for a second there's going to be the quality of production. Watching "Unhinged" was like seeing an amateur actress class going into her warm-up. Some of the left, seriously lit, the overlong scenes are played out with the gusto in a Valium overdose. I wonder why they did not just put the advertisement-cards on cameras for the actress would not have been constantly changing their gaze. The two main girls were obviously chosen for T & A factors rather than talent. Laurel Munson as the main Terry Chick is as interesting as watching dry paintings. Two nude scenes make for a teenage thrill. Janet Penner and Virginia Stay as the crazy / creepy daughter and chic mom find themselves trapped and competing for Worst Acting Legs. Long pause, weird expression, emphasis on the wrong word, it's all there and is a pleasure for those of you who love bad movie. Scenes of sudden changes and black-outs time you could drive a Mack truck. Lightning cartoon lightning through shots without even bothering to show the sky. Eighties eyeshadow the viewer's attack. But I know, he grew up on me. I felt sorry for that. I wanted to embrace it, kiss it in boo-boos and do it better. The finish does not make up for the damage it caused but I grinned anyway. I have my own theory regarding all the "banned" hype and hope that anyone choosing to see this movie does so with substantial substance abuse and a sense of humor. Otherwise.
