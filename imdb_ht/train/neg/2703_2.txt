MINOR SPOILERS! <br /> Well, I just got up late and watch this movie, especially because I enjoyed and rated some of Singleton's earliest works like "Boyz n Hoodie". However, I must say this was a big disappointment and it's all I hate about understanding, clicking on, so-called "message" movies. The act is mostly poor, (pop stars and models do not necessarily make good actors ... take notes), situations are difficult to swallow, (victim of rape gets lesbian lesbian ... ... please!), But worst of all It reinforces each screwing up the stereotypes you can think of. In the second half of the film it has become the lowest cartoon of its characterization, which makes you lose any torn of sympathy you might have for players with its dimensions. <br /> Not once is any valid point made about the inherent causes of racism and culture, gender and political ignorance. As a result it simply ends up sensationalizing the results of these problems. It's message is contradictory, causing a sense of confusion and a general lack of joint plots. As for the film conclusions I found it predictable, embarrassing, exploited and mildly offensive. For a movie called "Higher Learning" I have to say all I learned is to avoid seeing it again. <br /> <br /> If you want a true comment on some of the themes that this movie completely overlooks elaborate on then goes to hire "American History X" .... unless you've just watched it for Tyra Banks then go hired a life.
