A brutality, American family, vacation in the west, discovered a strange ghost town in the middle of the desert. Little is known that this ghost town was once a test site for nuclear bombs, with a deadly presence followed. I generally like mystery-horror films like this. The "Cube", the "Duel" Spielberg and the "Birds" are the best examples of movies that do not give answers but we let you intrigue and want more. Apparently, "Disappearance" writer / director Walter Klenhard tried to do just that kind of movie, and whether he succeeded is up to the viewer. I personally think he got about halfway the way, then the movie just shed. The actors are all just "ho-hum". They are not especially bad but as a hearing never really feels frightened and they react in unrealistic ways. Is anyone else absolutely SICK's character just walking out of it to investigate strange sounds?!?! At least give some kind of justification to do this!?!?! <br /> As far as made-to-TV movie goes to a higher average just for sure. Klenhard's leaders should be commensurate with the treacherous environment of the desert for everything he has to offer and some of the environmental impact. There's a really cool scene where two characters get an old nuclear test strip the sand has been completely dissolved in glass so far as the eye could see. I wonder if that was real ?? <br /> <br /> No gore talking about, and the 'animals' ?? or what ever the hell it is after these people ?? Never show, we do not mention that we never even give a real sign of what they are (mutants, aliens, ghosts or ancient evil Americans? Oh, that really array it down for us!) or where from. <br /> <br /> There are plenty of clich√©s here, too. Why is he city-famous in these types of films still really, really dumb? Why is there always someone old guy thinking is crazy that turns out to be correct? Why? Why? Why? How to build a NEW scenario, folks! <br /> <br /> "Disappearance" is trying different and smart, but ultimately failed in that in many ways it's too familiar to us fans of direct-to-video films. Hey, I've seen many films worse, and disappearance is not bad, it's just too ?? Average. <br /> 4/10.
