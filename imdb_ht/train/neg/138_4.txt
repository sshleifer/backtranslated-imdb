Good: I loved this movie because it was the first horror film I've seen in a long time that actually scared me. The act was not too bad, and the "Cupid" killer was credible and disturbing. <br /> <br /> The bad: The story line and the plot of this movie is extremely weak. There just was not much of it. The way the killers killed his victim were extremely horrible and disgusting. I do not recommend this movie to anyone who can not handle gore. <br /> Overall: A good scary, but a bad story. <br /> ** from *****
