Cavemen was by far the biggest burden of crap I ever wasted time I watched. This show based on the Geico networks is less fun then a current 30 sec ad for Geico. The half-edged makeup was said to be the least, hard to imagine a caveman with white teeth preferences even after going to the dentist. This show could have been potential for a comic series if they were able to throw the cast out of their advertising, which in it itself made for a disgusting show. Perhaps if the writers were the same from Geico's ads this may have had a chance, rather the pilot missed a good story line. I give this show a 1 out of 10, I'd love to put a zero out of 10 but that was not an option. I pray for a quick death this show, I would give it less then 5 bits before dying a worthy death.
