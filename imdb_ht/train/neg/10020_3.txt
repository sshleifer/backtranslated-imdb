Vijay Krishna Acharya's 'Tashan' is an over-hyped, stylized, productive. Be sure to read one of the most stylish films, but when it comes to content, even the masses will reject this one. Why? The movie movie is as amateur as a 2 year old baby. Script is king, without a good script even the greatest director of all-time can not do anything. Tashan is produced by the most successful Yash Raj Films' production banner and Mega Stars featured in it. But nothing on earth can save you if your script is bland. Head Down! Performance: Anil Kapoor, is a veteran actor. But how could it be a role as this? Akshay Kumar is great actor, in fact it is the sole saving favor. Karena Kapoor never looked so hot. It looks stunning with your leaves, all stand. Saif Ali Khan does not get him due in here. Sanjay Mishra, Manoj Phawa and Yashpal Sharma are wasted. 'Tashan' is a boring film. The movie chess in the box office, you should keep away.
