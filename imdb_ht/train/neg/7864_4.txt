Hills have eyes II that you would expect it to be and nothing more. Of course he will not make an Oscar nominated film, it's just the most fun that you can just lose yourself in for 90 minutes. The plot is fundamentally on a National Guard trainer group that finds themselves fighting against the horrific mutations mountains in the last days of formation in the desert. It's just to fight back to the whole movie, including a lot of violence (which is basically the entire movie) as blood and intestines are constantly flying around the whole thing, and also yet another graphic scene scenes is freewly thrown into the audience's trauma. <br /> I would give the hills the eyes of II 4 out of 10 for the most fun, and that's just. Although even then, I found myself looking at me more and more as the movie went on, as it started to drag because of the fact it continued to try and hit the audience with Gore graphics and the occasional just off to ensure that the audience remains awake. The Hills II eyes are just decent entertainment, something to spend time if you're bored, and nothing else. <br /> 4/10
