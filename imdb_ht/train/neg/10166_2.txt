If he wanted to be accurate, he should choose some Frisco natives and not a bunch of actors NY who do not know anything about Sucka's free (not Sucker free). I lived in SF all my life, and as here's not talking or acting the way these actors did. Everything was over-dramatized, and the only cat I saw out of the Bay was the JT Bigga Figga and her little became kouro as a rapper. No shock that he was the only one in the movie that really dressed like cats out here (ie his Jersey warrior). Not once did I notice anyone wearing any Giants or 9ers gear; instead it was put in some made-up cheese SF or Oakland jerseys that do not even sell around here. HP does not have any bribery, black and Asian gangbanger blasts by wearing head or wristbands and colors in China's African or Olympic team, nor does each Chinese gangster wear a jersey yao ming and try with black sound while shooting hoops. Further, while there is now a significant yuppie community that has invaded the mission, all that has been shown has some white dude and a self-proclaimed "100% West Coast Boriqua." This is not New York! Puerto Rican here is a few and far between, with the Latinos of the Mission are very, very different from the one that has been shown here, who was without a doubt from NY. Also, HP is not just the black neighborhood of the City. An accurate illustration showed the drama between HP together in their own hood as well as vs. Fillmore, Sunnydale, Lakeview, etc. This movie could have been better if Lee did some more homework and had a better storyline to work with.
