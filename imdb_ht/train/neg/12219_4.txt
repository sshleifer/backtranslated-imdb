This was a strange movie. It started out pretty good. A solid sound track behind flash images of throat and destruction like our psychopath did its thing. <br /> <br /> Next comes down "down autumn" here I could say I was in for a real movie movie "B". Poor act, I mean how hard is it to hold a gun and act like a cop? These guys could not. After the death scene of our psychopath, we get the opening credit and the movie starts ... From this point on it is bad acting big boobs, the occasional bucket of blood and harm done death scene. br> <br /> That said I gave the movie a card because in spite of its flaws it held a sort of creepiness that I just could not quite shake. <br /> I do not recommend this movie but I must admit I seemed to get worse.
