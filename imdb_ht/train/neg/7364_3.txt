In 1692, Salem, a child lying on the slave's participation in magic throws a whole community into a mess. The costume drama begins by Claudette Colbert and Fred MacMurray is not clogged, though neither is it a vivid illustration of contagious hysteria. Workers by three writers (Walter Ferris, Durward Grimstead, and Bradley King), the story elements are rather interesting (especially coming from Hollywood in 1937), though someone since he has Arthur Miller in the "Crucible" up melodrama On display here will not be tolerated for a long time. The biggest problem with the picture can be laying in the casting: Colbert and MacMurray are a sickly-matched pair of lovers prevented by hunting witch, MacMurray have been far too contemporary a presence for these environments. * 1/2 from ****
