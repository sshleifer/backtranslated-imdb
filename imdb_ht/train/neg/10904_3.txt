I hired this movie awaiting a few laughs, hopefully enough to keep me amused but I was sorely mistaken. This movie showed very minimal moments of humor and the sad jokes made me horror and shame for her entire hiring ... The purpose of a 10-15 age group, this film will certainly allow viewers out of the boundaries feel very satisfying. Worth no more than 3 votes is recognized for anyone who does not want to waste 2 hours of life.
