If you want to watch a good movie about how women can fight against sexual assault, then this movie is not the movie that you want to watch. It was a social comment about a woman who had been victimized and back fighting. Spoiler: Rosario Dawson turns the charts on his attackers. Instead of using the criminal justice system, victims of resorts use vigilance. It's the sense of nullifies the judiciary. The film "The Defendant" was a better movie because the victim used the judiciary and wins. What does the "offspring" say to victims of attack that they should resort to violence? Are victims any better than the defendant? No !!!
