I would give this film a zero out of ten, but I'll give it a two. One reason is that Shah Rukh Khan appears in the movie, which is not really a reason. The last point is that Rani appears in this movie and makes a smooch and Kamal. I love Rani very much and have a respect that she is a great actress. That's why I did not enjoy her in this movie Kamal Kiss, but she does not have any great deals. Anyway enough in the room scene that made this movie apparent, allows actually to talk about this movie. Is it good or bad, I think it's a completely trash movie that made me yawn. I was a fantastic critic, you can see my other 250+ reviews by clicking on my name, I have great taste. The movie is not fun is one thing and if this would be believed to be difficult to hit movies, why there is no moral in this movie. It is a partial film that is not a true story and it feels. Watching Kamal kissing these actresses make me sick, Man cant kiss well anyway.
