Why did I waste 1.5 hours in the life I watched? Why was this movie even done? Why do I also comment on this movie? <br /> <br /> <br /> A criminal said that this movie was patience to look and it was not for everyone. I can not know who this movie is for. Maybe after dropping a stroke of acid, DOCUMENT, another can look at this and make some sense out of it. It is incoherent, it's not experimental, it's plain and simple waste. The movie does not follow any line drawings, just when you think you have something, well ... you do not. <br /> I think the end has brought some finality of the film (no pun intended), the viewer gets a glimpse of what might go on. I do not think I put a shingle here, not that it would have trouble. This film is another must miss the world of filmdom.
