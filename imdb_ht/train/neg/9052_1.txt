I respect the fact that this is a very popular show. However, in comparison with the inept, etiologic, and inaugural 1970 classic 1970 classic, this show was probably destined to be less-than-mediocre ... though it was running for 11 years, which does not necessarily make it any good. This show formed an all-too-integral part of my childhood (he was about to re-run every night, and guess whose parents had looked at him and laughing it up), but it's one of my memories Do not miss. And now that I actually saw the movie, I can give this series an accurate criticism. On its own, it's not nearly "2 out of 10" bad. However, the characters on this show are nothing like that in the movie. Some of them are technically the same, but they're just the same in name. For example, since Alan Alda is anything like Donald Sutherland? His style of humor is totally different, as is its characterization and outlook. The new characters are not that great; they just used to make you miss what they are replacing. It's the same with the new actors (including Jamie Farr). The only thing that actually transmits in the series is Rada, who is still (though played by the same actor) simply a pale imitation of the original. What else? Oh, yeah. With a laughing streak (it did not matter if it was used in operating scenes or not), it came across as creepy, due to what's happening in other settings. And because it lasted nearly four times longer than the current Korean War, it took viewers of this rare temporal scroll that did not work out the world in cartoons. I never liked this show, and I never will.
