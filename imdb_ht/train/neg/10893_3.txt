This is one of those movies that should have way better than it turned out to be. I'm afraid to think what the modern Blockbuster-approve to be looked like, because the director's cut on DVD is made one of the season's proportions. Of course, you do not expect it to be the "godfather", but a class or two may come in handy. <br /> Also, there were many nice guys in this movie, but they were terribly under exploit. I love watching a savvy of writhe hotties around in the BVDs as much as the guy next, but even I may expect a little more. Not a total loss, though; At least we got a look at a Fuller's Dunk (covered) junk and truly troubling head. And Huntley Ritter looks even cuter than he did in "Bring It On" (and acting as well). There's always a silver lining, kids. You just have to look really hard for her. And occasionally, you must make use of your pause button.
