This movie is really jumping! I saw it as a 11 year old, and even then I thought it was very ridiculous! I would only recommend this movie to children under the age of 12. I really did not care for that, but I think it answered some very good questions that children should be aware of, such as: 1) Buying Early Earnings? 2) Should I lie (to my parents) about what I think they would not approve of? 3) Do money buy friends? 4) Do All Things Money? 5) Should I not tell my parents when someone tries to hurt me? Granted, these are very unrealistic situations, but I think if parents discuss these issues with their children, maybe they should watch this video too, in order to show / scare the lying children to have the potential to do you get wrong.
