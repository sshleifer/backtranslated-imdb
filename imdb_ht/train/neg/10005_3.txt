The second tent is not a New York scholar in less than 10 years to make a movie "Swedish" - first by Susan Sontag of "Brother Carl" (born in Sweden, with Swedish actors, no less!) Results? Oscar Wilde said it's best, in the Dickens' "Old Curiosity Shop": "One would have a heart of rock not to laugh at the death of Little Nell." Pretty much the same here. "Interiors" is full of sunshine trauma. ("I'm afraid of my anger." Look in the middle: "I do not like who I am.") Quotations are directly (using a polite theme) from Bergman to nearby parody. The incredibly involved family who keeps reminding us of how brilliant and talented are, to the point of strangulation. ("I read a poem to you the other day .. It was in - I do not know - The New Yorker." "Oh ... It was an old poem I worked on.") Far not taken Care about these people, however, I found them quite hilarious. Much of the dialogue is exactly like the funny thing from Allen's earliest movie - only he has directed his actor to play the right lines. No one threw himself into the movie, he has poor Mary Beth Hurt copying all his testers, intonations, and nectic habits, turning it into a nasty substitute (much like Kenneth Branagh's "Celebrity"). /> The basic scheme - dysfunctional and slowly dominoid mother - seems to arise more or less from Bergman's "light winter," the basic family melodrama deceived up with a lot of bitter outburst. It all comes in visual / aural store troubles: astonishingly scratching a paper pencil, immense surfing that limits the people walking on the beach. etc., etc. <br /> <br /> The Allen later "serious" films are less embarrassing, but also far less fun. I'll take "Interiors." Woody rarely made a funnier movie.
