I never read the book "A Rip off Time". To be honest honesty, after seeing the movie, do I really want to? Well, I should not review this movie I'm going to start with. Next I'll say that the TV movie is pretty forgettable. Do you know why I say that? Because I forget what's happening in it. I told you it was forgettable. To be honest, no TV movie will ever be better than "Merlin". How do I describe a TV movie? I never wrote a review for one before. Well, I'll just say that they usually have some celebrities. A rush in time includes only one. Alfre Woodard (Or Woodward, I'm not sure), the Oscar winner. <br /> <br /> The movie has to hit the special effects, a very interesting scheme, the scene that you go "WTF". The movie is incredibly bad and it makes you go "WTF". What did I expect? It's a TV movie. They are usually not good. As this one is. An hour's worm is a waste of time and a great short time. At his head off, you will most likely forget about the second it's over. Well, maybe not the second it's over. But within a few minutes. <br /> <br /> A rush of time: * / ****
