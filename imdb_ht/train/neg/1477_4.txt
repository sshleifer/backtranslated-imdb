I saw Dolemite and Godfather (Avenging) Dispensation, two other fine jobs in the bloxploitation canon of our friend Rudy Ray Moore. But this movie, the human tornado (aka Dolemite 2) will still hold a special place in my heart. For absolute inflatedness, lack of competence in film production, and absolute enthusiasm (frankly a little too much), the human tornadoes can not topple. <br /> <br /> The opening scene sets the tone. Our old palm dolemite is shacking up with a white woman, when some local racers gather the house for no good reason, and you would not know it! The woman in bed with dole oil is no other than the sheriff's wife. His cry when he saw him: "He's made me do it!" Dolemite's cry: "& $ * @ $ you are for real ???" Subtlety had never been his strongest point. <br /> <br /> Online? The cage is not a very young Ernie Hudson (in fantasy fame), the continuity mistakes (characters looking one way in one shot, and another in the next, Dolemite's suit changes color to each single shot of acts nightclubs), with Queen Bee's demonic eyes at her first stage. <br /> But real joy here is Rudy Ray Moore himself. Does the man really think he looked cool in this movie? I certainly do not know why, but you have to admire the sheer enthusiasm he has. If he would skip totally naked on a cliff, or barking his gang order in rhyme (eg: Quick! In the cave! I have a plan to leave that mother $ * @ (% & dig her own cellar!) The man commit it totally, it goes further, never so than any time it is doing kung fu .. The climate fight is filmed at high speed but occassionaly slows down leaving Rudy posing with his teeth grits .. I'm not if they wanted it too look like they sped up the movie as an effect or if they really wanted us to believe it was that fast. In any event, the "Matrix" it was not. <br /> <br /> Ton Humans, as much as the original Dolemite, is an incompetent movie in enormous proportions. But at least it's fun, and certainly you have to give credit to those people for the effort .. Just not that much .Enjoy with my hearty recommendations.
