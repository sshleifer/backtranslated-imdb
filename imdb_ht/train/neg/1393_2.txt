I thought watching video on corporate compliance was tedious. This movie went nowhere rapidly. What could be a bit scam half hour twilight episode back to a seemingly endless garbage of the movie on those parking cars, a picture of some dude pools in it (it really needs to answer his phone in the way) a printer Matrix dot does his job, and Heuy and Louey sit in a yellow light control repeating "T 10 less and counting" as if something interesting is going to happen. It's not so much to get your hopes. The best thing about this film is to see James Best and Gerald McC, in something else than having famous TV personality, and that is stretching to find anything good. And do not get me started on the music that was totally composed of a tympani, some mammals, and microphone feedback. This film is as close as I gave one one yet, but it gets 2 because I actually could end this insomnia cure, and did not have to leave in the middle. Avoid all money.
