Where did he criticize the democratic administration as well as the Republicans? After all, he served for 17+ years in a government body where his influence was unawareing. Oh I forgot about the 8 years it was the 2nd in order of the most powerful nation on Earth. The movie is pleased to show shots at a young Senator Gore asking why a NASA scientist had to change a conclusion from his scientific paper, but failed to ask about the complicity of Clinton / Gore in global warming. Probably too close to a election year, or maybe it would hurt the Hillary at '08. Either way it is a loose policy and people part of the bitter end. It offers no criticism of consumption, there is no criticism of capitalism, there is no way to be the history of industrial development that led us to this point in time <br /> At the end of this film Much more about Mr. Gore himself than on any real environmental issues we face. Mr. Gore if you really wanted to make a movie movie - reduce it & call it what it really is.
