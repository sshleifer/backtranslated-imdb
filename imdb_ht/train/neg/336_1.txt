Why is it that when a star reaches the star's top, they lose the good work of making a bad movie? Burt Reynolds some, then began to make dreadful Hal Needham car chasing flicks. Arnold Schwarzenegger became the hottest property in Hollywood, just inviting hacking on his head and the hero to expand the last Action. And here, Eddie Murphy deliberately clears the memory of Trade Place and 48 hours with this "family" flick of film, which is an incredible tedious, infinite, and generally terrible terrible misery in which the chance to see Charlotte Lewis's big breasts A tight blouse is the most appealing aspect of the entire movie. <br /> The story is worst. He worried social Murphy worker, contacted by mystical qualities and said he was the one. Choose for that, I hear you ask. His job is to save a Tibetan boy and mysterious power from a race of demons who want to rule the world. As the main demon, stylish actor Charles Dance looks terribly embarrassed to be in the movie, but hey, I'm sure he's been well paid for his talent. In all of Murphy's films, this is easily the worst. I have read some reviews that suggest that it is nice to see Murphy in an atypical role, in a form of non-formal formula in film, and while both the true injury points have not forgiven the fact that the movie - however atypical and Formula name it might be - is an absolute load of waste. <br /> <br />
