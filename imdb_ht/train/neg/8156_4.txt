Prom Night 2 is an OK movie horror but prom night is the best way to go with this movie about how Mary Lou's Queen Prom in 1957 gets killed by her boyfriend and returned 30 years later for revenge. This is Micheal Ironside and the movie stars of other actors OK and actresses such as Justin Louis (I), Wendy Lyon, Lisa Schrage and Richard Monette (I) .And some good performer scenes like Mary Lou kills the girl who is trying hiding in his locker by breaking the lockers together with how one of the students on the computer and her husband Lou Lou electrocutes to death. More than all this is an OK / good movie movie and my rating is 4 out of 10.
