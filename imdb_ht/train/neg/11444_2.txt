SNL is very funny but people say this is like looking at a short skateboard on SNL is a little mute voice. It's nothing like SNL, it's just a stupid piece of crap. Andy Samberg tries to act like Jon Heder, but fails. Although Jon Heder is only funny at Napoleon Dynamite Andy tries harder to tell him and those who think it is funny. <br /> Only funny people in the movie were Danny McBride and Bill Hader. The only part was decently funny and Andy was part of the pool. <br /> They could have made "quiet" a lot better if they did not make the scene fall 3 minutes freaking. > <br /> The part where it was pronounced H it is delayed. They try to go with it too long and half the time it looks like Andy is laughing while acting ... he's a terrible actor and he does not deserve to be in a movie. jokes and is for the simple minded people and the brain at a 10 year old level of comedy. That is approximately half the United States.
