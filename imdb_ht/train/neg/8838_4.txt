There is similarity between Ray Lawrence's "Jindabyne" and his latest film "Lantana" ?? a dead body and its consequences for life is already dysfunctional. But whereas "Lantana" offers some hope and resolution, "Jindabyne" leaves everything unresolved in a weak way that will allow most viewers to meet, perhaps even cheated. <br /> <br /> The scenario - the result of a fisherman's discovery of a floating corpse in a remote river - based on a short story by Raymond Carver. It became an element of the classic Robert Altman classic 1993 ensemble "Cut Short". Lawrence uses this term for an exploration and exhibit in relation to a small Australian community under stress. The movie poses some moral questions "Would you let the discovery of a dead body ruin your good weekend?" and more important for Australians "Does it make any difference if the deceased was an Aboriginal?" Acting, especially by Gabriel Byrne and Laura Linney, is laudable. And there is the mysterious element reinforced by haunted music, not unlike the "hanging rock picnic". <br /> <br /> If all this sounds like the basis for a big movie - be prepared for a down, the pace is very slow and the murder is shown near the start, thereby eliminating the mystery element. So we left with these uninhabited lives and an empty loop.
