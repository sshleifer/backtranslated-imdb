I ended up watching this movie before going to any of the comments, at the request of a girl. Just out of curiosity, I thought, let me know if people actually recommend others to watch this movie. I'm quite shocked to find such long and positive reviews on this website that make me conclude that it's a scam. <br /> <br /> As far as my opinion goes, I must ask, "Are these filmmakers delayed or asserted that viewers are delaying?" The film is atrocious at many levels and I'm not even talking about the story or presentation. So these bunch of guys plus a girl (the lead actress) form a musical band; Guessing from the constant presence of her guitar is supposed to be a rock band. Hell, when did dancer began to become part of a Rock band ??? Anyway, let me accept it as a Bollywood-version-of-a-rock-band, but amusingly enough all the notes that actually had these two guitarists to make all kinds of cool "ROCK GESTURES" and I am assuming played instrument, the sound of the guitar was completely missing !!! I simply can not understand the magnitude of sort here .... <br /> I just will conclude here because it is absolutely not worth pointing to any more flaw in the movie. Bollywood directors seem no longer shame !!!!!!!!
