I'm a big fan of old horror movies, and since my middle age, my old one is a movie that was made before 1970 and most were made in the 1920s in the 1960's. I'm not a big fan of more modern horror movies, and one exception was Creepshow 1, which I thought was great. I could reminisce about the stories there but I really really enjoyed the monster in the box history with Hal Holbrook, and also the one on the really neat guy was a great finish. All stories were great though. So why did I love them so much? The characters had some decent development, the lines were very plain about who was good and who was bad, the horror bits were increased with a close up of aghast and fear figures, and the funny bits were really funny ! This end is either very lacking in these elements or are totally absent! I write this only have to look it partially because the movie was a complete waste of time and I turned it to do other things like movie review reviews on IMDb.com, lol. When George Kennedy and a former Dorothy Lamoure found himself bidding to tell you something ..... 4 of 10. Also, Romero's expertise is hard to find here, to be told to her tone down to a standard PG (I did not know what was rated by it looks like my PG), and that's not a good thing for a movie that's nothing else going on. It shows on the Encore Camp if you die (yuck yuck) to see it.
