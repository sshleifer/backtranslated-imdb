Störtebeker is truly one of the worst series of mini-series made on this planet. <br /> <br /> The act is unbearable and the historical background is mostly nonsense: Just two examples: Visby has been shown as a city of three houses. Instead, it was a great city at this time, it's the best day to go by. Secondly, Hamburg would never have been the city taking care of the Baltic Sea pirates. Hamburg had no access to the Baltic Sea, the largest city at that time was Lübeck. <br /> But worse than all that: the LED! How can a dilettante like this guy be direct to a movie like this? Impossible! Not one of his credible scenes, the battles were ridiculous and I could not suppress laugh at most stage scenes. <br /> I can not understand how a major TV station can be so incompetent.
