This film was hidden in scandals so long as it became a very sought after item ... the outrage, the mystery, etc. It had everything to be a great movie-making piece, but finally failed at all limits. it is a very bad comedy movie, a movie movie terribly, an erotic movie movie. The DVD DVD DVD 2 includes a gorgeous booklet with stills, interviews, essiality essays, etc. as well as an extensive interview with the over-the-counter-director. For those who have heard about it but never seen it, the package will look fantastic until one actually sees the movie. Disk 1 has the edited film, seriously translated into English, but with visual quality. Disk 2 has the director's cut, in a terrible transfer, in French. What can I say about the real animal? A hand puppet of the Kermit Frog would be more effective and shocking.
