I have to admit, there are some books and movies that correspond to what I actually have before viewing cinematic adaptations. Ninety eighty-four arrives in one of those rare cases. The book was great. It was immersive and interesting prophetic. But the movie just plain sucking. It's easy to worry the worst movie I've ever seen. The only reason I did not turn it after the first 5 minutes was the fact that watching the movie was half a two-party placement for a class. It was dark and grotesque, but it did not do anything to achieve the proper atmosphere. The act was nothing above the average, and considering the fact that did not much to act out, this was serious disappointing. The book, for example, did not give me the impression that Winston could excite more than one single syllable at a time. Boring, disturbing, and visually unappealing, the movie totally cannibalized the book. Wait a second ... Is not British?
