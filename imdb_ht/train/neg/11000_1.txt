Words can not describe how completely this movie is filmed. It's a series of random, unfunny clips about everything from a stupid Batman parody to a guy getting it on with an old dead lady (really disturbing). The only funny thing about the movie Comedy Underground is watching Joey Buttafuoco, the best actor in this movie. Also, it is rated NC-17, shunning away from the only people that could tolerate it.
