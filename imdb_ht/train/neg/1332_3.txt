Gifts at his own-cut Jay Leno joint four-letter words are the only memorable aspect of this capricious mismatched-police-caper partner. In a couple of collections, the Panamanian comedian teams deal with Morita's skateboard late to track down a stealth prototype voltage (thinking Lover car Leno played a hand in the plot?). The two drivers try hard, they really do, but Leno is not the actor and fish-out-of-the-water Morita routine gets old in a hurry. The film brings a bit of '80 cheese calls', but its worthy moments become increasingly rare as it fills its relieved time 100 minutes running time. Fans of Leno's considerable talent will feel left down; Everyone else will just be bored.
