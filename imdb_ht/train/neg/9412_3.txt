This movie was screen as part of the 2007 Sydney Mardi Gras Film Festival. I had no wait in the movie as someone else chose it for me. <br /> I actually love films that take time to develop, films that allow the characters to unfold and allow the story flow. Always is a good thing. But this movie though it was just plain slow. <br /> <br /> Credit must go to two main actors. There was a sense of tension between them as totally different people, really misfits, come together in a very awkward way. There were moments of tender and sadness as we learned more about them. <br /> I also loved the environment and how it was shot. It was clostrophobic and monochrome and added to the film's intimacy and strengthened the uniqueness of the characters. <br /> I just do not understand the finish. What was the point of it all?
