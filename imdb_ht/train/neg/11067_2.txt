I'm a big fan of genre of true crime, but I could not sit in this putrid piece. It was almost as if Dahmer was born as erotic, down to the porn-cops band. There was no look at what made Dahmer tick, no exploration of who his victim was. There is nothing but "Look at how to climb this guy is." And I have to give these filmmakers a lot - Dahmer is the creepiest thing ever shameful to the screen.
