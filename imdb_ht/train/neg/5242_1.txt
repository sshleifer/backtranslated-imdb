Well, I hate to knock up, I despise 40-year-old maiden, and this little gem is a worthwhile piece of garbage dump. Do yourself a favor and skip it. I admit, I do not like the actors in this film, and after my 18-year-old son showed me the cover of the DVD, I was like, "I would not like that movie," but in his insistence, I decided to give it a try, unfortunately. <br /> <br /> About two minutes in the movie I've been turning around, I've been so offended. it's just disgusting. Any decent person should be left in the movie in this movie. call me old fashioned, but haul your pussy juice covering but your friend's face so it will know you "got some" is on the line of decency, in my opinion. yes, it's like how this little movie begins, and I can only imagine it gets worse out there. another real winner for Mr. Rudd. I bet it as proud as punch. Imagine if you could only find worthless roles as it gets, would you stay in the movies? despite the pay, I would not. <br /> I should know better; next time I'm going.
