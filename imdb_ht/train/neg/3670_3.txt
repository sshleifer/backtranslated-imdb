For a movie movie to make the effort to work well it has to be either really original or a very good answer. This movie is not. Be sure to have a pseudo-original twist in that guy's murder because of a toxin and not because of a disease, but this is a very minor twist. The scheme of government scheme, the Crusader protagonist has personal experience ... And a real disadvantage of this film is that the man contaminates no pathos. Although the scripted character must be a person who should be gracious, he is not. Without the mercy of the movie is pointless. The other characters are so ridiculous knives. The subplots are complicated and annoying. And the sad thing is the movie is too flat even to be enjoyed as mockery material. Make the movie a 45 minute short and it might be worth watching.
