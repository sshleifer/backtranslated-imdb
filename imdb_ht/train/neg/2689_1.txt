Now I have no movie critics, but I'm really hated "September 11". This movie was, on a general basis, bad. With the exception of the segment Alejandro González Iñárritu, which was more effective and direct about the subject, the short films were at best boring, and at worst offensive. The worst of my mind was the Youssef Chahine's segment of which he compared Palestinian suicide bombers to U.S. soldiers, even going so far as suggested the suicide bombs were fighting for a major cause. The segment was completely on the subject and, considering Chahine's similarity to any decency, a waste of time and patience. The idea of ​​getting eleven different directors in different countries to make a movie present their views on a tragedy was good on paper, but in practice, it was tasty.
