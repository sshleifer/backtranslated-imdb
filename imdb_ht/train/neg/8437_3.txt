As a great fan of David Mamet's film and plays, especially his first House House game that also starred Joe Mantegna, I was expecting great things from this movie. Instead, I find myself annoyed by the film's superficiality and lack of credibility. Reliable races are thrown over without any feelings or revelations, in hoping to set up a racial tension that I never materialize. Identity is totally reevalyone and boys become "heroes" for no apparent reason. Because of his oath to take as a cop, the lead character negligently refuses to perform a relatively small action that would be wrong not one and can possibly save their lives, and yet to do another action that is very violent and very illegal but Then always refuse the minor action. In addition, a very incredible subplot involving a man who killed his family presented just for the sake of a point plot that was all but released with skywriting, and the cop reactions to that incident to relaxing most credible ways far beyond all reasonable limits. Needless to say, after waiting another exciting thrill from David Mamet, I was very disappointed to say at least. 3 out of 10.
