This is probably the worst movie ever I've ever seen. Once again I made the mistake of buying the movie because the synapses on the back sounded cool and the front cover looked pretty cool too (After buying this with the "Malevolence" movie which I reviewed over here as well, I was learn my lesson). I love horror movies that take place in the woods or in the desert or in a farm. This supposedly takes place in the woods of Texas but was probably filmed in the director's yard. The output was probably the worst I've ever seen. The actors were absolutely furious. The story did not have anything to do with that back cover said. I even tried to sell it to F.Y.E and some other "mother and pop" stores that buy DVDs used and would not take it. That's how terrible this poor misery is for a movie. I've seen some bad movies before (trol 2 for example), but that's definitely taking the cake. I did not think there was a movie worse than "Trol 2". Boy I was wrong! Do not buy this movie unless someone but it for you for free, but even spend stuck with it unless you throw it out that is what I am about to do !!!!
