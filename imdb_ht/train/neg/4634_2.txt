Obviously some talented attachments, Maria Bello is still great. but this is just a deserted plot of time, portraying every character as someone to be loathed and exploited for someone to make a movie out of an 'interesting' story. Well, I hope they got it out of their system. unfortunately for the audience, there is no insight, no sensitivity, no contexts, and really no humanity. that would indeed be, except it does not have any humor, no horror, no contexts, and nothing constructive to say about the story it tries to say. bad things happen, you sit down and watch it, you do not care, so what? 99% of the time, words 'based on a true story' constitute an unintentional warning to the audience. It means the director and the senarist are lazy and fascinated by some events they hear about somewhere, so they just throw them up on the screen and expect the 'true' nature of the story to make the audience feel something without The filmmakers have to do any of the work. I hope they had a great time making this movie. it feels on ice.
