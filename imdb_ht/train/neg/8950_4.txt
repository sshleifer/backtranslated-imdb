I heard about this novel long ago, many of my friends recommend reading it. I searched it everywhere and finally found it. This is a book that every person should read, because it is engineering and because of his vision. I enjoyed each page. <br /> I knew about the movie and could not wait to see it. When I finally did I was very disappointed, many items in the book are not in the movie (I do not think this is a beckle) that just makes the movie by logic ... Michael Radford could be a good director, but a bad writer. Especially as an author of books. The film is not dark at all, the writing is really bad, the only thing that is good, even big, is the act. Jan Hurt is an amazing actor and the only figure I could see as Winston Smith. <br /> <br /> What's my worst are the people of IMDb who call this "Adaptation is the Best Ever" without even reading the book! Or know anything about writing screens! <br /> You can only understand the brightness of the story by reading the book, not considering this as an alternative. As a fan of the book, I was very disappointed. The points I gave to this movie go for the act.
