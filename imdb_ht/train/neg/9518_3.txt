Scary performance by Sinatra, Martin and Hyer. Great features supported. Bored talky with no real plot. Finish leaves you flatter than a pancake, and more than loose than you could be tied to four suites (that is, if you care about these wooden characters). MacLaine is the only real advantage. That penultimate sequence in which the "Chicago hood" search for the character of Sinatra is mockable. Music in this sequence is also poor. And in the final scene when Martin's character removed his hat for the woman he called a "pig," almost let me go out and find a stone throw in my TV screen.
