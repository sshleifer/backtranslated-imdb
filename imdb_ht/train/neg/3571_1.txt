The super actress B movie actress has another small part as Ray Liotta 's "Goodfellas" star in this box office bomber. She plays Marion, there is only one line of dialogue, well, one ROLE in dialogue actually. He speaks about "Joe!" as Ray's character is poor breach of Pia Zadora and a plastic plastic rubber field. This movie is so bad even if it gets funny, hilarious at times. The guys in Mystery Science Theater 3000 would like this! Check out the hysterical scene at the end of which Pia has a nervous breakdown with the cheesy correction and effects to try and show how seriously Pia's character is freaking out. Pia plays a Hollywood scenario aspirant. Pia Zadora as a senarist? Yeah, right. Pia can barely talk, let alone writing! Pia is absolutely and absolutely disgusting in this mute role. But who cares? The real star is Annen's hot and cool glory in her small part of this cat's opinion! Rock on glory!
