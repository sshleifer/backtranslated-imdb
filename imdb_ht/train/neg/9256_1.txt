Without limits on a bunch of half-naked people slipping and punching with each other. That's it. For about 5 minutes we see that. It's injected into black and white with tons of half-naked people running around to slapping each other into the tune of obnoxious music. It looked interesting, but there was no conspiracy and really - the inherent violence was disturbing. Also the homosexual erotic in this is played but combining it with violence was not a good idea. Some people like Garde material would like this but I found it incomprehensible, boring, stupid and (ocassionally) disturbing. Really - what's the point in all this? I saw it as part of a festival of gay shorts and the audience sat there silently stunned. I really wish I could go below 1.
