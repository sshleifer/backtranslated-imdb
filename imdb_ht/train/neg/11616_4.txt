I did not enjoy the movie, Joshua, at all. Perhaps it is because I've seen another, better movie titled Orphan 2 days before, but maybe it's just because this film was not very good. I'm going to the ladder. Sure, the plot of an evil child is not exactly original, but that does not mean the movie could not succeed. It could have been thrilling and fun and refreshing, but instead it was slow down building, boring, refined and really did not let me think anything more than 'what was not pretty good' when it was all over. /> In the end, Joshua's motivation is revealed. I will not give that far, but the fact is that she did not really accomplish her goals since Vera Farmiga as her mother, Abby, disappears on the 3 / 4th of the movie, all point points at home return it soon. He was engaged in a mental institution because he had lost his mind, but then his father / husband Joshua was accused of fraudulent and his medicines telling the audience that the institution realized he was true not mentally ill but instead was medically dose. So .. should not he come home soon? Did not Joshua fail? Is not her mother living with her and her sister and maybe her dad right away? I ask the Father since his future left. <br /> At the end of the day I did not care about the characters. Demon's evil demon was not really afraid. The scenario moves slowly and when it's picking it was always boring. Suspension fell flat every single time. When it was over I could not believe I was sitting in the whole thing. <br /> <br /> 4/10 just because the act was good from parents especially to Vera Farmiga as the Mother, but if you want to see a movie about a child 'wrong go see orphelies. Now this is a movie that took a groundbreaking concept and created a brilliant film.
