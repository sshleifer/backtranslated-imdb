This movie is really wacky. There is really nothing nice I can say about it, besides the moral truth expressed in the Climax of the film about people in the neighborhood that is involved in fighting crime. In addition, the film had nothing: no good shots, no good action, and no good script. I give this movie a F and a 2 out 10.
