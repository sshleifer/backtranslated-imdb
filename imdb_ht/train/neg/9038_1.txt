This is a terrible production of Bartleby, but not, as the other criticism puts it because it is "unfilmable," but rather because this version does not keep the spirit of the book. It tells the story, almost as painful. Looking at her, I could turn the pages into my book and follow together, which is not as much fun when dealing with an adaptation. Instead, see the 2001 version of Bartleby featuring Crispin Glover. That version, while funny, brings new details to the movie while maintaining the spirit of the novel. What matters is the spirit, not the minitiae of things like environment, character names, and costumes. The difference between the movie versions is like night and day, tedious and hilarious. This version is a lesson on what can go wrong if it is a busy, painful, self-numbing adaptation to Schlock.
