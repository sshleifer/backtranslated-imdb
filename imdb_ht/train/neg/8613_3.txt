I almost burst into tears watching this movie. Not from laughing but in the memories of a great movie by Rodney Dangerfield. Candyshack was his first and stole the movie, Easy Money had him at its best, and Back to School is by far a classic 80's masterpiece. Then there were ladybirds and that's when it started to show. Poor Rodney became old (Meet Wally Sparks a little step up from ladybirds, but not much to say). In a 5 Wife Rodney playing Monte (a name he needs to love since his name was Easy Money) a rich (is not it still) guy who loves women and gets married as there's nothing to him. Well now he inherited a great piece of land and since the country was run by Amish, he inherited 5 wives. This sounds like a great idea for a movie Dangerfield. The problem is everything. The script is so poor that Rodney seems to say his one hardware in the camera and all the side characters have nothing to do. The film seems to have shot on video and some really poor superstar sequences that are obviously not Rodney. Andrew Dice Clay plays a gangster that looks like he's dying the word (which he should have since the movie rated R, but playing as if he was PG) and Jerry Stiller has a nice 2 minute chatter. Do not get me wrong, at times I've been laughing at a few of Rodney's jokes but the poor man is getting too old and way too slow. We can see its joke from miles. And the movie turned way too PC that was due to the 1990's terrible, Rodney's 70's and 80's just do not work anymore.
