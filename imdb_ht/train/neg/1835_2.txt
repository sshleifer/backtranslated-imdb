Start with the script. I saw an animated cartoon that is more profound than "jealous". Any character keeps repeating what you have already seen, and was not funny the first time, a movie is in deep trouble, which "Envy" certainly is. A movie that relies on one joke was better to have a place to go with it. Here we have a movie that goes absolutely nowhere. Christopher Walken especially wanted to forget this bomb, because his character is so weak. Ben Stiller was in some pretty good black cats, "Flirting and Disaster", and "Duplex", immediately coming to mind. Make sure that "Envy" is not a black comedy. There is no double meaning, just nonsense. "Jealou" deserves its rating low, because as it is subject, it feels. - MERK
