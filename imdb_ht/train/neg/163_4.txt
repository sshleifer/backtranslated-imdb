The earliest part of the film was rather enjoyable but towards the end it became trite. Although Turturro is an actor I generally love, his Luzhin often looks like a bad impression Man's peace and pain in the genius as a semi-autistic man was annoying. Overall it looks as if this movie tries hard and ends up looking firefighting in spite of particularly fine performance.
