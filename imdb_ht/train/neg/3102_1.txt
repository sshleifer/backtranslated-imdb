No matter how you look at this movie, it is just awful. If you see it as a horror, then it is a smile movie and the monsters were puppets but. If you look at it as a comedy, then you'll notice most of the humor falls flat and it's just lame. <br /> <br /> If it is a romance you will wonder why a guy would stay with these B ** Ch! <br /> If you look at it as an action you can not really pull for the whiny hero. As you can see this movie just fails to save anything remotely funny. As mentioned monsters are obvious puppets and this movie was another attempt at a Gremlins kind movie. This however contains the worst monsters in that genre. Critters look very beautiful, so did the ghoulies, excellent even puppets from the munchies look better than that. The characters in this movie are unrelentingly wrong. The hero is a whiney security guard, his girlfriend is still complaining, they have a hobo friend who has a military military companion, and another friend who is a Spaz. At one point in the film of the hero and fight the military guy and rake ... this movie is just completely stupid. I love the scene when they are scouting the club scout (which is obviously not a club but more likely a diner) and the hero tells the waitress that none of them are 21. Give me a break, I am 25 and I look younger than any of them.
