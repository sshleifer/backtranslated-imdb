This was a movie about infidelity and revenge. A twin and "twin" connection in the sense that something is wrong with her sister. This movie has taken forever to establish the scheme. A plot that made many times. The act was disgusting for the most part. Once the plot comes together, the movie ends. Laura and Ashley are twins who live with an abusive father. The father looks like Ashley, so Laura becomes the blame for everything. There is a promise that the girls are never separated, but as they grow up, their lives go in different directions. Ashley gets a job of a diner where she meets Barry, a married man. Of course no good can come to this. The fact that Barry had Tinnitus was a poor excuse for a way to follow him down. I was waiting for this movie to get better and to have some resolution somewhere, but it never happened.
