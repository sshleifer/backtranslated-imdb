The second Renaissance, part 1 let us show how the cars first rebelled against the people. It all starts in with one case, in which the cars claim that they have a right to live as well, while the people state a robot is something they own and therefore can do anything and they want. While there is an interesting quote, the story gets really strange from then on and (violent!) rioting between the robots and humanity. Somehow it does not seem right, as another review point it, it's all a little too smart. The animatrix histories that remain close to the core of the uterus (in particular Osiris) work for the better. As for Second Renaissance Part 1, I would say it is too violent and too funny. 4/10.
