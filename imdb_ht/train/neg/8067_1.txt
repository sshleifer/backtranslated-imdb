The first let me say that this has to be on the top of my list of boring movies. There is nothing, and I mean nothing in this movie is even remotely thrilling. Most of it is very confusing and as it progresses you just want it to end !! Some people want a movie that makes them "think" in the whole thing, in which I say ... "More Power You" !! Here on the other hand just want to entertained. Which brings me back to stinker this, it's not fun. This film is stupid and a complete waste of time. It seems that most here also agree. Most of this did not make any sense, and by the time you think you have one scene to calculate another tram scene coming around with .... well i guess you see where this will be. Avoid, this one sucks .... bad !!
