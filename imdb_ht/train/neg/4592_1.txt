This film made me very upset. I wanted to desperately be in the gas "scientists" and unseen movie-makers during the course of it. Very, very painful to sit down. Sophomoric and firefighters are the worst way. There is little good information on brain / chemistry and proportion theory lost in a sea of ​​new horse to age. The last offenders were crack-shock Ramtha and Joseph Dispenza. Mr. Dispenza informs us that most people lead to life of mediocrity and clearly implies that, on the other hand, live on a higher plane. Even the ideas and attitudes that I basically agree with are presented in such a heavy release, clumsy, superior, firefighting, preachy way that I felt the disadvantage of their desires. I think this has made me so upset, the fact that they were taken are all the profound aspects of thought scientific thought and the marred and hokum new age. Many of it is based on the illusion of implementing the theory of proportions in the macro world. Most, portraits are portrayed with Marlee Matlin are amateur and cliched up ... <br /> I would refer people to Bill Bryson's excellent survey of science: "A short story of almost everything." There are many profound miracles on life and the universe in the current, establishing science.
