I would give this a negative rating if I could. I went to this movie by waiting a lot, but I had an open mind. All the stuff is stupid! The snakes are obviously false and the first thing to bite is a boob and a johnson gentleman. Oh how original; if I was a 12 year old boy I might laugh at that. I have no idea how this movie has become so popular. Seriously, the worst thing I've ever seen. I was not entertained, it was not funny, I was not even bored! I did not do anything. It was not even so bad it was good, it's just bad. Ridicule actually. Please do not waste your money on this movie. Do not even rent this movie. There are no signs of getting such a high rating.
