Billy Crystal co-writes, co-produces and stars in this highly safe and comfortable comedy-drama about ancestors and sons, adult responsibilities, and growing old. Billy plays a heart surgeon with a heart attack (ha ha) that causes him to seek his alien father (Alan King), an extra-film that fancy himself a great star. The script is sub-Neil Simon nonsense and one-laminated material, a flat, inexpressive direction by Henry Winkler (stuck in sitcom mode), and the family's conflict in the ready. Crystal and King try their best, but kings are over-craving and often over-the-top. JoBeth Williams has another role in its ingredients, but managed to bring her naturally to her, down-home class of the proverbial girlfriend character. It's a comedy, I guess, but one that blinks back tears ... shame. ** from ****
