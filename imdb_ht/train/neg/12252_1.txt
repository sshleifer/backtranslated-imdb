** SPOILERS ** <br /> <br /> This is one movie movie. Seriously. The absolutely terrible act, the FX are dreadfull and the plot is down horrible right. But hey, it's so bad that it's watching its fun! The script is SO bad that it is enjoyable! You simply have to make and laugh in line like "I guess what you call CROCTEASING." as the flash breast women in the crocodile. I mean COME about this funny cause it's so bad! It has such horrific jokes that they're funny! But after a while it just gets so much as the movie becomes crap. I really started to fall asleep. Believe me though, the plastic hook stamping on the leaves and the constant swishes in a cork that keeps you laughing for a long time. Though I said he had one cool party when the hook worn that dude in half and he just hanged there for a while when we figured out what to do. It has mindless films, which have to be nominated for the MST3K line !!
