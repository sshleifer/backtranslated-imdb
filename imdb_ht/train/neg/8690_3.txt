All involved (and the audience) should seek the "candidate" to see how good this movie could be. What happened to the South American history? What was Julie Christie and Kate Capshaw thinking to allow their roles to be cut off-outs. Until now I liked every Gene Hackman performance and / or movie. It was either without interest (which I can hardly believe) or dreadfully miscast. I also loved and defended Richard Gere (and was charged with it). But here it had no "power". It was never intimidated and only occasionally compelling. All in all I was very disappointed. I really expect more from this director and cast. If you can not find the "Candidate" look at the "Wag Dog" again or even "Bulworth".
