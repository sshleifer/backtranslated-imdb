The husband and wife team at Bennie Fields and Blossom Seeley were great stars in vaudeville, but they did very few films. As is the case for some other performers of the era (George M. Cohan, Fanny Brice, Gertrude Lawrence) the most accessible film footage for Fields and Seeley is the biopic on them, in which they are described by other actors: Someone likes me, starring Betty Hutton and unmatched song-and-dance man Ralph Meeker. <br /> <br /> In the great day of Glory, Fields and Seeley were so widely popular that another husband and wife vows - - Jesse Block and Eve Sully - have achieved almost as many stars perform an almost act Identically, effectively become the "second team" Fields and Seeley. Instead, though, there was a big difference in living couple accommodation. The fields and Seeley lived in hotel suites, paid room-service rates for each meal they ate, and eventually ran out of money. Blocks and Sully have been living modest and invested wisely wisely, ending in comfortable retirement. The first 30 seconds of this short Vitaphone are occupied by two spat-bearing pies. Apparently these guys had some small names in their own in 1930, although I never heard of them. Finally, Fields and Seely rush in and start doing. They both have a lot of people, and it is fairly attractive. <br /> I was annoyed that both performers kept moving as if they were about to break into a dance, but they never did so until the third of the three songs made in that short. When they finally start hoofing, the results are not impressive. <br /> I was pleased to have the opportunity to see these two major performers doing their archaic acts. Now that I've seen it, I understand why they never became the movie movie music. My rating for this one: just 4 out of 10, and I'll stick to Blocks and Sully.
