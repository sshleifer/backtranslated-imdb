This film is about a very sexy Olympic track who has been coaching a high school boy basketball team. Like WILDCATS Goldie Hawn, it stars Cathy Lee Crosby in the title role, and it does as well as the script allows. I think Racquel Welch would have a better choice, but considering the apparent film film movie budget, they probably could not afford it. Cathy Lee looks great at every shot, but we never get to see her completely naked. The story is pretty predictable, to say the least, offers no surprises. A young and lucky Michael Biehn has the role of male lead. He is the star of the team and also the love interest for Cathy Lee. Keenan Wynn has a few fun scenes as the old rich man who runs the athletic program and does not think that a woman should be coaching sports. This point is carried out throughout the film, and, the useless say, is dating. Ironically, Cathy Lee does not put his team in any unorthodox practice session; He does not do anything to a male coach. There is a funny subplot involving a tall and not-so-bright player who underwent hypnosis in order to pass its class and play like Pro Basketball player Sydney Wicks. It seems everyone had a good time to make this movie, but the only real reason to see it is for Cathy Lee Crosby. It's not that great an actress, but she has a dazzling smile, beautiful hair, and a very long body.
