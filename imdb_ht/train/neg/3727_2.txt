Writing and acting in heartfelt enthusiasts, produced by some monger exploits, this is dull and tough to look. <br /> Not the worst film ever, but at least Schlock like _Plan 9 De Outer Space_ usually has a real or two actor. I would recommend _A to steal the Night_ only for hardcore ironists and Hardcore Dispensationalists. I have not. <br /> <br /> Do not believe me?
