If you go see this movie you will keep a bad movie theater account, the director, the producer, the actors and those who said you go see it! Shame on you, Sarah Michelle Geller, for your name and face of this poor excuse of a movie. It may have been more scary if Japanese actors were just talking to Japanese instead of trying to 'act' in English. I wanted to boo when the movie ended ... a true disappointment after all the hype on television and trailer films that promoted this lame money maker. Sarah Michelle really did not have to act in all to make this movie ... she just practiced her frowning skills. Do not waste your time or money on this movie.
