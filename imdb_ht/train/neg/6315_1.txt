This sweet, sexy movie is a must-see. Only on multiple opinions can one really understand the uniqueness of this movie. Personally I enjoy the narrator for his intelligent, no subject matter is intact, style of narration. Introduce your flu right away and keep you in the corner of your seat throughout the movie. He gives wonderful things to the world of the train and allows the audience to really 'connect' with the internal horror movie exhibits. The script itself keeps the movie together beautiful. Not only for children, but elderly people will get a higher understanding of the dwarves and the modern hand that they have about the sexual experience. Ahead of his time and the inauguration of cinematography, he surely defines the word 'chief'.
