The biggest hit in the National Lamp remains "Animal House", and that's why. It was funny, horrendous and good-natured. <br /> <br /> The exact opposite of each other National Film Movie. Including the "Reunion Class". <br /> <br /> PLEASE DO NOT be fooled by the inclusion of Stephen Furst ("Flounder") from "Animal House". Or by the fact that John Hughes wrote this disguised disorder. This reunion is about as hilarious as root canal and twice as painful. <br /> A star, and that was generated. Then again, I still think most of my old classmates were spirits, vampires and serious killer, too.
