Personally, while I can appreciate really good movies, I also had an unusual ability to somewhat enjoy even the most crappiest of crap. You know, these times when you just want to sit there and watch some horrible movie cookies-knife action to kill time. This is the only movie that I can actually remember in the middle, and I have absolutely no intention of going to finish it. The plot was so understandable and predictable, I called that the next scene would be easy (and I'm usually not very good at this). The actors were awful, I saw the best act of playing middle school. Even off the scenes were bad, the sink was all wrong. This movie is like a parody of the funny memory.
