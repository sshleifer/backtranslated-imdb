Because others have gone through the problem to summarize the draw, I would like to mention a few points on this movie. There is power for people here; I do not care enough to filter them out. <br /> - Given the low budget film, the animal design was quite good. It's actually nice to see a direct-to-video horror film that is not slathered and awful CGI. Unfortunately the quality of the digital film is very good in places, and it is most noticeable in the well-lit white hallway of asylum. <br /> <br /> - Ridiculous lighting design plagues part of this movie, they say nothing of the variations of the passage of time. I understand the director would be trying to simulate dementia, but in order for this to be the time-consuming effective needed to be established. As-is, it simply looks like amateurs .. <br /> - Twisting draws were much but still predictable. I have not had a doubt in my mind in the identity of the stolen cultures, nor in the fact that there are some kind of blame evil-trumps-good development would be the end surface. <br /> - This may seem like quibbling, but the character of this film reliably fail to employ any kind of common sense. First of all, regulatory commissions should be all over a mental health center that unilaterally declared all patients and cardiac death arrest employees. Why would the psychiatrist also be able to perform autopsy? Why is not a draw point made of the impressive credentials, or in his introduction to his odd choice of religion? What's the background? What's supposed to take care of anyone in this? And just as important, who's right idea would go to the introduction of the place, seeing everything that was so frighteningly wrong with it, and then concluded that it was still a good place to pursue a residence? This film did not even respect its characters enough to provide intelligence to the benefit of the doubt. <br /> <br /> Below the line: See the Wicker man instead.
