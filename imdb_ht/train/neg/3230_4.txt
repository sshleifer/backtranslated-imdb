I just finished watching guinea pigs - spirits experimentation. I said that this movie, although there are many good FX, better then I hope, was not a good movie. I honestly cant saying that I enjoyed this movie at all. Of course it's effective in its way of being a shocking, realistic, twisting 43 minutes of torture, but I found it to be very boring (and not as gory as I expected). And also, I found that the torturers were very annoying, when they talked and insisted trying hard sound all the time, which ruined it even more (and I'm sure some people out there are going to agree with me on one). I have now seen guinea pigs 1,2,3,5 and the best one from those in my opinion is Guinea Pig 2 - Flowers in the body and blood. I do not say much more about the Devil's experience, other than the Great Fx, the descendant of the girl, bother torturers, in general I give it 4 stars against FX bond accounts are awesome.
