... then they will have a great place to fill this crap. Sorry, not a "mystery" as claimed, it is religious mumbo-jumbo. I was waiting for the "unimaginable wrong" that promised me, but the "wrong" of this movie flicker would only be unimaginable by a five year old and learning disability. <br /> I can not believe they actually managed to find some bigger actors wanting to participate in this troublesome. Unfortunately it has always changed my opinion in them, and I will likely avoid anything they do in the future. I also slightly cut off that I now have the writer's name and the director's name memorized as I will avoid anything to do as the epidemic from now on too. <br /> It's really unfortunate that all religious fans are posting about here and it says that this film is 10 out of 10, etc. will get the comments posted first. This could lead to more people being deceived, as I was, believing that this movie was something other than religious preaching. <br /> Well, it's going to the video store to get my money back for fake advertising. Too bad they can not give me back 105 minutes I wasted watching this thought that it was actually a Hollywood horror / supernatural movie.
