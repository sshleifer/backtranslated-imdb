I'll probably still go to see a movie Woody Alleb, as one never knows when he just might make a real return to his past grandmas. Just one or two big moments or lines can make it refreshing. Unfortunately however this movie just does'nt do it on any notes. Say thar actually make me sad and even slightly guilty. I'm sure my reaction is like a lot of other fans in Woody, but what can one say? It's probably time for him to focus on his clarinet, which in my opinion, it is rather good. Saying all this, I'll always probably go to any new Woody movie to come out and in the future. There is still hope and I will continue to love and respect the WOODY !!
