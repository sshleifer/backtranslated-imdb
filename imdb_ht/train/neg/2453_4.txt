I could give this movie a higher rating before Peter Jackson's trilogy was out, but seeing two of them around is simply not comparing. The pace of this film runs, many important scenes in the book are left out, and there is little character development. The animation is a strange mix of traditional cartoon designs and live action scenes painted over, which I find distracted. And the most irritating thing about this film is that it breaks off in the middle of the story and never ends. There are some good points - the battle scenes are interesting to watch, and the dialogue follows the book pretty much in the letter. Look at this one if you're in a hurry and can not spend 10 hours watching the new trilogy. But if you do not read the book you will probably be confused, because there is a lot missing in this version. 4 out of 10.
