I still can not believe this film. They had so many incredible things in it, that it's hard to believe anyone wanted to do it. The story is a joke, but in the sense of being funny, but more like no history at all. How can you combine a slapstick comedy with a train flight, a prison movie, city conspiracy, sex jokes and an FBI-agent? You can not. <br /> In addition to the fear of asking the most obvious things are the actors. I watched this movie and thought, 'Is this really Marlon Brando? No, he can not. (5 minutes later) Is Charlie Sheen? Wow, maybe Brando is true. (5 minutes later) This can not be Donald Sutherland. (5 minutes later) No, by Mira Sorvino. This movie is too bad for everyone. (At least). No, no, no, this can not be absolutely by Martin Sheen !!! Not for 10 seconds in such a movie. 'Then it was over and I came down with my nerves. So many good, oscar-win, usually convince actors in such a stupid, mute, horrible movie. I rarely wanted to know as much as they did in this one. They could not get much money. <br /> Only just an incredible funny idiotic movie. <br /> <br /> 3/10 \ / 4 \ 5 (1 + - 6-)
