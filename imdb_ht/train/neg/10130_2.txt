I own almost every Seagal movie (yes even people like this low budget), and I must say, this can be the worst, not only in movies but in all movies ever made. The only exposure of this film, and just why I gave it 2 stars instead of 1, is that A. it is Seagal, and B. Seagal has some sequence of sweet actions, especially in the store, and also when all Time else it takes out an entire army with a knife. Next time I give 90 minutes to Seagal murder, and do not even bother with a story line, because the storyline is not just stunk, but so was the act, the fact that the F-18 and the F-14 Still changed in F-16s, and also the fact that the infiltration was as fast as an F-16. Also the Infiltration has never been to Ravitayel ??? And since Afghanistan is considered hostile territory from a Force Force force. My last check, Afghanistan has no Air Force, we (USA) controlling the sky. Also, this secret secret was played by speaking of all the crew in the room, yet the Admiral still whispers the other guy that it is secretive. Also, how did Seagal go down to the truck, to the top? Tell us why was his prisoner, Since Air Force pilot commander large (unless they are Owen Wilson?) And since they are drunks in Arab countries, consider Muslim not to drink alcohol? Also on top of that, since the Arabs listen to orders from women like # 2 in charge? The highlight of the film was definitely Seagal murder in the store, and the other 50 people were killed with a knife, as well as very short and totally random lesbian scenes from nowhere.
