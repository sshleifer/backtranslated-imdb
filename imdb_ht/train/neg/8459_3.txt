There are very pretty cameras that work very well with a great potential. But he never came together as anything more than the graduate student's film school. <br /> There are two main reasons for this. Points, there is not one character likable, not even a villain we can admire for his / his chutzpah. Secondly, all the act is terrible - even from veterans Willem DaFoe. The hammam is so luxurious here, you feel like you are at a picnic - but it's one of those picnic staff companies where you drink too much cheap beer and get your hangover before you even stop drinking. Then you eat an underdone hotdog and throw them. <br /> <br /> All right, I was a bit rough about a young director who would always go where - as I said, the camera work is quite good. br> <br /> But I feel cheated - the presentation for this movie suggests we'll get to watch a "modern western", and the DVD packaging has photos on it that suggests this as well - but nobody actually connects to the movie does seem to know that this kind of movie is supposed to do. <br /> <br /> This betrayal is what is wrong; But even without it, the fact remains that we do not like these characters, we feel embarrassed for the actors, the story is hopelessly blocked, and in the recent analysis, we just do not care. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I took it from the DVD player on the half way. but the rental store would not give me my money back. <br /> Now that's really hurts.
