Man For Man tries hard to be a good movie: he has the heart in the right place, he hopes to be epic and has a message that no doubt everyone will appreciate. But there are also some of the problems in this picture. It strives so hard to be good and to get its message across that sometimes the viewer must feel unchallenged. So it is only adequate that the images that are used by this photo are simplistic - Man For Man does not let the viewer decide what he thinks is right, but is raktering his message in his head. Joseph Fiennes shows that in his role: it does best to look at, really move around with all the other emotions you can express with one single facial expression that she has to offer. Adding that the movie is overlong and loses its speed towards the end you should easily lead to the conclusion that Man For Man is not worth watching. But there are enough points to defend it: it is fun, there are some funny scenes and show-stealing Kristin Scott Thomas. Of course you should not compare it to humanist rulers like the Elephant Man (David Lynch), but you will let the theater be satisfied. It tries to grab your heart (even if your brain thinks it's too obvious) and succeed most of the time.
