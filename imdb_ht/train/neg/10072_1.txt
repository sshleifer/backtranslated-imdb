Unfortunately I made a mistake and paid 7 Euros to the movie theater to watch this movie meaningless. My points; <br /> <br /> Movie based on 2 things; <br /> 1) Ethnic Views: As things happen to most of American films, the writer thinks himself as an expert after learning 2 or 3 things about Asian culture. But unfortunately it's not enough. Knowing kunefe and 2 other foods do not make people understand a culture. For example beard is a sign of pure life in Asia but everyone was trying the girl to stop that. Lebanese people are Christian (Ok got it) and their cultural background and beliefs and approaches are completely different from other Arab countries. The main difference between Eastern and Western culture is that we do not make ethnosentries. So we do not judge people after the first questions about our life as the father's face was made across the movie. <br /> 2) Sexual Revolution a Girl: There's nothing much to say about that. Show me 10 girls who had these on their sexual awakening than I'll say I'm wrong. <br /> I wrote this comment because the producers are promoting the movie in the black humor genre. Please see Dr.Strangelove and understand the meaning of black humor. A dark humor has reflected the truth and must focus the audience in the funny parts of it. Where is the truth? Where is the meaning of the movie.
