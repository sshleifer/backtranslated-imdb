I went to this hope that he would "think of provoking" little man to review this as. i love films independent and hope to dig this too. knowing what a hot button the topics I expect to be really entertained, maybe even see an alien perspective. <br /> <br /> All I can say is wow .... if you are in torture yourself, or mutilation then maybe you'll love this. personally I do not like the idea of ​​being pee'd on or off myself so I thought it was rubbish. bad script, bad act, bad story, wrong direct, bad correction .... I could go on. I have no clue why a review has stated it or has made a political point by giving this movie a 10th. That's foolish and ignorant. vote for a movie about IMDb by putting a precedent! It just allows others to think that a waste bomb like this is OK to look as long as it's controversial (this movie is not, it's trying very hard to be but failed). <br /> <br /> You know the movie is bad when 15 minutes in it's your prayer that all the main character dies horrifically. unfortunately they die, but not in the painful behaviors that would give the viewer some justice or retaliation to watch the 2 hours of the crap just endured. <br /> <br /> Make yourself a favor, just do not even bother. I got this movie in a bargain bin in my local video store for .50 and feel torn off!
