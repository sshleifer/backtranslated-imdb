Well, the film festival movie probably loved it. But your average, popcorn munching movie visitors with scratch-finding ten or fifteen dol it costs to see a movie these days will probably wonder why he or she made that choice. If it's "Copolla" jumps it's really great, right? Move! It's a clean parody of the filmdom's pretense. But it's terribly "at." I'm worried when movie makers are more concerned about entertaining themselves than the public. It's interesting as a Curio Cinemas and it has a chuckle or two of it. But once it runs its course in the movies and on television, the dirt grows thick over the movie boxes and cassette holders. Hardly either era or season!
