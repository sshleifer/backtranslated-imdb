I looked like 8 or 9 Herzog movies and none of them had no impact on me. <br /> I look at several documentaries about it. It is obviously a smart person, with great knowledge of film and passion for doing, but this makes him a good director. Definitely NO! A complete anti-talent. He can do a good documentary because they have already mentioned features, but a movie and actor ?? Do not ever! <br /> It can not be direct or written. His screenplays are filled with plenty of thinking out situations, and many situations / dialogs in his movies are for kids and seriously make that they can not hide behind the word "art" in any sense. There is no way. Not to mention the indifferent direction, so amateur-like. To say that he wants direct like that and writes crap as this is a lie. <br /> Like the scene when Scheitz gets arrested and Storszek hides at the back of the store. WHO ARE I LIKE? <br /> It's a Cheat; He knows that fake intellectuals and critics want. He knows which elements he needs to put in the script to get your attention and praise. Never forget the rest of the script and sloppy directions. <br /> Just look at Julio Medem. If Herzog can make a movie like Medem can, then I would re-check her old movies and try to find talent in them.
