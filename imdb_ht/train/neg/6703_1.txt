I noticed that this movie took the brunt of a lot of insults. It's probably earning some of them, but it was not that bad. Well, I'm honest: I never want to see this movie again. It was a bad movie. But I do not hate this movie, he tried to tell a story. As a drama, this film can work very well actually. I just think that the filmmakers misgauged that the roads take when they made this (they should add more funny bits if they wanted it to be a comedy). With a rewrite, he could be a great movie. But as a satir, he did not work in its current form - many scenes did not fit into the context of the plot: for example, the flight scene makes little sense of the story. Still, it was not the worst movie ever made - is it the Top 10 Worst? This is accountant.
