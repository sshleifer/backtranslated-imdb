"Street, Clown Street" released in 1928, Chaney's legendary star as a sly circus Tito. Tito raised a founder (a young and beautiful Loretta Young) of his adult Simonetta. Tito raised the girl in the circus life, and she became a ballerina achieved. While Chaney has given her great performance, I could not get past the fact that Tito, now quite in the middle age, was for Simonetta's youth. Although she is not her biological father, she has raised her as a daughter. This kind of "movie" factor permeates throughout the film. Titan's contest for Simonetta's affection with a young and beautiful 'Count' Luigi (Nils Asther). Simonetta clearly falls to the young man, but feels guilty of abandon Tito (from loyalty, not romantic love). The entire first part of the film is ridiculous, and I find it amazing that no one in the movie says Tito that his foolish old fool is being (until he reveals himself to the end). The film is noticeable only because of Loretta Young, who would go to have a great career. While I worship Shaney's bright as an actor, this whole movie looks like me and just outright creepy.
