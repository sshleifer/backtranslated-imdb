Let's see where to start ... bad act; I'm not sure if I would even call it that, as it's more on the lines of a no-effort script. The actors did not even seem to be in their party and they seemed quite awesome and smooth. Make sure there was a scene or two with stripping, but that could not save this movie from his character to death. <br /> <br /> To call the main character a rapper is an insult to the people who actually do. The readings had no rhythm or sink and seemed more on the line of blood risk. <br /> <br /> Budget? Does this movie even have a budget? It seemed like they used less money than I saw in a YouTube video-shot video. Bad lighting, accessory, poor sound output production. Bad effects, if you want to go too far to call them. History could be good if people actually seemed interested in doing it, but there was no life of this flick; I do not care who led him. <br /> I've seen some really bad flicks in the past year and this one is definitely at the bottom. Do not waste your time or you will want to listen to this review fairly. Check out the ratings, you will see the 1's rapidly exceeding the 10's fluffy and hardly anything in between. Wish I would look a little closer before wasting my time. What a suck-Fest!
