After superb Aachen (2002) has been a remake of a Gujarati play he comes with WAQT who looks like a stage game <br /> In stage play, we have crying characters, overacting here also <br / > <br /> The first half shows Amitabh almost kidding at 40+ Akshay Kumar that acts too funny as a little nerd <br /> <br /> The movie has a good message how not spoil your son but sadly the Amitabh road want to make Akki responsible is absolutely false <br /> Even why he hides his illness, runnign him from the hospital and the melodramatic speech by Akki is a cut <br /> Some emotions you touch, but most are too over the head <br /> <br /> The actress Rajpal is hilarious but too stretched in the second half <br /> Directions by Vipul Shah too late even though some scenes are good Music is okay <br / > <br /> Among Amitabh actors too much in the first half, but superb in emotional scene Akshay Kumar also does belong to him well, but looks uncomfortable in some too lively pics of his chemistry. i and bachchan are unprecedented Rajpal is a record, it makes you laugh without horns and just his presence and mute behavior and humor deadpan it is a riot boman is good at some funny but too funny sides in where Priyanka is the heroine So, nothing is done, this is his latest film and Akki so far Shefali is awesome though it seems too young for Bachchan
