Detective Tony Rome (Frank Sinatra) returns to the screen after his first title titled, this time he's a movie that plays for laughing erm. While on a dive trip, Rome finds the body of a blonde beauty at the bottom of the sea, its feet as you might expect, safe in cement. Rome immediately on the case after being hired by Mount Waldo Gronsky. Rome finds itself immediately at risk as he investigated some types of mafia, who turned the tables on it and is itself found to be the main suspect, he must now go on the run and hoping to resolve cases alone alone. Sinatra in portly trying hard to sell our jokes to blame and to believe it is a good detective, oh and not to mention being sexually attracted to the Foxy Raquel Welch, but it failed miserably, in this van fisted vanity project. Denomination of the quiet franchise surrounded by every girl is quite surprising, all the women in the film are a thief, who likes to bend over in front of the camera, Douglas Director of the head of the zoom on the slots of the donkeys each time flex the posterior muscles. There's even a funny gay character who has masked belief, this was a movie made by "real men" for "real men" to restore their own sexuality, it is a shameful shame.
