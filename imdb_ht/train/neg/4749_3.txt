This film was so badly written and directed that I fell asleep 30 minutes from the movie. The jokes in the movie are coral and even though the plot is interesting at some angles, it's too far away and at some point - ridiculous. If you are 11 or more you will be neglected to write in the movie and be disappointed, but if you are 10 or at least this is a movie that will take your attention and be amazed with all the cascades (which I might be add them wrongly) and wish you had some warrior. The casting of this movie was not very good, and the music was very disappointing because it was like being trying to build the tension but it did not fit at all. On a scale of 1-10 (10 being excellent, 1 were awful) acting in this movie is a 4. Brenda Song is talented in comedy, but with this kind of movie, in some of the most serious scenes, it acts mockingly. When she made some of her "fight" poses, I started laughing loudly. I think the worst thing about this movie is definitely the ruler, for example, the party where his enemy turns out to be the evil person of the evil is to possess, how his voice turns dark and evil, I think that was incredibly stupid, and how Wendy (Brenda Song) teachers were all her teachers in schools owned by monks, which was very ridiculous. So sum it all, a disappointing movie, but okay if you're 10 or below.
