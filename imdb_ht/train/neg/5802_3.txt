Nikolai Gogol's history has again been "threaded" and has recorded home videos in the United States through movie faith. <br /> <br /> The original story concerns a priest who has to watch over a witch's body and only his faith protects him. Many expand and put in America, though clearly filmed in Russia (houses, clothes and furnishing are all bad despite English signs), this is an odd movie that does not really work. Part of it is the weird environment who are trying very hard to be weed America but clearly is not.There are also some weird, intentionally obscene moments as the main character being a reporter at the start with a priest shortly thereafter. I'm not sure why they did, even after looking at the make of pieces on the DVD) The other problem is the dubbing which is beyond terrible. It does in such a way that everyone speaks when their lips are not on camera - or their voice is not even remotely matched to the lip flashlights. I do not know if his movie film faith or those of the producers who made the movie are expected to be thrown into the West (revealed in iron in pieces). The movie is not very good. As I said it has all sorts of technical issues that just make this an odd odd curio. Although some really good looking movie horror movies never work as a horror movie. As the movie encourages her faith too confused in this response in the amount of money to make anyone feel closer to God. <br /> <br /> Give the choice I would give it a pass, even at a bargain bin price. My advice should be to find the 1960 version of the story called Vine that will bring both some thrills and some understanding of a belief in God.
