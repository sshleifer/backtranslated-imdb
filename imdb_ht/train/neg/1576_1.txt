This film has it all; The turbulent camera works, reminiscent of martin scorcese, or olive stone, the tight act of 'heat', the explosive action of a jerry bruckheimer film, the witty dialogue in a tarantino script and the epicurean feeling of saying 'godfather' br / > <br /> player characters show a fire temper, but also show real emotional depth and intensity. His performance reminds me of painting the niro in the jocke moth's rotting bull. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />! Special effects are pushing technology hinges and achievements within the boundaries. Independence Day sets the standard that this film clearly matches, and unsurpassed. <br /> Overall, great acting in its cast list (as a list of oscars night party invitation!), stylish place, gripping action, and a tight script.
