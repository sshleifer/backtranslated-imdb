My sister and I have now watched that movie. we have laughter those who are deaf. can u imagine on cover has nominated for Oscar ?? - first, the singers were mixing around 4-5 different styles of music ... and the music was not synced with the scenes and the character movements ... <br /> <br /> --- main character Silvester does not fit into the. It looks like Mexican tarzan .-- - Russian soldiers are everything but not Russian faces :-) ----- ok, the main points: 1. planes are called chartered painted in black. <br /> <br /> 2. What is an idea when Rambo goes to jump out of the plane, but he stuck? mixed cord 3. a girl? The best scene is when he dies. It means a lot to him. Does he know it for ages? he cries for her, ... my samurai my god 4. How many arrows is she getting? his arrow is still full of arrows? I did not notice a scene where he collected them - but I saw the scene where arrows stay in the green Vietnam head - which is very important 5. How many rockets helicopters can hold ??? (one real) I saw 4. but Rambos was hit on 20 of them. the main part. what Russian military helicopters special to do in Vietnam ????????? after the war? 7. The first stage when he entered the Vietnam camp ... his first idea was to clear the shelter that stood on the tree on the open space 'wow, what a last thought: 1. with the cutter knife can cut off the iron fil? Maybe only made in Vietnam? 2. Mortar - using to hit one person running? Oh my God, u Americans really need to learn about their weapons! Do you know how much it takes to determine the mortar (I think the writers have watched many movies in World War II)
