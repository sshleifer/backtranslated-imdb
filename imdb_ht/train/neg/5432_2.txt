A battleship leaks ... Its survivors, hanging on a nearby liferaft, sat there to do anything while we go to each of the minds for a series of long recapitulation. Even though Nonel Coward is the only one that you have noticed during the credit, everything in cinematics in it is because of lean. And on technical terms, its very good. David Lean just KNEW movie from the get-go. There are many moments where Coward's study discusses a second place with Lean's visual sense to take center stage. Try the soldiers getting on the boat near the end, with the whole scene; Follow the injection towards the singing songs, scenes in which we are inside a home that has been bombed. Noel Coward is one of the worst actors I've ever seen. It's totally wild, does not show emotions, characters or humanity. You can see it in her eyes that she does not really listen to what the other scene says she just waits for her to run out of her own line. /> <br /> Its epicenter, a small repetitive, and flashback to cover the story: there's no central story that they move, just to give the general overview of the characters. Still, it's an interesting movie worth a look - and a good first for lean. It's not a very deep or penetrating movie, and it's definitely a propaganda movie, but it's also a showcase for Lean's correction skills - it's all about how the pieces are put together.
