This was one of the most ridiculous and seriously directed movies I've seen in a very long time. I never liked Spike Lee, but thought I would give this one a try: bad mistake. The film is supposed to show how Sam realizes the murder of a neighborhood in the summer of 1977; what it really has to do around the boring character that I doubt anyone caring for as far as drug problems, marriage issues, and so on, etc. The scenes depicting murders are just that, and no nothing more; a shoot and then it's back to Fever Saturday Saturday! What's even more ridiculous is Spike Lee's choice to show up as a reporter of the movie: Spike, trust me, you have no Hitchcock, stay out of the movies and make them even worse. The most funny scene was to be the dog talking in a jumping voice, which was shown in a scene before it was supposed to shoot ??? Spike, what did you think when you made this movie? Do not think of all is to guess me. People who think they will see a crime drama, take my advice and do not waste your time or money on this deficit. You are best looking at Jerry Springer in this case! The movie Waste, I gave it a 1 out of 10: terrible dude.
