I like to throw in pretty much however sort of story of unfolding rather slowly. Danny Glover does a great job to ask if he is the bad guy. Meanwhile, the other characters are just a part of the story. Dennis Quaid did not have much room in the story as he might have had. I thought the first scene was a bit about the gloomy top compared to how the story unfolded. I would watch it again though. I rated it a 5 (wanting I could read it a 5.5)
