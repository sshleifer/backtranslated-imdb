Seriously. I just vlip up my first look at Demonicus and words have failed me. <br /> I remember a time when I would see Charles Band's name on a movie and my heart would race. It was never a Wes Craven or a John Carpenter. It was a bastion of hope for the little man. The guy who has movies has come to the video store instead of the multiplex, but still throws harder than most of the trends we have otherwise kept ... <br /> One hundred barges of Californian mall doubles for " the Alps "and an abandoned train tunnel actually assumed" an ancient cave ". I mean, they did not even try to dress up the stuff with moss or movie it in a way that might suggest it was anything other than an old train tunnel! Ugh! Instead of a climbing demon gladiator, as the cover implies, we are treated to a dude wearing the latest at Wal-Mart Halloween dress. There's a pretty cool looking corpse, who occasionally comes to life to belch and tackle his fingers, but he does not even learn to stand until the final five minutes. Why could he not be the wicked? Instead, we had frat boy Joe with a plastic sword. Ouch. <br /> <br /> Charles Band ... you should be disappointed that your name is attached to these drifts. I love movies that are so bad and good. Hell, I occasionally enjoy a flick of films that are wrong, it's just bad. This one, however, is just unwatchable. A perfect example of making a buck, rather than making a quality movie.
