In spite of some interesting sequel (and daring), NBTN just never went. There are explosive boats, pin spikes, mass suicides, pathologists and body parts, and all kinds of classic mysteries / horrors, but they are interspersed with prolonged periods of pure display. All of the film looks bored. This is a shame because many of the sequences should be considered nana at this time this was filmed. <br /> Add this "too-inappropriate" to the British characters and you feel like you've drifted into a movie Sherlock Holmes. <br /> <br /> Finally, the movie is very ordinary. There are plenty of opportunities for beautiful vaccines in the country, or complex shots of someone they have pulled into a great fireworks, but the whole thing is inimitable and dull. <br /> <br /> Definitely only for Lee and Cushing fans.
