Wrong, bad dialogue, bad acting, idiotic, bandits that scramble screen screens that are still running over the script are overacted, and a printed copy of the VHS can not be delivered by consuming liquor. Believe me because I'm glued to this turkey from the end. It was so pathetically bad all over that I had to calculate it was a parody-parody rate in Springtime for Hitler. <br /> <br /> The girl who played Janis Joplin was only the weary spark of interest, and was only because she could sing better than the original. <br /> If you want to look something similar, but one thousand times better, then look Beyond Valley in the Dollars.
