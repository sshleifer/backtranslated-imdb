Pretty terrible, but look and fun. It's the same old story (if you lived in the 80s). Vietnam veterans fought together as friends against injustice back to the United States. The A-Team meets Death, my favorite! <br /> <br /> Time goes on, the soldiers go home, and years later a friend is in trouble. No, wait - in fact, the friend dies and his father is in trouble. Our first hero, Joey, was killed by a very tender meat tenderizer (super pointy) as he tried to defend his little shop from the local "protection" gang despite being tied to the war. Desperate for help, father speaks of sister, leader of Joey's old unit from Vietnam, when Sarge shows up for the funeral. <br /> Well, the squeaky wheel gets the fat, and the old gang saddles up for the city. You can pretty much imagine most of the rest of the movie. <br /> <br /> One thing that drove me crazy is that ticketing keeps guessing her guys on planning, and about how they're really good at what they do when they plan ahead. But Joey would not put in a wheelchair by a shotgun in Vietnam in the first place if the unit did not mess up around! Then when things are really good in the city as they fight the gang, they do it again. There is no reason at all, they completely bypass their plans and try to nail the gang without everyone being present. Phh !!!! I lift my hand in disgust. Organizations! <br /> There are also a momentous suspicion when all members present in the unit are sure to try out their heroines from the gang to make sure it's real. A single one of them. Hmm .... <br /> <br /> What will you do? Keep watch, I guess. The movie is not too horrible to watch, but it's a tease. There are all these climatic when nothing actually winds up happens. The most dramatic things that happen are those at the start of the movie - the explosives in Vietnam, Joey's death battle, and the brutal gang kicking a innocent Teddy bear aside (Poor Teddy!). Guess my main beef and this movie is that I feel left down to it. Even the subplots are confusing and "mystery men" and bizarre cross-purpose motors were not enough to save it to the end. But one day maybe it will all come straight and will make an end. Ha ha ha ha !!!
