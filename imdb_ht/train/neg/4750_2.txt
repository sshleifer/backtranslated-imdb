I gave it a 2/10. <br /> <br /> The scenario was poorly developed, for example, the incidents were too short and short, Hence the moral was not clearly carried out. I thought Brenda Song did a good job, but Shin Koyamada seemed to have a hard time touching his role. I could see the need to put in the western elements of the show, however, some parts, where the Chinese elements needed too! The villain for example. His physical appearance looked like a robot, instead of something from the Chinese culture. The final and the worst flaws, they did what is right, and deformed in the show. <br /> <br /> Others can show that this is a 'kid's show' and hence, there is no need for these high standards. However, there are other Disney shows, such as Mu Lan, were the best in terms of story and story development. <br /> In conclusion, I feel that Disney movies should be best researched and better planned. A good show is not enough and just a series of martial arts movements rely on.
