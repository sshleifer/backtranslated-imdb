I love Anthony Hopkins as an actor so I was very interested to see how she would do as a writer / director. I could not have been more upset by this move. The film was so disjointed and the cinematography was so over to the point I wanted to pull the plug out of the wall. The actors were pretty good but it was like a waste of talent. Not all actors are cut out to be writers or directors and clearly Mr. Hopkins falls into this category. Of all the films I have ever seen in my 50 years, this is absolutely the worst movie ever. Please make us all a favor Mr. Hopkins and stick acting, which you are excellent in, and leave the writing and direct to talented people in these areas. If I could give this film a rating less than one I certainly would.
