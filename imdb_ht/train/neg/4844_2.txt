I am definitely in the opinion of the minority on this one. The "Hurt Locker" won more "Best Photo" awards from the critics' groups than any other film this year. However, not only do I do not like it, I found it hard to sit down. <br /> There are minimal drawings and small character development. They disarm bombs, fight, and disarm more bombs. This is the whole movie. <br /> <br /> But the worst part is that the camera never stops moving and is constantly shaking. This was a recent fad to make films and it is supposed to make it seem more real because it has a cheap, documentary look at it. The camera was so worrisome that it made me nauseus to look at the screen. <br /> I do not normally not care for movie wars and the "Hurt locker" was no exception. But you do not have to take my word for it because critics love it.
