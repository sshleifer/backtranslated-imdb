Are you kidding me ?! A show showing someone who opens boxes and envelopes for a meal? How talented should you do this? It can be cooked, but it does NOT write in the stomach of half-hour churning painful production. I know he has an Martha-Stewart-enchored empire. So, Warren Buffett but I do not see him with fake knockers open boxes of maize cream and Alpo. <br /> She has a nephew named Brycer. Brycer? Stop talking about anyone who is a stupid name. <br /> More time is spent on "table-scene" than the current cooking. Who has the kind of time? Silicon should be on your spatula, not on my TV. This show should be on Cartoon Network, PA Network Foods.
