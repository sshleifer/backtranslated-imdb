Melissa's Seventh Anniversary is right in the corner and she just discovers her sexuality with boys. But it turns out that all the guys are spending time and all the winds up in the movie this generic '80. It's up to the city's Burial Dancers (Bo Hopkins, the Wild Bunch) and her annoying mystery-loving daughter's daughter daughter, Marci (Dana Kimmell, Friday 13th party), to get to the bottom of the killings these. This film focuses more on the mystery aspects and melodrama of the film and less about the killings themselves and thus is able to distinguish itself from a lot of 80 slasher's 80 siblings. It does not hurt that Alesia has a big body (I feel in need of stress and stating that the actress is over 18 and so transmits that I'm not overwhelmed perverted). On the downside, the film is hammered with a few draw points that are underdeveloped and unnecessary, a few grille terms that use a bit too often, and an end that is a tough anti-climatic. But the good outweigh the bad (barely). Give this a rent, but I would not buy it.
