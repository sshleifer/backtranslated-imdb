This "movie" tries to follow the genre of low budget, but has caught flicks cameras that have proved to be very effective and successful. <br /> This one, failed, and folks. / It is amazing how so-called "premium" this piece of rubbish was plastered on the cover ..... it makes you wonder what the critics were about when they actually submitted this .... < br>>> Failure to describe just how terribly profound this movie is. Seriously, it is ked. <br /> I watch it in 20 minutes flat, almost always fast forward. <br /> From trash grabs to direct grains, visual sound sounds sound, and of course do not forget ABYSMAL acting, this was one piece completely and totally pathetic in the so-called movie making. <br /> It's badly, there is no kind of redefining - too. Save your cash and look a decent low low-film movie, there are lots of outside - Dead end, the Blair Witch, REC, in the name but a few. Do not waste your money or time on this trash for a current movie. Be careful of all the other comments! You've been warned!
