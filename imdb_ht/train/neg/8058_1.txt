Having seen the hot Elisha Dushku in the very good turn of the turn, I decided to pick this one up instead of returning to the living dead, in every movie. Not seeing one yet, but considering it is one of the most acclaimed cinema ever, safe to say I made the wrong choice. There is simply nothing to recommend this movie, and I'm talking about supposedly superior to the killer. He did not even have juvenile appeal to mediocre in poor cinema as I know what you did last summer or Valentine or Urban Legend. It simply did not make any sense, made no excitement, there were very little interesting to act or compassionate. Released to date apparently placed many times for about one year running, and the reason is obvious. The whole movie comes as a bunch of unpopular scenes thrown together harshly, in effect. Get wrong turns turn instead, if you want to see Dushku. I would like to see a movie with her and the super-hot Elizabeth Harnois - but I do not even think that would make this film watchable. Casey Affleck, so promising to Good Will Hunting, is terrible here - it seems to miss both intelligence and bowel. That's enough on this one.
