I love monster movies, generally. Though they are implausible and funny. But its hard to like this movie when its plumbers smash funny and try to take it seriously all at the same time. Like a kind of really posh in style. <br /> While the idea is a bit of reality, as the Orcas are known to kill big white sharks, it's really hard to find it frightening when I can not help but just see a mad Shamoo destroying things. Especially that one scene where some buildings exploded the cause of the Orca ... and while it exploded, the stuff jumped out of the water and it felt like I was watching a show of Sea World and Fireworks. Plus they kill a lot in moments of fear before they even hint that will happen. On top of that, it takes a few jabs of JAWS. It's like "Hey look, we're being real and we can come up with the best reason that Orca is attacking." Yes, you ignore your headphones **** UPS in logic of course. But JAWS has only one movie thing you do not. Its scary. Yes implausible. Its a bit outrageous. But quite frankly, fact or not, a killer shark is not close to being as scary as a Great White. And the poor attempt of character development and writing just hurts me more. Even the JAWS revenge is fatter than that.
