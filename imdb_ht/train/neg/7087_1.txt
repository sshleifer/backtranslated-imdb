I would not normally write a comment on-line, but this is the worst movie I've ever seen. Not only that it was filmed just like a set of soap (the "young and the restless" is really filmed by professionals compared to this), but it also has terrible cuts. He has no action. It is full of wasteful waste. <br /> Here's an example: a guy wants to kill the main character as he was shot because of him. So (after loads of crap) here are: The guy puts a knife into his throat and says something like "You're dying right now". Then the main character says: "If you kill me you die. I told the police you threatened me." So the guy (killer) goes like (just to cry): "Oh no ... the cops will follow me! Oh !! my God." <br /> <br /> Remember: this is just an example. I really can not believe that this movie actually exists. So: IF you want to watch the WORM movie ever ... go ahead, I recommend it :)
