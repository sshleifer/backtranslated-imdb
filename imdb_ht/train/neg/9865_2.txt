I picked up this movie in the hope it would look like the hilarious "gamers" by dying Mr. Productions (which is very recommendable, by the way). Boy, what a deception! The film is shot in this fake fake documentation made famous in the office, but it fails to deliver. The reason is partly acting stiff, but mostly writing and directing. True, it can be funny to use every song cliche has on the role playing game, but here it is done in such a way that it becomes very predictable. Already at the beginning of each stage you know what the "joke" going on. But perhaps the biggest problem is that everything is depicted on the head. There is no intricacies of this film, if there were "many now" captions or a cheap 80s-style fake-style tracking it would not make much difference. With some scenes you can not help thinking "Yes, I find out why this thought would be funny" but the way it executed takes all the momentum out of the joke possible.
