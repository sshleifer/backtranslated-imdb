This is one of the worst movies ever made. Trite. Projected. Flat. <br /> The only thing that rated a point had a few beautiful scenes in Barcelona. I think they would use films like this in Guantanamo or some other hidden CIA / NSA suspects torture prison. <br /> <br /> Often bad movies have some features of stampers, this is nothing. If I were in it or worked on it, I might change my name. Surely a turdock. Difficult to write more than this, but I feel the movie Watchers in the world need a head up on this. On the other hand it will make a great gift for people you can not stand. <br /> You can send it to your politician or flu, in law, ex-wife, teacher hated, senior staff, Dick Cheney, W., and a host of others.
