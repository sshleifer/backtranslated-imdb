I would give this movie 5 instead of 3 if it would be at least in time ... When I saw it the first time it was just that you could wait in the work based on the artistic abilities of the hand directors on the ideal or I prefer to say idiotic habits in our government (Kazakhstan) ... It's a shame, because 'Qazaqfil'm' shot beautiful movies when it was not honored by the name of shaking Aimanov, but it was actually run by him. These films include 'Konec Atamana', 'Kyz Zhibek' or even 'Aldar Kose'. But after Aimanov's death the production of cheap movies went down almost dramatically in 10 years time there were so many films produced. However, by the late 1980s, 'Assa' was shot, it was a movie about the first organized crime group in the big country, a year later Mr. Rashid Nugmanov shot another film and co-starred at the same actor / singer, At that time it was already a Soviet / Russian legendary rock, - the film called 'Igla' (Needle or something) was completely new, someone called this period as a resurrection or a new Kazakh movie. Unfortunately, nowadays, we do not have a quality movie, film directors of French and Japanese financial support, and so are not the public cinema, but for professional critics, some of them take a prize on international film festivals but there are a very few of them become a good business product ... And again go back to our 'nomad'. These films are usually popular because of vast aspect. The same effects were Nikit Mikhalkov's 'Sibirski Cyrilnik' on Russian Zar, which was also shot on parity with foreign partners, I think they were French or perhaps British. Nobdy liked her, even in Russian public she came as a main topic in a comedy and comedy show as 'KVN'. IMHO
