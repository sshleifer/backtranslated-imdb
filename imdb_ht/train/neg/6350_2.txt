I've seen my share of Woody Allen's movies, and while they are not always great, you can usually make sure you're going to be entertained. Probably the last ones really were Bullets on Broadway ('94) and Aphrodite Warriors ('95) - since then those I've seen have been patchy but look. So, when I was invited to see Melinda's new Melinda Melinda and Melinda films, which I did not even know they were released, I went along happily. I did not really hear much about it so I hope I should be pleasantly surprised. What I got was definitely the worst movie Woody Allen I've seen. The first is over-explained, the cast is terrible, the script is slow and dead. Too many scenes said nothing and yet stretched out, I supposed to fill what would otherwise have become a short 15 minute film. <br /> I do not mind the concept behind this film - two directors discuss how a simple situation can be interpreted as a comedy or a tragedy, and obviously the movie continues to show us that, by playing out both scenarios. The problem neither of these 'two films' is any good at all. The comedy is not funny and the tragedy is not very tragic. It seems like Allen has come up with a good idea but then runs out of steam, or time, actually fills the movie. <br /> <br /> The overall level of acting is also very bad - Do Ferrell is the only one who brings anything to the table, and it's basically an impression of Woody Allen. Previously good actors like Chloe Sevigny just come in as annoying, and the worst of the bunch is Radha Mitchell as Melinda (which is a shame, because his character is in almost every scene!). Just the actors, the script are working and is missing if not the non-existent. Definitely a long way from the Allen we know and love from classics like Manhattan or Annie Hall.
