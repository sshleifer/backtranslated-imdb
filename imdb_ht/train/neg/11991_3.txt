- Move Stuff: This movie is real crap. Bad exhibit on one thing, to look so fake I thought this was the "Twilight Zone". Flatbacks are pretty much useless. Part of the film she thinks takes her anger out on a window making her life better. I want to know the casting director and if he was high because the act, even from the adults seized. A kiss scene in this movie is sucking. This movie killed the book. The book was great. I highly recommend this movie. Not even for educational purposes. <br /> <br /> - Good thing: I do not know what I can really say. There are some suspension parts that make you go, but they are quick to shoot down to the bad stunt work and act. <br /> <br /> - My advice: do not look.
