I watched the movie recently and it sounds like the book is based. I blame this on poor scenario and direction. Some parties have sneaked into (gay rape scene) for no apparent reason. I actually read the book after watching the movie and some 20 years or so after reading it for the first time. I found it difficult to read with a bit clumsy. Too many different ideas are presented for no benefit at all ... other than sensational parties for the time. As it covers the things that were 'sensitive', they say at least, during communism, I can see the passion it produced at the moment. This is not the case yet though or maybe I see things different now or somewhat in both. The movie tries too much to cover many aspects of the book, the result being a contest in scenes that can make some sense of someone reading the book. Even if this is a movie that is difficult to look and maybe never have to do.
