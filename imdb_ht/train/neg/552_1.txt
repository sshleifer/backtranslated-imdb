I was sitting at almost one episode in this series and just could not take anymore. She felt as though I would have watched dozens of episodes already, and then he hit me ... .. Nothing new here! I heard that joke about Seinfeld, I saw someone falling like that on friends, an episode of blessing day was almost the same storyline, ect. None of the interesting actors here either! Some were good at other shows (not here), and the new ones in a profession should never enter. Avoid this stinker!
