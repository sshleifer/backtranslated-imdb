One of the pillars of low-budget movies will take a well-known, classic scenario and make a complete bastardization from it. Phantom in the center is no exception to this rule. The senarist takes Phantom's perceptions of the Opera storyline and moves to a retired 80s mall. However, the "Phantom" goal now is simply to get revenge on those responsible for defying his face and killing his family. The special effects provide a good chuckle, especially when the body parts begin to appear in dishes from the yogurt stand. Pauly Shore has a small role that does not allow him to be as dreadful as one would expect, especially due to the fact that his fifteen minutes in MTV fame was not yet. If you are looking for a few good laugh at the expense of the actors and crew special effects, check out this movie out. Otherwise, keep on looking for something else.
