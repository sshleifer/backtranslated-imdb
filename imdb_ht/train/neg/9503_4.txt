Also known in a different form as "House of Exorcism," this room <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> also <br /> <br /> too. <br /> <The reserve scheme involves European tourists Elke Sommer who have a <BR> <br /> chance to run in with Telly Savalas, which looks just like the devil it <br /> see on a freshen in the square. Summer gives a ride to a mysterious house home page, where Savalas happens to be <br /> Butler. There is a mistake for a woman to die, and the real theater theater theater begins. The Blind Mary in the House <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />, The couple who gave summer the ride? <br /> Well, the woman will give the driver, uh, "back seat driver <br /> <br /> lesson," and the husband knows and does not care. Eventually, <br /> <br /> most of the die cast, summer is drug and rape, <br /> <br /> night, and the viewer took to a better point on board a blank <br / > <brjecta.pl that must have looked like the empty theaters <br /> stuff played in. .. The alternate version of this, "House of Exorcism," has scene <br> <br /> added involving a priest. <br /> <br /> The copy of this VHS, from Elite Entertainment, is crystal clear and <br /> <br /> letterboxed. There are "extra" after credit ends; delete gender <br /> <br /> and gore scenes. <br /> <br /> Mario Bava's direction is fast and furious, but his scenario is terrible. There are half cooked ideas, abandoned plotlines, and <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> convincing stunning that does nothing more than pushing this stuff <br /> in some sort of direction forward. You have life like dummy <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> and Savalas give the lolipop even having in "Kojak," (who is <br /> <br /> do, baby?). <br /> <br /> The project looks like they have two non-stars, then write the script <br /> quickly, something that's happening in Hollywood on a daily <br /> < br /> incident right now. Savalas looks utterly lost, delivering him <br /> line haltingly, and wishing his character was not killed in the "dirty room" dozens. " Summer runs around and screams with a lot of humus, but <br /> <br /> <br /> Its character is a blank, I use the term "character" wounds. Only something we know about it is its name. <br /> This is a real strange movie, and your reaction it might depend on <br /> how heavy you are in Eurohorror, and Kojak. I'm not sure someone can <br /> recomment "Lisa and the Devil". <br /> <br /> This is unrated, and includes all the extras at the end of the VHS <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Gorge, strong nudity, nudity men, sexual content, and adult situations
