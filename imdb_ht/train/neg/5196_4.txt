Though a bit more polished technically than the previous movie in the series, BULLDOG DRUMMOND ESCAPES, this is a weaker escapade of both a plot of less thrilling and a leading man who simply does not have the charisma of Ray Milland. <br /> That said, many actors and characters continued in their role and managed to keep the flag flying. Also John Barrymore is present, popping up all of the movie in a variety of strange disguises. So it's another endless night for BD as he and his coyote chase around trying to save the poor girl she intends to marry. Suggestions are stupid but again the actors often support their fun.
