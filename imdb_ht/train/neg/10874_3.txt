I just finished a marathon in this series, and it became agonizing to look as it progressed. From the historical factuality of the historic elements, to O'Herlihy's awful accent in later episodes, the show just slipped the more he goes. If you are looking for some quality production that is generalized WW2 duve, then I could recommend season 1, but avoiding anything afterwards, it degenerates into being one step from a soap opera, with increasingly Worse history and tenderness. <br /> <The old B & W film is by far the best of any form of entertainment with the name Colditz attached to it, and even that is not something someone could expect for.
