This is really horrible: irritating screaming stylist performers and deep incoherent dialogues that take place in scenes that seem to have no purpose, no start, middle or end, cut together without any noticeable narrative attention or even cognitive, all of the service of some "stories" is entirely refreshingly and almost detectable. What makes it worse is the "movie style" pretentiousness: suddenly a remote-head shot spiral technique and, without any apparent reason there are suddenly whip-wap or wobbly-kept sections: all this " style "simply serves the almost incredible large project misconception and almost offensive vaccine in the material. Definitely a candidate for the worst movie ever made.
