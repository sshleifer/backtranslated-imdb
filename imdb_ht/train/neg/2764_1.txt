First, I have no idea how this film made it to the big screen. It's not the same budget low SCI-Fi movie channel, just its terrible. Me and my friends who love action movies, Independence Day, Jurassic Park, LotR, etc. went to see this movie awaiting this movie to make me a transformer and dragon, mindless entertainment. All we got was a mindless and a half hour. The CG was not as bad as I expected, but the plot was so awful along with the act she made up for her. It basically a Chinese string of dragons returns every 500 years ... sounds like a good rumor of rain in fire? No, the plot is trying to deeper than it should be left by ditch only drawn, but with magic, and a little real healing between dragons (rather big snakes) it just becomes ridiculous. The director tried to add a bit of humor to the movie that weakens. Me and my friends laughed at the whole thing (and all 5 of the audience), and cant believe we were spending money on this. The short trailer on TV makes up for most of the action while crap makes up the rest. I've seen a lot of movies B like Reptilian, Cave, Spider, and others, but I said if you want a laugh to stop by for an hour, watch this. <br /> <br /> History: 1/10 CG: 5/10 Actress: 3/10 <br /> I do not drink ... but would have helped before watching this movie
