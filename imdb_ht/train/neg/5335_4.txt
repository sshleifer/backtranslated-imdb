It was a looooonnnggg time since I saw this comedy, and I would just forget how idiotic it is. I would put this easy at lower two or three of Elvis Presley's worst movies. Presley plays Joe Whitecloud, a half-raccoon Indian rider who returns home to Arizona and Shack's break-down where his family lives, and where his friends love to party all night long. His parents played by Burgess Meredith and Katy Jurado, and his old American father is Thomas Gomez. None of three offers anything of substance, humorous or otherwise. The government has invested in the cattle, but they are missing a bull. Elvis gets singing just a few worthless songs, and he is pursued by a young-crazy gal and mother-toting mother. This is just a real slapdash in a mess, and the dilapidated practices practically stink in manure and do not make it easier. The only thing that's my puzzles, however, is that Elvis actually seems to have a good time in the movie. Hard to believe, considering it was upset about being stuck in many movies.
