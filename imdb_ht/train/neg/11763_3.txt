Yes. I'll admit it. I believe all the hype surrounding this piece of work, the trials and tribulations of 6 people, living in Mexico regarding sexual life. So I really expected to finally see a Mexican movie (at age) that was both popular and interesting to watch. Unfortunately the film was utterly disappointing. The story presents us with two couples, both with very obvious marital problems. When a third party comes to life every couple, the problems come to an important point. Or absolute absolute. The plot then turns into a fight in their sex. The positions taken each group (yes, they literally group, girls and girls and boys and boys) are flagrant stupid and childish (I guess the mood was supposed to be). And it all goes out of bad worse. Their performance varies from Miss (Miss Zavaleta) to mediocre (Mr Bichir), and Serrano performs an acceptable job on his great opera. However, the flatness of the plot, the characters of one dimension, the very poor (if not stupid) perception of sex represented in a mature relationship etc., make the film fail. Miserab. SPYL has an impressive (impressive) reception in the box-office. Believe the hype at your own risk.
