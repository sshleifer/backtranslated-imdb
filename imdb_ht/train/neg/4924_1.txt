This movie is really bad. It may be harsh, but it is. It really is. Poor script, each vampire cliche in the book is used, and they have no sympathy given in all the origins of the main character ... That's Dracula. There were some really brilliant Dracula / Vampire movies in the past, but that did not even make it to the "top" place. Take a selection of those who seem to have fallen from a Adolescent-slasher move, add a dribble to Dracula Lore and mix in a tonic Falling in religious / surreal day-dreaming ... and you get a confusion of a movie - Dracula 2000. <br /> <br /> I really can not find any good thing to say about this movie, as if it was not bad enough that he did in the first place, seems to have made Johnny Lee Miller The effect of an English accent ... What's the problem with what I hear you cry ... Well, it's English, but it sounds like an American trying to make an English accent. <br /> In all of this you can as well say your money (if you thought of buying it), or rent it out, watch it, and discover for yourself why it's about as scary like the Tellytubbies. <br /> PS Despite La La is very scary!
