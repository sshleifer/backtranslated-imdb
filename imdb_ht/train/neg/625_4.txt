With excessive violence in this film, he could have been NC-17. But the gor could have been pg-13 and there was quite a lot of swearing when the mummy had jackass original friend of boy-hairdewed boy boy. There was a lot of character development that made the movie the best to watch, then after the kid came back to life like the scarecrow, there was a mindless and ten minute hour of her murder. Violence was too much and I thought that the money was higher than twelve that is a large number of movies like this. Almost every character of the film is sewn or gets itself cut off, but the professor has called it "white garbage" and "hoodlum" (though the character lester is anything but a hoodlum, not even close, i know ot and party hood, not drawn in class, they sit down and throw things from the teacher). The teacher deserved a death more harder than anyone in the characters, but he just stabbed the back. There were two thriller scenes in the movie, but did not last long enough to be scared at all. As I said, the killings were too much and sometimes those who have nothing to do with the story line get themselves off. If the gor was actually fun to see, then it would have been nc-17. Two children describe a body found in the gardens, described as a gorye much more than it actually was, explained to the cop that there were maggals pulled around the triangular men. His belly did not even cut open so there was no way the maggots were in his stomach, though I would like to see it. The act was pathetic, the characters were losers, and the scarecrow could do a lot of gymnastics exhibit. I suggest renting this movie for the scene of death, I do not see it anytime soon but I enjoyed the excessive violence. Also, do not bother with the end, I watch five minutes of it and being bored to death, it sounds good, but not. The original scarecrow actually keeps me interested.
