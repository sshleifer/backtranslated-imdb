Pain. Pain is the word only to describe this terrible pronoun in such a fun and exciting Shakespearean play. I gave her a shot, but she was terribly disappointed and she could not even finish watching her. For those who wrote a novel about how wonderful this twist Ado was, I am merciless to you and your boring brain. Be pretent about young viewers rising without retribution. Please do not even bother with this gut wrenching, disgusting excuse for a performance in a Shakespeare acclaimed drama. You will be forced to induce vomiting and will require a commodity close to the TV with which you choose to watch this crap because unintentional defenses will take place.
