I'll keep that short, as I know I do not need to say so much. <br /> <br /> "Alive" is a strange little movie that obviously appeals to some, but I found it to be shocking sharply from almost the very start. The film made very little to make any of the characters likable and the story at times became so entangled that I completely lost interest. As I said, I know other people liked it, but I found Kitamura's "living" to be anything but - a lame, very boring drama disguised as a thought-provoking action action sci-fi flicker movie . I felt like I was suckered in watching this movie, based on its intriguing quotes and uber-exciting art covered. <br /> <br /> My suggestion? Spend it for Easam easier effort Kitamura's "Versus" or 2004 riot "Godzilla: Final War". <br /> <br /> ... and do not get me wrong, I'm still up for a good movie to think of the person, but that's certainly not it. There was a moment that I actually cared about a single event taking place in this heavily-preachy, film-heavy film. <br /> <br /> If you want to talk about something ... talk about boring.
