Although in many ways I agree with the comments other comments. I find that the plot and ideas are very good. Many of the supporting actors were very good. The fatal problem with this movie is Ellen Pompeo. I'm sure I've never seen a less talented "actor" How this person ever was in a movie or TV, I can not imagine. In my opinion it would be best as a major at a Wal Mart. To see someone with this low level of talent involved in paying roles, ask the question ...... "Who knows?" I'd love to see this film re-do with some talent. I'm not the writer's fault for the failure of this movie to be worth the time to view it.
