Apparently intended for a thriller in a wind up movie being almost mockingly. It encourages me to call "Oh my God!" More than once conscious of the lust of the plot was just plain funny. <br /> <br /> Local or absurd places just for the absolute gift or dramatic and incredible situation, near impossible, human reactions and the extreme circumstances to be complete as to why they exist. <br /> If you have time and want to discover just how bad a picture can then you will want to see this one. Otherwise dedicate some time to watching some dry paintings for a most productive investment in time! This film was released in 2003 already being shown on television in July 2003 might provide an indication of the movie quality)
