Pictures that usually glorify a hero have meaning. As an example, Bonnie and Clyde praise the dynamic bank robbers, and you actually felt sympathy for their bad actions. Why? They were two people who were caught in depression when people were desperate to survive. <br /> <br /> This movie has absolutely no substance. The character Viggo Mortensen soon appeared as a popular hero. Why? It speeds along highway Idaho highway on the road to the hospital where his wife took. No one dares to understand why he's trying to run everyone. Even worse, when the realization becomes apparent that it is not a red-faced terrorist, no one in the government wants to help him as they try to save their backs. <br /> <br /> Jason Priestley co-star as an emcee radio that builds on the story of our hero's support. <br /> The end is absolutely incredible.
