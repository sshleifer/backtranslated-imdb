I love the book, "Jane Eyre" and have seen many versions of it. All have strong points and faults. However, this was one of the worst I saw. I did not care about Jane or Mr. Rochester. Charlotte Gainsbourg (Jane) was almost tolerated and certainly looked the part of the plain, but she had no emotions in any of her lines. I could not imagine what Mr Rochester saw in her. <br /> <br /> This brings us to Mr. Rochester. William Hurt had the same emotional emotions than Jane, if that was possible. How can these people be inappropriate to fall in love is a mystery, but it certainly did not keep my attention. Maybe the director (Zeffrelli) fell asleep during the production. Dalton's child (too cute for Mr. Rochester!) The version is far more faithful to the book, but Ciaran Hinds plays Mr. Rochester's perfect in 1997 A / E version true of the book). Try to find something positive about this movie: Geraldine Chaplain was perfect in her role.
