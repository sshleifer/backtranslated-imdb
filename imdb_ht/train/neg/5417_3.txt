Three Aristocracy Russia soaked up the decline of Monte Carlo, despite the fact that they came down to their last cats. In order to support their lifestyle, the three use the services of a counterfeit, and use the notes in the casinos, exchanging currency exchanges for a skin. Andre Hughes, a U.S. envoy, came to Monaco with his wife Helen, and the three decided to paddle with visitors, hoping for financial assistance. One of the three Russians, Count Sergius Karamzin, plans to go further, and advanced continuously towards Helen, while the irresistible maid Count, who loves Sergius. Eventually, circumstances play their hands against the three aristocracy. It is obvious that Von Stroheim was trying to convey a message (with the folly of American women and the bad behaviors of the aristocracy), rather than telling a story, and the movie really can make modern hearings, like me, easy to do . Even the act, which is great in later EvS like greed and wedding masks, is just running in the factory here. The film has been used upgrades at different levels. Rating, 3.
