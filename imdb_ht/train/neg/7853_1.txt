No scheme, engaging act, and unnecessary gore .... <br /> <br /> This is supposed to be a horror movie? There is no fear, or suspense, just BOOM BANG GORE, then do. There are some nuns in the desert for some strange reason, and they get hunted down to those mutated creatures from the first movie, which was good, and they should leave it at that. just another excuse for money, and use freeware violence, just like "Saw" the suites. They know no matter how tricky the draw is, and the more they can add, the people will see it. I miss good film suspense suspense. Come on Hollywood, you can do a lot, better.
