........ and a very bad at that !!! How long is this train-wreck last? Episodes 14 or something? I can see why now. I bought the episode "Serenity" from Amazon Unboxed. It was my first purchase, so it was free. That's just the right thing about the incident (incident ??) <br /> I will not really comment on acting, since that, I guess, fairly new people who did not really get the job down just right again. At least I never saw them before in any kind of great show, theater or TV. If I did, then I was easily forgotten. <br /> But the special effects were absolutely horrendous. True, this is not exactly a multi-million dollar project project, but the original Star Trek made better than that & THIRTY-FIVE years ago. I especially got a laugh out of the bad guys (grapple or something like that) as it chases the hilarious carpet, and smoke from the engines looking something like a monstrous model rocket. I am fully expected to eventually see Wiley Coyote riding on top, while pursuing the Roadrunner. MODEL jet / engine rocket does not even make it bad. <br /> And this was not even the worst of it. Wild-type shoot-outs were asked if I was actually watching a sci-fi movie or a single autry genre. Whatever the hype, do not waste your time ... I did ... all 80-something minutes of the disaster called "Firefly".
