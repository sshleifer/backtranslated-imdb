I could not tell if the "Skulling Skull" was trying to have a Hitchcock Rip off or an upgraded Edgar Allen Poe tribute. These days, someone would have cut it a bit and presented it as one of those TV episodes of anthology from the old "Tales from Dark Side" ... but only after an extensive hardship. Sad thing is, there seems to be a beautiful, nasty little story trying to get out under the rubble of this movie, and the actors will obviously do the best they can with both the talents and the material they have to work with. But the director just did not know how to step or pace a dramatic scene; The special effects simply did not work; The telegraphed scenario traces its threadbar so clear that a bivalve could be seen coming; and the band kept playing music "Oompah Band" German when it was supposed to try to scare the audience. They tried; they tried really hard. But this is of interest only as a period of time. I suppose a very young person who did not see a lot of suspense or horror might get a load out of the Skulling Skull, but a young person Probably would not find most of subtext or motivation to draw. ("Mommy, why is this lovely man trying to scare the twisty face of scary-cat ladies ??")
