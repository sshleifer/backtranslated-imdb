This is a decent effort but the guy who wrote the scenario seems to be a bit of the dark as to what exactly does a cool zombie film. No, not CGI bugs and software companies. Actually I'm not sure it was a software company - I saw it without subtitles so I guess what they're talking about. Anyway I was - instead of wasting your time hosting some bug-donkey bugs, why not throw in more zombies and more action. 2/3 in 20 minutes include news bulletins, bugs, some guys on something. And to make matters worse (more boring) most of the deaths occur on the screen. I realized that it is all too common for no budget budgets, but then there were some very impressive effects (well, the type) that let me ask why the director (or senarist, whichever) chose They focus on how the epidemic began - It's a short, nobody will take care anyway.
