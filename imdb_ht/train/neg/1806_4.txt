Antonioni's movie of age is not well. What always surprised me is that, besides an unquestionable plastic beauty, there is a matte and pedagogical "psychology" of the characters and situations. Remember, for example, the conversation between Mastroianni and "ruthless capitalist" who wants to sing it in "La Notte", or Monica Vitti laughs at the flirting peasants of the train in "La aventura", or Ferzetti cast the ink glass end of the same movie. I reviewed yesterday "Zabriskie Point". In this film there are a lot of beautiful and elaborate shots in the Taylor Taylor office, streets and highways in LA, the advertising advertisements, deserts, etc., showing the passion of the author of his American trip to The same way Wim Wenders years later. Unfortunately, there are too many left-clickers who spoiled the film: - The boy leaves the meeting, steals an airplane and flies over the desert to free himself and find "something different". - The executives in gray suites speak all the time about speculation. - The girl looks at the "object objects" of the pool and herbs because she wants to not be like them. - The middle-class coupe of the caravan speaks, in front of the beauty of the nature, to build a hotel and earn a lot of money. - Last but not least, a lot of couples make love in the desert. What a lipy platinum! <br /> <br /> Sorry, today, half a century after the "revolution" of "Aventura" we can see that the King is naked, and its films (except "Amber" and perhaps the "Grido") is only a handful of aesthetics and Commonplaces.
