Well. that was not a surprise. many people will tell you this is gory. but they all speak "shiztz" this film is very slowly. <br /> It starts off with some guys who make a conccoction to feel no pain and call it "my son" have some fascinating scenes but i have found them kind of weak. you might as well jump 40 minutes into the movie and get the eyeball scene that was surprisingly impressive and disgusting. There are some really stupid scenes in this. and they dub on the hit and bumps with stupid fake sounds that make me laugh! I would not recommend it. Keep watching Gore throat. <br /> <br /> Check out this out if you want such 20-10 minutes the end stage that still is not amazing and there is a random scene of the guy trying to love violating his mum .. yeah it weird .
