The first half of this version was the best I saw (and I think I've seen all Jane Eyre version ever made). Development of Jane's infancy and character was exceptional. Then it was like someone saying "Uh oh, this is running too long," and hacked the rest of the story of shreds. The largest scene, when included in all, are glossed over, combined, and set out in order in a way that completely changed the scenario. There have been many transitions or even scenes of development that it would be difficult for anyone not familiar with the same story to follow. The great designation was that at the beginning opened a lot of hope, and then the end was shot.
