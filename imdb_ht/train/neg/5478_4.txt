There is nothing better for me to have decided to check out "Aztec Rex" (as it was the bill) for the hell of it. <br /> <br /> The funny story could play best if the dinosaur effects were convincing. They actually looked like animated (these rough designs by later artists used to end up the CGI effects, add more details, smoother moves, etc.) Absolutely horrible looking dinosaur, which is the only reason you'd probably want to sit at that in any way. <br /> <br /> One redemption factor was the beautiful Dachen Lachman as Ayacoatl. He kept my interest; if only the budget has been ramped up and some convincing dinosaurs could be used. <br /> <br /> Irritating. At least the cast and crew had a free trip to Hawaii, where the movie was filmed.
