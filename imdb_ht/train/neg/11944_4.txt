I rented this movie thinking it was sobbingly sad 1959 version I saw as a kid. It was not. I was very disappointed with what I felt was marginal act, poor character development, and most of all, failure to emphasize the relationship between the boy and his dog. In this version ... "The Dog of Flanders" is just a beautiful "sidewalk" in the movie. Find the version in 1959!
