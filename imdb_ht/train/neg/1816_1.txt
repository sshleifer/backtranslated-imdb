This movie is really brilliant. It ducks in crapiness banality at these speeds you do not even see common sense and common designs for humanity to go past whizzing. But he does not stand there! This movie hit the bottom of the barrel so hard it bounces back to the point of comic comedy: Look as Kor converant√© the conan's wannabe and the abundance over her hair as she rips her portraits like no tomorrow (and the way she swing it, I'm really surprised there was * a * tomorrow for him, or at least for his beer beer. Do not miss this movie, it's a fantastic fantastic of idiocy, and absolute absolute absolute! And once you look at this one, dry tears of joy (or tears of frustration in an inept tantrum in storytelling) in your eyes because some stupid f00l have given these people another $ 5 to make a sequel !
