I could name many funny movies. Comedies are set out to be funny, and they. Some movies, such as a Gymkata for example, try to be serious but funny comedy. The Lady Man is a movie that desperately tries to be funny, but it could not be less funny if it was about a guy who got a lot of chicks in the middle of the wreckage of a nuclear nuclear burn. It's anti-comic. <br /> I do not think I laugh harder than a chuckle of anything in this movie. It's simply unfunny. It's boring, stupid, inane, annoying, bogglingly bad, but not funny. I do not particularly care for Tim Meadows, or this character from SNL, but I hope better than this. The movie is completely lacking logic or common sense. As the script writer had a bag on his head while he was typing and he could not see which key he was hit. They say "the origin" of the Ladies man, but fail to include a motivation for his scarcely passionate and acting as it's still sixty. The film tries to get humor from a man who looks fun in pornography, shortly after he tried to hang himself. This is comedy? I like to consider myself having a very sensitive sense of humor (Spend a lot of time writing comedy as I do), but maybe I'm just not quite bright enough for this movie. <br /> <br /> Lee Evans, so funny as the Tucker There's Something About Mary, is incredibly bad here. I pleaded with him in my head closed. <br /> <br /> In the end I was pounding on my chair, muttering under my breath, and the movie had gone on any longer, would probably have tried suicide. This movie might not be as bad as Earth Battle, but it's the first movie I've seen this come off. <br /> <br />
