I said that this was the worst movie of priyadarshan (releasing along with the best kyonki also its corporate director), it has no specific and just focused focus on the body shown by debut actresses and some comedy sequences funny. I think priyadarshan will become too repetitive in his comedy flicks like Govinda and David dhavan made in the past after giving some good lover they also went to their audience. So it will be good for him to focus more on script and try some variations in his direction. Give us more of the erapheri and malamally every week rather than giving dudes like garam masala!
