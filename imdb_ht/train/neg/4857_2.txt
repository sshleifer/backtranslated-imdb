I really love ZB1. Really, I did. I have no problem with extremely low-budget movies, and I've enjoyed movies and production values ​​worse than ZB3 (if you can imagine something like that. Check out 'wiseguys vs zombies,' if you are interested). Indeed, I prefer to lower zombie budget film, because I suspect that Hollywood director does not understand what the zombies are 'about.' But ZB3 was just so bad. It was delayed. I do not want to bother being dignified in my criticism. I want 90 minutes to go back, etc. Except that it really only takes ~ 80 minutes, because the part I put it in 1.4X fast forward. <br /> <br /> Well, here's some criticism. <br /> <br /> 1. The rally was tERRIBLE. Everyone spoke of monologue. Even when someone just had one line, the camera work with the correction and the insertion of a bunch of F bombs in each sentence made the line feel like a monologue. At first I was excited about the 90 minute running time compared to the 70-minute ZB1, but there was actually less 'event' in ZB3. It's all talking. <br /> 2. The gore effects got stupider. Just glop rubbing around on tummies people. <br /> <br /> 3. Despite the seasonal exposure, there really was not a draw. And the display is true season! I will not spoil it, if you're going to watch it. (Do not watch it.) But then, it's just a bunch of characters that are walking around with bickering for ~ 80 minutes. or less, if you are so selected.
