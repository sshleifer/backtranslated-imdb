This movie was on t.v the other day, and I did not enjoy it at all. The first George in the jungle was a good comedy, but the end .... completely terrible. The new actor and actress to play the lead roles was not good at all, they should have had the original actor (Brendon Fraiser) and original original (I forgot his name) for this movie gets out of 0 in ten , not a movie that you can sit and watch and enjoy, this is a movie that you go to another channel or take it back to the shop if you hire or bought. It was good to see Ape back in back, but not as fun as the first, should be in the new George as the son rose up and still was Bredon and (what his face) in the movie, you was a bit better then it was.
