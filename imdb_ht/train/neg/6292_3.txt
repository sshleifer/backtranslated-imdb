I wonder how many films this actually happened to film in 1984 "Bachelor Party", starting Tom Hanks. Is this movie even an official ending? This film is missing in every department and you're obviously better not watching it. <br /> For a movie comedy this is simply not good or funny enough. It depends mainly on their stereogenic character ratings, rather then the movie actually features some good, original and funny moments. <br /> Of course there are also many little stories present and the nude movie breast than script page. You just keep waiting for things to finally start off. There is a main conspiracy line in it somewhere, but that one is so terribly initially and gets executed so badly in the movie that it feels more like it's something that is not-existent. I guess there is even a message and moral story in it somewhere but this is so terribly initially and wrongly done in the movie that it simply does not work out. It's basically a typical young comedy, and lots of sex and naked jokes, only without the main characters of young, making the story all the more sad and tastes. The movie does some really bad jokes, which is deplace for any kind of movie. <br /> I'm sorry ever watching this.
