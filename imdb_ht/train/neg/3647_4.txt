It's a good thing I did not look at this while I was pregnant. I definitely would have to call my eyes out and / or vomit. It was primarily horrible type of disturbing. I personally thought the baby was adorable in her own tristed little way.However, like a mom I cringed when Pet was standing in the stomach and when Virgina announced the child during his 3rd quarters and utensils by less .. Also, as an animal lover I almost cried when she scratched the cat in a bloody pulp. Always, As creepy and disaster like the baby I was rooting for her to live. And as twisted as the movie I was very intrigued to see the end ..... ......... ....... ......... ......... ....... ...... .. ...
