I do not understand the positive comments made on this movie. It is cheap and embarrassing on every level and I can not understand how it has ever been. <br /> <br /> Cartoon characters are very - bad in-mouth Sue, alcohol, layabout, Irish dad is an example first. None of the characters will be sympathetic - except for a while, for Asian soccer companion but even then turns out to be able to domestic violence! As desperately unattractive as they both are, I have no idea why either Rita and / or Sue would throw themselves into a ramp to consumers like Bob - but given that they did, why should I expect to take care of what than they? So many reviews keep tight about how "realistic" it is. If it's true, it's a sad reflection on society but there is no reason to put it on the movie. <br /> I did not like the movie at all.
