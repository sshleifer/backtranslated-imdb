I rent this movie yesterday mainly due to the good-looking art and summary provided on the back of the jacket. After popping it into my DVD player, I re-examined the jacket cover and even though I took the cover from the plastic viewer, I still could not read any of the detailed production information on the movie. This movie has gotten wrong on the jacket and found it not going to film their website movie to find out any links to it here on IMDb. The movie and special affect the movie make good look ... then a line-reading actor spoke. Oh i love ... reading this actor sounded like some high school jock who have managed to manage just managed to change pitch, and no attempt to give way beyond reading the line from the script. At first I thought I got a bad disc from five audio, then had to overlook it was a foreign movie since I could not read the jacket ... armed dialogue armed. If they were to throw the right person to lobby the dialogue, this movie would have been decent. I gave it a chance of about 20 minutes before ejecting it when I discovered the reader line readers were not going to get killed off, but staying as the mainstream device. Yes, it is wrong! Jacket covers the art and the art make of the movie are great, so gave the star one but less 1,999,999 stars for the rotten dialogue. I do not recommend this one!
