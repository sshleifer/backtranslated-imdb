I saw this movie two weeks ago at the "New York Film Festival" in Paris. Though I did not wait a lot from it, I said I was ashamed as many people in the audience ... if I wanted to sum up how I felt, I would say I compared it to Princess Mononoke and nausicaa from the beginning to the end. Of course it's funny. But I could not help her. Their stories are quite different, but the worlds photos are very similar. And from this point of view, "a tree of palm" definitely can not stand the comparison with the master Miyazaki. Though it's quite technically, boredom remains ... at the end of her complete lack of originality make me advise you do not care to watch it. I rated it 2 out of 10 (a little harsh, I guess it deserves 3 or 4)
