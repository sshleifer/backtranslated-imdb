'Succubus', the edited version of 'Necronomicon Geträumte Sünden', is a struggle to sit down, even in a lean 76 minutes; any more of this boring terrible breeze and horror euro horror and I can slip into a coma. <br /> <br /> Jess Franco once again delivers a really awful piece of garbage 60s that appear to have been made by a cast and crew from the heads on class A hallucinogenics, since not one second in this mess made any sense too. Apparently, this is one of the best in his 180+ film ?? It's hard to believe that there are worst efforts outside. The plot convinced unfathomable and Franco's normal theme of sex, violence and madness and launched a bit of S & M for good measure, and yet it still managed to stay numbingly tiring. <br /> I can leave it quite a while before entering the world of Sponge Euro Horror anymore ?? Life is too short to be watching Bilge like this.
