You must agree with the other review. This has to be the worst movie, let alone west I've ever seen. Terrible acting, dialogue that was inimaginative and pathetic (leaving alone completely appropriate for supposedly in the 1800s), and oh, have I mentioned a battery pack evidently displayed on the back of one of the characters? I was waiting for the mike boom to fall in the middle of a scene. And the finish? The youngest I can say is that he was consistent with the rest of the film ... completely terrible. And yes, it included each cliche in the book from the market slowed down the empty road to the ridiculous dust "let's remember when" shots when a main character died. Luckily I've seen it on free TV. Do not waste your time.
