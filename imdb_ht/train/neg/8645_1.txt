I just came back from this free screening, and this "Osama Witch Project" is the worst hand-down movie I've seen this year, worse than the same "Catwoman" - who had acted at least himself as fiction. <br /> In "September Band," a "film crew" at top of "topical documentary journalist" in Afghanistan - despite being well prepared for the trip, the conditions and, oh yeah, the psychotic and ridiculous vendetta of their leader filmmaker to avenge his wife's death on September 11 - dig down Osama bin Laden. <br /> They "made" eight tape on their journey, which now "documents" their travels and, of course, they try to kill the terrorist leader. (The eight tapes, fortunately, all the end points in the narrative, which is convenient for a "documentary.") <br /> <br /> The psycho, idiotic protagonist - who gives long, important speeches that he Probably learning to watch "MacGyver" - nothing for his own life or the life of his innocent team as it gets beyond and more in danger of a completely mute series. I do not know why he did not just put a sign on his back saying "Shoot me." The team's translator, supposedly sensitive to voice-of-reason, does little more than hollow and gets baffled as the hero of fools leads them to bankruptcy. You wanted to bring someone on their trip to call them all dead. <br /> <br /> Around "Type 4," I started rooting the terrorists to shoot the movie crew.
