This is the first movie in the Horrorfest I watched and after Im almost think I do not need to see any of the others. I told him a "Thin Movie Thinking" and should say if this was supposed to make me think I was flying thinking that the splatter / Gore films in the collection would be like. Do not get me wrong by the same throat in this movie is worth sitting in. The draw is very washed out with too much artistic art for art. The effects of the cameras and music come from most of the time and the banal characters say at least. Several characters and performances seem worthless to the end when they begin to reveal some of the hooks of the "Hamiltons". I figured that Lenny was about half an hour when I calculated the movie. I was so visually under whelmed and confused by Lenny to reveal that I completely felt torn off. I hope that I got, but they could go more, in fact, all the gorley fell completely flat. With movies out there like "Auberge" and "seeing" you need to come a little better for a movie that "is considered in graphic or too disturbing for general hearing".
