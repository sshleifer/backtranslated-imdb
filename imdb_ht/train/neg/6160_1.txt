I would not say this is a * bad * movie. Unfortunately for me, I get the feeling that more you know about fence, the worse it gets simply due to the fact that it gets totally unrealistic. I've been fence since I was 14 years old, and this movie shows it is very wrong. F. Murray Abraham is good (and seems to have some background fences), but most of the other actors - especially students - just seem to lose.
