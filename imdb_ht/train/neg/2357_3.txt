Let's hope this is the final nightmare. This is the epitome of good going bad. Well, there are always some fun to be, but only in the most mundane sense. Rachel Talalay was there for the duration of this franchise, on staffing in production and even producing. I do not know what he thought, but this debacle comes complete with the human game boy and an appearance invited by <br /> Tom and Roseanne Arnold! I wish I had a sign that he thought when he wrote / directed this irritating piece of garbage. He even tried to distract his audience in the fact that this film was nothing more than a popcorn movie shaking praise instead of bringing any resemblance to horror, and the use of comparable to a 3D end. Are not these nifty eyeglasses? And you get to keep them up! It's equivalent, you just spent $ 9.00 making me wealthy. Here's 10 cents. Now you do not feel special! Sorry, but for me, it just did not make me feel special. <br /> <br /> And the Freddy had another face-up. This one was for the worst, I think. All the beautiful art that enters "watch" it in the earliest films that have been replaced by an obviously cheaper, less detailed prosthetic series. It seems ... less like the victim victim is supposed to be, and more like it has a skin disease. Changing the makeup lead as far away from a series is on the same level as changing the lead actor. But wait! They did, and did so. So I guess it does not matter. But it is important for me. Freddy is not yet. It's just ... another lean monster like the Leprechaun. <br /> <br /> Read more ... a black comedy than the classic horror series this promise; Riddled with that you can only hope that the writers thought they were witty one-materio and cleverly clever (Unfortunately, it fell short of both accounts). <br /> So there's nothing more to say than grab the popcorn and get ready to laugh, because there was not one awesome moment or thriller in this whole movie. <br /> It's a 3.2 / 10 from ... <br /> <br /> The Fiend:.
