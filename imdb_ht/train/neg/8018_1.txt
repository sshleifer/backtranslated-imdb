Wow, I hated this movie. The subject should cause a really fine film, and the lead actor was definitely sensitive and talented enough to handle the subject, but the script - if there was even * was * a script - is a mess. This is less a movie than a random slip show that goes nowhere. I would say it goes anywhere soon, except that it's actually the longest 81 minute you'll ever sit in. As I mentioned, the lead actor is good. So, is Faruza Baulk (SP?), As her mom sometimes-hard-but-finally-like-and-accept. The movie makers have a lot to answer for here, because this is a mess. A real shame, because I really wanted to love this movie, but it's basically out-taken out of a movie that has never been made. Skip this one - it did not even value $ 6 i shipping to pay for each period.
