One of the worst movies I've seen cameras work, filter wireless films, movie grenades, script was awful, I mean come on, how predictable was the big fight at the end ..... <br /> < Some of the battle scenes were okay I guess ... <br /> <br /> some scenes were so bad it was funny ... like sorbo getting the horse and up the end ... LOL i mean really .. horse? Oh cant forget how the bad assassins roll around in the same car throughout the movie .. people would think that after killing key witnesses with federal agents, they would have been tracking down..ETC, ETC really does not bother look at it ...
