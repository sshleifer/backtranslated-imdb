I usually love lesbian movies even when they are not very good. I'm partial, I guess! <br /> But this one is just the holes. Yes, the landscape and the buildings are beautiful, and there is a short but beautiful erotic interlude, but otherwise this movie is just a complete waste of time. Annamarie alternates between sulking and getting high / stones / passing on any drugs or bottles is handy, and Ella inexplicably puts up with this abominable behavior in the entire movie. There is no time we give any insight into why this is so, or even why Annamarie is so depressed and removed. <br /> <br /> If there were at least some types of closure (potentially romantic? do not even know!) the relationship between the two might have some kind of satisfaction. But although Annamarie at a point asked Ella "why do you love me?" Ella does not even recognize that. It's never really clear if this is nothing more than a (ill-behaved) lesbian on a boring road journey with a straight woman .. Even the interactions between the two women and the local people are met on the trip, which could lively and informative, rather flat, tedious and mostly incomprehensible. There is only one good joke in the movie, although I'm sure he was unintentionally. Women travel to a two-seat coupe Ford with a size sized trunk. But when they camp, they have a big tent, bed, sleep gears, and even a table, chairs, and typewriter! On top of that, by climbing a ferry, we see piles of luggage, presumably theirs, presumably also brought in the Ford trumpet! <br /> And in the entire movie, we've never seen one gas station, or anywhere else it would actually have anywhere to buy gasoline. Mostly travel to the endless miles of wilderness desert. So, where to find fuel? <br /> There may be too many lesbian movies out there, good or bad, but there are so much better than this, and many are worse. Leave this one in the shelf.
