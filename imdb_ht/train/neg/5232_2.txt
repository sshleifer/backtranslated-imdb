Becky Harris plays the female buyer who has misfortune it is to be in the store at the wrong time and obviously the only goal to be in this movie is to give a reason to set out remote control! Miss Harris looks like me to be in his or her age or older when it comes first to the scene. Once the red haired thug does with it it becomes apparent that this is not AARP queen. If these are not some of the finest assets ever to appear on seluloid, I want someone to indicate to me. Absolutely enchanting in my opinion and I literally put out my VHS copy to capture her charms. I would like to know if this movie is available on DVD. <br /> The rest of this movie really is not worth mentioning. I was hoping to see something convincing and intelligent, but I was ashamed of both counts. God bless Becky Harris!
