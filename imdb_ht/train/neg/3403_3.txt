This movie should be fun. A young Lea Thompson, a young Joaquin Phoenix ... and Terry O'Quinn. In space. But it was dragged on, there were enormous characters and there was no target audience. <br /> <br /> Some children go to a space camp and they are accidentally launched in space by a friend robot in theirs (named, accordingly, Jinx). The space scene is then long, repetitive (the same accident happens twice) and either cheese or scent depends on your viewpoint. Adults will be bored and cheesed out, children may be scared as the way this movie has really left a strange sense of it. <br /> <br /> There is a budding romance, but unlike the craft - this is never taken off. Why it is included in the first place is clear, except perhaps adding more tension between the characters - but it fails if that's the idea. <br /> A young Lea Thompson should be original and attractive, right? I mean, "Back in the future" is great. But no, it was disappointing and average-looking. Not someone you want to date, there as a friend or even considered a role model. Joaquin Phoenix? He is really lucky he has ever appeared in the movie yet. Perhaps it can act like Mikey in the life cereal advertisers, but it does not seem to know how to be a normal boy. It does not fit in on screen and I do not think we can identify with him at home. I'm actually happier if he never returned to the world. <br /> I do not recommend this movie to anyone.
