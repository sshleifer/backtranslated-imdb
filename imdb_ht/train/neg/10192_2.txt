One of the lamers wedding laptops you will see. Smacks too much in his time period so it came from the date before he hit theaters. The ethnic stereotypes are like a joke Henny Youngman, except they are just aint of little bit funny here. Molly Ringwald, well what else needs to be said. Give you a sign of the silliness and destroy a wedding dress $ 10,000, because "It just will not be me" to make it to this shabby, and spaghetti and put on a head hat, and everyone smokes cutely in moxy it , rather than Ringwalding his neck. It's a helluva a cast too, check out how heavy Ally Sheedy is. Wheeeew!
