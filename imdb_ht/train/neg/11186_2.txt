I wanted to watch this movie, but it's a ridiculous scene after another forcing me to close it. Character does not seem to react to anything. Consider this: Heath Ledger is walking one night (through a cemetery I believe) when he was attacked by evil spirits, which he drives away. Once past this problem she calmly walked away and met up with a friend who saw it all. When asked what happened, he said he was "attacked by evil spirits, nothing serious." As if this is only a little more interesting than a flat tire. <br /> I closed it when they went to ask something-a demon or something, I stopped taking care of an ion cation. The answer can only be rented out of a person with energy in their deaths, and the priest looks at what looks like anxiety as a man is shaded up and hanging and ask him thrashing, dead question questions .. <br /> <0 from star ****.
