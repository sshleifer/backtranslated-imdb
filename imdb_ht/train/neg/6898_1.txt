Avoid this crap at all costs. Bad script, bad direct, bad act, bad correction, bad sounds, and bad music. Get the idea? This movie tries to be western flavored, it's not. It tries to be tough kernel core, it's not. She tries to present a cool look to an old genre, she does not. The actors try to have better, and my heart goes out of them. But with these horrible materials to work and it's hard to do something bright. For me this all looks like a "new outta movie school will put the world on fire" first attempt. Freshmen film makers often bite off more than their budgets, may be milled. The best thing to do is to take a few steps back, review what's possible, and work in limited budgets the next time out.
