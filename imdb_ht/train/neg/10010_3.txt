Drawn is not worth discussions even though it's the suggestion of corruption, murder, power and the rest of related topics. Characters are interesting if sometimes. Not real but interesting anyway. <br /> Development is slow like drinking tea ceremony. Visual is not stunning but good enough to ease the strain. Good movie to look after dinner before going to bed - nothing is too shocking, nothing overexciting. Movie sitcom movie. <br /> I love Woody - excellent performance. Had to fight the plot inability and do the job very well. The rest is irreplaceable though very predictable. The whole is looking and better than most TV shows.
