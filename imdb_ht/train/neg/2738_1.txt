Garbage / bad movies are usually not bad because I'll get them enjoyable. This one is so bad that I out of the word describes it - it's below the "bad". There is an instruction from the beginning of the movie that tells you what to do during the movie. Needless to say, the instruction and a dozen of beer could not help me seat in the entire movie. A tagliner compares this one to KILLBILL which is certainly a woe and an insult to our intelligent. Obviously. This tagliner has a plan to tempt you to buy this DVD. <br /> <br /> If you are considering renting this one, put it down! If you are thinking of buying, do not think! If you are unlucky to have this DVD, do not play it, thrown it into waste bin immediately.
