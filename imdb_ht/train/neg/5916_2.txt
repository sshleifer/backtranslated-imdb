Rapidly slow down in this film was probably the intention of expressing the director, in order to convey that life was as growing as a young village in China. However, I found the combination of the 'frosty' glacial relaxation and the general movie style so hired as to be totally alienated, particularly at a western audience. Sometimes I actually had problems telling some characters apart from being filmed from such a distance. Two hours and I was totally past caring. As a person who is not only interested in music but also is very in the history and culture of China (and is by the way there are no strangers in Chinese movies), I could not engage with a single character and it was get nothing to get my teeth in. He begs the question: If I do not like it, who would love it? Give me Zhang Yimou, give me Chen Kaige. Give me the job just about any other Chinese director I've ever seen. This regret effort just does not measure up at all. I should be sorry to see movie cinemas judged against this referral.
