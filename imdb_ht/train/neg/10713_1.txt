Come, let's get real. The Knights of Christ, Ordo Templi, or Templar of Knights as they most often call did not even exist until the early 12th century. The story is so ridiculous that it's pathetic. Dolph Lundgren just looked positively bored. And besides, if you wanted to have a real-life life, why not just use the Knights of Christ, which is still in existence in Portugal. At least they should take into account stories. The only kind of rashem I could get in this movie was that the affairs looked authentic enough to pass for medieval periods or gothic. The act was bad, the appalling scenario, the terrible action, and the accessory was okay.
