'Blue Desert' may have the potential to be even a half way possible and most enjoyable thriller having the main character, Lisa Roberts (Courtney Cox) was not so stupid. When he is victims of another attack on the streets of New York, the comic book artist Roberts moves to a small town from West. In his first days, he meets Rick Rapid Atkins's fault (Craig Sheffer, playing this part well) that will eventually do not leave beside him. Fearing for his safety after being in the situation already two times before, he hit up a friendship with the city's copious suspicion amicable, Steve Smith (DB Sweeny, who's character does not seem convincing enough, leaving disbelief among viewers who would otherwise be convinced of red hair will be thrown by the writers). Smith needed Roberts cooperation because, as he said, Atkins is a former constable and guilty of sexual assault. But the cops lacked evidence to put it before. <br /> <br /> The film had enough ploy at least to make an interesting movie because soon enough, there is confusion as Roberts should trust. However, many of the suspension intends to be too forceful because Roberts characters never seem to react to simple things as we think anyone can reasonably be. And its delay response allows much of that suspense to happen easily and unconvincingly, particularly in the final. Maybe Sweeny was the wrong choice for this role; Too many babies have been faced with the way Kevin Anderson's reminder of the character's character is evident from his character to 'sleep with the enemy.' Or, if Lisa Roberts was written as a stronger character, that would be enough as well. In the meantime, the film is not all that great, as a budget B-Gossard budget.
