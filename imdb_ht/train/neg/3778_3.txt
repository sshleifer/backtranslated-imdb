Descent animations and some maintenance character development keep this anime-inspired horse from DreamWorks at least watchable ... however it remains a bit slower rhythm and the storyline is a bit on the comic side .. It's interesting to see a Cowboy Cowboy are typical and indian roles, but here it just seems like a nod to political correctness rather than a proper storyline decision. GRADE: C
