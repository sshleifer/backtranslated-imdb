Primal species from B movie legend Roger Corman and as all those watching this need to realize that this is a Low Budget film and knows it. <br /> A bunch of great terrorist terrorist a Jack and killing an entire army doing this, believing that it hold uranium, but no ..... It has two dinosaurs and a taste for human humanity. Then a crack team, which might as well be called Delta Force to get the Occasional Call, this is not Jurassic Park, and Yes the Dino is never seen clearly because it's obviously a guy in a costume that is not too dissimilar at The dinosaur barney - only slightly less harm, but coming to this gentleman had about 1% of the Jurassic Park budget and as it did what he could. <br /> <br /> Is this worthy to be at 100 below? .... HELL NO !!! I think almost half of the voters that give this a 1 - were way to harshly harsh, it's much closer to a 4 ... it's actually a lot better than a whole host of other films by the bottom 100 , and has the same output value in a Sci-Fi Production Channel. (again movies that find a very difficult time of criticism here on IMDb) <br /> The act is expected as in a movie B although none of the actors take it seriously or does the script <br /> <br /> All in all it's an enjoyable movie B - Not for movie movie <br /> <br /> ** from *****
