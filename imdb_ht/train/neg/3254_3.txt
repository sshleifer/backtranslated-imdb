Cynthia Rothrock, (China O'Brien), "Manhattan Chase", 2000, made this film enjoyable to watch and of course, and this lovely petite gal is burning up the screen with its artistic and warm sexy body. China O'Brien gets angry as a police officer and decides to call her to leave and back to her place and get back to her roots and her father, who is the local sheriff. His father gets older and the city changes, the gangsters took over the city and began to find the local women to start turning tricks and people in the city became sick and tired of their city to go to hell. Well, you can almost guess what's happening, and you're right, China O'Brien fights back after great tragedy strikes his life. Bad acting out of the picture, but Cynthia Rothrock brings this movie to a wonderful conclusion.
