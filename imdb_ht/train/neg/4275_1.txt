I can not understand why many people praise this show. Twin Peak is one of the most boring titles I have ever seen in my life. Now I've seen all episodes of season 1, and see episode 2 episode 1. Simply I can not take this show again 1) Where is the appropriate induction of criminal investigation? <br /> In season 1, there was a scene that Silver Cooper throws rocks into a bottle. Can you guess why she did that? It just wants to identify bandits by making this 'joke' while mentioning supernatural abilities given in Dream Tube. Wow !!! <br /> 2) There are too many scenes needed in this show. <br /> <br /> For example, season 2 started with a 'funny' scene that an old old man serves as Cooper Silver with a cup of milk while Cooper is lying down on the floor. (He had the gun shoots in his abdomen already.) This old man does anything but says some mute comments. That's all. <br /> This scene is really boring and even long (3 min 30 sec ... It's like hell.) <br /> I would read some funny books rather than see this show again.
