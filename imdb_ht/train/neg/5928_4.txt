I just do not find some of the great sites in this episode - that Miranda is so remarkable, and that there's nothing to ugly it would make you crazy. Someone here made the remark that perhaps it's the frequency of the light waves or something rather than being intricate. Miranda is just a jerk. The episode is slow, consistent with too talky way. I also do not understand why Colos is an ambassador - why not the Federation just leave the damned Medusans? There's a party I like, when Kolos is talking to Spock about loneliness in the human experience. In general, I love TOS and even in its lamest, I'll still tune in this episode though - mmm, I would not buy it except for a copy used under $ 3.
