OK now, lets see. What was funny in the first movie? I know, people with funny accents, those who fall into the water, funny boat crashes and funny comments between the two teams. In this film they twisted the axis part of the max, no good. A whole lot of people are falling into the water for uncertain reasons, not good. Boatcrash, check. Funny comments between the teams, they tried but failed. Also, there are too many personality traits in this movie. This movie should be about what is happening on the water, not on the ground. I'm sorry to say that there are so far between comic parties and sponsors of the film to exploit the max. Not good. All in all, I give him four out of ten since he has some funny parts.
