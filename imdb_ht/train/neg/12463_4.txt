OK Hollywood is not liberal. Obviously I'm lying because it is. Im a conservative but political I will leave out of my opinion in the movie. This film was anti-bush, anti-eastern, anti-propagandine oil great but that's not why it was bad. <br /> <br /> My cutie fist will give credit where credit is due. I saw this film opening night because I came to love these kinds of films and I'm a great political science in collage. The cinematography was excellent and the actor was as far away as I could say very well. The draw was impossible to decode however. I have tested and have an IQ in 138 but no matter how hard I tried there was no way I could piece along the story line in the movie and what character to do that. <br /> The story and scene sequences were totally incoherent and wrong organized. Unless this is one of those movies that means to look many times to find the full PT PT story, which it very well can, I have no idea exactly what is going on. <br /> <br /> That makes sense because if you want to make a political argument and not get any criticism then make your argument impossible to criticize! If you cant dazzle and shine, then attach them to the bull S.
