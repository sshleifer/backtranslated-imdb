As a kid I thought the weapon the murderer used was cool, however I was a kid and so I was a bit dumb. Just as a mute kid if the cinema scheme was stupid and a bit boring when the killer did not use his light knife to kill. What amazes I is that the movie has a really solid cast in it. What script were it when they agreed to be in this movie as it most assured boring and only a means to show off a light saber on a very small scale. The scheme of times is incomprehensible and the end is totally chaotic. The whole movie seems to revolve around aliens with the one gun. The plot has two children and some dudes have an alien encounter, flash years later and there seems to be a return as it was in the mix. Dead animals and what to explore and for some reason a dude becomes the foreign weapon and the money they use to go to a killing many celebrity spree. Seriously, you just need to ask why this movie was done, if you are going to have a killer to have some good death scenes, if you are going to alien encounters show more than one thing strange light fervor, and if you are going to be there Light sabers then call yourself star wars.
