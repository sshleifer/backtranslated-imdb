My 10-year-old daughter, Alexandra, writes: I thought she was very boring, and I thought she was just a repeat of things from "101 Dalmatians." I could not wait for the movie to finish. The best part was credit at the beginning - they were beautiful and well done. The rest of the movie is not worth watching. Thanks.
