It's rare that I feel a need to write a review on this site, but this movie is very worthy because of how bad it was created, and how its product bias was. <br /> I felt a different attempt on part of the movie-makers to show the Palestinian family as clogged and untrustworthy. We heard them discuss their sadness that they felt asthma, but the film was shot and arranged in such a way that we felt the political oppressive population is the Jewish population of Israel. We do not see any evidence that shows Palestinian teenager's parallel position. We hear only two other Palestinians in prison. I understand the restrictions in place, but the political nature of the restrictions are designed to prevent peace. <br /> I came from the film feeling that the mother of the victim was selfish in her mourning and completely blinded mind due to her side of the fence, so to speak. He continues to want to see the misfortune of the Bomber's parents, with angry words and closing him to cause the final spiral meeting out of control. It is more realistic, in my opinion, to see the Israeli idea to be a root of the problem; ignore complaints and freedoms complaints, ignore requests for recognition for the process where the Jewish population has acquired the country. <br /> I gave this two because of the selfish selfishness of the mother, which normally would be admirable in a documentary, however in the light of the lack of impartiality, it all looks like exploitation. Also for poor modifications, lack of background in the current example, and finally the lack of proper representation of the Palestinian side. Finally, it is a poor documentary and a poor movie. I understand this is partially the result of the political situation, but I have to recall the flaws in regard to whatever heart-wrenching and sad subjects.
