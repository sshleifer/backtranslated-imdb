Cheap and mind-blisteringly math stories and acting. Not only one good line, not even a bad line enough to be good, and no memorable delivery. Even the blooper coil included with the DVD showed how inept the actors were and how little fun any of them had. The esoteric and occult foundation was indifferent to the universe, and the antagonists failed to greepy or credible. Homerotic 'obstinate' were useless to tame and dissatisfying, and they were limited to young boys caressing their chests while flaccid in the boxers. I'm not gay enough to appreciate it, but a little action can have at least keep me and my girlfriend awake.
