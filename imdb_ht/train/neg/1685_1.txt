All children aged 14-16 want to see this movie (although you are only allowed at 18). They've heard it is a very scary movie and feel so cool when they look at it. I feel very sad kids can not see what a good movie is, and what a bad movie is. This was one of the worst movies I've seen in months. Each scene you see in this film is a copy of another movie. And the end? It's an open end ... why? Because it is impossible to come up with a decent highway for such a stupid story. This movie is just made frightening, and if you're a bit smart and know some about music, you just know when you're scared. <br /> <br /> When the movie was over and I turned to my friends and said (a bit loudly) her that this was a total waste of money, some stupid kid watch strange to me. These days I could make an Oscar and a home-video of my red fish, if only I used the right marketing.
