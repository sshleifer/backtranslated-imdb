It's not the slasher movie is best done ever, but for what it is, it's very fun. The plot is lame but is not too bad. I have to be honest, if you do not follow the bandwidths of this movie, you do not get this funny movie like people do. I knew someone who saw this film and was really disappointed because of the poor quality of the movie, but you have to understand that he did in time of spending on being on travel, in between the moshing play kids and drinks' with friends backstage. .. it was not done to be taken seriously. It's ubber cheese at its best punk and with over 100 kills, many of them are ultra gory, it's a fun movie to have friends over to watch, drink and be happy!
