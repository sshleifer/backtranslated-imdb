Hobgoblins ... what a concept. Rick Sloan was a master and this movie. She had the shine to produce a movie with actors who could not act. On top of that, he chose to write a script based on some sort of bad acid journey going badly. Put it together, you end up with a film that sucks more than a full warehouse with suction cups and vaccine cleaning products. This movie was very painful. The pain it caused is equal to the pain caused by your genitals carved out with a spoon, and then the whole wound has to be covered with salt and hydrochloric acid.
