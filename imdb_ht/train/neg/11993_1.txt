After seeing only half of the movie school back in November, today, I saw it on Flix Channel and decided to look it to see the rest of it and write a new review about it. <br /> <br /> <br /> The book that the movie based, Hatchet, is OK. This is a terrible adaptation of it though. <br /> <br /> Awesome (and I mean terrible) acting, bad dialogue, and average cinematography make up this terrible adaptation of Hatchet. starting at Brian who is the cliche image of a late 80s (sporting a mullet, hitting herself in cheap 80s rock music) and her mother drives in a car for him to get on a flying plane up to view alien father her parents divorced ... now chewed a dramatic pause.) Now Brian said goodbye to the mother and dog and she jumped up to see her dad. The pilot is a fat, ugly, rude man (not like that in the book) that after 2 minutes in the air, there is a heart attack and death. In the book he goes to more detail with the most painful pilot and it seems that being in the air much longer before the pilot had his heart attack. The plane (in another two minutes) went blank on gas (leaving us, viewers, assume that it had been up for hours even though the sun had not changed positions and the landscape seemed exactly the same.) Now, in it has landed. <br /> This is the point in the movie where everything is a lot different then it was in the book. In the book he said jackets had torn tornadoes, but in the film it is perfectly fine with no tears or tears (seems to just buy it), he never said he was riding a hill, seeing a wolf, he fell on the mountain, never say he was attacked by a bear (he said a moose, but not a bear), he never said he ate many animals that he did , he never mentioned the second whirlpool or learned to find these little birds, their skin, and their foods or that little fish trap that he did (which was destroyed by one of the tornadoes), nor did he mention it 'injuring her ribs in one of the tornadoes. Do not even think you can call what was shown in the movie in a tornado. All it was just a storm that hit several of its stuff. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < (and everything he packs that can all perfectly fit into just back to his truck) leave and cry "DAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADDDDDDDDD !!!!" (again of course his father did not hear him though he was just right out) and his point punch in the window (wtf?) The finish is the only thing that is close to what happened in the book (I said close.) In the book I think one of the key things that the rescue pilot told Brian when he landed was "you're the kid who was looking for! They've stopped months ago. .. "again left this line from the movie. There's a paticular epicenter and Brian (somehow without advice or therapy) getting back to normal with his family. I think we were supposed to assume that they were getting together for Thanksgiving (because they had a turkey on the counter.) Then he showed his temporary home (for what, in the movie, seemed like three day, but in the book was for several months) and shaved it, still in a tree where he left it (also did not reach the book) showing where he wrote a message, so perfectly done: HOME "(where do you really believe that it carries it perfectly and just that hatch?) <br /> No quote can sump this movie up then then Enid from World Heritage said" This is so bad it happened past good and back in bad again. " Perfect description of this movie. <br /> I would not recommend it to someone (who does not read the book) and just looking at a movie or I would read someone who read the book (because they will be disappointed and bored to death .. For those who have read the book, let this imagination you created as the movie.This is awful and will bring down your thoughts on the book. <br /> 1/10
