Everything about this movie is pork wash. Pitiful act, pampering dialogue, authentic little girl. this sink movie in hubby !!!!!!!!!!!!!!! The principal must be a weekend Bender. Robert C. is totally lost and has no sign of what's happening. Children in colleges are worst. No talent acts at all, very stupid reasoning, and just down right dumbbells. Special effects are for the birds. These security forces call this park that belongs to the game: with stupid looking gun, talkie walkie that is useless; with a computer system that is arranged with a toilet paper roll. if the park is under construction and nothing works; why bother inviting potential customers until everything is complete. The writers should be the first victims of the mess with the producers and the crew. The whole movie belongs to a septic tank shot to another planet to watch. What a gem. Convincing should be looked at so that they can commit suicide.
