*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** Continue ... <br /> From here to collapse the movie all over itself. First we encounter a naughty program and the clue we will get ghosts and vampires and werewolves with the love. We found a guy with an end to the endless talk of garbage, of 'ghost' that serves no real objectives and has no-like-all-time character and a bunch of henchmen. Someone told me vampires (straight from blade 2), but they're so indefinitely I did not realize. <br /> <br /> The funny accent guy with a ridiculous name suffers the same problem as the Oracle, only for far longer and far worse. He has a simple point on the cause and effect, doing it, then continuing to do it and do it until it gets entangled and stupid. It's the final line before the market is comparable to the storm "Do you know what's going on in a frog ..." line of X-men at the level of baddness afar pronounced. The chocolate cake is like a lazy, pathetic clich√© and Monica Bellucci as the wife does nothing other than exactly what we expect the moment we see her. <br /> Then we get another fight kung fu !!! WHY? Neo is, allegedly, the One. It can do nothing. It has the ultimate power and what it uses it for. Kung hundred fu all the time. And while it can stop 1000 bullets, it always gets off by a sword and still makes a meal of 5 innocent henchmen (vampires?). I wanted to see power blowing yourself. I wanted to see him warm, digging the furious s *** in person because he can do anything. I got the same as before without the 'wow'. <br /> <br /> Car in chase machine. That can not be bad. Well ... no, it's not. That's just not what we've been tyold he's going to do. ALL the cool shots at this stage are in the trailer. Every person. So, all possibly Wow took from us so that all we now find is a good sequel to chase with, guess what, a fight kung fu !!! OK, it's not neo, but you'd have thought he would have explained his close friend on the reality of the Matrix. At least teach them something. It is not difficult. <br /> <br /> "Hey, Morpheus, do not worry about what's going on in your womb." It's not real. All your time to understand that nothing is real then nothing can really hurt you. "<br /> <br /> OK, so the chase is not bad .. It's never boring and it does not seem like 16 minutes, it's just so underwhelming. And still, It's getting worse <br /> <br /> The final point in the movie is probably the worst imaginable. They have this elaborate plan involving three teams and then only show it sporadically ant The Morpheus is so long, super preachy, monologue. To make it worse, they are never clearly defined what this plan needs 3 outfits. You know basically, but you do not know who is doing that, when so when a crew goes down you just do not care and you do not know how this will affect what goes. /> I'll sum it up though, it happens so trinity can get back to the end of the matrix. which makes them only happen .What raises the question, why they need to send 6 original people? Trinity will come in five minutes by itself! <br /> <br /> Neo is the trip to the center of the Matrix ( so to speak) read o also equally lazilyal. Ooohhh !!! He runs another 100 Smiths Agent! Woooooo !!! That must take a lot of thought. Only now are in a corridor for the fight no scale and is over at a time. Man, what a grand final !!! <br /> Then the Architect !!! <br /> <br /> Remember everything I said was bad about the Oracle and the foreign guy? Adding them to double it, that's how the expansive Architecture is. Only reasonable potential of him is he's about to set up climax in cliffaxing. <br /> Then it blows it! <br /> Let's look at the options it gives neo. Choose a door with all mankind dead (except 27 !!!). Choose the other and all mankind dead !!! When you consider choices is something this movie is trying to explore it does not really give her heroes. If he has a choice in saving humanity and the misery of dying or saving the missile and killing humanity there's potential torment inside and strains. Also, with the Trinity being collapsed, the potential of a real cliffhanger would have been to see the third more essential. But no. He has no-save or save the muscle. Now the worst thing about the original Matrix was neo dead and then returned to life right in the end. The year it came out everyone was so annoyed by how stupid Jar Jar they were not aware that at the very end of the Matrix made him look at him Steven Hawking. "The Oracle told me I would fall in love with the One, and I love you" .... Come on !!!! How can the whole world miss this terrible cause? <br /> So what does the Wachowski do in the end? Well, they make ends in the original look better. How? Well, do not do exactly exactly the same thing (only swapping characters) only much worse I think Fa and R keys should be torn out if I keep writing away before I got worse. The cliffhanger is just not really a cliffhanger. It's a reminder. <br /> <br /> Basically, this movie is just bad. I really did not want it to be bad, but it is. Bad in just many ways. And to make matters worse, this is not a movie that is not enough budget. It's not a movie and too short a schedule. It's not a movie that runs out. It's not a movie where there is much influence from the outside. This is exactly the film of the Wachowski set out to do with Warner's fortune completely behind them. And that's what makes this so awful. At least Rancid aluminum can say that it was not enough time or money. <br /> <br /> Matrix lodged. The worst movie ever made? Maybe not quite well. The most irritating film and scroll ever made. <br /> <br /> Undenably. <br /> <br />
