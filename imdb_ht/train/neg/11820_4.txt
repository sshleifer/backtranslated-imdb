I saw this on DVD (He `s known as the CORRUPT in this format) and the presentation on the box really hyped up how Harvey Keitel` character Frank is so much like the one he played BAD LIEUTENANT in" Thriller this frustrous and powerful police ". What the box did not mention was that this is an old Italian film. How old is it? Well when a play music player does not put on the CD player, he pulls a great plastic bundle stuff, putting it on a sort of revolving growth where a sort of mechanical arm touches the ear that causes the music to be heard. Do you see my point about being an old movie? The DVD case was not given any signs of this movie being made 20 years ago. It is also a film of poor production as many other Italian masquerade films as American people. With the exception of Keitel's cast is awful though Johnny Rotten`s performance is rare rather than terrible, the static symphony and the quality of photos and sounds give the impression that I've been watching a copy of the fourth generation of pirate (I would not know if it's down to a dodgy DVD or if it's very bad movie printing) and worst of all is Ennio Morricone's notes. It's impossible for those who made the impressionist incident for the CORRUPT incident the same thing that made music for Clint Eastwood in the west. <br /> All this is a pity because CORRUPT does this moment. It does not mean the biggest pike suspense ever invented but it made my interest and as always Keitel puts in a good performance as a violent violent cop. Just a pity the rest of the movie didn`t match up to his high standards
