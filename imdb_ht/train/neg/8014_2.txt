"Wild Tigers I've known." It will only be shown in big cities, to be sure. It is one of these films so artsy, that it makes no sense what forever, except the director! I say that! With all these oh-so-alternative / artsy people try DESPERATELY to find "metaphor" of what EVIDENT rider. <br /> <br /> There was no draw, no history, no moral, no chronology, and nothing fun or even touching. For me, it was a bunch of scenes thrown together that had nothing to do with each other, and all for "show" to show how "artsy" and "visual" might be found. It was an ATTEMPT of yet another film of angst, but missed the brand on every possible human level. Then the credits roll! I was waiting to get SENSE! I was waiting for the "good part." I own over 60 independent films in my DVD collection, many of which could arguably be called "art house" movie. This is NOT amongst them. You will be very upset by yourself to pay to see this film, much less to buy it on DVD.
