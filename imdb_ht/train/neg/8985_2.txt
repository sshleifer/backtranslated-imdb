Previous comments encouraged me to check this out when it showed up on TCM, but it was a serious disappointment. Loud Valdez is great, but does not get enough time screen. Frank Morgan and Eugene Palette play familiar but promising characters, but the sheet script is blocked. The movie revolves around the month of Lee Tracy's character, who is at best a self-centered, physically and verbally despicable jerk. The reactions of the "public" were thought-out and incredible, making the "shenanigans" seem like contrivances of a bad writer. And he tightened the credulity that the character Velez Lupe can fall for him. <br /> <br /> The "One-piece Spike" mentioned in another review must depend on the observer, since I did not even notice that an attempt was made.
