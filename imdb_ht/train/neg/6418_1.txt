Let me start by saying I'm not a fan of horror movies. I never looked at them. <br /> Let me tell you about my experience ... <br /> <br /> The only reason I watched this movie was because my girlfriend and her friends wanted to see her happy. <br /> <br /> ... I never saw Happy Master, but I'm sure it's better than that ... movie? Anyway, we did not actually expect it to be good ... we actually went to just laugh at it. Cool with me ... I have a problem with damaging the movie for others in the theater but since it's just another couple talking and making out, it did not matter. <br /> After 15 minutes 2 others let go sneak in Borat, a movie I'd be happy to see again. The film was not scared, and not stupid so it would be funny ... it was just boring. It was not terrible as "Baby Genuises" terrible, it was terrible like ... not fun at all. Avoid. <br /> Now I have no expert, but it seems the problem with the horror industry these days is that you can have a horror PG-13 that is boring and not scary, or you can have a movie R The supreme graphic is either too bloody or too disgusting to humans. <br /> You want a PG-13 horror that sucks but is funny? See "The Grudge." Avoid this movie as the epidemic ... because it can literally make you to death. <br /> <br /> 0/10
