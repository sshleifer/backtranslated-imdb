This film is one of the most wildly portrayed portraits in history. Or correctly, this film does nothing to honor hundreds of thousands of Dutch, British, Chinese, American and Japanese social workers who have killed and tortured the death of the Japanese. The bridge was to be built "on the bodies of the white man" as indicated by the Japanese engineer. It is disgusting that bitter horrors committed by Japanese fascists are the source of a film, where the bridge itself, is not even close to the actual bridge. The actual bridge was built of steel and concrete, not wood. What's the survivor still alive today? They hate the movie and everything it should represent. Friends were hungry, tortured, and murdered by cruel sadists. Those who did not die in Dysantry, hunger, or diseases are deeply hurt in the movie that makes these lights in the dark times.
