This was a nice attempt at something but it is too firefight and boring to climb higher than it's low budget. The use of virtual sets almost works, but at some point it fails miserably. They worked well with the budget I guess. I just want the story and most of the act was best. There are a lot of parts where you see what they are aiming for and would be great if they actually hit these brands, but they do not. Confusion and incredible story. Bad DVD transfers too. It does not take much to watch a movie in one sitting. This I was locked up. It was too boring. I can make cinema slowly. But just make them appeal in some aspects. Visually, wise stories, acts, etc. This was missing in all departments so it never added up to an engrossing experience. Maybe the next movie maker's attempt will be best.
