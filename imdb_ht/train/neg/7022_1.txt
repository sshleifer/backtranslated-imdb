In over 70 years of watching movies, this has to be one of the very worst comedy ever ever done. Mel Brooks, Mike Meyers & a few others did some pretty bad cats, this however is the sheer bottom of the barrel. <br /> <br /> It is unfunny from the very opening, to nail on stage during the Diane Keaton credit which I like usually had to have to pay much. She desperately needs to learn her craft. Dax Shepard (I do not know who she is), needs a better director, and show her how to act. Tyler's book is also not up to its role. Mike White needs to find another character, he has made that person the same kind of a few times too much. Ken Howard has started out years back as a first rate actor, also not as well as being used to be. <br /> There is nothing decent I can say about this attempt at film comedy. Rating: * (from 4) points 25 (out of 100) IMDb 1 (out of 10)
