When thinking of the revelation that the main character of "Bubble" comes to the end of film, I remember in recent years "Machinist" and Christian Bale. The differences between these films are literal physical physics of the characters. <br /> A painter, perfectly realistic reality in small town life. The title is the cause of contemplation. Perhaps, the audience is the ones in the "Bubble" as we give them no payoffs in the slim movie 90 minutes to run. Audience reactions have often suffered from trial, clearly indicating how detached people can come from seeing any strand of humanity in such foreign-sense characters. These characters are the ones that refer to as those who put George W. back to office for a second term. <br /> It's prudent to consider how reality TV has spoiled our sense of reality by watching a stalk hearing jump to the exit as soon as the role of credit. This movie has her fault, and she deserves consideration for things she does not say outright.
