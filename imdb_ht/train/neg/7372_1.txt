I'm so confused. I was a great fan of Seagal for 25 years. I've seen all his films, and many of these dozens of times. I can only describe this movie as "rare." Steven Seagal writes scriptplay scriptwriting and credit products on this movie, but I have a really hard time believing she would choose to dub on her own voice for many of her lines, and a thin voice, the nurse's voice is no less. What I do not get is, if they have to be dub some of his lines, why does his own voice appear on the rest of them? I hope Seagal is broad as the rest of us. But the Seagal of this film barely exaggerates a fraction of the same wrist, confidence, bravado, charm, and sex-appealing it so easily shows us in all of his previous movies. What I found to miss most of all was his cocky, self-assured attitude and bad-ass-his ass so easily scheduled to adorable grin. Where's your face-in-face attitude and charm that made her like a big star ??? I hope this movie is not an indication of what Seagal has left to offer us - if so, lifelong fans will have to concede that the Seagal we all knew and loved to go.
