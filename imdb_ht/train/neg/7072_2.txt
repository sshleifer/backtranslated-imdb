My title just about this pile sum of crap up I should have taken a hint when I saw it was a Fred Fred Ray movie - but I thought 'HEY, he could be better than his boyfriend RUBBISH', I was wrong! This has to be the worst movie ever aimed at children. The act was terrible, the humor was non-existent, the direction was the worst I've ever seen & the special effects would not seem out of place on the Disney movie in 1950. <br /> <br /> WHAT HAPPENED DEE-WALLACE ROCK! Who once was such a promising career in the 80's. Veteran's film & actors actor Russ Tamblyn was a terrible-guy guy & the budget was so low that it was a totally unbelievable just as a kiddie movie. <br /> I did not see the end made in 1999 and neither I intended for <br /> If you want a good movie movie Watch 'HONEY I SHRUNK / BLEW UP KIDS / KID' OR ANY OTHER FRIETE <br /> <br /> MY RATING A 19: Yo - 2/10 <br /> RATING as a KID movie: - 3/10 at the best!
