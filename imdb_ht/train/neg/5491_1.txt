We should have been suspicious to discover that with only two minutes of light from us are the only ones. Only five other people joined the film began. <br /> There is nothing at all to buy this movie. The act is terrible (especially Ms Hurley). The banal script. The effects we've seen one million times. The movie in the worst direction we saw. Flowing and disoriented. No-one street including children. <br /> <br /> We left after 25 minutes. It would be earlier if my wife did not go for a hot-dog !!!! <br /> Do not waste your money on this movie. If there is nothing else to look at your movies then buy some drinks, popcorn and hot-dog and make some people look. You will have a much more enjoyable time !!!! <br /> <br />
