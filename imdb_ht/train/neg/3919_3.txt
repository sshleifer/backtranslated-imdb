This movie is not all right. The actors are lowlevel and the story is very funny-like. I respect fantasy, but the Lord of the Rings is fantasy ... Conan..s fantasy ... This is only NORMAL HK-LOWPRICE-ENTERTAINMENT ... Why were this spotty-language language, doing everything worse. The only good thing is the cinematography and Job Knife.
