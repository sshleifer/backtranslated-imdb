This film is really something of a Curate's egg, good at party. Unlike other reviews, I found that the main fault and its inability to draw in the viewer's interest in the characters and the scheme. I sat in it because I'm interested in rock'n'roll and the dynamics of bands, but if I've been evaluating it purely on its merits as a movie, I should give it the thumbs down, with a caveat Some: Jason Behr is good at the party of John Livien, and is quite convinced as a rock singer; The narrative regarding her children's trauma is clear, although we are giving suggestions to the well-behaved relationship of Livien to her parents, but her behavior is ultimately rare to the viewer (which she should not). But the idea of ​​using a character persona to solve interesting interior conflicts, albeit by novel nor fully explored as a theme of this movie. John Lennon's allusions were disappointing, but I confessed to being a Beatles fan. At any speed, Livien and his band remind me more of the Oasis than the Beatles, in the sense that there was one derivative about them. Another frustrating film was the way it opened up with some interesting - albeit middlebrow and high school levels - philosophical musings of the lead character, but leaving the wires in his thinking, only to choose them again in the middle In the movie very briefly, when Livien said, "before God there was music" (never seen that ad for Tia Maria in the 1990s, "Before long was Tia Maria"? That's the idea in anyway); It seems a stupid conclusion, and the viewer has no idea how to get it, but it's right to read. Fortunately his bassist and friend played Ably by Dominic Monaghan, seem to recognize the illusion of this thought when he replied "You do not know that" .. In all, the forces are limited in the direction and the plot could go either ways on future projects, intervital intervals or an interesting and more mature perspective.
