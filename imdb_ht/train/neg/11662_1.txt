I do not often go out of my way to comment, but for this I was required, just to warn anyone who might think that by looking at this they will see a comedy. It does not come close. While the citing (change in color / gender / regardless) is bad enough (and he did, better, many times before) the actual transformation of two black guys into two white girls is one of the youngest transformational legs put on screen. It would be bad enough if all that was required in the script was a change in white chic. However the bravery brothers are required to disguise themselves as two specific white women. As you will have guessed by now, they fail completely. I saw Queens dragon without makeup make women more convincing than those two do with the best and special effects make-up people that Hollywood can provide. Its appalling. Added to the mix of a basketball player built like a building, horrible dialogues and holes more drawn than a golf course and this movie hit a new personal touch. And I love bad movies! Avoid such an epidemic.
