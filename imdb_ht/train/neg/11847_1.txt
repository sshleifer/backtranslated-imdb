I'm surprised at how bad this film is. As a pasty of the 20th century Hollywood artist has established a new bar - even past The Moderns or (gasp) Cradle Will Rock & I never thought I'd see a movie worse than those 2. Granted about being a Thousands a little different & period. But the intentions and results were distressed the same way. <br /> <br /> The first to have the terrible cast: Eddie Izzard as CHAPLIN? Excuse me? Peter, should you be this guy? Jennifer Tilly as Loulla Parsons ?? Kirsten Dunst as Marion Davies ??? Smoke Ghosts, these people do not even start trying to capture the look or sound of the specified period described. <br /> Well, Last Photo Show was a decent movie, but this is a disaster and the rest of the Pics Bogdonovitch was not the best. Guess rubs up against Welles & Hitch & Ford has been putting in a long time ago. Still good for TCM hosting though.
