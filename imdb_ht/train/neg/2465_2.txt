This would be a Hollywood substandard mountain if it had a good correction. It depends on the funny American comic scheme - "who will outsmart everyone". Acting is below the average, but with the shining appearance of the detective who is the best actor in the film and is especially responsible if the tension in the movie rises. The film has been fully suffocated by vid video and sound shots and most of it looks raw material materials. All in all, if you do not mind watching a movie that looks like a movie project student, this is a movie to watch. I guess that would be enough to say about this movie, everything else could really spoil the tension that is probably low enough.
