While I recently gave PETTICOAT surgery a positive review, I really did not like this movie though it had a lot of similarity. Both were made just a few years apart, both Cary Grant and both were WWII comedies. However, the overall tone and style of these films were quite different. KISS it for me, in general, just seemed like a cheaper movie - with poor writing, little energy and some very great performance - even when compared to Petticoat OPERATION. I think at least many of the blame for this lies in casting Jayne Mansfield. The combination of its talented enough with limited ability to act really made this movie One-Budget look like it came from a 3rd studio rate. Plus, there was not much chemistry or energy in his pairing with Cary Grant - an actor generally liked for his favor and class. It's sort of like Louise Lawrence and Marjorie Main.
