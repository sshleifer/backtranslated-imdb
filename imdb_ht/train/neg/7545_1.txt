It's unfortunate that you can not go anywhere than one star. Before watching the Wicker Man, I was considered as aliens 3 to be the only movie that would actually merit negative stars. In all the justice, the Wicker Food does not detect from the enjoyment of an earlier film, but the fact remains that my cumulative enjoyment has been reduced by not seeing it. <br /> There is a cheap trick all too often used in Hollywood when the producers are too nicer to hire good writers or toss in a hurry to allow them to bring a draw of a satisfactory conclusion: slap into a shocker finish and hope The public is mistaken for artistic or essence. It is a gambit that rarely succeeds and in this case managed only to prevent embarrassment about a fine and ridiculous actor on producers. Even more so in this "carefully fabricated" (or however to set it) conclusion did not seem to logically logically out of the draw (which naturally I can not elaborate on without introducing deflators), and rather negative that deserves The draw was up to this point. It's a movie that could be logically appealing to psychopaths, pedophiles, and possibly dead-hard Nicholas Cage fans, but only in a few of the mainstream audiences. If you really want something on these lines, I recommend recommending M. Night Shyamalan in the Village rather. Lacking some kind of memory-eradicated tablet, I suppose I need to look something better forcing it to my mind, say, attacks in the killer tomatoes or pee-wee's notice?
