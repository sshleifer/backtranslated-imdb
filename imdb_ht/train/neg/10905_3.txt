Guy is a loser. Can not find girls, need to build, was chosen by more successful success guy, etc. See it, see it, move on. I should say that Rob needs to move past Adam Sandler to a part of his life. And get out of the Adam Sandler cemeteries. There are two funny parts of the entire movie. I could not even finish the last 5 minutes. I got bored. The "Animal" is an audiovisual movie. I usually enjoy Adam Sandler film that has the same plot. But that was trying too hard to impress. The jokes are very old. So trust me. This is not a movie that most people could really get into. But some did, so I'm going to be nice. <br /> <br /> 3/10
