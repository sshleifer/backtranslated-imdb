Whew. What can be said about Gymkata not yet? This is nothing but omalery earlier in the beginning of the end. If you want a movie that will keep you on the street floor, this is the perfect movie to get. From the wild-style mullet / sweater cabin in Parmistan (and it's four billion lows), everything about this movie is crap of crap. Led by Robert Clouse, the infamous head which brought you the ice scroll of Bruce Lee's game of death, once again exhibited its complete lack of leadership skills. A few other facades you most likely will not recognize will appear for your enjoyment as well, from Buck Kartalian Tadashi Yamashita, although you will not remember them or take care of them after the movie is done. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> and go wrong. Instead, the book apparently is a figure of Gymkata's imagination. Probably something Clouse had made up in order to sell her humanity ideas. <br /> Choose this one up and yammallah it for yourself. It is unlikely one of the best films I've ever seen, and that's quite a bit.
