I just look this again and there is another version that is shorter 1999. I get the feel they are the same movie but I would like to know the difference. <br /> <br /> One is Japanese and there is no short pikachu is all I can come up with. Othmentwise why vote for the same movie twice ?? <br /> <br /> Prof Ivy was rather boring. He sounded as if he was almost asleep, there was no expression at all and the few lines he had. This was enjoyable enough, but not much of it at all. <br /> A collector (which after Lugia, he has no plans to destroy the world) and the usual characters who try to stop him because trying to take Lugia cause lots of destruction. / The Pok√©mon movies that follow are slightly better, ducs (poke 7) are great, with no. 8 almost here.
