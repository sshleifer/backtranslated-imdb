Filter in a documentary style, but you can very well tell the participants were framed. A newly divorced wannabe movie maker (Myles Berkowitz) sees a lifelong lifestyle up his love life and steps into the movie at the same time. He intends to make a documentary about finding love by filming twenty dates including division. The comedy is the best spot; The rest is bad after harm. Also take part in Richard Arck, Robert McKee and Elisabeth Wagner's inspiration. Trying for credibility is to seek the Tia Carrere speaking in a ceremony. This will be sufficient as a manual on how PA can get a satisfactory date.
