This time the hero from the movie first came to humanity and this time uses points and combos against super universal soldiers and a computer that has gone awry and is preparing to take over the world. I am very assured that it was Double Team, convincing everyone that Jean-Claude Van Damme was no longer credible in giving flicker occasional actions. However it was this that ended his credibility forever. While the Universal Soldier: The Return is not as dull as Double Team or the quest, it's still very terrible indeed, with none of the style and flair of the original and no star starry. This end is made simply for kids who enjoy professional wrestling. As I look back, not even the sequence of actions was all that interesting and that's why this movie is a worthless dude. In another word another clunker in the line of the Damme assembly line. <br /> <br /> * from 4 (bad)
