This drummond entry misses continuity. Most of them have the elements of silliness, the marriage postponed, and so on. However, this has an endless series of events that occur in darkness near as the characters run from one place to another. The house looks more like a city. There is also Leo G. Carrol who is such an obvious suspect with no-one seems to look at. He is a stranger and acts rather suspicious, but Drummond and folks do not seem to pick up anything. Still, it's as reasonable good action and a wonderful good finish. <br /> I know that Algie is supposed to be a funny figure, but like Nigel Bruce in the Rathbone Sherlock Holmes cops, she is so buffoonish that she's hard to imagine anyone having the taste or intelligence around her. Is there a story behind him that will explain how he and Drummond have become associates?
