It was not good. The characters were underdeveloped and the only personality was out of the memory I was in the movie before that contrary to the 'new' personality (or lack thereof). I seriously thought the opening scene was a nightmare by Ariel because of how absurd it was. It was serious. It just reminds me of all the annoying characters on the Disney Channel-everyone is overactive and jumping into stories from nasty scene actions without any connection really. The most disappointing part was the scary-not catchy songs, not surprisingly. In the original Ariel was an amazing and powerful voice and all the songs are enticing and fun. You remember them and want to sing them. But the songs in this movie were not creative in the smallest; It's as if talking in an annoying song-singing voice-quite weak, irritating. I do not have what they want-to-sing-to feel you normally get out of a Disney movie. It is as if not one wanted to make this movie, so they barely made an effort. . . This movie would need a new story line, new catchy songs and more heat and enthusiasm without annoying "look at me! Look at me! I'm so annoying!" mentality of this Disney generation. : '(
