I've seen some terrible horror movies in my time, and while this is not the worst of the bunch, it's certainly in the lower half. The script starts OK. A young doctor goes to a hospital as an internal, hoping she will arch her to a better job for her and her future wife. Cute huh? The movie then head straight into the toilet when you realize that something is killing patients. Turn that there is a demon in the basement of the soul's soul. There are 1 doctor, 1 nurse, and 1 security guard at all hospital staff for dragging this under mental patients, making a very beautiful ceremony just involving cutting the language out, and then allowing the home to haunt the In a demon it comes out and steals his soul in the magic of special cheese effects. At this point the movie became so ridiculous stupid, I asked for it to be over. There was still an hour to go. It looked like a half an hour "Tales from Crypt" the episode that somehow got up in an hour and a half crap-fest. From Little Lister to making it the best John Coffey (Green Mile) Imitation of Tracy Scoggins playing Stereotype Frigid Nursing Ratchet, this movie fails at all possible levels. I gave this 2 stars for only two reasons. 1) her fianc√© is very hot, it reduces the pain slightly towards the end and 2) the movie actually looks OK, a lot better than the current trend in horror movies made with wal-mart quality home cameras. <br /> In the end, avoid this turdure even if you have the blockbuster movie pass (which I do, and I still feel cheated). As a drinking bonus game, you and your buddy take a shot every time Matt Stasi (Dr. James Bishop) shakes his head while talking. You will drink 15 minutes from the movie.
