Well, I was able to get into the draw, but that's just me maybe. Lisless camera motion at times, nevertheless, this movie has got a good quality vintage. The act is genuine at times and fun with the occasional sequence sequences involving scantily clothed, beautiful woman. The highest score is confused and disjointed, but still ... fixed errors, Stella Stevens passers. <br /> <br /> The stunts are interesting, especially because of Las Vegas 70 center. There are some kerk-hand-held cameras-movements in the end, which keep me guessing for a while. But I do not think I'm going to chase the DVD, just yet.
