Dife St. The Elmo has no bearing on life after universities at all (for the majority of our common folk anyway). Why this same garbage did? Who can really relate to this? Who lives like these characters? I really feel sorry for the actors who are dealing with such a terrible script. There are some talented young actors in this "movie" that have done a great job elsewhere. It must be just one joke all about them on set. <br /> I actually get this "movie" insult to my intelligence. The only joy I got in this is hoping that Sir John Hughes had a good ol 'laugh when he saw a screening this same year was his masterpiece at the Friday Breakfast Club. even the mistakes I made in this look because you enjoy the 80's movie. It really is that offensive to the genre.
