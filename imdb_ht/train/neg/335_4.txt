Michael Jackson would have claimed a place for the top-bill of GOLDEN kids, and because he loves the kids. Who did not work (and why should he?), So instead we have Eddie Murphy out to save the world by rescuing "Kid Midas". I would strongly suggest all of the future scriptwriter, please closely study the actor's dialogue in this fantasy - adventure - adventure comedy that is at a stage closer to ISHTAR. Whatever Murphy says or she can best love, but she does not get hurt on her exquisite comic talent; he does not belong to this movie, and the same went for DR. DOLITTLE! Violence and visual combinations are the reasons for stamps as a classic class of cult, and that would not make any sense as Hollywood and movie fans keep cashing on the guy. Speaking of visuals, they were pulling out amazingly well at Ronald Reagan's fame as president. Murphy is far better in coming to AMERICA with 48 HRS, but this stale movie is by touching my honey honey for a sweet crunchy taste.
