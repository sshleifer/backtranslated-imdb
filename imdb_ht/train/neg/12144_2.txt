Although nothing can be compared with Vampires vs. Zombie ... in any realm of film I will try to judge this movie. <br /> <br /> First, the special effects were breath-taking. When there was an explosion on the TV screen I thought all my house was going to explode, and when automatic car guns were fired I thought the shells landed on the right floor next to me. Simply stunning friends. <br /> But the scene when Jack Black's sound-a-love is giving the worst monologue I've ever heard I almost killed myself, but do not worry since he got blazed in the movie he can pass terrible it acts on "I must be high". Seriously, he must watch himself mindlessly babbling on non-congruent thoughts that make absolutely no sense and just added that he must be "high" to justify his terrible acts. Well if you can say that excuse terribly acting then if you've talked to the writers, directors, executive producers, your sponsors will probably get the same answer seriously. With a production team called "Shock-o-Rama" I was shocked I did not wear a so-off shotgun in my mouth and ended my life after this terrible shocking excuse for a movie played. <br /> <br /> If you want to see this movie, then you should be murdered <br /> <br /> You're truly, <br /> <br /> The General
