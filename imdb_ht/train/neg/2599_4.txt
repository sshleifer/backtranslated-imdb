I got the very cheap DVD and I'm a total Drewbie, and that probably the only constellation where this movie might ever interest anyone. <br /> An early film of Drew, it was great looking, and it has become a lot of really beautiful scenes in it, like a show scene, a sexy dance scene, quite a number of sexy outfits etc. She never shows the charm friendship we know from its most recent movies. The movie itself is pretty average or sub-average, and much more like being made for the TV than one for the movie. There is no real horror or tension built up and the dialogues are often cheesy. The most interesting part is probably the end because I honestly do not understand it. But maybe nothing to understand about it anyway. But at least you do not get the end you should wait, and it comes too sooner than one would have expected. <br /> Overall I think this film is only for Drewbies.
