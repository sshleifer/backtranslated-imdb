Incredible! <br /> This film gets a 7 out 0f 10th. This has to be one of the worst movies I've seen in the years. Not only was the incredibly bad acting, the storyline (if you can call it) was just as bad. Offcourse everyone to know what will happen in the first 5 minutes. Which is not a bad thing if you can captivate the audience while leading up to that moment. That is, however, is not the case. There is no action, no suspense, not even a spark between the two leading actors. It was unfortunately a waste of time, and certainly a waste of my money. <br /> <br /> and 2 in just for trying
