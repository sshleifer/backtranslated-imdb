As other jars noted the movie killed in the last 1/2 hour. However before he suffered from predictability and a stunning performance steam by Kate Capshaw, who clearly never finds his character and breaks his every scene in in. Connery is fine as Fishbourne, but most scenes are manipulated for effect rather than truth which overlays the whole and a sense of unreality. And the finish is simply scarce. The movie makers apparently knew when they pieced this mess together as all they needed were sweet potato and pumpkin pie having Thanksgiving dinner, so offset they added a "dramatic" note to the top. Each little bit is accompanied by a crescendo of orchestration, to the point where it becomes ridiculous. If you want an example of this big league badge this is one to see, otherwise skip it.
