I'll keep that fast and sweet. Five girls on their way home from a soccer game decided to take a 'short cut' leading them down a desert forest-dog food forest. Of course there is nothing but good things to happen, and they are safe to reach their destination. <br /> Well, they do not. Soon they are driven down by a disruptive chick that has some mental disorders, and that induced is 90 minutes of absolute boredom. <br /> I hope never see any of these actors in any movie ever. The screams, screaming voice gave me a headache, and the script was so bad written that it included a lot of repeat phrases and nonsense screams screaming. All in all, one of the worst terrible bizarre cheeks I've ever seen ... and I've seen so much.
