In one word ... abysmal. I give it a star for the gay sex scenes and eye candy women, otherwise forget it. Worst Corman's efforts, nothing to do. Ben Vereen should have his name forever from the cast. I can not believe that this is now going to be on DVD (as of 2/15/05) and "Wild Street" - another retro stinker. I woke up to bed in this morning with a cold, decided to watch a movie in encouraging me up some, checking the digital channels ... the site looked interesting enough because I like to watch B-movie sci-fi, hippie culture and rebels teen flicks. It seemed familiar to Ben Vereen in the cast, I thought ... why not? What a great mistake ... it was a terrible start to my day. Only after watching it, I now know why the familiar crew of the newly-lifting my brain upsets. I remember seeing attractions coming to this movie as a 14 year old (i 45), back in the early mid-seventies in the Sombrero, a local art theater that does not exist ... The whole theater laughs irritatedly and even plunged loudly into how bad this movie looked. Actress: screaming, story: terrible, cinematography: almost-awful, music: awful, sounding: horrendous, directing: a joke. If you choose to watch this after my warning, remember ... "I told you that." <br /> "Gass-sss" is the perfect title for this movie ... you feel "gas" after watching this movie putrid - or maybe you should take in a "gas" room to wasting your brain go. I saw homemade Super 8 movies that put this film to shame. Definitely a new addition to all-time Top ten films this ... it's up (er, down) and "Tentak." Ted <br /> <br /> Ted in Gilbert, AZ
