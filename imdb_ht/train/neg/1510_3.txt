The reason to watch this hit in ... error ... Tribute to a great movie called Se7en: - It's while your channel browsing and nothing else about. - Someone pays you look at it. <br /> Do yourself a favor and pop into the DVD for Se7en, rent it, download it on iTunes, or put it in your Netflix replica and skip the sheep completely. Stick the same story with a few changes. In addition to the correction just Wreaks in Se7en and actually end up taking you out of the story several times. The worst one is probably flying on the desert helicopter vaccine, and the sound of people crawling on the radio, except no police helicopters fly on top of this one. <br /> <br /> Bottom line: I call it a blatant hit. If you want good you can call it a tribute movie, go ahead, but either way go to Se7en.
