I must admit when I went to see this film, I did not really have high expectations. But even with wait for me, I was totally and disappointed ... <br /> <br /> Basically Luke Wilson is a hot shot that tends to go out with a little crazy girlfriends. There is little mention of a girl following her but that's pretty much she for that character. Which I do not mind to cause it would probably be just as underdeveloped as the rest of the movie. <br /> So while on a train to Rainn Wilson (who I actually liked before this movie) convinced her to talk to a "hot" girl, Uma Thurman. This is strange to say the least, as everyone can clearly see that Uma Thurman does not belong to the "hot" category. Rainn Wilson's performance is also far from "warm". Normally I'm all for her to act, but she could not save that movie. Her character was jumping, unrealistic and rather annoying. You can never say if the writers were trying to make him funny gay classy sign, or just desperate. It was almost painful. But anyway, someone steals his purse while he goes to the train, and Luke Wilson is being rescued from the good she is running after the robber. Now we all know that Uma Thurman is the superhero, or "G-girl" as they like to call it in the movie. It still rustles me as the "G" stands for, but we'll leave that for the debate message boards. <br /> <br /> The sex scenes I suppose are supposed to be funny, but I find myself asking who sex like that? They almost throw the bed to the wall because of Uma Thurman's "passion" let's say. It made myself hurt, but not in "I think really hard to understand" that way. When Uma insults Anna Faris, calling her a "whore" I had no debate with that. Apart from the fact that he can not choose film well, he can not act and depend on the fact that he is blond and typical. <br /> Overall I would have walked out of the theater if I had not paid $ 8.75 to see it. Characters are typical and they have absolutely no chemistry, especially Uma Thurman. Someone should let her know that just because you move yourself very much does not mean you're acting. <br /> <br /> Also, the script and scenario could be used either a lot of work or a match with some lighter fluids. I actually began to feel embarrassed for the actors, and their dead career. In general, if you value your money, with self respect does not waste your time with this attempt in a movie.
