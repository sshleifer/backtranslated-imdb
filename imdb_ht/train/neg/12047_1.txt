I had the greatest enthusiasm going in the screening for this film. After all, this is one of the oldest and most complex stories known to mankind, and it was one of the first epic stories I read as a kid (even before Tolkien). I must say that it was a great discipline. They completely made the plot of a joke and turned the thing into one soap opera long. The loyal element of the plot was thrown over all in a horrific way that the audience laughed at many times in the comic script that just paid lip service in this fight in every fight. It was a great disappointment to see a complex character like Achilles (with a strange combination of almost matrices such as power, utterly unknown to male lovers of the original poem) going to "Fabio on the beach" in the guise of Pitt (ki with a good script and more effort could be turned into the most complex and original Hollywood face ever produced). The actors were actually decent, trying to make the best of a ridiculous script. It was actually a lot of talent (Peter O'Toole stole the show, and Orlando Bloom and Sean Bean were pathetic). Compare it to LOTR or Gladiator and do not even hold a candle. Many hunks for the goggle ladies on the battlefield scene are not enough for a movie that is on a long and besieged battle. I would not recommend that anyone pays to see this story dragged to the ground as one of the characters (at least they received this right part).
