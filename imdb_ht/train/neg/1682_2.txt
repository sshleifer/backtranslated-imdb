Takashi Shimizu has had a great opportunity and a remake of his original film Ju-Sou Grudge. While I have not seen that movie, I would be wagering that there is more imagination and originality (or some rip-off originality, in other words and abilities known in the Japanese ghost movie) than in his own rumors. Perhaps the script was written to somehow have some kind of deformation, or I would guess access, for an American audience. What starts off with some potential - the hint of something very targeted up will be on sudden Bill Pullman's move - just going to a total mix. And as a horror movie? There's a break. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />! Heart? How about some music timed just to know when exactly can you expect something. A black cat? Yeah, why not only make the ghost-boy stuff sound like a cat for creepiness that, in effect, only creepy if you want cats. Draw? Why not just shuffle between past and present without any pretending to a current flow of how a story can be said (ie, while the flashbacks are elements and are meant to be organic and the story is in general, they are not), or for whatever time the characters, or people who are on display, get around to tell us what happens or whatever, there is little point in care. The film is dried (ie the 180 degree degree breaks many times over and not in a pardon or intriguing way), and the wooden performance even when scary or shock (Gellar is especially disappointing, but Pullman, who shows up later after his first stage, is sorely bad). Even when Shimizu tries for some senior former "Boo" crisis, as when the woman is in the office building and chased by ghosts of Grudge, it's still funny. Just watch when it's about elevator and the ghost is in the background of shots. Either you will go with it, and if so more power for you, or you will laugh the uncertainty of the results. Count me in the letter. <br /> I'm not sure where this project goes wrong - Did Shimizu have his retool for the studio, or did he not give enough leeway and his clock to his vision? Or maybe Raimi had some say in it and did things most confusing and / or lasting happiness with someone else. Grudge gives us a lot of information that does not make sense or at least give us some movie-horror about. It's cineplex waste in a sad order.
