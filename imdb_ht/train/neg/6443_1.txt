I was one of the few non-liberals who showed up watching Steve's videos. It was quite an experience of propaganda film-making and boredom. <br /> I was hoping the film might be a real documentary on Michael Moore's visit to my local school, UVSC, but it turned out to make another liberal, off-and-burn effort for conservative slam and religious communities site. He certainly looks independent for a cinema to make a documentary that only reflects his prejudice on issues. <br /> <br /> What's more surprising is to see all the '10' votes the homeys posted here. Did they even see the video? Golly gee Batman, this must rank with the President! The ratings are as obvious as the bias in this film. <br /> Yeah, like stacking their votes at IMDb will help a movie crippled. Maybe my vote will help this balance.
