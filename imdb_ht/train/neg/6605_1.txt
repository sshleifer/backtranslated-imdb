If the director's intention was for the graphic head visualizer, then it would be okay, but I know that there is no such thing as a Hollywood director who would make a criticism of Pro-Marxist 60s movement, especially by a cinemas from the 70s. There are many diabetic dialogues going on here, which sometimes I wonder if I was not actually watching a comedy. You should not be in blame for thinking that this is a satir ?? So the naive movie appears. Spacek has been in his part of Leftist movies that brings me to the obvious conclusion that Hick's Wheel is one of those Morlywood Hollywood liberals. But I mean, is not it all? Beautiful hands, but s ** t for the brain.
