While William Shater can still make me smile at anything she looks at, (and I especially like her like Denny Crane in Boston Legal), well, this show is all about girl glitz and dancing and screaming and jumping up, it goes down. > <br /> It's No In The Intelligence Of Millionaire, No Of The Deal Flair or No Deal. <br /> <br /> This show is all about dancing and stupid stuffing in the allotted time. > <br /> I watch it off course to check it out. I watched him for more than 45 minutes, then I turned it around. It's a crappy !!! Unfortunately, this show will not do it. <br /> <br /> This is a given
