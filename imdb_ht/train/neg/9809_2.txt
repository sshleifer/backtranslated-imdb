Some wonder why Ms. Murphy was not yet another movie after this one. Is it because this film is totally blown snot. Disney was not the right studio to run this movie. Maybe Touchstone (well, they are owned by Disney, but it would be more adult). The movie is too kid-me, as the book series is not. The casting is all wrong for the characters. Characters do not even act as they do in the books. And why did Tucker change for a guy? It's a girl in the frigging books! Did this appeal to boy films? Sheesh. And where was Pewter, the gray cat? One of the funniest characters out of the book is absent from this scum. Rita Mae Brown is a good writer, but let Disney blow his job was wrong. An animated feature film, possibly in the blizzard of Don Bluth's artwork would suit a better movie by Murphy Madam. In general, I give this a 2, because at least Disney has made a movie in a series of books that do not appreciate. But I hope they did better. Either way, I still have my book to amuse me.
