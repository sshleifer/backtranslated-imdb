This was a very short episode that appeared in one of the "Night Gallery" shows back in 1971. The episode featured Sue Lyon (Lolita movie fame) and Joseph Campanella who played a baby sitter with a vampire , respectively. The Vampire employs a baby sitter to watch her child (which appears to be a kind of werewolf or monster) while she goes out at night to blood. The baby sitter is totally oblivious to the vampire appearance when he first saw him and only begins to put two and two together when he noticed that there is no reflection in the mirror, there is an odd collection of books in the library on the occult and hearing strange sounds while the vampire goes to talk to the child. He realized that the man who hired it was not what he thought he was originally. He bolted out the door, the vampire came out to believe and the episode was over. I do not know what goal he did as an abbreviated episode lasting only 5 minutes. They should just expand the episode earlier by these 5 minutes even with this one jump. A total effort wasted.
