Since people are involved, it's difficult to see why this movie should be so messed up and dull. The writer, David Ward, wrote the movie "The Sting" two years later, Jane Fonda has just won a Academy Awards for Klute, and Donald Sutherland has done just fine work in films such as "Klute", "Starting Blood Sanitation" The Me, "and" Kelly's Hero. "In short, the movie is a captivating story, and a small gumb of bumbling misbits is planning a great heist. At the same time the movie wants to be saturated hip, a series of comedy cartoons of NBC TV shows "Saturday Night" would do so well two years later. The bad result is that the draw makes the comedy bits look awkward and forcefully and the comedy comedy discovers destroy any kind of suspicion that the heist might have. It is quite literally a movie that keeps the destruction of itself, as the cars in the cars of the demolition scene run into each other. <br /> <br /> Only the real interest for me was to watch Jane Fonda. His "Iris Caine" is supposed to be a hearty version of dramatic Bree Daniels' dramatic drama in "Klute" but one does not believe it for a moment. She still Jane Fonda pretends to be a whore that we are watching. It is as a terrible performance as his performance in "Klute" was terrific. It would be a good lesson for acting teachers to run these films together to show how the actress even the same type of role can be great or pathetic. He suggests that the actors are just as good as the writers and directors.
