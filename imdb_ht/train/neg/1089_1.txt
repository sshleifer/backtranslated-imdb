What's up with Robert "Pretentious" Altman? Has he been saving on lighting? Everything was so dark in this boring movie that he was mocking. I mean, have you ever seen an attorney office where everyone works in candles? <br /> Do not waste your time. In fact, do not waste your time and anything Altman does: It's all a firefighter in the movie.
