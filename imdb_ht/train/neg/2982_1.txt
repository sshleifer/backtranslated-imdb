Zombie Review # 3 <br /> <br /> ** Spoilers ** <br /> <br /> Some films are actually "so bad they're good", and Zombi 3 is not just bad, it's miserable, unforgivably Wrong in many ways that a new language can be needed to just describe them all <br /> <br /> More than that, it's a credited film Lucio Fulci that even by his standard has absolutely no sense, reason or reasons. However we can not blame Fulci as he was not really directed by him, but by Bruno Mattei, who does not even have the essence of Fulci's style to help bring the film. Mattei seems to have brought little to the movie, but stupeing incompetence. <br /> So I'm ashamed to say how much I enjoyed every minute minutes of Zombi 3. He has no rachim characteristics - in a genre known for thin characters, weak stories, and lack of skilled film, Zombi 3 pushing the boat out, but doing so it's even funnier than nightmares. The "action" begins when the "death 1" gas stolen from a military base, and damaged in the escape. Who stole, why was it stolen, and why did the US military think that creating dead cannibalists in dead living would be a good idea? All these questions and more will fail to be answered in Zombi 3 .... <br /> <br /> After hiding from a hotel, the infected thief goes mad from all the green plastecine growing on face Before it was tracked down by the army that a bit scornfully decided the best way to throw off his body will burn it, throwing "Death 1" up to the resulting atmosphere ... Zombie birds! Who then attack people and turn them into human zombies !!! (if the cannibals zombies, why not the zombie birds just attack other birds?) Then we meet our "hero", a trio of horny GIs and a coach of girls. There are a couple of other guys with them too, but they are not important - NONE is important here. You will be hard pressed to remember anyone's face, let alone the names or find a reason to care about them. They finished hiding from the hotel as the thief ("a week ago this place was buzzing with life, now it's buzzing and flies!") But there is no escape from the undead. Your score will either be fully aspired to or you will have to turn things around the damned. The script is so appalling even the greatest act in the world could not save it, so it just as well to have some of the worst - and not just the human characters, the zombie act here is an everlasting ever low. There is no consistency in how the zombies behave - some chamble over in the time honored style, others engage in full on fights fights or packed around with machets, not to mention the zombies that are still able to speak (a gadget that gives the movie it ORIGINAL MAKE INFORMATION). They are shot dead in the chest (rather than the head) and even get knocked out by a good left-hook. How can you punch out a zombie ??? !!!!! In fact the emphasis on seriously performing 80s actions often makes it look like an episode of V ... <br /> <br /> Zombies are also spending a lot of hidden time, seemingly waiting for hours in places ridiculous about the lucky few poor sap will pass by and get the fear of life. They are hidden in bushes, in garages, in huts, roofs, in the water, and even under pregnant women. At one point a zombie followed a woman up the stairs. To kill and eat it? No! Push it into the water, these zombies with the wacky sense of humor! <br /> There are plenty of gore though. The lumps are hacked, most commonly used in the eating of meat and those who are getting the figures mushed in. There is nothing to match the original piercing earring, but if the bad effect of the bag is, you will not leave down. <br /> All this and I do not even mention the terrible music, inexplicably flying the zombie head, the scientist whose act actually managed to stand out as really bad, or the final cooling ... in a spirit twist original radio station was overrun by zombie, Zombi 3 gives us a current zombie DJ !! "He's gone on their side!" Shoot our hero escape, before vowing to continue fighting against the undead at an end that has never happened. <br /> <br /> Zombi 3 is trash - it would have no loss in the world if every single print was destroyed with all records of its existence in erasiness, but somehow I feel my life is richer to see it. <br /> <br /> Do I say richer? I mean 88 minutes shorter ...
