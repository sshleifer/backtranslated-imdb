You would think the first landing on the Moon would be dramatic enough without having to make up stuff on it. However, this documentary seems to need to throw everything in the hideous light possible. He talks about the risks associated with the lunar module and mentioned Armstrong's almost fatal accidents and vehicles in training, as if the coach and the spacecraft had nothing to do with each other. It has trouble overloading the computer (alarms 1202 and 1201) encountered during the final landing sound as a disaster near when it was just an annoyance and not a risk for the crew at all. And it took the "thirty seconds" call to mean thirty seconds of gas left before running out, when it actually thirty seconds before an abortion is required. <br /> <br /> If you want to see a documentary or dramatization of Apollo 11, go for "from the Earth to the Moon" or one of the PBS documentaries, but skip this one.
