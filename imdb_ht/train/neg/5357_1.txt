I do not know where to start. This film feels a lot like one of those cheap Saturday morning shows that they used to make back in the early eighties nineties. Sort of such power Captain or Power Rangers. It's full of super digital overlays and really cheesy to sound "secret agency" and bandits. The act is so bad that it's not funny. The direction is terrible and there is little continuity. It seems as if someone just dropping a bunch of scenes along with forgetting that was supposed to be a plot. <br /> <br /> Perhaps one of the most ridiculous scenes in the movie comes early, when several villains plant an explosive device in a silver car. For some reason, even though the device is clearly stated that the "remote sensation" bad guys decided to kick him down on the motorcycles as it drives away. This chase brings on. All the while with the bad guys performing funny and completely useless scrutiny demonstrations. Stand on the bikes, make wheels and so on. At one point, an accident happens and one of the attackers is thrown out of his bike, we see the bike (clearly cgi) dropping on the silver car but the rider disappears. Then a few seconds later the rider and bike returns ... apparently unscathed by the crash. At this point though the car has an explosive device planted in it, the attackers choose to shoot the agent while driving past, then blow up his car. Which was also clear to do with cgi. Sound confusion? It is, and that's the rest of the movie. <br /> I could point out that when I say cgi, we do not talk about Lord of Cgi sort of rings here. We're talking about the good Rangers Cgi's Power Cheese, actually I think he'd do better on Power Rangers. <br /> <br /> Why Savini and Todd have made this movie I will never know, I can only assume they are made for money, as a favor to someone or because they are blackmailed in it ... probably the last one.
