just below the surface lies? A movie is simply awful. <br /> <br /> As other viewers have justifiably commented, the storm sequences are just plain ridiculous. Cut already sodden firewood in the pouring rain? now this clever. threats? foreboding? sexual tension? for those who are dull and convinient, dull and understandable and too understated. <br /> I want to thank God for the sara's show scene but in retrospect I think the producers of the movie have seen the mess of the fact that they had put something in making it half way worthwhile at all. so it just gets another scratch. Make yourself a favor and give this a miss.
