All genre Movie Movie genre has to be made up of the worst movies ever made. This one delivers a lot of battles, generous amounts of money, American battleships, and a shanty town that blows up and tears down one shack at a time. The act is beyond terrible. What happened to Robert Walker, Jr. At one point he was in some major studio production, and then he just faded away. This film really strokes, but if you have not seen a biker movie in a long time, it's a good thing to watch. At the end of the movie, you should feel a little trashy for watching it!
