The concept of Sarafina appears to be one sound, which is about the perspective of music. He attempts to combine African music optimism with a story describing the atrocities and atmosphere of black people being forced to hold at the time the film was put. The contradictions of each of the two elements are too blatant and the film never justifies the rapid changes between jubilation and terror. Has it simply been a drama reflecting the conditions he could be a good movie, however the scenes of school kids were shot down by soldiers not exactly sitting beside the songs. Aside from the poor side of the act is not the best either, Goldberg provides a mediocre performance as the rest of the cast. Overall a deception. <br /> <br /> 3/10
