First of all, I'm not American or Middle-East. Second, I do not have a religion. The closest thing to a religion I have is sports and movies. Now I believe I would be best served to provide an opinion of neutrality and free of bias. <br /> <br /> Most of these short films are a utter shame. This event should be used to commemorate all innocent people being murdered by "some" barbaric and uncivilized morons. Instead, most of what I have seen in these short films have been observed attempts to note varied political points. Example: <br /> 1) Segment Ken Loach. Sure, we all sad that this dude had a tough life in his country, but what was done with the innocent victims in 2001? Of course not doing a right? Whatever! This film should have a subtitle for those who have problems listening to a partially Chilean-English accent. <br /> 2) Most disturbing is the Youssef Chahine segment. It is obvious that it has problems with logic. He justified the suspicions - America was a democracy and because some Americans voted politicians in power, then all Americans at the end were responsible for the actions and decisions made by the leaders of the Middle East. Helloooo! Is this guy for real ?? Some Americans do not even vote! Some Americans do not even know where the Middle East is; some do not even know what religion practices; and most of them do not know the real political issues that play behind the scenes. ### Mr Chahine, the reason we have all the problems in the world is because there are too many people with your kind of logic. The innocent victims of Twin Towers came from around the world. Firefighters murdered, rescuers, office workers, non-stop and flight riders have nothing to do with politics. And yet, we can not go on our lives because "some" people think that everyone has to choose one side or religion. We feel like just games for extreme politics. 3) The Israeli segment showed victims of their own bombings. Another film maker using this event promotes their own political agenda. Sometimes, it's not about you. Some people still think about "my, i, i." Sometimes, it is about others. <br /> 4) Idrissa Ouedraogo in the segment is a joke and another political tokens point. They obviously want money from the international community not to worry about poverty. Blah, blah, blah. <br /> This film delivers memory of "Sept. 11th, 2001" victim. <br /> <br /> The best thing for her is the CAN.
