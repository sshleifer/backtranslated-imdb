"Magnolia" is a preposterous, unpleasant acting showcase that adds up to many. Like "Eyes Wide Shut," "Magnolia" is a series of vigil in episodes without any concern for consciousness. The camera swoops into the hallways and corridors, gaining glimpses of sad characters. Where are the reasons for caring for these people? The common term seems to be the person who calls a lot, which can not care for others (except for John C. Reilly and Philip Seymour Hoffman characters), and are the destructive ones that either fall into pieces or die. I recalled how much I do not like "shining" because of the irresistible monster of a father playing by Armin Mueller-Stahl. There are many dangerous characters, unappealing here, why do we want to spend time with them? <br /> Having said that, nothing has been kept back on "Magnolia." Paul Thomas Anderson's ideas are jumping on her cloth and abandoned. There are two particular ideas that bombs. Both came in the last hour of this movie 188 minutes. One has the reversing camera from one character to another while each one sings one of Hime's Aimee Man's cock songs. Kind but unaffected since we can not see what the strings are all together. The other idea I refer to can not reveal other than saying it is completely unexpected and completely ridiculous. <br /> "Magnolia" has a lot of great acting. Particularly Tom Cruise has unleashed a performance I did not know he had in it. And John C. Reilly plays perhaps the most decent and really good cop in the latest memory. But it all adds up to anything. When the unexpected secret event happened, a girl behind me in the theater could not keep it in any more, saying, "This is stupid!" Feeling me is the majority of movies will agree.
