This typically melodramatic Bollywood film has been inexplicably becoming a favorite of Western criticisms. The script is funny, the act is over-the-top, and looks like cheese. The only reasons for watching this soap opera are the wonderful songs singing by Mangeshkar and calling in the legendary ceremony Meena Kumari. Watching the actress, who was sick during the filming and would drink himself at death at age 40 shortly after the film was released, had the same passion as watching a wreck train. Her husband, Amrohi, has written and directed, but lacked the competence of executing either good work. Bollywood has produced the best film.
