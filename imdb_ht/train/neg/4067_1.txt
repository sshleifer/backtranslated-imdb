Is it wrong, or is the 2007 version just a rip-off of the original? I have to ask because the DVD I bought is one of the worst films I have ever seen ..... bad acting, bad correction etc. .... the only "exploitation" aspect here is how we've worn cut for our money buy this piece of crap. It is nothing more than a light-weight pornographic flick ... there is no real gore, no scary image, just a bit cheap to do in garbage. If someone wants to see an excellent movie with no name actors, some sick gore and a decent storyline ... get baby blood ... also to do on a cheap budget, but well done ... with a story also current! a waste of money but I'll keep it just for a laugh ... it's pathetic! New comment ... Sept 3 ..... I'll keep this movie forever just because it reads its bad bad thing to almost fine .... in a really bad way .... worst acts ever. .. a real classical movie!
