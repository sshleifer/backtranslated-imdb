I start writing this review during a while while watching the movie. It was the first time I tried to do that, but I have trouble getting into this one without spending occasionally. This is not because it's intense but because it's bad. It's almost painfully tedious and incredible, especially when the preternaturally robust dead brother Ryan (Colm Feore) is on the tracks of tragic and bitchy, independent self and self-esteem. This would be a better movie if they would just leave that character out of the story. <br /> It adds nothing but mawkish, maudlin, very disappointing melodrama. Perhaps someone decides that if they could not make Ryan credible they would just make him objectionable. The problem with which is: Who cares if a spoil, shining, embarrassing jerk will die? Not me. <br /> Only the character thing that will be for him is the fact that he died, and sorry, but that's just not enough. Dead does not make anyone special. We are all dead, sooner or later. It does not give anyone the right to expect liking while acting like a jerk. The two other characters, and actors to play them (David Cubitt as Theo and Chandra West as Sarah), are much more interesting, and their stories, without the Ryan's self-pity interconnect, would have made a better movie . But it's not over yet, and it's time to hit PLAY again. Perhaps something big happens before the end .... <br /> Nope. Padon. This turkey leased to go back tonight!
