I wanted to like this movie. How can I not like it? Cary Grant, Jayne Mansfield, Stanley Donen; All icons in their own way. However, the wreck train that Suzy Parker lost all the experience for me. His acting was so awful that I sat there with my jaws open, do not believe my eyes or ears. I could barely make it in one look, that's horrible it is in this. <br /> <br /> Cary? Gorgeous and in fine form. Jayne? Adorable, endearing, and obviously having a ball. Throw in support to do well, and the city of San Francisco is captured in all its stunning, retro elegance. <br /> <br /> Then you see Suzy Parker trying to speak his line with a stick, a dead, a cluelessness that simply challenged belief. Who said this animal was able to ACT? Oy VEY, people.
