I saw the music live in the Denver Center for the Performing Arts and it was absolutely mind-blowing, stunning and had such fantastic continuity of scheme and dialogue that I loved reading more than most musicals that I saw on stage in. The interesting thing is that you have never seen Zach's face. He was still in the dark but his presence was powerful and guided by the direction of all production. Seeing I was having a movie out of it, I waited with bated breath, but when I looked at the movie version I was so bummed-out shame that I felt I was cheated. The film lacks the fascinating mood set in the live production and it never allows you to be completely in touch with each character. Personally, I would like to see the version live again and if that should ever be revived, I would all recommend that you go out of your way to see it. It will be one of the most memorable experiences you'll enjoy.
