Anyone who has been able to find out the value of this piece of crap must be self examined. We have submissive, heroin-addicted, hooker-wife wife and lazerations all over her body, lacerations received from sticks repeatedly by an abusive son. Now it is squirting breast milk all over the kitchen floor, the release thus became somehow the analogue of Helen Keller wearing his hand in running water. We have the husband who starts out to encourage a whore who just happens to her daughter (she's upset with her because she gets too fast) and ends by killing her female colleagues, having sex with corpse read, and then cut it up. We have the kid who relentlessly intimidated by his classmates and who comes home and beats his mother. You see, it's all circular. Deep, huh? Only the decent moment of this horrendous deck of threw is when the father kills his son tormentors. It is a good thing this turkey shot on video because otherwise a waste of expensive films it should be. If that guy who thinks artists should be interested in this slope is really serious, not surprising most people think the crazy artists. We saw this film disgusting, then put on "Zero's Wife, the Defendant." Oh, my God, it was a trumpet like that one was worse. What goes on in Japan these days? Sick, sick, sick.
