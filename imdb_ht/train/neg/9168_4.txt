Randolph Scott is leaving the USA for virtuous grazing in the British Columbia Canada. He wants to start a hive with Bill Williams and cook Lee Tung Foo. They prevented small animals from storm toll built by Victor Jory. After Jory rustles her cows and Williams loses her left arm during the sentences. <br /> From 1945 until 1962 when he retired, Randolph Scott did a series of good good adult Westerns, some of them considered classic real. Unfortunately the Cariboo Trail will never be listed among its best Western. <br /> It is more like the material that Roy Rogers or Gene Autry might use. The story is downright funny at times. Williams who had joined the ride with Scott, wanted to go prosperous for gold as there was a great strike at the time. He does not blame the rustlers, he blames Scott to convince him to make the trip for the loss of his arms. <br /> <br /> Also there is a scene in the movie when Scott, Lee Tung Foo, and Gabby Hayes were captured by Indians. They escaped because Gabby's mule was taught to kick off command and kick off away from the Indians to allow our heroes to escape. I'm not sure that would have been playing in a Rogers movie. In addition the story actually wants you to believe that tyro prospector Randolph Scott accidentally falls on a gold strike after just a few lessons from prospector Gabby Hayes on how to get gold. <br /> This was the Gabby Hayes movie mania movie. It would be best to have gone from a good west and in fact he did a couple of the best and Randolph Scott before. <br /> I'll say this, though no Caribou has made any appearance of the movie, this is one of some Canadian films in the past with no Mounties. <br /> But if I were you unless you're a big fan of Randolph Scott or Gabby Hayes, take the next detour to the Cariboo Trail.
