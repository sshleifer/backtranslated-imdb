If at least cruelty and death death there was a purpose in the story to justify the inclinations, but the script was just unintelligible and just plain. <br /> It went nowhere, the story had no readability continuity. It was just a bunch of sketches out of useless wet smile and a really stupid ending upset about as if they were saying "end * bip * my enemies and my few defenders for watching my garbage." <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />! killed by him and nothing else? There is no explanation, no punishment, a really weak main character cop who was a litter of an actor like Ready, who did not try to cut the guy who killed him cops, tortured a baby, a woman with a dog, he sends you to watch videos. <br /> <br /> The cops for some sex reasons all run down to the dark at the top (individually) at home farm at night as a bunch of bad characters write written to be killing the one a time like a bunch of idiots, and no other cop hears to die in one's darkness one after the other and just keep wandering around for no reason until every one is killed in turn. <br /> A bunch of terrible scenes of serious animals at the beginning for no reason or explanation, it was reminiscence, he looked at it in masturbate, it was comedy for him ... what was it? Nope Boll just thought to throw him into angry animal lovers .. whatever. <br /> <br /> Ready to believe the word of a psychic path to leave his family away if he killed himself ... a more gullible, cop stupider you never saw in a movie. <br /> <br /> I agree why I try not to totally hate its work. I try to find some reason to explain a horror writer artist, but this thing ... worse. <br /> Boll what do you do again? I hope you calculate it out because I know a lot of more worthy people who can not dream to get the budget you get over and over again to make the movies. <br /> <br /> If you want to see Boll actually in her best check out "Postal" it's actually okay.
