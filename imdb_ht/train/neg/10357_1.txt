I really did not like this movie because he did not really bring across the messages and ideas L'Engle carried out in his novel. We read the novel in our English class and I absolutely love it, I'm afraid I can not say the same thing for the movie. There were some serious differences between the novel and the version adapted to it just did not make any of the imaginative engineering credits that are Madeleine L'Engle! This is the reason I gave it as a poor rating. Do not see this movie if you are a great fan of L'Engle lyrics because you will be seriously disappointed. However, if you watch the movie for entertainment purposes (or education like it was my case) then it is a movie audience!
