"Welcome to Collinwood" is a kind of disaster. Considering those involved, it should have been several times better. <br /> Look at her, if you're at least somewhat attached to the faith that she's going to get better, will probably make you cry. It's one of those movies that has been potential, but stole in this potential thanks to a terrible script and some bad act, not to mention the strange sorry and unnecessary George Clooney character and guy who reminds me of Richard Dreyfuss about whom I care so little that I do not even want to know her name. <br /> <br /> Only films save grace is unusual vocabulary it introduces. I found myself thinking of it time and time again as I saw more of the kapers. This is the only reason I gave the movie a 3. The plot is boring, the characters are neurotic, unreasonably offensive, and very easy. They are in a constant state of agonizing stress and they're all so irritating that I celebrate the obstacles. They call each other and swear allegiance. The dialogue is the best and insultingly stupid insipid at its low point. <br /> I find that Steven "Traffic" Soderbergherabracadabrablahblah and George Clooney are blaming for that. They should try for war crimes, if someone actually remembers this crap long enough to care for.
