This movie is hilarious, not in good ways. Battle is awfully bad to do, while sometimes they will try to shock or break some bones, and even that happens only two or three times, definitely not enough to call it a shockmovie. A carnival means a hero can walk in an open field with 10 people shot at him with the usy, pick up a gun, start shooting back and do not get hurt. <br /> <br /> The story is empty, guys awake, losing his memory, starting to fight cos is what it's good at. Five years later memories come back, take blablabla revenge. <br /> Not worth your Buck, not really worth your time unless you're drinking and bored.
