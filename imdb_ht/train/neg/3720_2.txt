Is this movie a joke? Is it a comedy? Surely it's not a serious thriller? There is no suggestion that there is any intentional humor, but on the occasion of a few poor, acting poor, direct impressions and impressions, the audience laughed loudly at the cinema. The uncompromising plot - a young artist promises to just get his shot shot dead by a killer he walks through by mistake. The murderer sees young artist working his wallet and decides to attend an exhibition at his work. At the exhibition the killer satisfies the dead artist sisters and they end up falling in love. It is all very predictable and the end will not have anyone to guess as it is so badly scripted. The film takes place mainly in and around Vienna, Austria, and shows what a beautiful city it is. Do not waste your time on this movie though, unless you study how PAs act, direct or script a movie!
