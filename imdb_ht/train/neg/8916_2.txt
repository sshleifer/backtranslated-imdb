I rent this DVD saw it while looking for something else. When I saw the title on the jacket, I could not believe my eyes. I read Yalom's book about a year ago and love her, in fact admire Yalom's work in general. (I'm a clinic psychologist.) I watched perhaps 30 minutes from this movie and had to turn it around. I'm not sure if I can take more. At a superficial level, the faux accents, as others commented, are simply distracted at the best and disappointing with the worst stupid. The act is dull when it should be fun and funny when it should be serious. Lou Salome's portrait is simply flippant, and the brilliant Freud comes as little more than a student. I see that the very little book of the book is transmitted too far. I was hoping to be able to recommend this movie to my students. Instead, I will refer to them in the book. Imagine that.
