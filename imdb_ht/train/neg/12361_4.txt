I've seen this recent film by Woody Allen because I'm a fan of her work and I make it a point to try to see everything she does, even though the movie reviews lead me to expect a disappointing effort. They were good. This is a confused movie that can not decide if he wants to make a comedy, a romantic fantasy, or a drama about middle-life girls crisis. It does not fail at all three. Alice (Mia Farrow) is a restless middle-aged woman who is married to great wealth and leads a life of sophisticated luxury with her rather boring husbands and two toddlers. This rather mundled concept concept is livened up with such implosities as a popular Chinese folk healing that makes it invisible to some magical herbs, and ghosts of an ancient lover (with whom he flies on Manhattan). If these adds sound too fantastic to you, how about something more prosaic, such as an affair with a saxophone player? <br /> I'm not quite sure of what's being mixed up trying to say. There are only a handful of really funny moments in the movie, and the ending is a truly preposter touch at Pollyanna. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />! Or go back to "Annie Hall" or "Manhattan".
