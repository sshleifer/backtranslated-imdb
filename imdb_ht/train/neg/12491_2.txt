Hm. While an enjoyable film spiked holes, pointing out atrophic acting, primitive (at best) special effects (all of which caused me to view this movie three times over the past six years), Severed the rank Among the worst I've ever seen. I never make sure the protagonists, all I know, is that the killer uses a portable gidotine, as seen in the dance floor scene scene. All in all, I do not really like the movie, because only the first 30 minutes are enjoyable, the rest is a mishmash of confusing dialogue and imagery that fail to progress the story into a logical conclusion (which I can not remember about any way).
