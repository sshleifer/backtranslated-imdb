My dear. Where do I start? The father is not near anywhere near enough to be the girl's father. It's corpse on the camera in the first 5 minutes of the movie. The favorable excavation of this film is "Jesus Christ !!!". Zombies are nimble, stupid and few and far between. The motives are incomprehensible and a narrative does not exist. People 'run' at the destinations of jeep driving at 3 MPH. The world seems to be wearing as usual again these days are supposed to end. Breastfeeding appears for breastfeeding. Normally, such a approach would give some redemption but the rest of the movie actually made me uninsured in breasts or the future of mankind. There is a dog for no reason and thinner, orange blood that gets the sale. The general and catchphrase it to "Close the f ** k up!" is the only detrimental feature. As for the rest, I sincerely hope to hear that they have done the decent thing and killed themselves.
