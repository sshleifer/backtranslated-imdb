Very bad. Very, very bad. As a fellow who is hoping to do, there's or at least - smack the catering table in a movie series, I find it hard to criticize independent who actually got a movie of any sort done. However, this movie ... oh dear. <br /> <br /> Achieve Frightworld does not like anything more than rational exploitation (something honorable in itself) and try to make it compliant with mainstream standards is a mistake. And to be fair, it is much more fun than - said - Red Cuba ... but not much. So I will not try to criticize, just let me ask to throw out some observations. <br /> 1) If gurney is point in the movie, should you not be able to see it? > <br /> 2) If you have hired three sounds sounds at least one know how to operate the equipment. <br /> <br /> 3) In a fake maniac horror film you must be shopping than a Smurf Doll. Hard I know, but really ... 4) There are many talented videos in the Buffalo / Rochester area, most you can hire really cheap. Find someone who knows how to frame a scene. Just because you have someone who knows how to use After Effects and other cool programs does not mean he should do that every two seconds. /> <br /> 6) Kudos to find the girls taken by themselves but next time, find the girl in mind we want to take off. <br /> 7) Editing should help tell the story or put an attitude. At least in this sort of movie editing should sell the Gore gags. A chain suddenly appear in a stomach character is not scary, it is sloppy. <br /> <br /> There are some good things. Not all the act was bad. Jack was very good and I loved acid once he started fighting back. There were some own prints, unfortunately he was thrown up on the screen without rhyme or purpose. "Acid Poptart" is a name that deserves a better movie. I love the moxie in Frightworld too. Next time, now that they have a movie of quality under the belt, I hope all involve love doing something better than Colman Francis. Update at least Ed Wood.
