This movie was awful. The finish was absolutely awful. There was no film footage at all. The only thing that was decent on the movie was to act by Robert DuVall and James Earl Jones. Their performance was excellent! The only problem was that the film did not perform their performance to act any justice. If the script would come close to capturing a half decent history, it would be worth watching. Instead, Robert Duval's and James Earl Jones's performances are completely wasted on a terrible storyline ... or lacking in it. Not only did I wait in the movie for something to get the movie .... quite an actual movie ... not only absolutely dialogue between character for what ended up being absolutely no reason. It was nothing more than common dialogue that would have taken place back in that time period. There was nothing special about any of the characters. The only special thing was how Robert DuVall described a rambling, senile, drunk, old man. Nothing deserves happening during the entire movie including the end. When the movie ended, I was seized ... surprised that I was sitting in the movie all waiting for something of interest to reach watching the movie while. It never happened! The character throwing suddenly started rolling to make it apparent that the movie really was over and I realized that I was just wasting 2 hours in my life watching a movie and absolutely no conspiracy and no sense. It's not even a story. The movie all takes place at a time of value. That's it. It was one day of life (and death) in some craft on a farm. How much of a story can take place in one day (other than the Day Training Film)? The performances act by the entire cast were excellent, but they were incredibly wasted on such a movie deception ... if you could even call it a movie.
