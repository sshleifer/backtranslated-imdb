I figured that any horror movie with Orson Welles in it would be strange. Necromancy sure was but it was a bit too weird for her own good. The movie really has a creepy feel as it deals with a covenant of satanic / witches in a small town and a young woman's attempt to escape. The principal though seems deliberately trying to confuse the audience using flashbacks and sequencing dreams. Not the final, there are too many questions unanswered. What's worse, as the story is so confusing, it's very hard to root for any of the characters. It seems odd that Welles would agree with the great title of this film especially since it has not much to do. Perhaps one day they will put out a tape of the outtakes and bloop out of this movie. Now that would really be fun!
