The original Boogeyman was a funny but fun supernatural slasher flasher. It was by no means a great movie but fun in the right frame of mind. The third installment of this series, Back to the Boogeyman, on the other hand, is simply atrocious. It consists of two things. Firstly, cheap and soft new feet. Second, the LOADS recycle bits from the first movie. The new material is unbelievably unprofessional, but not in an amusingly stupid way, simply incredibly tiring. This foot was clearly struck together quickly and without any effort. It serves as a framing device for the endless clips from the first (and possibly second) movies. And boys, are these letters clipped out of the movies earlier; Sometimes repeating sequence over and over again. The only new addition to these parts is a voice that is useless to describe exactly what we can see with our own eyes. The whole experience of watching this is really self-numbing. <br /> <br /> Back to Boogeyman is an example of the worst type of flick of exploitation; types that exploit the audience in a very cynical way. I want to keep this review briefly with the point because this film deserves no more. There is nothing here at all. This is worthless.
