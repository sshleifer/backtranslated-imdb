I must have my head on the back to watch this movie all the way because it really was painful. An incredible painter gets a completely hit-man? This film was luxurious and absurd in which if I mentioned them all I should give away the movie. Norm Peterson aka George Wendt must really be in a rut agreed to make this movie. The act was depleted and the story was even worse. As a person who is innocent and rational, I could not understand where the writer came from and where he went with this movie. There were bug on the part of every main character, had a string of hapless and ridiculous events, then the movie ended. An absurd act after another and dialogue does not make a movie, it only makes a rail sled trench.
