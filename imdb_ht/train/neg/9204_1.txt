I've seen this film many times (and recently read the movie movie is based) and every time I see it, I just want to calm all the four of them. The fact that they are not signs of the fact that Tom Hank's character is flipping into his D & D (Oops M & M) :) character ("Oh, it just acts in character ..") outside the gaming session. That with the fact that after three months of therapy, let's just destroy all that and feed her delusion! These types of people are what gives RPG a bad name. <br /> <br /> Also love the song 'corny', and the music does not 'chat on a piano' and 'stop us if we get too annoying' are almost enough to put your teeth on the edge!
