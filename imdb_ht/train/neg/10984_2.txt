I watch this movie for two hours and have absolutely no idea what it's about. Someone was murdered or maybe they did not and maybe someone made it or maybe they did not. This has brought memories back on the good old days (old weather?) When all CBC Canaries were stinkers. Lately the stinkers were the exception, but this tipped podge is confused in trendy feminism, self-reeling back screens and dialogue mumbled to make up for lost time. I have never found Margaret Atwood's books easy for her. This film continues to be a good Canadian tradition. It's not easy to look. Perhaps the trendy folks at the Shoe Shoe Toronto cocktails parties will pretend to have loved it. Our boonies are slightly less firefighting.
