Higher Learning says it's OK for blacks torment white people because they're all oppressors. Most blacks in this movie are described as aldermen. Stunning that this is supposed to be a positive movie about race. Incompetent acting, direction, and production value all contribute to this act of acting in a film flick. A tough piece of garbage. The authors of this dude should be disappointed. Higher Learning says it's OK for blacks torment white people because they're all oppressors. Most blacks in this movie are described as aldermen.
