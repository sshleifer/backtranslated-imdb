Pretty standard B-movie stuff. Seriously, anyone who watches "Dragon Fighter" and Dean Cain and a bunch of first movie makers should know better than they expect real quality or even intelligence patterns. B movies exist for popular re-work formulas. If you give them same sign analysis, you'll wind up the damaged movie for yourself (and maybe write some self-important, unreliable riots on IMDb). <br /> I like the female lead, Kristine Byers. It was charismatic and I thought it was better to attract. It was a memorable B-movie appearance. Unfortunately, I do not see where he has made any movies since. I'll watch it again.
