She claims she must be closer to her ladies but her real motives are somewhat more enchanting. There he crosses the path with Burke (Bill Goldberg) a cumbersome prisoner who can take care of himself. Twitch, despite being less muscular, is just as thin and is pretty much the same. But there are gang wars between the black and mypanic prisoners who explode in a hostile control of the prison when the black gang leader shot dead and the fingers in Burke. But sh! T really hit the fan when the real killer and leader of the hispanics, Cortez (Robert Madrid) took Twitch's girlfriend and Burke's hostage. <br /> <br /> Steven Seagal does not swit (reportedly opposed to the idea of ​​under Siege 2 and only agreed to make it on the condition the movie company was and at the moment left direct his own movie So, despite this being a late end, the lead role this round goes to Bill Golberg (Steve does not even appear in some of the stock footage from the first movie that appears towards the end.) , there is one reason why he has not done much work since Universal Soldier 2 and that's because he's not much of an actor, and not a lot of an action star either, managing a character that starts as pretty black and brooding but unsubtly turning in a standard action hero awkwardly abusing on one-maternal math.
