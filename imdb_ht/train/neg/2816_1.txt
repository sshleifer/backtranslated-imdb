This is one of the movies you see in the video store that you just have to get because it just looks so horribly bad. And indeed, we could not take most of it. There was a lot of fast-forward going on. But then we came across a scene where Robert Englund seduces the girl protagonist (her name somehow slipping my mind at this time). CRIPES. I never looked at a single scene from a movie many times (I estimate forty or so). And I never laughed so hard in my life. You see, Englund has this to show off her kidney. I last saw the film a couple of months ago, but I can not stop laughing as I typed. Anyway, the scene is a montage of vaccine - Englund ripping off the lingerie in the girl, Englund rides a naked horse, and some mysterious women are falling into a snake's head. This is absolute genius. You've got to see it for yourself.
