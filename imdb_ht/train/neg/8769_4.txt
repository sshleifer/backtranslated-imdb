This was a movie that I hoped I could suggest to my American friend. But after 4 attempts to watch the movie ends, I knew I could not even watch the damn thing to shut down. You are almost convinced the real war was not even the last long. The other is trying to ask my patriotism to criticize a movie like this. But flat out, you can not go in watching Private Ryan LOC Saving Private. Forget about the movie's budget difference or the audience - these do not prevent a director from making a smart movie. The film's length is not so bad and the fact that it's repetitive - to hold up the hill but giving it different names. I thought the LOC was a terrible terrain - this hill looked like my yard. The sequences of character development (flashbacks, looking back at the last moments, before being deployed) should have been throughout the movie and not just escaped in one long memory. Until now, I have not looked end. But there was a better movie (not so many) called Border.
