I've seen better output on YouTube! I'm sorry the actors, as the writing was terrible and the shocking direction, not sure how they could get their lines out - I really doubt any actors could salvage this movie no matter how good they were. The characters were not developed at all, and there was no real joint of the plot that just seemed to go nowhere very much. It's a shame really, as the premise for the movie was good and better production, direction and script it could be a decent movie. It certainly was not a comedy, unless you laughed loudly at the dubbing - that was amateur, even the English actors sounded weird.
