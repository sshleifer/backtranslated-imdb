I've seen a lot of crap in my day, but goodness, Hot Rod takes the cake. I saw a free screening at NY other night. I can only hope to show the funny version of the paid customers. The big streets were sparse, the plot was refreshing, and the characters were the only one of the best. A highlight is a hilarious dancing scene with Adam Samberg. It was priceless and it was the only scene I really had a hearty laugh. Other than that, I can only remember random and when dead. SNL & Samberg fans can be disappointed. I know I was expecting more of it. But it's short, I definitely would not recommend going to a free screening or paying them to watch this movie.
