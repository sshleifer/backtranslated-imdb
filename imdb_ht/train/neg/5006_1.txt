There is nothing like a movie about a group of friends who not only all influencing one another at the point of laughter, but they have little to have any kind of redesign to make a * audience * like or empathize with any of the characters either. There are so many good movies (an Ed Wood or kill movie movie), and there's just plain bad (like 99% of Uwe Boll's "work"). This movie is barely tolerated even if you are a brilliant talent MSTie Riff (and Mystery Science Theater 3000). Fortunately while I am rather talented in that regard (it's how my mind works all the time), for those who are not so naturally talented in MSTie rifing, eventually in * this movie * you'll just want to pull your own head , slowly know the film "Taboo" robs you in about an hour and twenty minutes you will never get back. Even my MSTie talent was barely a match to slow down this slow, boring time. The most unearthly aspect of this movie is that * someone * green-lit and / or funded it ... I rent Taboo only for virtually Amber Benson's talent, who is clear to be blackmailed by making this movie a. I was another smaller movie known to myself in my rental queue, reviewing that I'd better read it first. Ironically the best aspect of the movie was its impressive maze castles for its interior location.
