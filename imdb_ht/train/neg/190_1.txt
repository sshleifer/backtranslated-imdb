I still feel that a good movie should have a conspiracy. This particular movie was missing one, and I felt it would be more effective with a draw. This has become even worse by the fact that it seemed to go on forever; I was worried that she finally ended. However, I just noticed that it was only 123 minutes long; It felt like four hours. Not only was there any plot but the movie also lacked a remarkable conflict. It's not the worst movie I've seen, but I used to say it was until I saw the "fast and the fury". So do not think my review from someone who needs nothing but action. I actually hate most movie action out today; It's just that this movie is all the way on the other side of the spectrum. Not really really happened to this film. However, the scenery and costumes were beautiful.
