Imagine the scenario - you are in the movie theater only because you are in Washington for the weekend and rain it and you end up with the Museums. You think you can go to see the marshall Sarah film as the trailer look so you do not have to engage your brain. It sells out. Options? - The Bank Job, The Bruges, The Leatherheads or Prom Night. You've seen the Job Bank (suprisingly decent movie heist) and In Bruges (yet, very good) for you're going down to two. You're not fancy watching Clooney or a nice one in the office running around 1930 football uniforms, so you go see Prom Night right? Move. You take the $ 8.50, walk up to a stranger on the street and ask him your punch on the face for $ 8.50. It would be better to spend money. <br /> It actually plays as much of a comedy than a horror / thriller or whatever it is supposed to do. If I had financed the movie and showed me that as a final cut I would not know whether they laugh or cry. Probably both. An insult to anyone's intelligence ... My roommate was laughing loudly in the movie, as for the act, they might as well have cast robots (or perhaps dogs) in their roles, they would be more realistic. The detective must probably be the worst actor I have ever seen (Ben Affleck and Hayden Christansan (I hate acting so much I do not care how you spell his name) or relieve your title (s) <br /> So, in summary 'not good'
