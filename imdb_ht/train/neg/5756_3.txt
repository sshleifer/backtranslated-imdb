This would be a great movie ... Meryl Streep and Jack Nicholson co-starred as two journal writers. Mike Nichols is leading. Uh uh. It's too matured! Unlimited and predictable! Slow and unfocused! <br /> She is a knife cookie boy to meet girls, boys get married girls, boys have artifacts, boys' boyhood story. Now there is an original concept! After squirming in two hours (it was only two? It felt like six.) I was not sure it was a comedy, a romance, a tragedy or a soap opera. It's been done in 1986. I'm sure everyone we did was sixteen years ago that we would forget. I hope that damage to the reputation of Streep will begin to heal and that the emulsion on the meter will begin to fade. It's not that it's such a bad picture. It's just that it's such a good one.
