This movie barely follows the story line in the movie. All the fascinating points in the book do not even exist in the movie. They ended up turning it into a cheesy "ant" Disney movie "breaking" story between Meg and Calvin. It was so bad it should have been Hillary Duff playing the party, or one of the likes. This film was nothing more than an insult to the intelligence and mysticism of the book. I can not believe Disney could even get away and make such a cheap, basic pronoun. If you've ever read the book, I think you would agree he could easily be done in a movie "Lord of the Rings" equivalent. This movie should never be able to use the title of a rip off of time. Poor to do.
