This has to be the worst piece of waste I've seen in a while. <br /> <br /> Heath Ledger is a heartthrob? He looked pervert. I wish I would know that she and Naomi Watts are a real-life article because I spent 2 in the longest hours of my life asking what she saw in her. Orlando Bloom is a heartthrob? With the scraggly beard and deer-in-the-front sight to look at it, I can not say I agree. <br /> <br /> Rachel Griffiths was usual fabulous herself, but Geoffrey Rush looked as if she could not wait to get through the series. <br /> I suppose I'm sorry for bankers and thieves? This is a far cry from Butch Cassidy, which was actually a fun movie. This was trite, cliche-dog food and boring. We only left because we were convinced he would get better. It was not. <br /> <br /> Last 10-15 minutes or so were incompetent hilarious. Heath and gang are going up to a border hotel, and women and children are dying because of their presence. It's not funny. But it was funny when they walked out of the hotel with the gun over, because all we could think of was the Black Knight from Monty Python and Grail of God. I kept waiting to say "I'm going to bite it ever off!" We were shaking and laughing, as they were several other deformation members at the hearing. When we left, pretty much everyone was talking about what a waste of time this movie was. <br /> I can not pay cash to see this disaster (sneak preview), but it certainly was not free. It costs me 2 hours in my life that I will never get back.
