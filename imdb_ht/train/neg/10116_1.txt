I honestly want the last 30 minuets in my life back. <br /> <br /> The only person who fits to watch this movie is Helen Keller I kept saying I myself was the best find this best. <br /> Then the zombies finally showed up and they had some raccoon paint on the eyes. <br /> They talk like regular people. <br /> One drove a car. Some female voodoo asked what one of the "zombies" wanted and the "zombie" said (i want to dance) <br /> <br /> can I take it again Can I call for an hour Â½ in my life ?????
