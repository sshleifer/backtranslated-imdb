Angels who got a little bit of booty were banned in the sky and now live in a British forest where they are seduced and off young. Talk about high concepts. On this extra side this little mom gives us Tom Savini, but since her acting range is limited to two minutes screen time, the attendance of five minutes seems to last a long time. Angels run around the naked jungle for the most part of the movie, but if they might have the body of an angel, their faces are sure to look like Joan Rivers in a bad day. Mediocre acting and gore-amateur amateur does not help with the nightly fatal scenes to recall Paris Hilton's most popular movie. So bad that it is really bad.
