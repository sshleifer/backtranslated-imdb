I saw the original "Chorus Line" on Broadway God knows how many times and felt passion, despair and joy from this live experience in the theater. Michael Bennett knew he should re-imagine "chorus" for the screen but he never knows how to do it. If the person who came up with the show is stumped - that should answer your question. Some show that they simply do have to see live - with an audience. However, Richard Attenborough cool to work music in "Ghandi" and dancing with animals in "Doctor Doolittle" ended this direct movie that does little to have no resemblance to the stage show. Horror songs were added (Surprise! Surprise!), Big songs were dropped or given other characters (which did not make sense). Michael Douglas was mis-jete. Those who could not dance tried to act and had the "Landers" sexy woman who could not sing, act, or dance - I guess she just finished being Ghandi's wife. Dance by Jeffrey Hornaday looked like nothing more than Schlock from "Flashdance" rejected and nothing works. I sat there to think about how such a fixed and emotional thing can be drained. If you really like to show this and it will come to Broadway in 2006 - see it, but do not think that long-running music event has been "A Chorus line" having anything to do with this movie.
