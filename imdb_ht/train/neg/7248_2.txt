When the law-abusive laws were killed by a gang of thugs, a young deputy ordered to escort his mute friends, forcing them to be raped by the gang of Tucson for trial and ending having to face the real killers on the road .. The decor is a real life discovery in the video store to lure you away from the best movie! It is pale, logical, slow, and ultimately very boring.
