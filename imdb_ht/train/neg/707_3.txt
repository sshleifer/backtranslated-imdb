"Celebrate All Saints?" Where ...? When ...? <br /> Are you born in all of the Saints and the term edited out? <br /> What a waste of a wonderful title! There is nothing in the story that has the connection to eliminate the "Feast of All Saints." Nor does anything in the story about "All Souls Day" that the term is referenced. Why do you need to bother using this title if you never intended to include any kind of storyline or theme on "All Souls Day" or "Celebrating All Saints"? <br /> <br /> Embarrass Move Script & Amateur Writing <br /> <br /> How to attract the great talents of this clunker? Writing is so amateur - the characters that have been known to each other all their lives are going to long talk about their life story for the sake of the hearing. Not along the way people talk to one another. <br /> <br /> What was the Principal Thinking? <br /> The direction R is equally bad! The style is forced and overly feels uncomfortable. In one scene, a character is called "Take Your Hand On Me" and NAME A Touch It! The most reliable scene however is, the scene is extremely battling over-the-top top of the beginning of the movie. <br /> <br /> Too many gore in a very fake, silly fight scene There are many dead in the fake battle scene. It looks like a sailing live Saturday Saturday! You can see extra waiting for the signal cameras in all cameras. Everyone plays the Death Scenes as a 4th grade boy - exaggerating every bit of swamp and shrinkage. The blood on victory battles is so overcrowded and overlapping to apply it looks like someone uses a tomato sauce set and just squirted straight lines in red on the costumes. <br /> <br /> The whole battle scene comes as the parachute of a movie really movie movie. You're almost expecting someone like Will Ferrell and Mike Myers to ride on a horse and deliver the punchline. Who in real life would ever behave this way? <br /> <br /> A girl standing under the dead body of her hanging father - who is most ridiculous in writing, directing and casting is actually concentrated in the scene: is terribly mutilated, and literally shedding shapes without gaping injuries. Even a totally stupid would know he's dead! But it is - very monotonous - repeated over and over "Daddy, Daddy ..." while looking at someone on the screen. He released it with so much credibility and passion as you could expect from a non-actress child who repeated the line for the camera all day. Even if the poor kid had any acting skills, the scene is completely incredible. The little girl would not even be in the battlefield after hours of carnage - surrounded by hundreds of dead bodies, while she calmly stood there! The natural instinct would have the kid screaming and scared, running away from the blood carnage! <br /> <br /> One particularly goofy detail, which provides scenes of a satiric toned ash, the father is hanging, with a big hook in his mouth and blow. It looks like a fish on a hook! Details are determined comical, making the whole scene come across as fake and funny. <br /> The Fantasy La-La-Land, Mother and Daughter of the same Age! <br /> <br /> Another funny detail is that you see a central character - the girl's mother - at the end of the stage and at the next stage, which happens 20 years later, it looks exactly the same! She is still young and beautiful, and now the same age as her daughter! I almost turned the movie right because the direction and writing were obviously awful - but I tried to beat it out because I wanted to see the Louisiana settings and I love all the actors. I do not know what these fine actors have thought when they accepted these roles! <br /> <br /> Who was the target audience? <br /> <br /> The excess amount of blood and seriously violate the acting of the opening scenes are weirdly out of place with soap opera tone to tell this story. It is also a strange way to start a movie that, for the rest of the time, seems to target romance novel reading. Strange inconsistency in tone!
