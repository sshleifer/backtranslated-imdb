From the capital of nepotism in the world comes another junk film in a fancy pack. "CQ" says a lame, chaos in a story that is little more than a bunch of funny cartoon characters, a babe, and straightman Davies running around trying to make a stupid sci-fi movie. I can not think of any reason anyone wants to spend time with this ridiculous attempt in making films. (D)
