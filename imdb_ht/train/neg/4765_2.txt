While the original titilates, this cheap remake is made purely traumatic sensitivity. Instead of drawing-complicated twisting, this call throws just the sudden and seemingly random feature of story change that only serves in its core plus each bare development. Worst of all, replacing the original spicy dialogue is a saltshaker reversing full of unnecessary four-letter words, leaving behind a tasty but refreshing taste. There was promise - unfulfilled promise. The prospect of Michael Caine pulled off a Duke Patty-like Keller-a-Sullivan graduate is admittedly intriguing. Unfortunately, this brilliant and respectable actor has only picked up his reputation, first not accepting the role of this story horribly re-scripted and then in turn in a performance that only seems competent when compared to romantic amateur Jude la. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> If you have not seen the original classic, Hunt it down, watch it, and just enjoy a story-and-a-half. As a remake, pass on this insult to the original.
