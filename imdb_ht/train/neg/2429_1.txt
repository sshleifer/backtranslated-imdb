Scary .. Yes scary .. Jam-packed with stripping (from crowds of thin ones), Beach Maslin takes place on a nudist beach in SA <br /> <br /> I saw this first movie Two years ago - it's safe to say she made a bizarre topic of discussion in the school next day. This movie was awful! Hardly a romantic comedy - just a showcase of stripping! This movie hit her lower and one of the new characters of age staring down between a leg girl. <br /> <br /> Girl: You will not find God in there! Guy: Nah, but I think I found the sky. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />! AVOID!
