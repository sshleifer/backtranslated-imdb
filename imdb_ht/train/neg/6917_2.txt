Again the same story is familiar to a man (writer here) who sells his soul to the devil in order to praise his most desire in life: success. Scripting unfunctions (we should "go home and write better"), ridiculous lines in order to understand the message "strong" "Christmanish" (our only aspiration in life is to find love, respect and a good friendship) and a very long-standing trial at the end of which the Hopkins beat the Devil (Jennifer Love Hewitt has no sexy or evil at all) for all the bad things he has done incredible characters. By bad efforts from the actors (Baldwin also as a director, Cattrall in a "Sex and City" role again, Aykroyd and some funny lines in his limited role). P.S. Try also a film that is not so popular from Greece called "Alloimono Neous Stage", a brilliant adaptation of this myth (an old man giving his soul to the devil to get back his youth)
