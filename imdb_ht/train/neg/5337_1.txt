There are many negative reviews about "Staying away, Joe" in here I just can not stay quiet again and let this injustice happen. Here's one side you have not yet heard. <br /> In Elvis Presley's movies is fun guilty for a simple reason: their perfect movie for a better relaxation because I do not have to think when I watch them. That means I do not have to worry about missing a complex scheme because never is a proper scheme to begin with. I can just kick off my shoes, grab a beer, sit back, switch to my brain and enjoy all the wackiness in general and catchy easy-will rock you rolling tunes out of the grooviest decade of them all. > In my book "Stay away, Joe" definitely falls in "so bad it's good" -categorizing. Now, if you are like me and appreciate the "garbage value", this is the final 1960's camping experience. It's so bad that it's almost surrealist to watch and just when you think it can not possibly get any worse it surprises you in the most imaginative way. At the end you are so surprised by all the new levels of sort you just do not know whether to laugh or cry. In a Nutshell: I love it because it's fun dummy that was once a generation that actually made movies like this. I still give it 1 out of 10 though - once it hits below 100 it will become an instant classic movie movie.
