A movie that begins Salma Hayek and Colin Farrell, two respected and talented actors, sound like a great idea. An independent movie sounds even better. Studios will monitor less of the content allowing the actors and writers and creators more creativity. But then why is this movie is bland? Ask the dust. <br /> This movie is supposed to cut off the stick that we are deeply investing in the characters. No one gives a good back story, so we never know why the characters act as they do. <br /> <br /> Explanation of physical and emotional marks to let our imagination, if you still have one left at the end of this movie. <br /> I told a friend that I went to see this movie, and that I thought it was terrible. <br /> It's the question: "Not even Colin Farrell could save her?" My answer: "Not even Colin Farrell's ass can save her."
