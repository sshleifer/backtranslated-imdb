A phenomenal success of terrible. It's actually hilariously awful. <br /> The first ... Nicholas Cage must now have made it to the finals of the over-embedded category in his acting class. Put the new hair plug with a face that has raised many times her ears estimated to be tense touch in the back it exclarses not only a sick patient but creates a character "hero" that you have no interest to invest in. <br /> I do not know what it is with Neil Labute and female characters. It makes brunette from totally divorced and wrong ... and pays them no kage punch several of them directly in the face and call them all "b **** es" a few times too. I enjoyed LaBute's early film and a few of her plays ... but it's a strange passion. <br /> I would give this movie a 2 out of 10 just based on Ellen Burstyn's performance. Since he finally made his appearance (brave soldier in his scene with his wigs line clearly visible on his forehead) it looks like all hope can be lost. She deserves an Oscar right here and now tells her line with a straight face and when she appears to wear a mumu white and blue, white, and gold paintings on the Wicker Man you know that working with Scorcese and Friedkin really prepped her for that role dang well. <br /> This movie is so bad-headed and rogue that is to be seen to be believing. <br /> <br /> Include: Nicholas Cage runs away from a swarm of bees and then falls down a hill. <br /> <br /> Nicholas Cage robbed a biker and looking like Ms. Gulch from the Wizard of Oz riding around. <br /> <br /> Nicholas Cage Run around the island kicking down the door looking for the missing girl. <br /> <br /> Leelee Sobieski PLUMMETING from a once-promising acting career in a "brawl" and cage. <br /> <br /> Ellen Burstyn dancing around in a while while mummy. Nicholas Cage calls "Who burns her? Who burns her? Who burns her? Who burns her? Who burns her? Who burns her?" There is no reason. <br /> Nicholas Cage in a bear suit (I'm not kidding) running into the woods, taking in the suit (but leaving the feet to carry on) and then doing some karate moves in some bandits. <br /> And you have not lived until you've seen the final 15 minutes of the movie and its insulted epilogue who looked like she was shot yesterday at your cousin basement. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> There was actually a point in the movie where I stopped snickering wondering if perhaps this was not an elaborate send-up of "hysterical" films ... only to be reminded when Cage would call / call / whisper its dialogue that it really was take it seriously. <br /> I think this one is destined to be a cult movie all over again ... just because it's so obnoxious.
