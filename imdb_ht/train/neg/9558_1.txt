I thought this was an end to some kind, and it meant to be the original from 1983. But an end does not take the original plot and destroy it. <br /> I actually had this movie's absences, but I just wasted 95 minutes of life. No suspension - I actually feel clairvoyant, poor act, and so full of technical errors, so I as a computer geek just could not believe it. They tried to make it a mix between a generic film movie and 24 hours. But this is not even worthy of a low budget TV movie. <br /> <br /> Do not see this movie, it's a complete waste of time. Instead find the original. The theme is still valid. Do not leave much power in a car. And the act and plot is far more exit and compelling.
