I laughed all the way through this movie rotten. So incredible. A woman leaves her husband after many years of marriage, she has a breakdown in front of a real estate office. What's up? The office manager comes out and offers a job !!! Hilarious! Next thing you know about two women will be in it. Yes, they're lesbians! There is nothing true in this "life for women who has nothing better to do" movie. Clunky drugs like "I do not want to spend the rest of my life feeling like I had a chance to be happy and did not take it" does not help. There's a wealthy, far-off mother who does not agree with the relationship of her new daughter. A black sassy maid - incredible that in the year 2003, a movie came in with a black sassy maid. Hattie McDaniel must turn into his tomb. The woman has a husband who freaks out and wants guards at the snotty teenage kids. Sheesh! There is no cliche left barrier.
