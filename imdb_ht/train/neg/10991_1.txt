My brother is a hungry DVD collector. He took a look at the cover (two models on toilet) and added it to his collection. I stayed with her to watch what turned out to be likely to film the cheaper (I use this term injuries) I felt obliged to sit down. I courageously did not make eye contact with my brothers, quite sure he had to cursor the receipt of his touching point. The biggest name in the movie is Michael Clark Duncan who appears in one scene, which the "movie theater" decided to show each taking in (over four) throughout the movie. In fact, the movie is all very beautiful following this costume. The fact that the DVD has deleted feet was a hit. (I went to bed without looking at it, however). There is no surprise at all, I found this disc without its contents behind the TV a week later.
