The act, other inconvenient reviews, was remarkably well-done. Brad Pitt manages the role of an annoying, obnoxious Australian community. Other acting is fine. This story could be fixed, but somehow, it lacks - one never really understands or cares for the characters shown, and so the story, which could be quite dramatic, neglected to draw attention to this hearing. beautiful scenery and cinematography, a considerable dramatic story, important events that have shaped the world that we live in - but I could not, try as I might, involve myself in history that. As an unabashed Brad Pitt fan (I consider him one of the 5 top actors in his generation), I hope * likes * this cops - and yet he let me cold .. It might be a I do not tend The creative direction of film - direction, scriptwriting, production, correction - somehow, they lost me. It's a shame, because it could be wonderful. <br /> <br /> Good acting, dramatic story, very good shot - it should have been great. It was not. Probably worth seeing, just mind yourself up on it - but do not expect too much, and maybe you will not be as shame as I was. Mostly, he bored me.
