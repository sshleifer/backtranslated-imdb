Everyone just seems to raving about the subject, and not really noticing how the movie was made. The deaf, dumb guy is fine, the underdogs are underdogs - that's good, the cricket aspect is great, but the movie is the average overall. I think it might be much better than it is. The plot is too predictable for a movie that is not based on a real-life event. I'm sure the film could be more interesting. The songs are just stuffed in there, and I was forced to send literally the scenes where they showed the same thing at different angles. <br /> <br /> Good act, though. Look.
