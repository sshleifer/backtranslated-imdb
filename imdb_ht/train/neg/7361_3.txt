Mr Perlman provides an outstanding performance (as usual). Unfortunately, he was struggling with a script written above and some nonsensical pieces. <br /> <br /> Larsen is in fashion mode "Hard" mode with singlet and inflated muscles, I'm sure he could do better, but seems to satisfy grimace and snarl in his part. The beautiful Erika is something decorative (though completely dressed!) And shows some signs of "getting" the last act. <br /> <br /> SFX is mostly poor CGI and steals from other cinemas. <br /> <br /> Shooting are pitiful - worthy of the A-Team <br /> <br /> Not even worth seeing for Perlman - AVOID
