Do not spend your money or time on this pitiful piece of film in the cinematography film. When every third word is devoted to bad language and there is no real plot as well as having a cast of old actors who always give even with performance dates from the past and have not evolved into their careers, leaving a lot to be said. I was hoping something better from the award winning actor Benicio del Toro. The vision that others may have in Puertorricans will be irreparably distorted by garbage like Maldeamores. A bad word at a given time in a movie can be used to emphasize a point of view and may even be funny or sad depending on its context (see the Elsa Movie and Fred for example), but should not infuse the draw. The film is a total embarrassment and has absolutely nothing funny or even beautiful on this movie.
