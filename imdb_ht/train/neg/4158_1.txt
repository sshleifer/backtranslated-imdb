This is by far the worst movie I've ever seen !!!! <br /> I can honestly say I never saw a movie worse than this one !!! <br /> <br /> And I want never !!!! <br /> I'm a big fan of "B" horror movies. As you can imagine .... I was exposed to some of the worst that the movie industry has to offer. <br /> I have attracted this movie by its title. I mean c'mon ... what true fan of horror would not be intrigued by a title like "vampire vs zombies" ??? Images of the "undead" are fighting each other in the undeath dance in my head. I thought myself ... "this I had to see" !!!! <br /> <br /> Well .... sorry to say .... "this I wish I did not see" This word is very addicted to the least. There was no vampire fighting zombie. In fact, there is no scheme !!!! If you asked me what this movie is all about I could honestly tell you I have no idea !!! <br /> There was no scheme !!!! <br /> There was no history !!!! This movie absolutely makes no sense at all !!!! <br /> At the end of this trail ... I find myself feeling sorry for poor souls who have invested their money in this project so they have no business sense !!!
