There is no reason to view this movie. A good idea idea to handle very seriously. Among the movie everything changed and out there on nothing has made much sense. The reason for the killings is not clear. The act is terrible. Nick Stahl obviously needs a better director. It was excellent in the room, but here is terrible. Amber Benson from Buffy, has changed her character one day. Even those of us who enjoy sex and free violence will be disappointed. Though the film was 80 minutes, too short for a good movie (but too long for this one), no deleted scene of the DVD meant never being bothered to fill in the missing parts of the characters. /> <br /> Do not pass the time on this one.
