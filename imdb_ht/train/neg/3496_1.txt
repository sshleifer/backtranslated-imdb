I remember my parents do not understand Saturday evening when I was 15. They also did not understand Rock n Roll and many other things. Now that I approach the ages, I still remember, and get to know many of the things my kids love. But this is pathetic. I can not say I've seen any Sarah except for a few appearances here and there. They were reasonable. I do not see it as anything special. But this show is just too far below what I expect from him. The IMDb writing made it sound like potential. So just for that, I started to watch the first episode. I turned it halfway through. Anything else is better than that. The jokes are meant for a 5 year old featured on an assumed adult program. Well, Sarah, this adult unwittingly moves in your turn. I just cant believe that someone actually funded this comic commotion. Only good thing I can say is that sooooo many bad jokes are dropped here, saving other shows from such an embarrassment.
