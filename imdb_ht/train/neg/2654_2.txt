Although the casting for this movie was admirable, particularly Dianne Keaton and Tom Everett Scott, the quality of the writing was so poor that it would be impossible for any actor or director to make this movie worth watching. My wife and I decided that the reason we watched the movie was that it was like a train wreck, and it was almost impossible to turn. It may be that we "hoped" that the message would eventually make itself apparent, and that we could pick up some meaning in this effort. Unfortunately, that did not happen. <br /> Of course, the audience could "make sense" this story story, an intelligence credit to the human brain makes sense to the absurd. The writers, however, did not facilitate this natural need we seem to have to find meaning. <br /> It seemed that the participants were simply going through the motions of their respective crafts, and that any intrinsic passion for their characters or stories was either high or non-existent. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, made-for-TV movies seemed to devolve over the years. Whereas communicating a message to the audience may have been the main interest of the writers of the past, the current writer and producers seem condescending to their audiences, focusing primarily on manipulating us in "stay-tuned" in the advertising Perfomances that seem to be the cinemas of reason only as surrender, Dorothy did.
