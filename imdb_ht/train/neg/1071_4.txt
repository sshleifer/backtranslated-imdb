A very weak film, especially because of a poor story, but also poor act in the case of Robert Downey Jr., and irrational behavior by many of the characters. If you are a person who likes to change your mind and simply watch a movie for his creativity or acting criteria, then you may like this movie. Personally I can not do that with a drama and I found this too far to seek. <br /> <br /> I'm particularly annoyed when a primary character, that's supposed to be a smart person, always acts as a complete imbalance. In this movie, if the main character made the way someone would normally act in such situations, should not have any movie. <br /> <br /> The first act is very easy is when the main character, a successful lawyer named Magruder, played by Kenneth Branagh, is leaving a party and is happening on a girl, Mallory Doss played by Embeth Davidtz, who called that his car was stolen. They stand in a tropical rainstorm as he badgers him in accepting a ride home. <br /> It tells him about his unusual father who belongs to some kind of strange circles and crazy things. When they arrived at Shack Delambre in the worst part of town, they noticed that his car is in the driveway. Also, the light houses are on and some objects in the house have been broken. <br /> <br /> Things are very odd, it is strange (looking like a tramp, it strips off before it is completely naked ?? oh yes!). Also, strange to the father, the house is a collision - everything should be said to Magruder, "This hey is too weird for me, I'm from here! But not Magruder, he sleeps with him and then Motivated by her story and sex, take up the case of trying to have her dad committed .. She shouted set-up! <br /> <br /> Then they were the head - Attorney aircraft that it is, it happened late in the office to wear the same shirt it had on the night before, (a fact that all the women in the office notice.) Is it likely that a successful lawyer would act as a 16-year- former? Magruder has angered the police in some of his cases when he goes to the police claiming, with enough evidence, that the father is terrorizing them, the police ignored him .. I could believe beludging assistance. There is no help at all - not likely! <br /> It's just too easy.
