I would leave half of the film if I was not with those who loved it. The film is based on real incident, but it's on the top it did not feel real at all. I have some psychological background, hang out with a lot of psychotherapists, and they've known seriously crazy people, so it's not that I think people like this do not exist. But in the movie, the only characters that seemed to have been Augusten's father (Alec Baldwin) and Augusten's youth (Jack Kaedin). (Although Evan Rachel Wood was an intriguing rehabilitation - very sexy and a vicious sense of pleasure). There was a fun moment, but the overall tone of the film was murky, scary, and embarrassing. What a waste of an outstanding cast! As I watched them go in their turn, I just felt like I was watching a acting class. This was brought home during the credit, when a couple of people showed just sitting there, do not act, not talk. Those few moments were more fun than the previous 2 hours.
