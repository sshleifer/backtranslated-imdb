My God, this was the "Run, Lola, Run" adaptation of persuasion? It was terrible. Bad enough that the "senarist" (and I used the very wound theme) cut and glued dialogue from one character to another, often completely out of context and squeezed the story together: but Anne Elliott ran from place to place in pursuit Wentworth near the end of the piece was an abomination! Austen must be spinning in his grave. No respectable young woman would act in a fashion like atrocity. And the actress who played Mary? Terror. If you want to see an imposing version of this (otherwise) wonderful novel, get 1995 Roger Michell directs the version starting Amanda Roots (whose expression can speak merchants) and Ciaran Hinds. It is superb.
