A bloody maniac and tendency to cannibalistic violate a woman. He was shot by two policemen and then he was raised alive from the tomb because of some sort of ritual ceremony ceremony preformed by an evil heresy. The hunting of women continues by this zombie demon. The baby sacrificed to return from the tomb and wants to die maniac again, but only with the help of the police this will happen ... A hundred 65 minutes chaos ... Horny zombies, dolls-babies, S & M , policemen and tristed policemen, repenting mistakes that seek refuge in Jesus Christ and three screen texts at the end of the film explaining what finally happened to the policeman who survived (yes, we must know!) ... Two vacant moving vacations can not be save the situation. I saw the worst horror-flicks, but this one was very bad too. Recommended only for the dead-very-hard fans of the genre.
