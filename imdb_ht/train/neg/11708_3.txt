My body felt how this film was made. I watched her while I was working at home writing and answering the phone - I only watched her because I expected the part of "revenge" would be good. The useless say, the revenge and twist their scheme forced are not worth the emails during which they looked. In fact, I'm not even sure what happened at the end any more. The act was as bad as re-deducting scenarios about "FBI Files" that show - by far, the worst re-deductions (really only "arrest and trial" may be as bad as re-deductions). I do not even know that the leading man was in the third blind eye until I watched the movie up here on IMDb, but it's obvious why he did not have any movies since. I hope he is a good singer.
