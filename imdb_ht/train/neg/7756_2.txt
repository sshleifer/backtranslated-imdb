I remember watching RAID when it first came out and kept it again lately. Signal channels run worse, but not much. A cynical breakthrough in Jurassic Park, ATTACK replaces sabertooth cat for dinosaurs. And on loose, devour as much as possible as possible. The CGI is very bad, and the prosthetic cat closeups are mockingly. We get some gore, which helps a little. Wait until you see how the upset scientist started all this mess. Other than Robert Carradine, who has very little to do, the cast is unknown. Apparently it was shot in Fiji. Good work if you can find it. Remind me of all these low-budget monster STVs that were popular in the 80s and 90s.
