This movie has inexorable B quality throughout its performances, effects etc. As you think they spent 80% of the budgets on Connery. It's like watching some Star Commander Star after Star Wars (well apart from content). <br /> <br /> History can be described in one word: FLAT. And with my God I can not recall such a worthwhile wicked long ago long ago. We give neither a reason to be so cruel (an insecure damage, we are leading into thinking :) nor any real conviction or flair of his cruelty. <br /> <br /> If you're out for Connery rather go to Rent Forrester Hunting.
