Prom Night is about a girl named Donna (Brittany Snow) who is chased by a psycho killer trying to kill him in his ballroom night. And do not kill his family, friends, and enemies. <br /> <br /> Now, before I begin to let you say you were tired of the PG-13 movies that were not scared lately. Are you tired of stupid girl's dialogue 'Oh My God' and talk about girlish stuff. And you really tired of girls in relation and then cry. And the last thing you tired of American, Japanese, and Chinese rumors. That pretty much sum up Prom Night but I still do not do with the review. The only reason to see 'Prom Night' is to crack a laugh at the killers. If not, do not see Prom Night. You never saw the kill one heard screaming and you saw some blood on the wall. And the death paths are repeated like 24/7. So, not only are they scared, but it's obnoxious. Since I met the throw I thought I was ready to swing. Too many talk girls, too much talk guy, and many of my 'Oh gosh. It's our bullet. I understand it's fun, but seriously it's too much to ask them to focus. <br /> If I put Prom Night on the list of worst movies in 2008 without seeing the other films I would be the first one too. I will not be surprised if it gets released on DVD for cheap and quick. Do not seriously spend your money or when you act, badly hurt, and a 'night dead' when watching the movie. <br /> 1 star from 10. (PS If I could give the zero movie stars I would).
