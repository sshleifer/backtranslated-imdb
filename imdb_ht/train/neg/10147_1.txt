I usually do not comment anything (I read the opinions of others) ... but this one I _have_ comment ... I was convinced to watch this movie by world like action, F-117 and other things with technology, but not just a few minutes first and I change my mind ... lousy acting, script says with a great science fiction. <br /> It's one of the worst movies I've ever seen ... <br /> <br /> Simply ... do not bother ... <br /> <br /> And one more thing, Before any movie I usually check user reviews and rating on this site ... 3.7 points and I give this movie a try now, I ask WHO this movie rate does not give it more than 2 points ??? ???????
