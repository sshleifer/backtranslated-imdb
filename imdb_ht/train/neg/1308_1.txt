The thing that really gets me on this movie (that is, the thing about this movie that makes me physically ill) is that someone actually paid he did. There is absolutely no reason for the existence of this movie. It's not scary, it does not think provocative, it's not fun, it's not good. It is a sleeping tablet made of cyanide. The DVD can compare it to Blair Witch, Dead Dead, and a few other decent films, making the yellowish descent of the obvious yellow. It's nothing like any other movie ever made; it is far, far worse. Claims of a "very shocking endeavor" are the equivalent of one ton of shocking cast horses. Please never waste your time watching this piece of waste, because it can make you sterile. People who wrote this movie should wipe the list of Guild Writer's lists and never allow them to film anymore. Because if he thought this movie was worth doing, it probably does not have much of anything to offer in the future. Zero stars. May Grod have mercy on the soul of anyone unfortunate enough to see this. I'm going to vomit right now.
