"Hey everyone! I had an idea, we found this egg shaped in outer space so why do not we thaw it out and open it up?" "Yes, I know that the thing would be dumbest a scientist could do, and he would be filling with contaminated bacteria or unknown viruses on earth and can potentially wipe out the human race, but hey, I want to know what's in it ". "And nobody told NASA, they could take it away from us." "Wow this thing to give up vibes!" "Yes, really strong on contact for not touching it but it's okay to cut it open". "Hi there nice, check out my nips". (Later that day); "Do not open" !!!!! Uh oh, we must run all the way in the laboratory and say they are not opening it because we do not have phone or radio or intercom even if we have a gasillion worth in other equipment here. "I never saw these organic technologies!" "Yeah, ever took this stick and stabbed it." "I'm getting out of here, I do not care if I kill another 6 billion people on Earth, Nukkin nobody me!" "Look, it is the friendly aliens from the" deep "! They want us to come up with them." BEFORE
