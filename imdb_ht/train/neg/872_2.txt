First of all, I was expecting "Caged Heat" to be on the same line as "Ilsa, the Warden Warden". Boy, I was wrong! In no way is this movie 70s exploitation, "chix chains", or "women in prison". Sure, the sketch consists of a bunch of women in prison, wearing street clothes (quite funny), but nothing happens. <br /> There is no strong rivalry, no one tries to seduce the direct or physician in order to try and escape, and no prisoners make out. There are 2 showers showers, that I suspect is just recycle footage, but there is no fight broke out / no one seduces here - or anywhere for that matter! Aside from the lack of conspiracy, compelling, unsympathetic, and flat character, a couple of prisoners who managed to escape actually return to the prison in order to "free" their fellow prisoners !! !! PUH-LEASE, the film should just end up with the escalating sunsets ... as opposed to leaving this chaos continue! <br /> I feel scammed.
