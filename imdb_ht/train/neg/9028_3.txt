I just watch this movie and I had to say that with such a great and great talent this turkey just lays there !!! A friend lent me this movie and I watched with an open mind especially because he had such high praise for the story. <br /> Well, the movie started off with Kevin Costner as a retired pilot pilot ... why? Why did he make a fighter pilot? He supposedly be hired by Anthony Quinn's character to be his new pilot ... well, we never see Costner go near an airline for the rest of the movie! <br /> <br /> Costner runs in a Texan (James Gammon) selling a horse to a great Mexican businessman and Costner tags for a ride. Without knowing what happened, Gammon was beaten to death near and Costner drives him to the meeting, which happens to be with an associate of Quinn! But nothing comes out of it ... nada, zilcho! Why was Gammon's character? Why was the horse sold and associated in Quinn if nothing came out of it? <br /> <br /> Also, after leaving Costner for the dead, Madeline Stowe's character has become a whore, then he attacks one of Quinn's people who were paying for a spin ... sewing him with his own knife, and the next thing he had moved to a convent! No explanation of why he moved, or when he did! <br /> <br /> Too much talent wasted on such a weak and poor correction script !! I only watch this because a friend owns it and let me look it ... I'll throw it to him for the 2 hours I wasted in my life to watch the thing dried up!
