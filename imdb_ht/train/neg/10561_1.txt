I saw this movie in its own time period, when she had a baby from marriage not only losing your life but putting your baby back up as a batter. In those days of 'single mother' that may seem very far-fetched, but it was very true. And I'm not crazy about laughing at someone who stammering, either. Between these two problems I had difficulty finding this movie funny. At that time I did not know who ruled it or what a wonderful reputation it had. I did know that Betty Hutton was, and she just made me nervous because she was so frenetic. I liked "Bringing Baby", but I found this movie just embarrassing. I'm sure the punch in some church functions was probably clamp, but I was the one who needed a drink after watching this again. The idea of ​​the girl should be drunk in order to 'get married' and get pregnant just add to the misery. An entire city can turn you into such circumstances, so the outcome of this movie is really the funny part. Of course, to shoot me, I do not like "It's a nice life" either.
