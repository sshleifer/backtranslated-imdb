The weapon is perfectly stupid. I think the guys were dancing at the start of one of the movies Steven Segal was entertained by Mike Mock making his form of dance music at the start of this stupid movie. The plot is predictable, the battles were fair and Jeff acts as well as the couch heats with some sort of gun in one scene.
