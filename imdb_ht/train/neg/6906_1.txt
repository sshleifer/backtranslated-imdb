Not only does this film have a poor, bad, and awesome trace, it opens a whole new meaning of racism. In this film "White" chicks are slaves, "White" boy is the gangsters wana, and success (yes "White" businessmen rebelled candlelight toilets. <br /> I just wonder what would happen if I did the exact same film with the same same line line with my only script "It's dude, its good to finally see you've stopped dating these black chicks." Nobody seems to notice it, but watch this movie again and you will vomit in how they have shown new to Zealand "white boys." All of a sudden as white is the main cause of gang aggression, and whine comes out for a quick bang. Only the Samoan girls a heart, there is no such thing as a girl who does not slutty white. <br /> <br /> It disgusts me that they could not make this movie without giving the White Community a New Zealand one profile repelled. If you think i s and overgeneralizing, go watch this movie, and see what you do in the "white boys". Just because Samoan chooses to call our "white boy" in real life, does not mean its comic. If I said hey black boy I'll drop my teeth. <br /> <br /> Do not see this movie. Do not waste your money. Do not be racist.
