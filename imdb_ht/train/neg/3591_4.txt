First, let me say that I'm a great believer in Fanpro's stuff. I see it as a way to continue a good show long after it was canceled. Star Trek Tour and Star Wars Revelations are examples of decent effort. So I have a soft-spot for fanpro stuff which means I'll neglected things that I would normally slate badly. <br /> So, on ST: HF. Well, first of these good things. Enthusiasm is a great part of doing any credible show, and, for the most part, the crew of the various ships all seem to have a good time and their role. Next, the effects are not bad for a home-mixed effort, and nothing makes you really wince. History is not too bad either. There is nothing particularly innovative, but solid enough and at least there is continuous story. <br /> But it has a lot of flaws .. The first, although quite obviously rip-off trekking Star Trek, puts back, music and effects, I see no reason why they started to rip in virtually every other sci -the music notes ever made. Everything from Aliens to the Starship troupe is backwards orchestral head to one point or another. Similarly, many of the footage are from other movies, dedicated to CGI'd about making it look different. War ships, for example, though disguised, are obviously Star Destroyer from Star Wars. And the station is rather obviously fleet Ticonderoga station fights from container troupes. Similarly, sound effects from various Star Wars movies appear in space battles between fighters, such as hosting on foot. At one stage in either the first or second season, I think, you see two TIE fighters flying past during a fight, which hardly your suspension of incredulating any favor. <br /> <br /> Acting varies from the incredibly painful look to look. Everyone improves as the epic progress, though, but expects grimace of the screen a lot, especially in the early seasons. They also made some interesting choices. Let's just say that the reproduction of this show looks like ever put in "cake" and leave it in that. <br /> <br /> Effect of make-up are generally quite effective on the whole. But they should really be gracious to the death of people who decided to use cheap Ferengi and Cardassian masks for anything other than used background or "passing" shots. They are just beyond juries. Whenever I saw one of these (apart from trying not to laugh too much) I kept waiting for the unfortunate soul to put him pull out a gun and announced that "This is a stick-up!" In one scene a "Cardassian" actually talks also brings one of these. Not only do the lips move, but the mask does not even have an opening where the mouth should be. Someone needs to be jetted hard. Could not have taken a craft knife, for goodness' sake! There are also some good work done, but unintentionally funny make-up, as the look of Herman Munster looks like. <br /> <br /> The report, though coherent, is nothing new. Instead the script runs as a continuation of DS9, with the title chips from DS12 in various missions. The new enemy, the "Gray" is not very ominous and the plot line involving them is effectively a reworking of the Borg threads. This means Starfleet meets the Gray, Grays are powerful, Starfleet barely escapes with their lives, then in technology they begin to find ways to combat enemies etc. etc. All done before with the Borg. The debate is the dialogue. Star trek writer has long had the ability to write "technobabble insert here" in a script. It usually means an exhibit in the latest plan to combat the enemy using "quarreling phase discrimination" or "ISOLATIC charges" etc. In other words, nonsense tells you that they are on the case with a resolution at hand. > <br /> These words are just gibberish really. I have no problem with this, but where ST: HF makes a mess in it is where they contain real world comments in this concept. <br /> <br /> Tactical advice like "We need to reconstruct" good sound, but not when explained by the character trio that is already standing in a group. Similarly, when asked what the situation, a tactical hearing officer heard, "We're counting three trapped." Does he actually need to count them? C'mon! I hope the questioner asks him "Are you sure?" or "Can you double check". But I've ever liked the comments this is: <br /> <br /> Captain: "Can we establish two-way communication?" <br /> <br /> Comms officer: "No, we can only send and receive .." <br /> <br /> Well, thank you! ..... <br /> <br /> Having said all the above, the show improves as it goes along. Season 1 and 2 are very bad, 3 shows an improvement but 4 & 5 are where it starts to find noticeably better. Season 6 so far seems quite reasonable. <br /> I have a problem with the choices in the media to show them though. Quicktime sucks, quite frankly and sooner they move in divx / notice the best format. Some of us like to actually download our shows and watch them on the screen size decent and not peer into a small QT window on a computer monitor. Not only Quicktime does hard, but the 320x180 resolution shows them in by scale of all assets. In fact, it shows them very indisputable, as being a tenth-generation VHS tapes copy. The fewer could be to have included a hi-res downloadable option. <br /> In any way, the show has promises, and I am starting to love some of the characters. But this 40 episodes over, so I'm not sure this is so much about character development at all. <br /> But what you can say, it's free .... PS: From 28 votes, 19 people rated this show as a 9 or 10. Hmmmm ... were we watching the same show? Or are you all 19 children three years old?
