A very "pretty" beautiful old lady, desperate for the money to save her home and everything, grows "skin" in her home, smokes it with a few old-biddy friends and then sells li. This is the story for this low-key comedy, emphasizing the absurdity of the situation and some of the mood the mood brings. For many of the film, she works. The humor is not in the variety of laugh-out-loud but it keeps you entertained for an hour-and-a-half, so I guess it serves its purpose. <br /> There is funny moment and Brenda Blethyn is fun to look at the lead role. But the end really lost a "beautiful" movie and ensultingly-bad films that only the ultra-liberal films in the world would like to see happen. <br /> Like most people, I would prefer a happy ending, too, but it would not be all hot and soft for those flagrantly breaking the law. Also in here are typical (1) children from marriage but posing no problems and judging okay; (2) Clerics are described as morally weak people; and (3) even a stabbed doctor, too! <br /> Hello <br /> And review here Hollywood Blast? This is the exhibition of how a secular society has lowered the standards in the UK and Europe in general. Hey, people: at least have a trace of morality instead of nothing but a Leary Timothy "If it feels good, do it" message.
