He makes the actors in Hollyoaks look like the Royal Shakespeare Company. This film is thrown to cast into how terrifying it is. The DVD player's spin was not a good course of action. I want to get people responsible for this disaster and slap in the face. I will never get this time back. Do not ever. How is it possible to create such a banal, boring and soulless movie? I could not think of a course of action that would alleviate the teddy. Write the ten necessary lines are incredibly difficult for these pieces of shame in the movies. What more can you say than repeating how really terrible the act is. Please Avoid.
