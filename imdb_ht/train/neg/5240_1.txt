As soon as it hits a screen, it destroys all intelligent life forms around! But on behalf of its producers I must say it does not fall into any known movie category, it deserves a brand new denomination of its own! It's a "Newologic drama"! It saddens and depresses each new neuron inside a person's brain. <br /> It is one thing that is closest to one ever found in a stroke without actually suffering one. It drives you words, all your members go away, your mouths fall open and suddenly, and the most unusual symptoms of all are that you find yourself wanting to go blind and deaf. <br /> No little feat for such a sort of "movie". <br /> <br /> The only word that comes to my mind just ended my problem is outrage !!!!!!
