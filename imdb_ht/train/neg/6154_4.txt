Portly cute guy falls for a yummy blonde; She likes him too, but not for the reason you might think. Little-seen black comedian of writer Prof Proft features very good performance by Joe Alaskey and Donna Dixon, but does not make any lasting impact. It's just an effort quickie effort, eliminated by Norman Bates himself, Anthony Perkins. Even at level B, a bit-like "Food Raoul" is a better bet. There's definitely a fun set-up here; Unfortunately, the picture has nowhere to go through its second act. An interesting attempt, but it misfires. <br /> ** from ****
