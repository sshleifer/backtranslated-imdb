Wow, here it finally is; Action "movie" without action. In a very low budget environment (do not miss the flying hilarious flying fly by a few times) in a Seattle neighbor we find someone with no brain seeking to avenge his childhood. <br /> There is nothing even remarkable original or interesting about the scheme and actors' performance is only rivals in sort by their attempts to jump from other movies, especially "Matris" without having the money to do it right. Yes, we get to see some running on the walls and slow down shot-down drawings (45 circles approx) but these scenes are over as cool as the hardest attempt of the stupid man to make jokes about male incompetence now and then. <br /> <And yes, we also served a number of lead leads absolutely nowhere, as if the script had been thought-out of the already unseen cast while shooting scenes. <br /> <br /> Believe me, it is as bad as it can possibly get. In fact, it does not deserve to be taken seriously, but maybe I can do some of you do not rent it and save your money.
