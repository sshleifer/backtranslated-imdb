When I was holding a glimpse of the title I thought they were going to get another hip-supplement to try-hard, but actually I found "7eventy 5ive" to be a moderate beam, and almost throwback 80s after a tediously slow mid-section he picks up momentum for the half-hour final leading to it's exposure to minimizing climates and coply outright finishes. It will not have premiums for originality, because it's as systematic as you can find and steal its thunderies in the way of emotion (usual cheap jump crises), where (solitaire solitaire) and motivation from other films. The brilliant direction is not-the-pound and the material is well hacked and incorrectly achieves red eras in its elaborate sketch and flimsy script. Sometimes ridiculous but, however, I was primarily entertained due to her brutal and grisly violence pulpy towards some college annoying colleagues annoying by a psychotic assassin and a battle ax. Their performance was not bad in the form of a young spunky cast, however the characters they showed were not particularly catchy. A still presentable Rutger Hauer shows a supportive role as a grizzled detective. A slickly made, but a deep and forgettable addition to the fold.
