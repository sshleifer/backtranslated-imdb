It's not the best of actors' cinemas. The director focuses on stardom projected the actor rather than giving a good artist. His own hero, his family and his heartfelt fan can enjoy it.But definitely it's not worth the net audience. Sonic Battle sections are a total comedy. Moving the dance to the songs sequences are pathetic. The music is average. This movie was the biggest flop for the actor. The hype of the hype was created on the film, the movie failed miserably. Do not even think of watching this move even if you want to kill time. You can watch some designs instead. A good movie movie can not digest this crap for 2 1/2 hours.
