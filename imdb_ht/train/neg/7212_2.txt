Why every horrific director wants to imitate the "exorcist" is a complete account of me, as William Friedkin's "classic" is a very overrated movie and, in my opinion, is not all that's tense or shocking. But here is another clean rip-off, a Spanish once this time, which versus repeats the story of a young girl who is possessed by evil worse and turns against her own family. Paul Naschy (who I am to admit to choosing hot here) plays the honorable priest approached by John Gibson because his sister Leila's behavior changed dramatically since he met his new boyfriend. At first the priest does not believe it, but when John's body discovers and his braided neck, Leila's demonic behavior becomes more apparent ... "Exorcism" is not only very popular, it's also an objectionable boring film! Here Naschy and director Juan Bosch had an open opportunity to make a thematic religious themed full of trauma and gore, and yet the result is a sleeping drama and overall blood flow that will almost put you in sleep! The last few minutes have some atmospheric moments, albeit very stupid, and there's quite a lot of stylishly stylish stripping girls and sleaze. The sheer lack of budget is not realistic since Paul Naschy has already proven before he has enough imagination to make up for a lack of money. This is just a terrible movie, the end of history. Other European "Excorcist" rip-offs are the "Antichrist" and "Beyond the Door" and are sourced as well!
