I really must have kept a different film in the rest of the commentators on this site because of a movie screening at night either the audience was so mortified by the dialog (which I did not kidding) half walked out. Shot as if the cinema thought he approached some new territory territory by presenting a coming-of-age homosexual history, the film uses David Lynch to inspire visuals and Fassbinder to inspire act. The performances of this movie are so dull and bored that I figured one of the actors went on to spend from how unenspirated they seemed to be by the script. What's worse is that of color as an episode of Visa Miami. I do not know who this director thinks he is; Maybe it has the surreal of the surreal like Bunuel, Jordowsky, etc. But the problem is that all of the directors mentioned before show a level of sensitivity to readiness that is sorely lacking here. I could understand the meaning of this movie about ten years ago, but when we had masterpieces like Poor Education, mysterious skin and show me love why harassed with this cinematic torture? There is nothing new to be seen here.
