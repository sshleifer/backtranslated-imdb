I'm a great fan of Troma but I can not figure out why they bought this movie right, so boring I felt like I was watching for 3 hours. Someone on the plot summarized saying "but what Satan does not know he was stuck with tourism tackled" Well they did not seem to disturb him in the movie, just me. on this movie is the actor who plays Satan, I love the bad movie but he's just boring.
