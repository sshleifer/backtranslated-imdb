Young and attractive Japanese people are getting on the wrong side of some curse again, this time it involves mobile phones. Many people die until the sound of the trumpet is all over, so essentially if you've seen more than 2 latest Japanese horror films you can trace this movie in the dark with your hands tied. Attraction here is the fact that Takashi Miike is behind the camera. So far I was more impressed with his key work key as the City of Lost Souls, however as One Call Call plodded together I was desirous of his more renowned envelope in Dead or Alive or the style too pseudo-Cronenberg in Audition . Although a lot of his films have been essentially empty, at least they have merits as such, or at least something to keep your attention like Tadanobu Asano prancing over in brightly imitated Johnny Depp costume. None of the one in one Missed Call; It's just the little credit: the act is bland and average, there is plenty (nothing, at all honesty) in the path of crisis or suspense, and in which it's just outright boring. <br /> However, there are times when glaciers like the Miike in humor jump into the commercialization of the affair; Most notably and examples of the intention of television show on filming the peril of one of the cursed subjects, and the TV programmer more concerned about her evaluation than the girls' lives. But next to this there is nothing to suggest it is Miike behind the camera; Most of the usual visual flair it disappeared without a track (and its famous ones), although it is more likely that it just did not have any enthusiasm for the project, and I can understand why. One Call is not a bad thing. It's just frustratingly averaging. <br /> <br /> Miike obviously liked to direct. With its huge annual output it's obvious will not be 100% concerned about all his projects. But even with that in mind, One Missed Call felt like it was just paying the bills.
