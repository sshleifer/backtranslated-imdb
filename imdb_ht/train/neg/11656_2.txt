Scary movie 2 was a serious disappointment. Simply referenced movies, such as Mission Impossible 2, do not lead to comedy. The film opens well enough with a comic white rapping scene with an excellent use of James Woods's James Woods. The film plummets out there unfortunately. The act is terrible. Tori Spelling looks like acts completely out of place. The film looks hacked and is amazingly slow to rhythm. Some of the longest gags in this rhythm snail film, involving joints and a movie already mentioned Tom Cruise, are funny to anyone in my theater. The film, fortunately, comes screeching at a stop of 83 minutes to a shockingly ending end. (I say shocking because the finish does not even try to end up with humor) I do not know what else to say except that a sloppy sequel is running to make Miramax some more cash back on adolescent mute. In general, a very bad movie does.
