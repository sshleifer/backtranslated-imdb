A trio of low-life criminal, led by Matt Dillon, a late-night thief botch. They run quickly and quickly with the police who just happened to be in hot pursuit of a terrorist. Of course, the burglary gang burglary police for terrorism, the real terrorist gets far away, and the thieves are forced to take shelter in a small plunge into a bar, taking hostages, ignoring why the police are so intent on catching them. And guess which other person chose the bar as a temple for the night? <br /> <br /> <br /> Incredible? Absolutely. And he went down from the mountain. Spacey did get a good bit of talent acting; Matt Dillon, Faye Dunn, Gary Sinise, Viggo Mortensen, and M. Emmett Walsh, but they are all wasting. Mostly because after all the characters get stuck in the bar, all they do for the rest of the movie will be discussed. Endless and haphazard. Long before the film's conclusion you stopped giving a curse about what's going on in them.
