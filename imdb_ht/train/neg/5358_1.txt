It is obvious that all the good reviews are posted for this film so far from the insider who has either participated with the movie or who knows someone who knows someone and has so seen multiple cuts. Well, I do not know anyone involved, and I've seen the final cut, and it's pure waste. The only thing he has to go for is ambition and several out of the legendary horror (none on the screen for so much time). It is as if the filmmakers made this movie a weekend during a horror convention and received actors such as Tony Todd, Tom Savini, David Hess and Michael Berryman movie scenes during their broken coffee. This is an ultra-cheap, shot-on-video Wannabe X-Files and awful acting out of a cast in non-actors with more mullets than is acceptable in the 21st Century. There are little or no action; it's all explanatory dialogue that attempts to explain a complicated plot of crap. FX computer FX is a joke but not enough of them or enough action to make this movie enjoyable in a way MST3K. After approximately 8 straight lines of nothing but talk, you'll find yourself reaching for the fast-forward button ... and not let go. Absolutely worthless.
