Judging from this film and the STRONG man, made the same year, I would not put Harry Langdon at the top of the list of great silent screen comedy. There simply is not enough. Maybe she was on her way to developing her style but sabotaging herself by taking her first big success too seriously. In any event, all its tricks are reminiscent of the biggest comic men, but it lacks the acrobatic skills of Keaton and the enthusiastic intelligence of Lloyd. He also affects his own person by dressing up and walking like Chaplin's tramp character. Its marks are innocent children, shyness in approaches and a downwardly-reacted tendency of calamity by looking to embarrass, scratching his eyes or touching his hook mouth with the tip of his finger. The comedy of Langdon's film comes from fate sending various obstacles in his path that he tries to overcome in wimpy or naive way or with a minimum of physics, such as throwing stones into a tornado approaching to drive it away, propping up a Building collapses with a large two-by-four or dodging boulders by raising a leg so that they roll down under him. In this story, about the son of a eyeshadow that entered a race cross-country market published a rival company's rival, he managed to win in absolute luck. There is nothing here that has not done far better than the Big Three.
