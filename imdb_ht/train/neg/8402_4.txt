The three stooges of a west feature of comedy-music feature? Perhaps "Rockin" in the Rockies "was meant to combine Stooges short comedy with the western music, in a morning; if so, this was a great way to break a Saturday afternoon. Jay Kirby (as Rusty) is a beautiful young hero; and, Mary Beth Hughes (like Blonde Jen) and Gladys Blake (as the brunette Betty) are beautiful women.Hoosier Hotshots are a harmonious group; Songs are quite tuneful; however, this is the 1940s, by the 1950s, so the film is not exactly "rock". There are a few laughs, but the Stooges brand of humor is much more subtle than the usual horse. *** Rockin 'of the Rockies (4/17/45) Vernon Keays ~ Moe Howard, Larry Fine, Curly Howard, Mari Beth Hughes
