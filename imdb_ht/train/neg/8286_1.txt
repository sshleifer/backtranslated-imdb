- = have to languish from both original and film versions = - <br /> I'm a big fan of Notre Dame de Paris music, I am reading this summer book and I watch movies today, from the beginning I was Hope to watch a good movie especially when I saw 6.3 IMDb point.first scenes were good, but I actually waited for theater performances directly in books, but it was normal but when Esmeralda kissed my gringoire I felt something wrong. They do not even kiss in books, even in musical .. <br /> <br /> and there was great space why Esmeralda being judged by magic, in the book he teaches his goats how to answer the clock clock or write the word "phoebus" .. wait a phoebus was there? In this film it is some junk soldiers there is nothing more, the creators made Quasimodo's love to show them and even cancel Frollo's love .. but Notre Dame was frollo. Think about her struggles between love of God and the human love of our films can not find anything like that all we have is, some wicked people who are really angry and murder people with clashes and thoughts of her .. and not to mention phoebus, do not mention the love of frol, not to mention jehan (brother frollo) not to mention Mom Esmeralda (maybe it is ok, the storyline would have to cut much) even not to mention the real story .. (another PS: frollo did not a day opus or some of her cult members of interest and alchemy she tries to make gold .. she was stuck in science and religion) <br /> <br /> finally does not watch this movie, it's some kind of edited director director , and if you've watched it before reading the book, God has mercy on you .. you have to read books immediately .. <br /> This movie is worse than the hump of the Notre Dame II animated film, passing you time and watch the Notre Dame de Paris music .. enough to say.
