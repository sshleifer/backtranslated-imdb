If you are looking to be either openly or amused or both, you'll probably have to look elsewhere. LMOTP really does not even think much provoked beyond rehashing the usual funny clues. At the end of the second episode I felt a little embarrassed that I actually sat in the perfect mess. <br /> <br /> Beyond the gimmicky thin cover that attracts all the first attention to her in the first place it's just another lame, harmless and anti-septic attempt at Book and Entertainment by the CBC Typically excelling of products. And once "ZOMG MUSLIMES IN ROLAL CANADA ROFLMAO !!" Hats hurry out, the show is likely to follow in the rain drain because it's so deep when judged on its merits alone. Unless you're obsessed with Muslim culture in the west and / or are readily embedded by the most minute idiosyncrasies on the subject I really do not see how LMOTP is enjoyable beyond meeting the curiosity that looms out of the hype. Other shows best addressing the problem of culture / ethnic dichotomy in western multi-ethnic society. LMOTP will never be ranked among them in entertainment or insight.
