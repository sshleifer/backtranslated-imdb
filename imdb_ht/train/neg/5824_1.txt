I thought it would at least have nice aesthetics. It was slow, pretentious, and boring. I almost fell asleep. There are some decent songs, but there's a song at the end that's just some guys calling out "Yaowwww!" while someone tapes randomly onto a wooden object. That said, there are some pretty songs, but it's not worth seeing movie hte on. Go on iTunes (they have the album), preview it, and select the right ones. <br /> Half the movie is some guy doing tea. Well, this is a slight exaggeration. But you will see what I mean if you see it. What they said: do not see it!
