I'm not damaging anything when I inform you that you get to see a woman having sex with a goat in this movie. If this is your stuff, then your movie has come. <br /> A woman and her husband go to see her sister's sister in the family's castle in the woods. His sister is a creepy woman to say the least, and she seems to have interest that goes beyond family love. On the side of a group of characters sailors show up and begins to adopt all kinds of pagan rituals. <br /> <br /> The draw is very weak and the characters are very mute. The woman sticks around even after her husband begins to turn into a jerk and hanging out with the other nations, even going to have sex with her. On the exploitation side of these things, there are plenty of meat bared with a couple of stanza jacks, but nothing has been better elsewhere. Oh, and the aforementioned unknown sex scene. <br /> <br /> Most viewers will not make it to the end. Exploitation fans will ride it out, but they will leave wanting more. <br /> 4/10
