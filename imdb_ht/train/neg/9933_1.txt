It was hard to sit in this terrible heresy adaptation of Sherlock Holmes. Apparently Matthew Frewer has been cast because he is tall and thin. Critical-like figures made for a good zombie at the Dead Renewal Dawn, but as Sherlock Holmes looks like a scarecrow. Not only Frewer has a market missing markets that are hard to look, but it looks uncomfortable at the Holmes stereotypical racks that it will bring. Not only that, but while the dress is gray the pits apparently could not find a matching cap. So his cap is black and it looks bright as if it were made of polyester. Whatever the cap was made, it looked very new and artificial. Jeremy Brett occasionally put those traditional outfits, but Brett did not have to dress-up like Sherlock Holmes in order to watch the party. Frewer on the other hand is hurt to look. Even in the full outfit "Holmes", it does not bring himself like Sherlock Holmes. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />! To say that Frewer is overacting is an understatement. After finishing each sentence with some kind of hum naz, it then sneers as if there were some very British types. When I started watching this I thought it could be a comedy featuring the Wishbone Jack Russell Terrier. I thought Frewer had been cast as some kind of foil for Wishbone. But, sadly, there are no dogs in this movie except for Frewer. Wishbone would have made this movie much better. <br /> Not only Frewer's version of Sherlock Holmes has ever stopped speaking (in which attracted British artificial bronze in nose), but it is very much in friendly and kind. Frewer is still smiling at the witnesses he speaks, and he is so polite and courteous that he might teach at a Charm School instead of being a Sleuth. Perhaps since this is a Hallmark Channel production, they are trying to make a child's version of Sherlock Holmes (Wishbone was the best of that, too) that was limelight and gentle. Whatever point in the Frewer's interpretation of Sherlock Holmes, it is flatter than a pancake, and the easiest version of Sherlock Holmes that I've ever seen (including the worst before, by Charlton Heston). , the sound of this movie is terrible. He reminds me of a typical episode of Barnaby Jones or Murder It Wrote or Diagnosis Murder. All suspects have been suspicious and have been blocked from the victims before they died. Holmes and Watson are explaining each one of them with each other during the whole movie. Even on killings he wrote less exposure. <br /> This Sherlock Holmes does not even compare very well to Jim Rockford at the Rockford records and is miles below Columbo. The terrible dialogue is probably the fault of the writer. It is obvious that people who have written this script have very little familiarity with Sherlock Holmes, especially the BBC version with Jeremy Brett. This film has all the atmosphere of a Little House episode on the prairie. The fact that the actors seem to be smirking when they enunciate their lines of false accents do not help. Only the brightest spell is Ken Walsh who plays Dr. Watson and some dignity. Walsh does not cross it with Frewer, and when it is often interviewed witnesses, his attitudes, style of conversation are more natural and credible. Unfortunately, the rest of the cast is unprofessional, and the visual clues are given by blatant and faced with each other (to be suspicious) is something that I have not seen in any modern movie.
