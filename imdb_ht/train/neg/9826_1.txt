I guess this would be a great movie for a true believer in Christian organized Christian, but for anyone with an open mind that believes in free will, rational thinking, the separation of Church & State and GOOD Science Fiction it is a joke terrible! <br /> There are some well-known actors who were either seriously in need of work or had a need to share their personal beliefs with the rest of our Heathens. <br /> I was entertained by this film in the same way I was entertained by "Reefer Madness." This film has tried to teach drug education by making tactical scares the same way that film tries to teach the "Christian" principle and the threat of hell and misery for the good people who do not share the interpretation of our world. /> It made me courage and laugh and at the same time scared me to realize how many people actually believe that our society should return to the good old days of the 19th century!
