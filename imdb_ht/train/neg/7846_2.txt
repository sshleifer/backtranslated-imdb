You know, I went to see "the hills have eyes 2" wanting to love it. I really enjoyed the original, and the remake was fairly fun. They obviously had more money to throw around that Wes Craven made about the second special effects around. Even if I still prefer the original film, the notion was done well, and it was kind of a pleasure for me. Bloody, intense, and great effects. In short, a great popcorn movie for any horror fans. <br /> <br /> Which brings us to the "hills have eyes 2". Man, Where am I starting? The plot, or lack of one, is thin paper. We are not exactly breaking new ground here. The military has decided to control the area, and all these people turn up missing. So, what do we do now? Let the National Guard investigate. In true Hollywood mode we need to be the dumbest, and the worst soldiers ever see. Yes, I've never seen before. To make a long story short, you have to kill the soldiers in the moron one soldiers at a time of graphic arts. Again special effects by Nikotero are great, but the kill does not matter how graphic becomes boring, and predictable. Honestly it seemed to me that this movie made just grab a quick buck. It was bloody, and graphics, but I found it predictable, boring, and not afraid at all. For me it would have been nice if this movie has one original thought.Wes Craven and her son share their written assignments, and has participated with many of my favorite movies, but sadly is not one of them.
