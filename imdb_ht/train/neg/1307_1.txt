This was really a very bad movie. I'm a big fan of Italian movie, Argento, Mario ban, Fulci and yes, even our good friend here Lamberto sometimes comes out with a good one. I found the first two 'movie demons' to be very fun - they were so bad they were big, but this one is just so bad that it is really, really bad. It is intensely boring, the story never goes anywhere and I hated the characters - the husband slapping husbands and cry-baby babies at the *** wife drove me crazy, had nowhere near enough in history is devoted to the Ogre who was probably the best actor of the whole movie. I turned it over three quarters of the way because I was very, very upset! Do not bother.
