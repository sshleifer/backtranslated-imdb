It's as if you took the overall terms of the Usual and Fightclub Suspic, taking all the styles and classes and mixing them with a lot of newest pretensions "I'm intellectual for my movie to be hard to make sense of" garbage films Maker, crushed in a few extra genres for good measurements, cut in the end, there you have revolver. <br /> Yes, I thought about it for a little after watching, and yes it was kind of meaningful, but that did not stop it from garbage. <br /> Waste of money. Waste in time. <br /> The up as the worst movie I've ever seen, and not even a movie movie bad movie gets it a little bit.
