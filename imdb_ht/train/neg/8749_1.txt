A horrible movie as everyone said. What made me laugh was the appearance of came by Scott McNealy, giving a prize in one of the programmers murdered in front of a wall of SUN logo. McNealy is CEO of SUN Microsystem, a company that practically defines itself by hating it in Microsoft. They were instrumental in complaining against Microsoft antitrust. So, were they funny enough to think this bad movie would add fuel to that fire? There is no public record I see in SUN's participation, but clearly the makers of this movie know Scott McNealy. An interesting mystery.
