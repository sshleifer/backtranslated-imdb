I do not like to return Frosty with this one. Both of the films are absurd and bad characters written with bad voice. The voices could make Frosty's return but was worse than this because of the unlikely snowman they had drawn. Frosty's winterwonder country was great and so was the original cheerful drama. The only good thing about this movie was the Frosty Snowman looked like in the classic 60s and a funny line like when they talked about things that are not real and then frosty walk through the colorful window, whistling it did, but everything else was badly written and badly animated and I barely traced. I saw the DVD coverage in the library about 2 or 3 years ago with the art look bad so I did not pick it up this year because the pictures on the back looked a little touch but I played this movie . It was a character complimenting art characters just like the DVD and it was just awful about what's going on. I watch this at night and find it dull that I fall asleep on the whole thing (Wait I always do that when I look at something while I go to sleep) but this movie was in general boring <br / > Overall Rating: Class -C <br /> <br /> This is like another special holiday rip-off holiday in the frosty returns with this one. This one is the 4th end seriously as Home alone 4 well I thought that film was OK but home alone 3 was great. But it's like a bad home alone 3 and 4 people hate like this. My sister did not look at her so much because when she came into my room to look for 2 minutes and a half of her, she walked away like "I hate the animation!" I agree with it just like the 3rd Frosty One's return. Plenn terib!
