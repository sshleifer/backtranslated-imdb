I was disappointed. The movie was a bit predictable and did not live up to the hype plastered all over the box. Having said that, the characters were well developed, the windego myth used in a unique site and the home was pretty spooky but it just missed for me. I was waiting for big AHHHHH or BOO! But he never came. <br /> <br /> In addition the film was plagiarized on poor cheeses in special poor effects. So, the very show of a bad thing and not using atmosphere and imagination imagery to create the horror and suspense. Try cinemas like 9 or Cube sessions if you are looking for a low budget budget but are getting pregnant.
