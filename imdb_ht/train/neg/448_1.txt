What I hate about this show is how badly driving is being written. These women have no self respect or dignity. The whole plot is to send them to men. Amanda Bynes' talent is completely wasted. She was brilliant about "all that" and her own show. Why would she write to Jenny Garth as stupid, airhead, desperate, boy chasing, old-maid wannabes "is beyond me. <br /> <br /> The webs and dialogue remind me of" simpsons "Homer says when her cartoon character Poochie is not on screen," Everyone should ask, where's Poochie? "All these centers talk about shining on some guys, and then complaining in some guys sometimes they change it up, and the guy instead, then they come back together or break up to the end 2 women either either drug, stupid, or gender. The only thing I can think of is " absorb ".
