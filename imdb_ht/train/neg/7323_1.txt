Well ....... in contrast to other comments already written I said that only good things about this movie are the fact that one guy in it looked a bit like Jason Donavon who reminds me of my youth. I have no idea how to win any premiums, and although I'm sure a great deal of effort goes into making it it's all fruitless as the final result is one that screams in the 90's soap opera. The plot was non-existent, the cinematography was hopeless and the act was on par with a performance level. It was unfortunately long and sub-plots were incredibly unrealistic ... for example .... if your best friend is lying with your ex-companion in 6 years after only 2 weeks of being broken you would not all stay the good of friends. It was all fantasy. It's all! Oh yeah, and the 90-year-old home / core core core was idea numbing!
