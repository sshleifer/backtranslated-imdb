This is, without a doubt, the most offensive "chick flick movie" I've seen in years, if not all the time. Writing and characterization are so riddled with the movie stereotypes of verges on parody. Before walking out of the theater an hour and five minutes of this disaster, we've been subjected to these terms: a baby will solve all your problems, "character types" are messy, and musicians can not be good mothers unless they send their dreams for a more conventional life. What a waste of a talent throw & some great-looking sets & costumes. When Natasha Richardson told Toni Collette that unless she lived a more mainstream life, she would end up - shudder - "alone!", I felt unpleasant. I can not believe that this film made it to the theater release. It sort of one ticket is expected from the "women" cable channels that I still pass right by channel-surfing. I'm female and over 35, so I should be part of this film audience target, but boy, doing "Evening" misses its target.
