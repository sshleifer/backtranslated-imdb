Why is a woman unable to be a strong character in a sleeping movie with the leading man? The campaign manager dreamed of this movie by Tom Sellick in the White House. It's all it can think about. So why on earth should he have an affair with him? She added nothing to the plot and served only in successful seduction women. The only value in which tidbit was nice to "all of us died with your husband" scene. <br /> <br /> Also, could not those who made this movie have looked at national conventions being paralyzed? Prior to the two major political conventions, only served to emphasize the total ignorance of nomination and selection processes.
