There was not one single redemption factor in this film. The girlfriend and I both love acting movies. Especially battle scenes (Bloodsport and Kickboxer were awesome), but this movie was not fun. Five minutes of action followed twenty minutes in talking to "angry" facial expressions. The main hero is a troubled character who saw battles and thus forced to look seriously constructed at all times. The army was disturbing his bowel movements on top of his fighting techniques. The music is not good either. They fight in the rap and hip-hop style on the streets, 'cause these guys are thugs. The rest of the soundtrack is usually the background of low-budget drama. <br /> <br /> All about this movie is classic-style B. The actors deliver the lines as if they are in the four rays and their headlines should be set on fire and left burning into some Hollywood rotten alley. The movie is called "Honor," but there was no honor in making this movie. It was simply a waste of money, and wisely costs are something I consider to be honorable. <br /> Go see Felon instead. The battle scene and situations are more real.
