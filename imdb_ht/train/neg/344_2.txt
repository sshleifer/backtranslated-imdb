Let me really clear about this movie. I did not watch this movie because of the draw, I looked at her for the saucy sex scenes. That said, this movie is so terrible to my damn damn flip between best happiness in seeing a body of God in Traci (Mandy Schaffer) and cringing my eyeballs out for the disaster of a plot. <br /> <br /> Spoiler Alert The first stage of the movie has already made me cringing .. you see a woman painting something by the Lakeside, the most beautiful and serene, then a beautiful girl approach and ask if she could paint around her. When they both finished, they showed each other what they were doing ... and the woman painted a vineyard when it made the influence of the LAKE. What type of screwball director would make this kind of error ?? And in another scene, Traci came to kill the teacher lover by breaking her with the veil, and then she swim away, and none of the city police suspected her once. I mean HELLOOOOO? DO NOT MAKE A GLOVE? His Fingertips are all about GOD WOMEN BOAT !! And it gets worse, every time Mandy is around, there is "erased" the sound effect that sounds like a cat to fit scissors. It is also a pity of the Rosanna Arquette is in this film. I feel really sorry to have stars in this super low-budget low-budget porn brainer. Even goes for JÃ¼rgen Prochnow, who also has the misery of stars in this movie. All in all, 2/10.
