I gave this 4 star because it has a lot of many interesting themes here already mentioned. Out of domestic violence, in sexuality and much of the tobacco therein. Outside of the gor I really would not call this much horror as I would science fiction. <br /> It's weak, depressing and hopeless. While I do not mind a finish less than, I'm really tired of the "people sucking" the stereotype that is central to each movie. I know you can not get a liberal art degree today without falling off from the self-hatred change as a member of the human race, but how to 'bout as a writer / director we pretend to be different than all Others in the pack and notice that the ALIENS kill people in the races is wrong! Now, if you are reading this and believe that humanity deserves to die, just go out, get a lake and swim 'your arms are tired. This way you will not be around the next movie direct or write the next book tell me I deserve to die for being alive. It's funny, not thinking, and boring.
