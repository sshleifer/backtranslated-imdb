Great throw. Great acting. Predict line story for the first half <br /> <br /> hour or so. I really wanted to know what was going on <br /> to reach each of these unredeeming characters, and how they <br /> seemingly different lives would become tied. But when <br /> <br /> the writers took the glue to start connecting players, <br /> <br /> mistakes use super glue and lead the movie to a place ... for the last two hours. I kept thinking she would get better, but only <br /> <br /> became worse. Do not believe the reviews. This is a waste of time. <br /> <br /> Think about it - Tom Cruise did ugly - why? Gorgeous <br /> <br /> Hotty the bartender puts braces - why? I know he did with the plot <br />, but without them, at least there would be one <br /> <br /> attracted to cast members to remember.
