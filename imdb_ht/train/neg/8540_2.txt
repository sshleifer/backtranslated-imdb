As someone mentioned, it starts with a rare prologue for a blonde girl killing a cat. Then the main story: a photographer (Gaffari) and a writer (Shepard) meet by chance and take a trip to the hills. The first they spend overnight in a hotel where the owner of a little deaf gets rid of, and raises the irritation of the audience, by Gaffari. Once in the hills they seek shelters again and are invited by an old lady to look like he's very welcome to stranger (Hansel and Gretel, anyone?) What happens next I'll leave for the bold viewer to sort out because I'm most assuredly unable. Now I love Eurohorror, and this would be best if only Artigot (extract ET director) has made some attempts at logical history to say. The series (pirene?) Makes an excellent and intriguing location for mysterious and occult events. The green peaks can easily darken Supernatural forces and those who order them. The photography is beautiful. Just want everything to make sense. You can view this movie at achiv.org.
