The main problem with "Power" is that it features ways that can be freeware characters and subplots that add absolutely nothing to the movie too. It gets boring after a while, sitting around waiting in the non-connected scene to find something that drives the movie forward. You can probably spend it all in as character development, but all of them are recycled from earlier stage of the movie, or are just simply flat and refreshing. Lumet never gives enough time to let any of the cast to support flowers. It should cut some of the characters (hackman, the wife) and focus harder on others (Billings). It could be a great, hard political thriller instead of a disguised disruption that lost any message to a sea of ​​bad writing and act, a fact that surprised me to consider the cast. Even Gene Hackman performance was not up to par. Denzel Washington is the only real actor to score here. Manage and others have all done better performances elsewhere. Sidney Lumet needs to go back to one fierce show that he performed in the Seventies (ie, Serpico) and stopped trying to recapture his success with "12 Men Angry" and "Safe Safe" . He has not worked yet Sidney, and most likely never will. leave the dramas together with Altman. <br /> <br /> 3/10 <br /> <br /> * / * * * *
