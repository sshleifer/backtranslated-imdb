=== Minor deflators === <br /> <br /> I, like many others, is a big fan of Bruckheimer Jerry. So when I saw all the beautiful posters hanging out, and the trailer came by before MI: 2, the expectations are rising. A Jerry Bruckheimer production. Great cars. Nic Cage and Fresh from an Oscar - Angelina Jolie. What could possibly go wrong? Many. <br /> <br /> The script is neither comical (which it tries to really be hard to be) neither exciting. You put in a black man who is still doing jokes on his head and Wooh-haa! did you have comedy? I do not think so. Excitement is totally out of the picture. First of all (and this is probably said many times) there is no sympathetic character so that suicidal concern? If you can buy the house that a psychic will kill Nik's brother unless he steals 50 cars in 4 days, the next thing you know is that Kip (the brother) will walk with Nic in the streets again. Is this excitement? Think about it. Then comes the best bit of romance between Nic and Angelina. It actually seems bored to have pronounced all these nonsense lines Nic. 'Do you have a girlfriend?' 'Do you see anybody?' 'What's wrong?' etc. <br /> Then there is one bright sparkle of hope left: car chases. They're disappointing to say at least, because the trailer made it look like it was full of them, and there is one. A very long, keeping in motion irritating cameras. I really had problems following the action. <br /> So is it an action movie? a thriller? a romantic comedy? - There is no need to decide, just avoid this horrible mess. I'll give 3 out of 10 stars, and I feel like I was generous.
