You can tell yourself, "Don Johnson as Elvis? Is this work? Is it possible? Looks like a horrible choice for me, but maybe I should have an open mind.Perhaps I'll be surprised.Maybe it can pull it cut. "<br /> <br /> Don Johnson is not a bad actor. But it's a terrible Elvis. It's too short, too weak-voice, too sharply featured ... well you've already imagined how bad it should be. Add to that a hokey black wig and heavy-handed eye-liner and mascara and it's a great mess nasty embarrassment. <br /> <br /> The best I can say is that since Johnson's act is decent and since her imitation so far, after a while you do not even think of him like Elvis again. You see it as some other crazy pop star instead. Then, at this level, the movie gets to look. Stephanie Zimbalist also is not ideally disposed as the beautiful queen, Linda Thompson beauty. But it is attractive to its own right and play the party with honesty, the elegance and intelligence we have come to expect in all its roles. There may be too much intelligence in performance. You must have a baptismal baptismal drug with a drug abuse drug. There is nothing new in this story; we have heard it many times before. If you were looking for new info or insight, you will not find it. It is said as a love story - one unrequited: Linda for Elvis and Elvis for drugs.
