I just watch it. A couple of laughs, but there is nothing to write home about. Jason Lee seemed to have fun. Two (long) coil reel coils consist almost exclusively in its adaptation of uncontrollable laugh. Selma Blair seemed to punch a timer, but then again, his character was supposed to be a stick in the mud, so "well done" i guess? Jim Brolin was amazingly funny. (Babs getting married can not be a picnic.) The soundtrack was hip, and eclectic. Larry Miller, who played Julia Stiles father (hilariously), in 10 things I hate about you is funny here too. It's great, but the best aspect of this film was filed in Julia Stiles. I could spend two hours watching her fold fold, and I feel like I just did.
