I was shocked by the incredible ridiculous plot of Tigerland. It was a liberal fantasy of how the military would be. The dialogue was difficult to swallow along with Colin Farrell's funny characters that were allowed to get away with by his superior officer. <br /> <br /> I kept thinking, "Hey, there's a reason to boot camp is difficult. Assume soldiers fighting for and turn them into one cohesive unit. There's no room for attitudes to men and boys who will not follow order. "I was framing for Bozz to get his butt kicked because it was such a danger to his fellow soldiers. I do not want to fight with someone like him in war because he was more concerned with feelings of happiness and to do what was necessary to protect his unit. <br />
