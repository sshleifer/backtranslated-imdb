There are two types of characters on the SHIELD: those who try to do the best they can and do right, and those who relentlessly pursue their own self-interest and commit all the deadly sins they can say to themselves and everyone else that they are heroes, and only hope everyone. More than any other show, the SHIELD is about hypocrisy and self-arrogance. Unfortunately, the hypocrites and self-denials are shown to their heroes, and as these heroic genre-fiction humorous humor are able to beat or catch and get out on top of them and over again, make fools from all classmates. <br /> <br /> The show has great camera-work. Inside the lead and the fading outs are always superb. It really is a work of art to see. Unfortunately the story is a cartoony, screensaver wants to complete scenarios of free violence, rape, and lies. The hero, who shoots all people down with him to scheme after failing to scheme, is wiley like a cartoon warner cartoon warner, always escaped and make fun of all the closest elmer (anyone who does not support him) in his lies and crimes), automatically attracts any good woman who supports the characters coming on the show, still surviving any attempt to bring him to justice, and ever scratch your ears and justification himself to extremes. If another cop detects something wrong with something he does, and someone gets hurt because of his actions, he still blames the suspect cop, regardless of the fact that his schemes and elaborate lies and finishing plans are still the cause. Every time. <br /> Like 24, this show depends on contrast and innumerable delays dragging its stories out for season after season. Boring, incredible long-term history is injected into the scenario every season to provide a skeleton that hangs bloody, perverted fragments of meat that acts offenses and the inevitable cover-ups. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Sometimes they want us to see Shane as the enemy. Sometimes they want us to see him as a misunderstanding soul soul. Sometimes they want to see Vic as a dangerous, dynamic sexual. Sometimes they want to see him as a poor guy with a gold heart. Sometimes they want to see Mara as a little low-priced Jezebel. Then they think that if they show it sitting and talking about his dreams with Shane, that we will find it to be sympathetic and tragic. <br /> <br /> None of this manipulation is adequate to find the qualities of liking. Once they have shown these characters ruin the lives of others for their own finish, that's it. It is nonsense to keep trying to flip back and forth. But then, it is also nonsense to produce seven seasons of these bumbling clowns drawing each super model into bedding and running a crime crime right from the police station, right under the nose of everyone.
