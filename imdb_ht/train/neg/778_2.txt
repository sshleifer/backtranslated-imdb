What have Ireland been doing to the film distributors that they seek to represent the country in a peasant way? This film starts as a primer for the Irish movie cinema clinic: homeless priests, spit before handshakes, march in town square, biking through lands in the popular anodic music series. Quickly, however, it becomes apparent that the main theme of the movie is great daddy-o in Irish Cliches - religious discussions. She worries a Protestant woman who wants to decide where her cousin's father is educated, which would seem like a reasonable enough to want, but not in '50 Village Village Wexford she lived with. Instead of sending them to a Catholic school, he decided to step up and leave for Belfast, then Scotland, where a few more cliches are regoried. While he's, his father (similar looks like George Lucas) and family back home undergoes a boycott, which becomes extremely embarrassing. I will not give away the finish, not because I think people should go see this movie, but because it's not very interesting. One of the issues with the film is the central character: we're supposed to be sympathized with it but ending rather than asking him to find a life. Villages are presented as bigots whose prejudices should stand up, but your children's traumatism looks aptly appropriate to go on. In addition, it takes on the burdens that he staggers down to when trying to draw analogy to the current Northern Ireland peace process: the woman was told by her lawyer that she had to "prescribe prescription" to return her. The film is allegedly based on a true story but it's the themes faced with much more imaginatively, and with less recourse to redeemed clich√©s, in the past.
