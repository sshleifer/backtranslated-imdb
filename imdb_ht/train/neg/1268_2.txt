Oh that a movie is condescending! Set in Los Angeles, the center of the universe from the creator Hollywood POV, this movie tries to have a deep social of contemporary craze. <br /> <br /> Stereotypes, smarmy characters in the largely varied socio-economic background cross paths in their daily lives, humdrum. The plot is disjointed and desultory. Many contrasting inimaginative plots keep the movie going, such as: a drive-by-shoot, a baby abandoned by the weeds, a gang of thugs bullying a lawyer, a flying guy in the night sky over the city, a kid in summer camp. <br /> <br /> And in all these events, the one constant is the generous sociological "click" that has been distributed in the dialog, as characters compare notes on their life experiences. One character says another: "When you sit on the edge of this thing (the Grand Canyon), you realize what a joke we are the people ... ... These stones are laughing at me, I could say, me and my anxiety; real funny in this Grand Canyon ". <br /> And another character pontifies the meaning of it all: "There's a golf in this country, a deep enlargement between people with things and people who do not have ... it's like that The big hole was opened in the ground, just as great ... The Grand Canyon, and what comes out drained ... is a eruption of rage, and the rage creates violence ... ". <br /> <br /> Aside from dialogue usually and forcing, aside from the smarmy valley characters, aside from the mute scheme, the speed of the story is agonizingly slow. Acting is inspirational and perfunctory. The movie is suffering from self-satisfaction, despising the script for viewers. This was a movie project approved by Hollywood costumes that fancy themselves as Gurus omnipotent, looking down from on high. They think that the films will be an amazing revelation to our unpretentious, unrealistic film guide, eager to learn about the real meaning of American social change.
