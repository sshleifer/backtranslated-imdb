The first, anyone who thinks this end of the "French Connection" William Friedkin, is the most definitely superfluous completely crazy or mental or both. The issue and review of this film is that, a.) It's an end to a brilliant film, which always makes it look it objectively hard, and b.) It's directed by John Frankenhimer, one of the best American directors they are always, so I wanted to love it. William Friendkin was the perfect person to direct a movie about drug trafficking in New York City's rotten, because of the documentary-like approach to action and history, Frankenhimer's other hand is one of the most stylish guys ever, that is, "The Candidate Manchurian" and "Secund", and "French Connection 2" it feels like someone trying to become bravest and does not have the true understanding of pulling it. That's the fact that Frankenhimer has chosen to direct the end by Gene Hackman himself to tell a lot about Hackman's understanding of the original movie too. It's well known Hackman hated Friedkin about the series and promised never worked with it again, it's also known he has envisioned the character to be more a dimension, freeing weight and trying to play it like a right characters. it shows you Hackman, despite being a great actor, had no idea who made the movie with the big story. The plot of Doyle becomes an interesting addict, but does not guarantee the rest of the movie. An unfortunate point in Frankenhimer's filmography.
