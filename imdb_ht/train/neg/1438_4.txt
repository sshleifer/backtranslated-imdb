Well! What can one say? Firstly, this adaptation is far too long within 4 hours, for the complexity (or lack of) of the scheme. The actors try really hard to do something in this movie, but there are too few content for the available time. Swayzee is really NOT a Quatermain character at all. After seeing Sean Connery's interpretation of the great man in the "League of Extraordinary Men", Swayzee really does not make the class. This chapter with the winchester rifles repeats no strength, tallness, subtlety, or humor needed for the party, and it is upstaged by everyone with the witch doctor, who incidentally looks at my point of view, They must be more convinced as an actor than the rest of the cast. Some of the perspectives are fun but have funny mistakes in the cinematography. For example. When the team is happy to reach the pond in the middle of the desert, the tracks are visible down to the oasis, just waiting for them to walk through them. Riding from the leads me to an exit (on the next shot) there is nothing like the exit seen in the passage they had risen, and tight. I was waiting for Doug McClure to appear at any moment. In some ways I wish it was. <br /> <br /> The leader of the Russians running Quatermain is a ridiculous to create stereotypes that just shoots in everything. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Swayzee should stick to that kind of stuff. It can not be part of a courageous gentleman with a fantastic heart, experience in life, and the essence of fair play. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10. Barely
