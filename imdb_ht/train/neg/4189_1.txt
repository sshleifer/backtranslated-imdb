I had the different misfortune of catching up on two of the 2004's worst films back in the back this morning: first, incoherent CGI-driven empty into the Riddick History, and then the worthless project project known as Greendale. One price multimillion and the prices are costly, but they are both bad. Really, really bad. <br /> On my front, I should point out that I'm not the biggest fan of the Neil Young fan, but she has contributed her share of classic tunes: from Buffalo Springfield (with the best Young Controls recording) at Rust Never Sleeps , Harvest, and ice balls, the man had some really great songs. Unfortunately, there is no big song in Greendale, and precious some good people, and the movie where to build is truly kringeworthy and sloganeering politics. Completely without merit as art and unimpressive as polemic, Greendale is best left to forget. Buy the book if you feel compelled to contribute to the Young Bank account.
