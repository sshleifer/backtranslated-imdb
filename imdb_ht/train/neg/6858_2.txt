The San Wise John Huston was a miserable addition to the Flonkery O'Connor book than I could imagine. From the actual performances actually awful (and not yours, "Oh that did on purpose, you just do not get it" me!) In the music score that was more suited to an episode of Rockford Files, this movie was riot. I see it has no ill-will at the beginning, and, in fact, expects a nice experience. But lies representation of South characters, from ridiculous fraud to the south lilting, the comedic way of faith described, was inaccessible. Right down to the end, which was completely devoid of any character sentiment, it failed in everywhere O'Connor's book was bright and resonated. The actors who show "south" policemen can also as well eat smothered hot dogs from NYC street stand and quoting godfather. One of the performances of the act represented the alive and dead-Ned Beatty representation of Hoover Shoates, a religious connate that heard Moates announcing the Christ Church without Christ and seeing signs of dollars and business opportunities. O'Connor's powerful book is best known for its creepy, religious undercurrent that slips the seemingly slim rock into "Faith." Mr. Huston's film is a humiliating humor of the author's intentions, as understood by me and most of his fans, if I can be so bold as to say so. While I acknowledge that I can not know exactly what the author wanted to convey, I have enough affection for him and his work wants to be a fan. If I saw no way Wise than Mr. Huston apparently did, I would throw it into the trash. For the sake of the Flannery, and I, I forgive you, John Huston. Remember ... that will take some time.
