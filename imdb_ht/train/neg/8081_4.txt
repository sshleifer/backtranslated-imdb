One of the requirements of science fiction, at least before it begins to become satir, is that it must be as little as possible. I would think an anti-problem bomb would make considerably more damage than for what it intended. But I'll let this give the physicists who can see solar crisis. <br /> It's a land crisis that faces because solar flares are getting totally out of hand. They are getting near Earth, so much to become unrealistic, as if the whole Earth were Death Valley. The answer is an anti-matter bomb that a space ship will have to take to the sun and explode it there. This will divert the rockets off by saying Mercury says it's not in direct alignment with the Earth. <br /> Who rescues it, but commander Tim Matheson and his crew. That is if he can keep himself on the business at hand and not on seed Runaway, Corin Nemec. Take care of personal family problems by admiring Charlton Heston, Matheson's father and grandfather Nemec. There's a villain here too, Peter Boyle who is CEO of a multi-national corporation in this crisis is trying to control the world's food supply for survivors. The idea he could not survive by entering his thoughts. He is doing his best for the Sabotage Matheson mission. <br /> <br /> Solar crisis seems like a bad mix of 2001, a Space Odyssey and trip to the bottom of the ocean. Boyle seems to take his cue from Gene Hackman as Lex Luthor at Superman, apparently it is the only one in the cast that he realizes in a turkey and onaks accordingly. The rest of the cast are stiff, true blue and dull. Except maybe desperate Jack Palance rat who finds Nemec and cares about him. <br /> <br /> The key here is that the movie was directed by Hollywood films to Hollywood films, Allen Smithee. The film gets as much as four stars for the cast involved and it's time out for a Carving Thanksgiving.
