I was only recently able to catch up with the films of Marilyn Miller since they are not showing on TCM in the UK. I was very intrigued over the years because this was one of the superstars in the 20th. What he really liked .Some stars in this era like some jolson in the magic still shine, but not for Miller.Her Dancing looks awkward and badly choreographed, singing it a little bit limited and as an actress she does Ruby Keeler looks like Hepburn. Even worse in this movie as the public has become tired of musicals virtually all of the music numbers have been erased. So we are leaving with a comedy of this period with little real calls. They've paid $ 500,000 for this! So I have only two conclusions. Either it was wrong to serve in the movie or he had no talent at all. I think the truth is closer to later than the former.
