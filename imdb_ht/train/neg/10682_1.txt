So I'm looking to rent a DVD and I come across this movie called 'End Game'. It stars James Woods and Cuba Access JR and has a summary of a policy to cancel. Well worth a look then. Or so I thought. <br /> <br /> Boy, I was wrong. <br /> <br /> End game has just about the most ridiculous plot I've ever been to scared of enduring. Now, being something in a whodunnit, I can not really break into it as I would like without 'damaging' it for those who have yet to experience this monstrosity. But questions like 'why he / she / she does this?', And 'where did the earth find the resources to pull this over? they are all too abundant after the unintelligible film conclusion of the film. <br /> <br /> As for the act - you know these films where you can almost feel that an actor realized that a terrible mistake was signed on for a movie, and that's then the show performance? This is one of these people. Accompany this with a clear and flawed treatment script, irritating direction and you have the recipe for poisonous cinemas. <br /> <br /> Of course, this did not make it to the cinema, and for the same reason you should not allow it to your living room; it is appalling.
