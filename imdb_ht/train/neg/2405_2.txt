This film deserves a working on Mystery Science Theater. Even though she does not have anything to do with King Solomon, she's worth a look because she's an unwilling street-riot. Really! It's worse than "destroying all monsters." Be sure to check out the following: The Cheese Meday (looks like the Shriners were here), obviously the Norfolk jacket jacket on "Allan Quatermain," David MaCallum has seriously ironed (which makes it attractive far away even poorly acting) the incredibly bad job on all the "monsters," the monsters themselves - puppets from that threat the little girl, the giant snake who threatens Macallum while sinking in oatmeal, the red-lit eyes on the mumps crab, the amazing hilarious boat (oh, brother !!) which appears to be made of plywood mounted on an old sand dragon and looks like a rest from a jr.Sr. Prom ("The journey to the future and the class of '71"), the Phoenician city - where they put imperial weapons weapons but which inexplicably contain Egyptian inscriptions - Hieronymus - (the Phoenicians invented the alphabet-come on!), And most Wrong at all, Macallum and Ekland (and peach peach) play smoochy-figure-oh the horror! The best part is the intrepid explorers to manage losing the frenetic comic, and the African guy -Snuffleupagus or whatever - obviously chose to die heroically rather than to be in any more scene.
