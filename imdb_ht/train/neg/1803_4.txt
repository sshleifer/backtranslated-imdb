Here is one of these short education films made to learn the unknown people out about reality in their lives. This time, the target audience is girls preteen, the reality of life is rule. This animated film, created by Walt Disney Pictures, apparently and some sponsors from Kotex. <br /> It starts with explaining how hormones make you grow and grow. With the help of animate and a female narrator it shows us how the body, especially the ovaries, matrices and vagina, work and why this all leads to menstruation. It is almost amazing, gets the funny note here, how the subject of sex avoided. Even the word never mentioned although "furtilized" happens once. I do not really know why I've seen this, but since it is one of those rare short films that might give an impression of an innocent time, you might want to give it a try.
