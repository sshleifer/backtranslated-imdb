Not finding me wrong, I'm a big fan of Woody's movies, obviously her late 70s (Annie Hall, Interiors, Manhattan) and most of her 80-year-old / early 90's (Ana, Krim and Deli, Husband and Wife) in fact I also loved some of his more recent efforts (Melinda, Anything, little little Crooks) but that was wrong, though he might not have been any worse than last year's Match Point but how wrong I was. <br /> <br /> It's been traumatic draw - basically a cross between Match Point, Mystery Mystery Manhattan and Ti Crooks time, and all the jokes are taken out - Woody seems to be on the road out as well, bursting most of her lines and delivering 'hilarious catchphrases' I mean that with all due respect ...' over and over until the blandness of it all gets plenty of do. <br /> I know that most actors are passing to work with him, but should at least read the script first - Scarlett Johansson and Hugh Jackman are so much better than this - and Woody would really take a much more behind the future camera role, if it has any sense about 20 miles behind it. <br /> It would not be so tragic if we did not have so much great moviey woody compared to this - but it's clear that its best days behind it, judging by this effort, Woody would call it a days before becoming a joke industry. <br /> <br /> Anbarrassingly bad
