I took "Lost Sorrows" at the New York Film and Video Festival and I guess I had some high expectations for this movie. Unfortunately, this is just another visual FX calling card. The story is very lame. The bad lighting and camera work, along with less than the great editing and music all make the movie look like quality. <br /> <br /> Is it really too much demanding FX shorts have better story and the rest of the technical production must be on par with the FX! You can not just get away with cool FX in shorts again, it was 5 years since "405" made a great splash. At least that quick, cool and even a little funny! None of these can be said about "Lost Objects."
