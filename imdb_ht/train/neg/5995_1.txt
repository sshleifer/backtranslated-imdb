This is a really awful movie. What they did was to take a TV show, which was never aimed for young children and given it to George Lucas's treatment (meaning he lost it by kiddifying it to appeal to the younger audience). Thunderbirds TV show was not exactly the most cordial of shows, in fact it was very formulated, but it was always enjoyable to watch (especially when the models were awakened) and the voice was not too bad. <br /> <br /> This tormented by bad casting and bad acting (with the remarkable exceptions of Sophia Myles as Lady Penelope & Ron Cook as Parker, which seems to be the cast member only has a sign of how character they should have played) and after this travesti, I would not let the traffic from Frakes. The whole point in Thunderbirds was that it was about the entire Tracy family and how they worked as a team, preventing disaster or coming to the rescue of people involved in disaster. <br /> Avoid this waste as the epidemic. <br /> I only give it 1 out of 10 because a rating zero is not supported.
