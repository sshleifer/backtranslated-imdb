Pyar Mohan can be safely included in the black list of one of the worst-ever-made films by humanity. The movie, one of the many disabled people-flickers who arose after the phenomenon of the black phenomenon is making a mockery of the disabled handicapped. Vivek Oberoi and Fardeen Khan are only caricatures of people with disabilities. While Black describes the patience and emotions of a disabled woman and gives us a glimpse in his world, Pyar Mohan shows two desperate monkeys as scars with no harm on being disabled and hitting up half the world to protect love interests them. Anu Malik's music is just enough. Vivek Oberoi has made a promise promising and Saathiya is sadly losing his balls quickly to Hindi movies. Fardeen Khan has never been an actor acceptable and deserved to be banned from the film industry. Amrita Rao and Esha Deol are just beautiful girls in distress have nightmares of Thialnd who have no one to save them - except for the recently mentioned deperados. Boman Irani, as the Don Toni's future, is somewhat unacceptable. Avoid filming if possible.
