This film is not as good as all of Christ's movies I've ever seen. And I'm quite surprised that in this story Pilates wants to end Jesus, when the Scriptures (as well as the other movies) state differently. It also misses a very important issue: The Resurrection .. None of the other cinemas skipping this party is very important: the faith of all of us Christians lies at this very event. As Paul said in one of his letters "If Christ had not been raised from the dead, our faith is vain". A very impressive scene for me in this movie was seen on the streets remaining in the palms used when Jesus entered Jerusalem. <br /> Finally, and in opposition to my Jewish co-commentator, Jesus does not have a myth. And as a matter of fact, it was also a JEW. There are plenty of documents (religious and secular) that prove the existence of this extraordinary man (or I should say, God becomes a man) that really changes mankind. I strongly advise him (giving it a historian) on Flavius ​​Joseph, the most brilliant Jewish commentator of the 1st. Century.
