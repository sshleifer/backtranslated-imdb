"Gray Matter" AKA "Brain Machine" but the videos of people have been thinking better at that; The screen says 1972 but IMDb says 1977; it's the kind of movie. The government has some kind of significant interest in this brain car project that has shot four people - which turns out to be, approximately, a philosopher, a horny priest, a crackpot veteran and a patriot who got an abortion - to sit at a bedroom shrinkage and a computer that can read the horrendous secrets. At the end the government takes on the laboratory by force and everyone dies. Here is a movie that is incompetent in every important way; M *** s *** has the best output value than that. It kept my interest, though, just to see what exactly these filmmakers thought they did, dabbling into four-guy-in-a-room drama characters. The answer: a device on how inferior science is to God. Thank you very much. It's like opening a baby egg and getting puzzle 30th puzzle yourself. The priest is played by James "Roscoe P. Coltrane" The best, philosopher by the Gerald "Republican Simon" McRaney. Also presented very, very, very long established and transition shots in large numbers, this move almost as slow as the Liberal Convention.
