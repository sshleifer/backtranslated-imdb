I insert it to the back of the DVD coverage of this movie at Best Buy over a year ago, saying to myself, "Looks funny, more he has Michael Clarke Duncan, how can I lose!" I continued to pay $ 15.99 plus tax for it. I took it on a friend's house and we both stood up to how bad he was writing and acting. Wooden performance has a lot. All the "hilarious" and "outstanding" performances have never seemed to happen. After 90 minutes I hung myself in shame, knowing that I can never get 90 minutes or $ 15.99 back. I literally cried too much, because if that was what could be considered "comedy" I did not want to believe in movies anymore. My friend and I always informed a friend of us in the horror of this movie at the point that he needed to see it just to understand how bad he was. During the holiday season this year I watched her with her because she did not want to look her alone. This was my next horrible mistake, because as I watched I just became angry. I started calling in the movie, and I'm not talking to the movie theater. Everyone I know has even glimpsed this movie has agreed to the worst they've ever seen. My sense of humor is sick and twisted and often disturbed my friends, but that could not save this same movie. The fact that this film is not on the list under 100 about IMDb is surprising. The fact that its rating (at the time of writing) is 3.6 a crime against humanity.
