I see people writing about how this great movie was. It was awful! The act was sub-par at best. She made lots of money because the girls were going to see the film 7 times in the theater because of Leonardo. Where did the hell find the money? Anyway, I wanted to learn more about the Titanic; why did he plunge, which ran into a lot of people's minds; Maybe even a little conspiracy. Anyone realizing that some people do not even ride the boat because there was a fire on board before it even took off? No, you're not because everything you see is a rich girl who falls for a poor boy and painted her naked (made this junk dripping at least the tip you cut that the movie was stupid?). I was crying in one scene, though. The scene shows when the water was filled up in the boat. It looked like water pool! I think this movie has made all this money and could not even make the water out of the sea look real? incredible ... <br /> Ohhh group played on while the boat sank. Just ridiculous. This was the worst film until Pearl Harbor outdid it to the "Nothing to Do and Reality" department.
