Seriously, why American actors and Frech pretend to be checking to speak perfect English with a fake accent Russia? I'm a man, so I enjoyed the free nudity - but a soft porn movie would be more of that, and at least did not pretend to be artistic. <br /> <br /> All political statements of painful guidance - did the director hear talent? The act was also woody and melodramatic, and the funny rescue is never funny. The characters were very deep, and I just could not identify with them at all. <br /> <br /> The bit where I made laugh was when they cut off the actors in the archival footage of the protests in Prague - and they were black and white and then sepia matched the footage-just funny . I read many of the short story Kundera (not the light unbearable for them), and there is good thing about its style of writing (although its theme is one big male fantasy) -and I have to say, the movie did not transmit any of goodness in Kunderas style.
