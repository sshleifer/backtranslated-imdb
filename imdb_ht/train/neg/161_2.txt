If you can imagine Mickey Mouse as a New York street pimp, or John Wayne as a Communist spy, then you might believe Pat Boone as a juvenile delinquent on her uncle's firm in Kentucky, and you might be able to enjoy filming that. <br /> <This movie is so stupid that it is not even indexed for a 1950s love love without it. And the problem is that Hollywood has done such a great deal on Pat Boone's refusal to kiss a woman by his wife on screen before he released the audience knowing he will not kiss Shirley Jones so you can not build any anticipation for the "screen execution "in their love. It's sort of like watching a west in which the cowboys do not have weapons. <br /> <br /> The story is pointless. Even this song sings song and enthusiasm passion. <br /> <br /> April Love belongs to the worst bin bin along with Ishtar and Plan 9 from outer space.
