First they warned that I saw this film on TV and armed English - which could have entirely spoiled the atmosphere. However, I will rate what I have seen with hope that will drag people away from this version. I found this film excruciatingly dull. All the movie's atmosphere loses and locks the frustration slowly into a stalker movie. I'm sorry, but the worst film sin in my book is to be slow except when the movie about philosophy. I did not see any deeply philosophical significance of this film. Maybe I miss something, but I must say it as I see it. I rated it a "1". What can I say, US oriented taste, maybe.
