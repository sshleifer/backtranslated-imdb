This movie was a time built-up with no climax. People related to the swordfight in the big end must either be out of their minds, or no. The way too often this movie has become soft. I do not say that soft movies are bad. But no matter how your fans are in sugar it should be no space on a T-bone slice. This film was supposed to be vengeance for crimes committed against a culture, but it ended up being a little bar-brawl. There was one of them who knew what a sword was; Tim Roth's character (and yes, he plays it well). Rob Roy was a "weak" hero who had no knowledge of how to use a sword, and how he "won" was a shame. As a movie drama had its period, but the best performance in it has to go to the nature of Scotland. This is one short tad of being called "soap" in my book.
