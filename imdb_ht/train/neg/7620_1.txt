I rent this movie because it sounded very interesting, but in my horror movie this movie was the worst movie I've ever seen! I read the comments from Gumby-8 and it must be a part of the cast or crew. Unless Gumby-8 is a 4 year old or a few members of the culturally deprived people of the right mind would have thought that this film had any potential at all. <br /> I can not believe the Gumby-8 comments. <br /> <br /> Quoting: "Out of" Dune "inspired animate opening at the fast speed ... this movie keeps the eye moving and working properly as repeated look is not unexpected." /> The animation is the only aspect of the movie that was interesting with the fact that the movie keeps the moving eye, well that's because you keep looking for any kind of suspense. I mean giving me a Halloween break shot with a budget of $ 100,000.00 and a mask that is painted and also in the way became a cult classic. As far as "looking repeatedly is not unexpected" I think he did a tip. Another quote from the Gumby-8 Fan Salt: "The act is also a strong aspect of the movie." /> <br /> With all respect due to the actors, the performances are nothing more than the respective talent of Robert Napton. <br /> <br /> Hatian Tagline: "Beware the hours between sunset and darkness" <br /> This is because there is no sunset or darkness in this film. <br /> <br /> MPAA Rating "Rated R for Some Violence / Gore" <br /> <br /> Only the gore you see is some red paint on a leaf that you have never seen. As far as I know it could be the only one of herbs. <br /> In summary, I saw cops territory from 50 to 60 and 70. I saw what I thought to be absolutely the worst and some were very good. The director of this film either did not make any attempts, slept, or took a hit of acid. Whatever I think the actors deserve applause for trying to salvage a very poor job in the direction. I would give this movie a rating .5 for a movie 'B'.
