Very bad movie. Very, very, very bad movie. It's a rarity, but it's defensively not worth hunting down. This Italian rip-off jumper makes little sense most of the time, and no sense of the rest. The "Cayman" is not at all convinced, and many sub-cemeteries are nowhere to be found. If it's in the local video store, you may want to watch it if you're a fan of Monster Cinema, but it's not worth hunting down.
