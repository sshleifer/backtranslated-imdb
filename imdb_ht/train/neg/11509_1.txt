I do not know what some of us smoke, but I suspect it's potent. <br /> <br /> To call sweat Away terrible would be a reproach to the very concept of terribleness. The act is frightening and I'm not picking on Madonna here, we all know it's useless, but someone should have warned everyone else that his illness is contagious. My back literally hurt at cringing lots of malicious deliberately delivered lines. The correction is so sloppy, it baths out descriptions. The photography and composition (which at that time, skill should be a GOOD for any movie that has a budget) are surprisingly inept, even the illumination is something very serious and unnatural looking. These are basically elemental in windmills, if you can not get them right, you should look for another line of work. It's as convincing as a 3 grade white snow production, except nowhere near as well made or interesting. The original film by Lina Wertmueller is a wonderful and metaphorical satire, superbly acting and writing, featuring spectacular visuals - you can practically taste the sea salt and feel the sand of your hair. The sexual tension feels really and immediate ... The person who found Ritchie Guy's version to discourage, should see it, it really is one of the landmarks in the world cinema. <br /> <br /> Those of us who thought the renewal is some kind of leader should have to examine yourself.
