No, this was not one of the ten worst films in the 1980s, but it certainly skirts below 100 somewhere. This film seems to have been put on the shelf for two to three years and then released in 1981. What else would you explain the special pre-dating effects "A American Werewolf in London," disco still being considered fresh , and Ronald Reagan was not the 40th President of the United States? While we're in it, let's not neglect the 1970s hairstyles in the 1950's and '60's. I've seen more of what's happening in "Happy Day" & "Laverne & Shirley" combined. A woman raising this movie in "so bad, it's good" category was late, great Elizabeth Hartman, but just barely. Biff plays as Miss Montgomery, high school professor who becomes a sexpot, a stereotype that has been killed and still churned out of Hollywood today, but even as a "hot chick" he retains the quality of his mouse. Calling for help is proof of this. It also looks great as Miss Wimp. "Seven dol in the beauty salon, shot in hell." He was not kidding. This is not to say that there is no good party elsewhere, they're just a few and far between, and I'm not just saying that because I love Hartman. Incidentally, "Teen Wolf" was better than that. "Teen Wolf Heavy" was better than this, and that was not even so good. <br /> <br />
