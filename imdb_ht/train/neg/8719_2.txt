Well here I go with another movie industry B. It's sad enough to see some films seriously doing but I'm not occupying an industry B or C industry film product. Show some effort at work. The characters are really bad. The act is not in this question (surprise), but plot is. How a tight-knit squad witnesses two fellow soldiers to clog, and then go on as if nothing happened. What my rampage was how the writer even threw into the remaining members a scene where they joke about how cute the doctor was. Give me a break.
