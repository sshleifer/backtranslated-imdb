I remember the days in which Kim Basinger was nothing more than a beautiful figure that decorated movies with typical characters in Blondie mute, romantic interest or damsel in danger. But everything changed when he won an Academy Award as Best Trade supporting her role in the COMPILATIVE COMPLETELY PHOTOS, and I think I was not the only one who was surprised for her solid performance.However, after that moment, her career did not follow the ideal path. he was thankful that film made it to participate in prestigious unpretentious movies (like those I know or the door to the floor), but we never saw it again on a substantial character. The picture was out do nothing to put it on this situation; and it is not only that his character is not too tasty, but also that the movie is really crappy.Skinplay in this movie could not be more hollow and basic.However, Basinger brings some conviction into his character and making this film poor to win a few points. This film is full of clich√©s and generic villains.The work of director Susan Montford is really disastrous for many reasons but especially because the film never gets a good rhythm and tone. That finish is out of this movie is very ridiculous. I do not recommend While it came from all.This movie commits the capital's sin to be boring.
