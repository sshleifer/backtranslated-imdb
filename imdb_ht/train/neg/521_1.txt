Wow! This film is really awful. I can not imagine how one could read this script wrong and gave it the green. Throw is the same time the second percentage with some really horrendous performance from virtually all of the cast. The story is disjointed, fragmented and incoherent. He says, lead and predictable. There is no understanding, no charm, no humor. Not sexy at the smallest. Characters remain the same as the dish like the fish. There is also a strong current of misogyny that has become increasingly difficult in the abdomen as the movie went on. When your lead (Carrell) is unfunny and unappealing it's hard out there. Although it turns away-around to end where triumphant love over my lust has left with a sick feeling in my stomach. If this is what happens to humor and social comments then we definitely end up.
