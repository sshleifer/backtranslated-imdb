Published in 1965, but clearly earlier years injections, this is a mild ill with little crime and some unexplored sexe ups. As usual for grindhouse flicks in era, there is a fair amount of strip and dress for no reason complemented by lousy music, annoying narratives, and awkward edits. The coffee shop scene lays the base unleashed, as we cut back and forth between characters to avoid actually seeing their talk lines. All we get are reactionary shots in the screen's voice! 50s-cute Misty Ayers strips in French panties cut her a couple of times before the action began. She has been continuously accompanied by apparently music music from romantic to western mother-to-plate dishes, combining randomly to produce, among other things, the most thrilling cigarette lighting ever captured on film. Look how it taps it! Look how he hit the match! Will it breathe or it will be captured by Apache? Only time will tell !! The movie tells the sordid story of how Sally gets deceived into working in a whorehouse, falling for a drug, and can not escape. For some reason, we treat in some of the most bored Hookers and boring engines of film, literally making the nails or knitting rather than enticing the client. Some funny trading senses (Boozy Dame accidentally drink milk! Har was har!) And silently film does not help. This is one of the worst feature films I've ever seen, even on the show something weird Video. It's really more of a film curiosity for those who are interested in the history of movies - very bad movies.
