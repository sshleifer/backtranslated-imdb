Did I step into something or is that bad move from Daybreak to 1 + 2? God was behind all things? What did God do with sci-fi? God is the only answer when you can not think up a sensible explanation for something. In fact, this is exactly the problem with the final set - they obviously could not think up sensible explanations for the crowds in great questions that were raised throughout the series as how Kara Thrace returned from the death in a brand new viper, how does its old snake and burning cause end on Earth 2, why Baltar has an imaginary 6 in itself, why 6 has a imaginary Baltar in itself, etc. to explain it "angel" or just does not explain it at all. <br /> The plot of the last 2 episodes has been big enough to fly a Basestar. For example, why Galactica and her crew go on a suicide mission to save a girl (Hera), particularly after Adam said there was no way he would try a rescue? Because they found the location of the Cylon base? It's not a good reason to kill the crew's life. And how did Anders know the place? And what was the point in the flashbacks of life's greatest characters' before the war? It's like they forget to make it earlier to throw something off at the last time. Those who wrote the last two episodes could not have been the same writers who created what was so far a sensational series. Feel like writing the script was taken by evangelical Christians in a mission to spread the 'Word'. Forget trying to tie up loose in the draw, the important message writers wanted to get through is: Do not put your faith in technology as it will lead to your destruction; God is your ultimate salvation (hard to believe if you have a disorder that needs medical treatment). <br /> Imagine in the final movie of the Star Wars series they say you have no "force" ... instead, a jedi actually gets her power from Jesus. Then they fly the spaceships of the nearest star and go live in the jungle with the Ewoks. Would that be a good end? His name will not be cracked.
