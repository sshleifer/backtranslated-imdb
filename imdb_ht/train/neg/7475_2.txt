To be honest I knew what to expect before I watched this movie, and I had to say he had the worst act I had ever seen. It does have its moments, and on a comedy level it's very fun, but I'm afraid it's not scary, and stupidity is taken to a new level. There are a lot of unnecessary gorts, and the plot is all over the place. I have no idea why foreigners were wrong, and why they even got to this remote party in Wales, (I mean who would go there anyway?) But I did not take care of That point, because I was hammered by the costumes, and the bad CGI. As far as B movies goes, this deserves the title of 'being so bad, its good', and kudos movie-makers, because they probably knew what they were doing. Long can these films continue .....
