My wife is a fan of this show. That being the case I bought season one of three and four cards is on order. I personally think the show is one big cast of the cast is equally bad. Alyssa Milano should have stuck in the other garbage films she has made like Ivy Poison, embracing the vampire on behalf of a few, other girls supporting cast members are equally inept in portraits. I've seen the best special effects of the old Republic Photo series I've seen as a child. I can understand why the male leads remain on the show for the short periods of time though I do not know if it was their own to choose or not. Please. please do not renew for another season as enough is enough, Bob
