This is absurd - aside from the fellow Australian who has reviewed this cops, I can not help but think that everyone else who submitted a review so far was a way to involve the production of Elektra, considering that How generous they were and praised I'm not really a fan of comic-book-to-movie conversion so I did not go through with great expectations, but I found Elektra to be incredibly underwhelming. The thing that irked me the most was the fact that there was plenty of this movie that went unreasonably, which let you think "huh, what significance has the plot?" or "So how does this aspect of the character come on?" I can only hope that these are things that may explain a bit of Daredevil, which I have no intention to see. <br /> <br /> In addition, the behavior of the characters in this movie appeared to make an over-face at random moments in the costume scenario, and not even to get me started on absolutely romantic gratuitous sub-trase la. I (still) scratch myself to the fate of Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa's character, which seems to have gone unexplained. <br /> If I can give this movie kudos for anything it would have to be the fantastic place in which it was shot, but otherwise I became little fun at Elektra. I know we should stop our disbelief for films / action films, but almost everything in this film was so probable or confusing (even by standard movie action) that it simply frustrated me. <br /> Well, Hell, at least Jennifer Garner seems damn good.
