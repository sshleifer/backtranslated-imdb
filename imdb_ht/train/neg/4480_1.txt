Let me start by saying that I did not watch this movie at first with high expectations. He recommended me not a friend who has mediocre taste in movies, and "MTV" was stuck on the front cover so I did not expect much. What I hoped was a tearful, dramatic, but at least effective one. <br /> <br /> I was wrong. <br /> <br /> Firstly, let me start that I have never read the book nor look any other version of the movie. <br /> <br /> The act has been my main grid and the movie. By God it is AWFUL. The main girl is beautiful mediocre, but when compared to the rest of the cast it is Maryl Streep. The main hero, Heath, is just plain terrible. He can sing decent sounding clich√©d, but that's about it. His act has broken 'sad' moments not so bad at point that I just broke into laughs. The girl Isabel was very pampered too, and the brother was just a flat character played by an actor who could not show emotions too. But when he tried, he failed miserably. Neil Patrick Harris was the only decent actor, playing Edward, although it's obviously the direction was bad because he did not live up to what I saw him doing. Oh, and the father was not half my bad memory, but it was in the movie for as little as I can hardly remember. The story itself was not good. More breakups than you can imagine. Predictable story (Until the end, which I barely understand). OBJECTIVES one-sided character with no real profound ... In general just not interesting or compelling, nothing we've ever seen before doing so much better, and nothing worth looking here. <br /> <br /> The finish is supposed to be a tearjerker. He did nothing in the sort. The finish is not built up at all, it almost feels like a reflection. In fact, I had to ask my friends for what actually ended, when they explained it to me, I had to have a look on my face to "Wait, when did that say? What?" Never a good sign. The editor was probably the worst I've seen, though I understand that the fade-ins-fade-outs are doing because this was originally made for TV, but that's really no excuse. <br /> Overall, film is just rubbish. I'm a tender guy, I called during the two episodes of the Simpsons. I never cried during this crap, not even closed. Really, this movie is not worth your time. If you really want to see a tearjerker look elsewhere.
