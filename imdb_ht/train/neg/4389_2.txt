If you like occasional stripping and high school level slippage high school, then look no further. <br /> Starting in on the half-point, the beautiful and erotic Arielle Dombasle starts disrobing at every opportunity. That's the only thing that made this movie worth watching. The story is both lame and preposterous, the humor is corny, and character development is basically non-existent.
