It was almost worth the whole of God-awful "movie" everyone just knew I could never experience anything as bad as this again. Interestingly - 0, script - 0, battalion scene - 0, lead male - 0 (cheddar Bob from eight miles as a hero clash hero who gets the girl), Nadia Bjorlin - 10 (It is gorgeous and not a horrible actress ). This is the criteria I used on its average from a two. I lost count but I believe ever movie clicks, ever, is in this movie. When the driver allegedly killed his father miraculously shows the end to race against him, from out of nowhere he cemented the previous statement. Plus it just shows up for no reason. It never mentioned before. I do not know what else to say here. Just watch it when it comes out on TV in a couple years. At least in what ways some of it will be edited out for advertising.
