The idea is beautiful. Bringing many stars into one movie is great. But .... too many stories, too short and miss really any sense. There is no connection between scenes. There were some 3-4 brilliant stories ... but these were from the 18. The frame reminded me of "All Invisible Children" - a movie that I loved so much. Compared with it, however, "Paris Je T'Aime" lacks the intriguing little story, which develops - begins and has end. And it lacks topics that connect all of these children - children. I do not get Paris enough in a subject to connect 18 short sketches. Perhaps for those who know Paris it is interesting. Otherwise, I would not recommend it ...
