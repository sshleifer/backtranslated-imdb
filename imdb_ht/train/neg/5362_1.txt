Wives and wigs, who "coloring" her hair in the middle of the movie (= taken in wigs) presumably do not see what the audience can see from miles away: <br /> <br /> *** start spoiler alerts * ** that hubby has a deal with her best friend and they both try to get rid of it. *** the end of the spoiler alerts *** <br /> What a spoiler that has: the title already gives it away, does not it? Bad act, bad script: waste of time Oh yeah: in the end, she lived happily ever after .... <br /> <br /> If you loved this movie, you will really love "Cannibal Woman of the Jungle avocado of death "....
