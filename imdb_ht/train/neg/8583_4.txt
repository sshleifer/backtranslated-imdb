Americans have the attention span of a fruit fly and if something does not happen in the span of a typical commercial, we tend to lose interest really fast. <br /> I found an interesting fact in this movie: someone has to paint toll pillars and make it on a schedule! And guess what, really would like to do something else (the viewer has similar feelings). Surprisingly, when I was bored night infomercials night and decided to actually watch this movie, I found the characters to be interesting and very engaging. <br /> I just do not usually watch that TV TV late, so I can not recommend this movie, unless watching dry paintings is your idea of ​​an interesting two-hour time out of your life.
