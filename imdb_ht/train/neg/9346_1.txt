This movie was a come from the title of credit, it's boring at the point of Tedyman and the act is wooden and stilted! Admittedly this is the director of Richard Jobson directed first, but who is green-lit a script as evolving as this one? Looks like another money down drainage government project (the Scottish screens are credited with surprise, surprise). I almost fell asleep three times and my review will unfortunately have to be more restricted than this one. Please, Mr. Jobson Whatever you did before directing this sedative to a movie, go back to it!
