Lynne Ramsey makes image arrest, and Samantha Morton can summon feeling with a gesture. So what a drag to discover their talents wasted on this unfamiliar, pretentious bark. Ramsey can not bring Callar to life. Its attempts are too artistic and oblique. Repeat his camera on long silent shots of the actress agonizing as if Morton's contemplating contemplation alone could give character. We are in a hell of Warholian hell of self-esteem: for a movie with minutes of spare bugs climbing across the floor, you might think he could get round to block out his protagonist. But how will he do that if he rarely speak? Without the Roman interior monologue, Morvard Callar's cellulite has no one. Small wonders Ramsey discovered Morton frequently. <br /> That said, the first ten minutes were so impressive to act, shot and edited by my hope being soaring. Give the film so much: he knows how to make promises, if not how to hold any.
