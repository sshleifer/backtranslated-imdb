Hoo boy, this was a real trial to get through. The DVD case has Tom Hanks' grated to plaster it and that's the only reason that anybody would buy it. It looks around forty on the box, however, the movie was made in 1982, so it still has its Buddies buddies and of course is about forty lighter books. The plot worries a dungeon with dragons like games that Hanks and his three friends play with Hanks end up thinking of the whole thing. Chris Makepeace is a boy named Jay Jay and the best thing about the movie is that he puts a succession of funny hat. Ooh, look, he has a yellow hardhat over with a tuxedo! Now she was dressed as a WWI pilot! This was a really awful movie but in a bad way. A bunch of veterinarians pop up mostly as parents of children. There's Anne (I'm Honey West, Dammit!) Francis and Louise Sorel, who actually looks like hot. Murray Hamilton, the Mayor from Jaws, has an infused scroll as a cop. Wendy Crewson, is the love interest for Hanks and some blonde guys I've never seen before or since. There are some sirupi music here and there and absolutely no tension or sense of danger or excitement. There is a monster that only Hanks can see because it is, you know, black. The monster is played by the end, great Kevin Peter Hall, it's Fame Predator. A friend got this out of my ol 'discounted deal in MallWart and advised me to chuck it in the garbage without even looking at it, so of course I had to see if it was as bad as all this. It was. The night before, I watch Apollo 13, so after that, this movie was a bit of a shock. Make yourself a favor and leave it in the box. Oh yeah, after Hanks nearly jumped from one of the World Trade Center towers because of its hallucine, he went home to recreate and visit by his friends. Hanks mother, a drunken Vera Miles, says she is coming together nicely now but when walking down the lake goes to her in her tennis outfit, she is crazier than ever. End of
