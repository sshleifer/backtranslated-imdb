Stephen King adaptation (scripted by King himself) in which a young family, recently rural Maine, acquires information about the pet's home closet. The father (Dale Midkiff) then finds out on the burial ground Micmac beyond the permanence cemetery of power of resurrection - only of course nothing is buried back by RIGHT RIGHT. <br /> <br /> Under the average "horror" picture starts out clumsy, insulting, and stupid, and continues this way for a while, and the worst element is Midkiff's worthless performance. It gets a little better in the end direction, and finally disturbing finals. At the point of fact, the whole movie is really disturbing, which is why I can not completely reject it - at least it has Something to make it memorable. Decent supports performance by Fred Gwynne, as wise old age, and Brad Greenquist, as challenged Victor Pascow's mind is not enough to really buy movies. <br /> <br /> King has his usual roots as the minister. <br /> Followed by an end also directed by Mary Lambert (is it any wonder that she had no mainstream films since?).
