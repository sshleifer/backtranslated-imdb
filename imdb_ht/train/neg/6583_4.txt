Interesting ideas and scenarios that did not work well. <br /> <br /> When you see the movie, maybe you'll feel as happy with the finish as I did. I did not really know who's rooted in the movie, Hacking Diggs look bored as the detective, the rest of the characters seem so a dimensional and unpleasant. <br /> <br /> If the victims Alicia (Mia Kirschner) was more of a beautiful girl, we might actually enjoy seeing the plot unfold and the criminals brought him to justice. The problem was that it was like bitchy as the other girls, turning out to sweet girls are alluring cokehead opportunists. I can not understand the moral message of this movie, and as a detective story and his thriller does not work.
