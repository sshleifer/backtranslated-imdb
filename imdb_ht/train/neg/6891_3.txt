Start really well, nice intro and construct for the main characters but after about 5 minutes, the charm lost. <br /> <br /> The character is in the same mold as the main protagonist from American pie and underdogs without supporting cast or innovative scenarios that have made pie cinema more of a commercial success. Be honest - act Heder was very poor. Keaton, Daniels and Faris did their best but they did not have any substantial scheme or script to find the teeth in the movie just plods without any speed or clear simple logic story to justify its length. The finish is about as predictable as it comes - so predictable I've ticked the crowd box for this line. <br /> <br /> My advice: Avoid at all costs unless you really really have nothing else to do / listen or watch and even then you will feel the producers just cheated on you from an hour and a half of your life.
