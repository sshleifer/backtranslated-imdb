Where to start even? The horrendous act? Plot of Nonsense? Effect of Basement Negotiations? Characters are completely slow? The font editor? Head self-inducing headphones Casio keyboard ?? The embarrassingly racist remarks ("Look at it, Charlie!", "Back in, Jackie Chan !!" ??? Misogenny's constant ??? I'm a horror fan of life, and I have no problem at all and current "The turtle-to-tend" trend in movies.However, this is a new piece of trash. I think I suffer more pain in watching this than the characters have died in it! If you like the girls were forced They eat frozen fried penis, really poor soft porn core and think lines like "i'll get that b **** and staple it c *** close !!" is smart, live feed is yours., i feel I need to go wash my eyes out with crazy cleaner to prevent from ever seeing this movie again!
