I was one of those "few Americans" who grew up with Gerry Andersen's wonderful creation. Thunderbirds were a great series for the time and would have made a great movie / adventure movie if only the writers could figure out where to target it. <br /> I hope it's to be a temporary, but I did not expect it to be targeted at as a low age group. Like lost in space, this could be both visually stunning and interesting. It should focus on more action / adventure and goal in the original series ... saving people in trouble. <br /> Rather, it focuses on Alan saving the day instead of his brother (who also threw young anyway against the original). Part of the excursion was Lady Penelope and Parker. I did not care too much for the characters of the original, but I was grateful for them in the movie. They stole the show! <br /> I still enjoy Thunderbirds more for high tech than the stories, and even that did not get enough time screen as far as I was concerned. I would like to see more of the cool gadgets. But then, I'm just a big kid ...;)
