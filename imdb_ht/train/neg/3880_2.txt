I can watch a good movie gory right now and then. I've seen some very sick things. However, this is one of the few films that I get to be grotesque in a way that has just plain reluctance and rebellion. I like Gore movie when they enjoy. I love being a lot of creativity behind them. The throat in this movie is not creative. It's sick. It is repugnant. It is completely unpleasant. Therefore, this movie is certainly not fun. The movie is a horror movie, but it lacks crisis. So pretty much the only reason why one would watch this movie is for the Gore, but this is the most unappealing and ugly aspect of the whole movie, and it says a lot. The act is awful, the plot makes no sense, and the music is really annoying with WAY too electronic sounding. It all took me right out of the movie. Pretty much the whole movie is one big mournful depression. There is a guy who has an accidental crash in a craft and woke up in a hospital to find that his skin is dissolving and melting off. I guess that after it goes out and eat people meat in order to slow down the melting process. There are some strange subplots that involve an old couple getting chased by a dog, some brake head floating down a stream, and a finish involving a man being electrocuted. There were times when I tried really hard to enjoy it, but the only scenario in the whole movie that I thought was even fun was the early stage of which a nurse runs down a hospital corridor in slow motion. If you love ugly, embarrassed, horror movie envelopes, this one is for you.
