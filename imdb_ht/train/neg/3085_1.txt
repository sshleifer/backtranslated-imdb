Description: Corny, totally stupid and worthless. It is so cheap with lame, it will tell you why these abnormal people are even wasting 2 months or so to spend a budget (I guess this ...) probably not more than 700 dollars this movie. It was just hysterical to watch with or without Mystery Science Theater. I give you the best advice in the world: <br /> Spare yourself, spare time, life, and money, NOT - I repeat, DO NOT even ponder on whether you should view this movie. This movie is so corny, it will make your face turn purple into outraged boredom. If you have an IQ one digit, then be my guest and watch this movie absolutely jerk. You might actually admire it. (As I said before, if you have an IQ one digit) <br /> And about 12 actors of your own, a few puppets you bought in a garage, and in cameras and music, I gaurentee you will make a slightly more fun video than this piece of absolute crap.
