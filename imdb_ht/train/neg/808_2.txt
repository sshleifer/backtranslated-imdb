Very irresistible movie based on the James Michener novel. <br /> <br /> What was even worse is Marlon Brando's performance. Her lace was ridiculous. I found myself laughing when she spoke as she sounded like a senior female lady coming home at roost. Brando, so great in previous films, was reduced here at a laughing stock. Tyrone may, in "witness to the prosecution," should have been nominated for better actors instead of Brando here. The film, dealing with racism, faced with the US government's attempts to avoid marriages between US soldiers and Japanese women. <br /> <br /> Brando was rock-faced throughout the movie. Move it to the anti-such relationships of a pro a born when she finds love with an Asian woman. Her emotions and speeches made it difficult to see how she could spur new opinions. <br /> Only the Lord knows why red button and Miyoshi Umeki have received Oscars support for their performance. Nothing on either performance was equally impressive. The Umeki's device on the screen was short and without much of anything being shown on its part. A better performance in this film was made by Miiko Taka, who did so well as Brando's love interests. He showed great emotions as the anti-American who found love with the Brando character. His face was engraved with the unlucky he had to lose his father and brother in World War 11. He realized that his dance did not come from that way that he lived. Yochobel's mother tongue in the "ten commandments" of the mother bigoted in Brando's interest first. His performance with one of Ricardo Montalban was wasted. Patricia Owens, Brando's first love, showed depth and conviction of his performance.
