For this review, a list of good points and bad points. I'll start with the bad one. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />, the band, and above all, the whole idea of ​​making a movie feature from a TV set that was not great to start with, despite its popularity. <br /> <br /> Good point: Jessica Simpson in a red bikini ............ that's it! <br /> One can do an analogy here. At the scene where Jessica Simpson as Daisy Duke corrects her way up to Michael Weston as Enos, and asks the question "Enos, where Boss Hogg and Roscoe?", in cloud judgment read, tell her where she might just as well asked, "Enos, this is a good movie?", the red bikini would observe her judgment in saying yes, even in her right mind she would say, No, not really. " As good as she looked into the bikini, she could have been strong naked, and even that would not have saved this horrible piece of film-making. Stay out of Hazzard!
