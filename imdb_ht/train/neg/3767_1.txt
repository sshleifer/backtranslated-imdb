Budget, decent actors ... knew these things were important. Do not waste your time on this junk piece. The effects are crap. The act is crap. The only thing that could make this even tolerated was a little cheap T & A and that gets wasted in the first 20 minutes. Only the same remotely buy quality on this movie is the very awkward layman. It was just as they found only 7 people on the planet who never cursed before. Hats off! <br /> If you want to see some dude in a bad suit just go back and look at old bullet photos. The only way for a Bigfoot block to be any good is to have a great budget and some actors who did not come from Frogballs Community Theater.
