Look, I liked the movie PROPER Anchorman, but this was reaaaaallly bad. The bad type that makes you want you could get this time back to your life, the kind of bad that makes you think "what about Earth they thought this movie in the first place", the kind of bad that makes you want Would you take 50 more minutes when you went into the kitchen to take a snack during the movie, what kind of bad thing that makes girlfriend look fun, the kind of bad that makes you think you want you to rent a movie Pauly Shore instead ... I can not explain how bad this thing was ... I said that ... there were some semi-fun laughs, but they are all so funny than Anchorman. Sure, they tried to make it fun and fun, but the whole subplot that left out of Anchorman who made it here was really leaving out for a good reason ... it was not even a bit good. <br /> Do yourself a favor (or in the USA, a favor), and do not watch this DVD ... it will conceal the good movie that Anchorman is and you do not want to do that. > <br /> Okay ... I'm right now.
