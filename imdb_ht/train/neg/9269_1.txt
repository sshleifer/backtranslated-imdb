Well since seeing the party 1 through 3 I can honestly say that they should never have been part of 4. Everything is out of tacky, and I do mean the tacky note acts really bad, I dare anyone to watch it and should not be bored out of my Spirit. <br /> I mean part 1 to 3 holding the strong vibration on the plot of Damion, but without it around in this one it's just not the same. Make sure at the end of part 3 I got a little tired of the line line to continue, but it was a good closure at the end of the third one. Again there was no reason for a party 4. Even though there might have been a better job than this sh * t I sat in, lol. There are an hour and a half of my life I will never see again.
