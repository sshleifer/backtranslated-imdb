After seeing the trailer for this film and finding out Spike Lee was leading, I was excited about hearing about this event. I was not alive at the time, I did not live in New York, so I expected more of a story lesson than anything. What I had was some fun acting, a lot of sex, and about 30 minutes worth of films that actually had nothing to do with Sam's. I guess the movie was not about Sam's son, but it was a peek at the summer of '77. Label me 'wont. <br /> <br />
