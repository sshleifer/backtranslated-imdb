In 1960, there was a change and up time for most people. Social change and hustle were common as those who spoke out about their views. The racial tensions, policies, Vietnam war, sexual promotions, and drug use were part of a daily fabric, and daily news. This movie tried to include the historical aspects of a fun movie, and hugely successful .. <br /> In this movie, two families follow: one white, one black. During the first half of the film, the story follows every family on an equal basis in social and family struggles. Unfortunately, the second half of the movie is almost dedicated to the white family. Admittedly, there are more characters in this family, and story lines are mixed, but equal considerions are not given to the racial aspect of this century. <br /> <br /> In the whole, is a well-made and historic footage mixed with color and black and white original footage to provide a feeling of documentary in the movie. The film is a fictional work, but the clips of well-known historical figures are used to set the time-line. <br /> I enjoyed the movie but the situation was predictable and the storyline was one-sided.
