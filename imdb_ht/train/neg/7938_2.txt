A family seeking some old neighborhood attractions included in the coffee-book of the father comes through an old, decadent old freak show running by a unique eye-man. When family winds break down when they leave their mouths, they are forced to stay in a nearly abandoned camp that the site has been imprisoned for decades before. <br /> There are many films in 'freak' subgenre in horror, ranging from love to Thriller Todell Browning '(1932) Alex Alex's hilarious' Freaked' (1993). Those are both classic (or soon-to-be and 'Freaked'). 'Side Sho,' however, will never be. But if it ever comes to classic status. . . Well, it will be a clear indication of the sad state of our genre. From the ridiculous opening song of the 17-year-old badman who obviously is greater than her natural mother, this film did not have much to go for it. Writing this was subpar, but not completely awful. . . just boring. The direction was poor, and the rare freak effects were very formidable and incredible. The act was abysmal and the casting was even worse. Anyone who believes the ages of these young adolescent camps should not have met a teenager at a long time. There was far from gore enough & violence to make up for the lack of any kind. . . And when there was a bit of violence, it was not well done at all. And, I can not forget to mention the ending battle scene, with all honesty, some of the worst I ever had ever seen in a movie. In general, this is a sinisterly forgettable and miserable movie that deserves to be left alone at the bottom of the bin in dollars. <br /> <br /> Final verdict: 2.5 / 10.
