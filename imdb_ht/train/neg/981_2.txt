As a great admirer of Marlene Dietrich, I had (finally) viewing this photo very pretty dull. It is Dietrich's first diamond diet film, and the most beautiful blonde in the world is a wheelchair! Bad start. The story is a tremendous, involving a subject that itself hurts myself stealthily: the religious culprit. (Who needs it ???) Try to say, perhaps, that of Dietrich's films (and I've seen most, including "Pittsburgh") this is the only one where even his performance is barely worth seeing. Color photography is OK (this is a very early Release Technicolor), but there is no reason. Casting Rule: C. Aubrey Smith, Basil Rathbone (enough to say?). The only thing of any interest at all is John Carradine's charismatic charisma in a performance as the "Divine Sand," which foretells all that will happen. Suppose "happy ending" is one of the most depressive ever-conceived. But another example of David O. Selznick's reputable reputation (he never made a movie really good? - other than that?) And, for one annoyance, the band of the MGM DVD is a mess, and volume level seemingly random. Very unrecommended.
