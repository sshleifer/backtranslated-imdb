Normally I threw them away like budgetary budgets buddies, but Darkman III is so appallingly unengaging that I feel nothing but despicable. It looks like it feels like a TV show, and it's a particularly shoddy one. The compositions are sparse, the flat lighting, the score and the disjointed effects, and the camerawork is 101 film school. There is no scheme to speak of, the characters are one dimension, and the actors are sleepwalking. Most of the cast looks like they should make soft porn porn ..... In fact, the only reward I received from this mess was spotting the typing spit facing Roxann Biggs-Dawson (B'Elanna Out Star Trek: Voyager) without its Klingon humpback mark. Her skin tone is on two lighter shades than it is in Voyager; either he was wounded down for this role, or blacked up for Voyager. Very unusual way either.
