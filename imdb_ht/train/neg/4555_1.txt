This movie fails to take any of the mystery and intrigue that the book offers. The main point in the book, clicking them, hardly even touching on, let the viewer ask exactly why everyone is making such a big deal about them and why they want to risk their lives. Character development is not good at all. No background or personal development left the audience by really taking care of everything about them, and so the sequence of actions fell flat. <br /> <br /> The search for manuscripts ends abruptly, with no real explanation, do not leave any sense of satisfaction as to what the whole search was for. This is one of the worst adaptations of a book I have ever seen. It is terrible with a waste of time. If you do not read the book, skip the movie and read it. If you have read the book, skip the movie and reread it. <br /> It's almost as if the point of making the movie was to discredit the book, that's how to do it with ridiculous movie this is. It's a shame too, because it could be good to capitalize on it at the height of its success and they probably would be able to find a good senarist and some good actors. Do not waste your time, read the book !!!
