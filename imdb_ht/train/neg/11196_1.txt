My friends and I went out after 15 minutes, and we were not the first. And we tried to get our money back. Theater theater management did not allow this, but they agreed to let us see another movie. The only time we worked to see Dickie Roberts: Old Star Children. As you can say, this was not a memorable night. Probably one of my worst night films. The second closing was due when I saw a double header of Domestic disorder and heist. In conclusion, for the sake of humanity, please do not see the Order.
