As others noted, this would be an excellent Hammer-style film, and it seems to me that as most of the actors were instructed to play it ... but the scenario is so lead, poorly paced, and filled with a lot of dull soliloquies (Timothy Dalton poor is sealed and most of them) that it's all too strangely and self-important. This is a performance that does not work well in Dalton, although it's slowly nailing climatic scenes where Dr. Rock finally realizes what he has done. The only actor that comes in really good is Patrick Stewart who is a much appreciated eye. Freddie Francis may have been a great movie, but it was a disgusting director.
