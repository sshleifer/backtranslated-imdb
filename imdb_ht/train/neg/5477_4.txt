Take a SciFi Original Movie and mix in a little alternative / revisionist story, and find "Aztec Rex." Apparently Hernand Cortes, before the victory of the Aztec Empire, first conquered a Tyrannosaurus Rex and his companion. This violence in this movie. Given the scheme he could really suck; The fact that it only kind of aspired is a tip of the writer's cap. There are some issues. For starters, Cortes play by Ian Ziering. Even with a black wig, Ziering as side is about as compelling as Axl Rose plays Gandhi. Though Cortes conquer the indigenous peoples of Mexico, the Aztecs here seem to be played by an all-Hawaiian ensemble. Save the T-Rex (read) look reasonably good, though each time one of them will shoot it just oozed CGI. And they die very easily; I suppose if a T-Rex was around in real life they probably might fall or at least be wounded by some rather rudimentary weapons, the 16th-century gun. But it takes something away from the movie. There are also some T-Rex-swallow-man graphics, which are surprising, but in the context I thought they worked OK. There are many actions, and the whole colonization angle is prevalent at all, but not so tore dinosaurs corner, unlike other contemporary SciFi Original Dinosaur films "The Warbirds." In general, a mediocre (but decent by SciFi Original Standard) movie that rates a modest 4.
