Anyone who actually had the ability to sit in this movie and walked away feeling like it was a good movie does not appreciate quality movies. This movie was a crime to watch, the direction was the kind of class movie class as well as movies. The Blair Witch Project had the best movies and I hate moving with a passion! The scenario has the potential to be a very good movie film very well but it falls flat from the first 10 minutes of the rest of the movie. Someone mentioned that this film was about a child's imagination, okay that's fine and fine. But they can always do the best thing with this script than they did. I mean coming off, the Indian at the store. Does the kid look at the little idol and suddenly imagine the American and the whole story about an American spirit called Wendigo? Which are mentioned in the shop staff and it casually says no one but me that works here, so you think okay climbing ghost scenarios, but then it just barters for the amount on the idol and we forget about the little kid to see this guy. That was so lame it went beyond pathetic. The ending let you ask not only what happened to Otis in the hospital, but also with the OMG feel. Why hell did I just waste my time watching this !! This is a move that I recommend PA to look, there are definitely better quality outdoor films that will not insult your intelligence! Thanks to God I never had to pay for this film, I would ask my money back! For those who were easily entertained by this movie ... it's very sad that you lower your standards at this level of film making actually say it was a good movie.
