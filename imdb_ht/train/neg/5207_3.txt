Anemic comedy-drama, a happy, seemingly fun running featuring Cher as a high-tech housewife who slowly makes friends and hits-those who were hired to be killed by her husband. Chazz Palminteri, as the gun employee box, fits the scenario from his own play, with stagy set-ups and rear-and-out dialogues that quickly tackle the eye and ears. A time of the gloom hanging on the whole project, and director Paul Mazursky can not find Cher from his time funk (it's smooth). Despite all the talent themselves (including Robert De Niro as one of the producers), "faithful" is fake, with no substance in the story and characters that rarely come to life. * 1/2 from ****
