How did I ever appreciate this dude to an end? All he does throw balls! Worst of all, it does not compare with the same first installment of the series! The comedy is suffering from not funny. Where did all the unwitting street go? Ase slapstick on-the-field action goes on too long. Bob Uecker literally saved this one from a closed nine-locked shutdown. What's next, MAJOR LEAGUE 4: RETURNING LEAGUE? Ehh, ta ka! Leave this one on the shelf and plan a trip to the All-Star game. This was three more strikes.
