Scary movie 3 (2003) was a bad idea to start with. The last movie was a mediocre effort. Put it next to this charge, it's a classic comedy. Both parties were filled with a lot of humorous dates and cheap shots, at least it was funny. There is nothing funny about forced humor. Jokes, pratfalls and gag their eyes are naturally funny. Hit the viewer on the head and tired jokes is not cool. The humor of this movie was to attract juvenile gardener who will laugh at anything. When they treated people in high school, they felt no sense of respect for the windows themselves. Ring parody are not funny. I watched them in comedy since 1998. They're so dating. Michael Jackson jokes are not cool either. What's even worse makes the fun of breaking the "performers" having the best days NEVER. The death of American cinema was a slow one. Films like this are the nails that are hit in his coffin. Whatever happened to real humor? I was not laughing out loud in a movie theater in a very long time. Too bad cinema rot in the brain. Do you want to prove? Go to your local mega video store store and see what's in the shelves. This movie is bad. Do not believe the hype. I'd rather watch scary movie 2 in a continuous village than to suffer from this poor excuse of a comedy ever again! <br /> <br /> Definitely not recommended (unless you have a handful of brain cells).
