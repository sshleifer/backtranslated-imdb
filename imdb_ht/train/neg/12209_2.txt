Years ago, when I was a poor teenager, my best friend and brother both had a policy that the person picking the movie would have to pay. And, while I never paid to see some of the craps I took, I could not resist a free trip to the movies! That's how I came to see crap like the second movie Conan and NEVER say no more! Now, despite this being a miserable movie, it is in their entertaining place to look - in a dead brain dead way. And, technically, the cascades and cameras work are good, so this raises my rating all the way to a 2! So why is the movie so bad? Well, unlike the first rambo film, this one has virtually no conspiracy, Rambo herself only says about 3 words (other than grunts and yells), has a futile and romantic "romance" to completely irrelevant and unfamiliar "romance" and The movie is one giant (and stupid) special effect. And what STUPIFYINGLY AWFUL special effects. While 12383499143743701 bullets and rockets were shot in Rambo, there is no effect on it and almost every bullet or ramp shoots arrows hit its mark! And, while the bad guys are using AK-47s, helicopters and rockets, in some scenes all Rambo has been a bow and arrow and that looks like nuclear-powered guides !! The scene where one guy is bad is shooting at him as he slowly and calmly launches one of these explosive arrows particularly made for mute viewers! It was nice parody of UHF to begin Weird Al. Plus, HOT SHOTS, PART DEUX also makes a funny parody of the genre - not just this stupid scene. <br /> <br /> All-in-all, a movie so dumb and pointless, it's almost like self-parody!
