I've read all 'A wave of time books' and then see the movie. The film has all the elements in the book, but since the book was 190 pages and the film was 2 hours it felt really stacked in with too much and bad effects. <br /> <br /> A rush of time is about a girl named Meg, Charles Wallace, and Calvin must team together to find Meg's dad and get to the Camazotz island. <br /> The beginning of the movie is really a stinker. The act is terrible, the direction is ridiculous, and so far situations are not needed. I really broke to see the same person Madeleine Engle who wrote the book and created the movie, made a great book, with a terrible movie. The act is worse than any right-to-video acting. Yes, I got to admit there was cool effect. But seriously they were all very strong and not serial in any way possible. If you read the book you will break into the movie. I wish to give it a 0 but sadly I can only give it 1. A half could be helpful.
