This film is a re-recorded in the 1978 Warren Beatty film, "The Sky Can Wait," but she writes for the stand-up comedy style of Mr Rock. The first thing remains the same: Lance Barton, (Rock) is taken before his life is up and works a deal with God's representative, Mr. King, and have come back to earth as someone else. As in Beatty's movie; He chose Charles Wellington's murder, a wealthy white man, because his fantasy Sontee Jenkins (Regina King) is going to turn to Wellington's home during the assassination. The role of Mr. Wellington and his girlfriend suffers from this rumor and the idea of ​​turning a multi-millionaire white age into a black comedy stand that tries to pink pink Sontee simply does not work. Also intercuts are used to show Rock as Wellington and then as Wellington's real 'white', fail misery. The improvements made to the original Beatty scheme - which in itself did not masterfully decorate the idea of ​​life-after-death - but certainly could not get to "down on Earth".
