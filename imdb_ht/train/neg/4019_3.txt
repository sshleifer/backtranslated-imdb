Dakota (1988) was another good Lou Lou Diamond Phillips starring machine. This film resembles the Harley movie later released. There are a few differences but they are both the same. I do not know who came first. I guess it will remain one of the mysteries of life. But they are both troubled "kids" who are trying to turn around to have life around. Instead of this one bike involves horses. They're basically the same movie and they're both cheesy as hell. If you are a serious L.D.P. Fans then I recommend that you look them both. You get some extreme mugging and posturing from L.D.P. if you play then go for it. <br /> <br /> Not recommended, except for L.D.P. fanatic !!!
