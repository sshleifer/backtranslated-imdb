Hooper is not funny, not rhythmic, romantic and non-informative. There is no real drama. You would think that a movie about the greatest stuntman in the world would have some theater, there was an attempt but it did not seem real. No study study, no lessons learned, it does not seem like the actors had any real fun, they just tried to act like they had fun. There is no reason to look unless you like to look Burt and want to get an occasional glimpse of Sally. The horse's prancer was beautiful and did what he was supposed to do. In fact, Prancer was the best actor in this film. Smoking and the bandit was such a fun movie that I was ready to love Hooper. This film has become a real disappointment and waste of time
