Marty's nerd school (Simon Scuddamore) is sexually humiliated by a bunch of classmates and then is in a lab explosion (put by them) where his face is scarred by acid. Years later all courses are found to return to the high school (since closing) for a reunion. What they did not know is that Marty invited them to kill them. Then a storm starts, they are locked in school and Marty starts to take revenge. <br /> <br /> Pretty funny. The Murders are invented and gory and there are some atmospheric creepy vaccinations in the desert school - but that's about it. The humiliations inflicted on Scuddamore are more than cruel (it has stripped, has itself dunked in a toilet and gets burned) and they are just comfortable watching. Considering Scuddamore committed suicide shortly after this was released to make almost impossible to see. Also this film goes out of its way to have nudity. There are all in front of the car in Scuddamore (surprising for any movie) but a girl decides to take a bath alone ... AFTER to know a killer is wandering around! Then there's the couple having sex. This is the kind of movie where the killer looks to know where everyone will do and can teleport itself. It ends with a twist of my groaning and rolling my eyes then another twist that I want to send something heavy on the TV! The act is heat - not good, but bearable. Caroline Munro is in this too. She is a very beautiful woman, but not much of an actress. This gets a 3 for some throat bite effort and atmosphere. Otherwise it runs in the factory and forgettable. The Scuddamore's tragic suicide has given this film more attention than it deserves.
