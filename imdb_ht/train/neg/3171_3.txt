Was this the greatest movie that I've ever seen? No. Was it worse? No. <br /> As a mother of four children, it is nice to look something that was light and fun. It was great, but it was beautiful. <br /> I think it definitely had some improved room, but she tried. <br /> I'm not sure if this film deserves extreme levels of abuse from the other criticism. They obviously do not care for Eva Longoria. I think it was best in this passing through the Sentinel. I think movies are a matter of opinion. The actors play a major role in whether it is a hit or a flop. <br /> <br /> Maybe the throw did not work out. Maybe there was too much going on. <br /> I just wanted to talk up for an average movie, not one terrible. It might just be a chick movie chick. Types like the Split-Up movie or kiss in French. My husband still speaks of these. :)
