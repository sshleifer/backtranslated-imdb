I can not believe anyone thought there was anything original or interesting about this movie. I'm a fan of science fiction as much as the next guy, and I can enjoy even old movies and ridiculous premises as long as they are written by someone other than a monkey. (See, for example, glowing reviews at Altered States [1980].) A monkey could explain best exactly why I should be for a second to take seriously the core idea behind this movie. The problem is not that the producers had a low budget - it's that they did not care. <br /> Now in publicly humiliating magazines are worthless that glowing review appears on the box: <br /> <Chicago Court </ span> <br /> San Francisco Chronicle <br /> <br /> San Francisco Give Guardians <br /> <br /> (Actually, I love reading the two letters. Still, the movie credibility reviews went to the floor. But I know if I've ever made a movie with a camera camera, a cheesy plot with stupid effect, I'll show it to these journalists and remind them of what Ada's concept was.)
