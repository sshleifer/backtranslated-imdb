Since its release in 1983, "A Christmas Story", the story of Jean Shepherd-storytelling of his changed-month, Ralphie, became a true classic. "My Summer Story", however, still has Shepherd as the narrator, but she has absolutely none of the charm, and the characters are nowhere near the caliber of the original film. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Charles Grodin, who I normally love, is very unlike the role of the father (more justified by Darren McGavin in the original), and his character never seems anything but forced. Kiernan Culkin is a poor substitute for Ralphie, and the younger brother all but forgot here. Only mom seems to have any value here and maybe because she's been weighting a movie manager and a saucer boat when she pushes her luck too far with irate threats on "free night flat". They are mostly inconvenient and thin paper-thin. Let's appeal to the very independence but as an end to "A Christmas story", it's a very poor one and not worth most people's time. 2 out of 10.
