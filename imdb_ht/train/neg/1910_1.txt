I tried to watch this so-called comedy, but it's very hard to carry. This is a bad, narrow-minded, movie-ridden movie. Definitely not funny, but very boring and annoying, indeed. Bad script, bad act. It's a complete waste of time - and there's nothing more to say, I'm scared. <br /> 1 of 10 points.
