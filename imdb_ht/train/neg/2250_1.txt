Rock star Jan Norman Howard (Kris Kristofferson) turns singer Esther Hoffman (Barbra Streisand) into a star singing star. Esther's Esther rose while John went into decline, thanks to drugs and alcohol. After two hours, John makes the top-destructive-red-conversion-160-MPH-crack-up-on-a-desert-high-speed thing. The best thing about this film is the music, especially the song, "Evergreen." Barbra Streisand sings well, but you can not take it seriously as a star-and-coming star, when it is * already * a star. The first time she looks, singing in a bar goes off, she looks like a star singing star that slumming for the night, not like an unknown hassle that tries to launch his singing career. It's too confident, too professional. His apartment looks like a page from "Living Apartment," by some hole-in-the-wall apartments where a real singer struggles to live. Christ Kriserson's self-centered, out-of-the-rock rock star as well ... as a singer who tries to be an actor but has little skill to act. The direction is warm, the story is slow and dull. But the worst thing about this movie is not to act, or the lame direction, or the story slowly. It's the hair! After staring at Kristofferson's hairstyle and the terrible Streisand 70 bronze for 2 + hours, your eyes hurt.
