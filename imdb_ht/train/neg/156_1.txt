The worst warrior would have been an animated series because as a movie it's like watching an old old man on the acid. The movie just starts from nowhere and people just fly around fighting with metal wings and other stupid weapons until this sacrificed princess himself for his lover on a cloud or something.What this princess is a god or an angel is beyond me, but soon enough this van flying bad guys come in and kill him, while the guy with the razor wings fights some other mysterious god / demon / wizard The plot line is either no or very difficult to follow you need to be insanely clever to get this movie. The work soon follows this Deadly Chinese has been called on by this god to fight the evil flying, Princess kills bad guys and soon we have a very bad choreographer Uwe Boll as battles scene complete with terrible martial arts on a hill or something.Even the visuals Some strange words can be said to be stunning and colorful but I'm going to tell them is blurry and vibrant Hacking like acid (yes that's a word!) .I watch it both armed with subtitles and both were equally bad and hard to understand ... who I am sorry I did not understand it at all. Feeling like I've watched the episode 30 of the 1980's anime and completely missed how the story started or like I started reading a comic series of 5 at number 4 because I had no signs of how this stuff started it was gone or how it might end I've lost forever.I can honestly say this was one of the worst movie experiences ever to have been as watching Inu-Yasha's episode 134 drinking. .. yeah that's fine you do not know what hell is going on. If your brain is trying to figure out this out.
