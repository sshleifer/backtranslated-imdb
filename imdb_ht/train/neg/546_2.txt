Those 2 points are dedicated to reasonable performance at Akshay Kumar. I know Bollywood movie does not really make efforts to be realistic but PLEASE a Walt Disney production is much more real than this draw. Dad is dying and doing all that good parents do ... kicks the son out of the son and his wife PREGNANT. A few things that were too hard to swallow - 1. Priyanka 'fresh indoor pool in the bedroom' and going out of their hunger in his in-law gardening ???????? 2. Akshay suddenly got the job as a cascading person, gets bitten by repaid dog, then just walks. This film is an INSULT of our intelligence I really can not believe I contribute financial to the 'people' who made this movie by taking my family to see it, we left the movie with a roar, please do not mind the mind This mess is watching this take my advice and do not waste your 'watch'.
