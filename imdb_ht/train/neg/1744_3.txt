I watched the movie "Boeing Boeing" Malayalam made in 1985 (which in turn is probably inspired by an English movie of the same name) long ago. The basic story of garam masala is the same - but it is said in a pathetic way, the stylish jokes replaced by these routines that are found in normal Hindi movies (probably the director made this taste suits in Hindi audiences ) ... <br /> I have not seen the original English. But really enjoyed the Malayalam movie (made by Priyadarshan himself) who was a side split comedy, back then. Of course, acting by Mohanlal, Mukesh and Sukumari (who performed the role of the cook) was so natural and spontaneous. <br /> <br /> Probably, I'm too struck by the Malayalam movie that I can not tolerate even the slightest flaw in its Hindi renewal. But I still feel that Akshay Kumar and John Abraham were overacted. Paresh Rawal has done a decent job - but it does not happen anywhere near Sukumari. <br /> But all of its OK, if one compares it to other recent comedy Hindi movies.
