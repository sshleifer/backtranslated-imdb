I said this is a terrible movie, for the only fact that when you see this film on the guide, it is listed as a documentary. As I watched her, I started laughing, thinking myself, doing this guy actually expected me to believe that this is real? So I had to watch it, and now see that it is a movie, but now since it is not a documentary, it is now a movie and bad acting. So either way, it is very bad. I actually did not do it in the end. I had to close it. I am a NYC police officer, and I felt that someone was trying to deceive the person thinking that's a documentary, with the intentions of making money on a terrible day for me and my colleagues. So I took it a little personal. Perhaps I was blind by that, and it is not as bad as I personally think it is. Everyone has their own opinions.
