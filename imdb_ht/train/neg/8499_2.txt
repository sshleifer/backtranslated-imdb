This is the sort of thing that's just now jerking the eggheads movie. After all, the Crash Flex Feierstein will have you know that Real Men do not look anything by Truffaut. <br /> <br /> It might have been interesting if Truffaut had anything - like - here. The camera-like-like motif was nothing new. Do we all forget "The Sikon Steal De Sica"? Or anything by Hitchcock? So all we find is the extreme metaphor of the juvenile as Truffaut, who spends all free time he 'fucks up his eyes' in the films, who debris the school discipline, was accused of plagiarism (many flights in little), and finally saved society's propaganda to make his own movie. I'm sorry ... was there, doing so too many times for this problem.
