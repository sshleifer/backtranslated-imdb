This movie was bad because there was nothing interesting about it. It was sort of a remake but then again, not really. I was very disappointed to consider the tools that Tim Burton had at his disposal. It has great deal with CGI that is available with lots of money ($ 100 million) but you can honestly say that what we got was as good as the original movie made for less than $ 6 million? Hey no. So in that regard, the movie fails. <br /> At least in the original movie, the statue of freedom scene was shocking but there was nothing shocking about this movie at the end of the scene because you could kind of see it coming. And, by the way, if you give some thought, and I did, you can know how the finish can come up. I just want to have returned times when I waste my thoughts on it. <br /> This movie would be brilliant and fun if it was on the lines of the first movie and adopted a part of "Under the Planet of the Hills". Here's how I would write it: <br /> An astronaut (it really should have been more than Mark Mark because it's not good enough to care for a movie all alone so I'd put in three guys) Would it be a country that would think of another planet, meeting people (not fearless), a city that was ruled by holy, being driven, made friends with some good good, discovering that they are going to earth through some crushed crushes , end up running under mad mutant living under the ground, a war broke out between the mutant people and the pan, and then .... well, let your imagination run wild on how you want to finish it. But my point is that this movie could have been much more. Unfortunately, Tim Burton really knows how to destroy a good thing. Consider what he did with the Batman series. He is a pervert director inspite what people think. It is so trendy that it should be good to think. Sorry, but no. If anyone else made this movie, he might get far better and would be far more satisfied.
