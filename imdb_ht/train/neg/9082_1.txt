This is the worst movie I've ever seen. I was deceived by thinking he might be good because a couple of my favorite actors in it. Now I want to punch Jason Schwartzman in the face to take that role. I was physically ill after watching this movie. I really do not understand Hollywood sometimes. There are many people trying to break into that I'm sure you can skim to the top and get the very best. In this way the worst movie you do is equivalent to Ferris Beullar instead of this storage. The gags like the hair doll and blatant cut on jeans advertising added to the immorality of the movie. Glad I Avoid This Movie And Watch It On TV. This proves that you should avoid January releasing at all cost.
