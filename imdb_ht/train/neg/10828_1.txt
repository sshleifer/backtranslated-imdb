Not only do I consider verdict on this film, but also about many of those who have written about it. Now, do not get me wrong here either, I'm not a total philistine, I did not hate the movie because it was not enough like '9 academy police' or whatever, i enjoy more than my fair share of big head or artwork, I swear. <br /> <br /> 'Magnolia' is poor, and I honestly mystified as to why it is seemingly for acclaim. Long reversed, self indulgent, nonsense ransom begins to end, there is just little that might be believably what people like on the movie. There are some high gauge actors just enough, with no turning at an average or worse performance. In addition, my wife (a self-confessed Tom Cruise hate) tells me that her best career performance is far from. But the plot is so completely engaged, the flow between the stories of several characters connects to such a snail speed that even when significant lives change the show events seem unusually and refreshing to find yourself crying out for someone to blow or something . <br /> It does not help that any of the characters are very easy to identify or empower with (well I did not think so, but I do not like most people admitted). They all play life stories rather than the essence of great lengths, demonstrating the imperfections of characters and emotions of ever-so complicated details and playing out deep relationships with their essence in the nth degree and a lot of a waffling soliloquy en route. Yadda yadda yadda. Remember the bit as well, with this merit-suckingly irritating quality that I've hitherto considered unique in the music of Alanis Morisette. <br /> <br /> All in all, it was about as enjoyable a three hour being forced to repeat to watch an 'Friend' episode as being intermittently poked in the ribs by a newspaper goat. Bit and frogs are good though.
