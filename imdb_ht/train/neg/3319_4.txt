I was surprised when I saw this film. I would have heard it was best ever to film in the novel. How shame I was. <br /> <br /> How any fan of Jane Austen fans can rate this adapter is a mystery of my eyes. The scriptwriters have decided to stick to ridiculous humor bits that are embarrassing at the best of times, but also ruin the feeling of the period. As for the cast: Gwyneth Paltrow makes a rather talented heroine (but then any 'hot' American star would be skeptical of the role), Toni Collette is bad, and poor Ewan McGregor has made them look ridiculous! <br /> /> I really could not say a good thing about this movie. I seem to be among the very non-percentage rates, but if you want my advice, see instead the TV production begins by Kate Beckinsale - believe me, which is far preferable to this superficial waste.
