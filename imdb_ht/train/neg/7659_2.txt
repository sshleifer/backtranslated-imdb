Alone in the dark is one movie film and tied up with Deuce Bigalow for the worst movie of the year. I wish that was ALL I said but of course the IMDb stats a word count with all that. <br /> I'm in two minds that kind of bad movie is a worse kind of bad movie. A small budget budget like Red Cuba Area, a monster goes with manos. Or a great budget shame like Gigli, Superbabies or this guff. You see movies like Monster Go Go and Manos happen because the director is not a sign. Movies like this happen because the director is a stupid, acute madness that simply does not care about his audience. It's more shocking when you consider that Uwe Boll (the Master behind this spitting spit and already has some real garbage under his belt) created something that's just happening once in a blue moon. The movie is terrible terribly bad bad. Everything about it is a mess. CGI cheese, draw bad, crazy random camera functions and soundtrack agitation. <br /> <br /> Alone in the dark is a weighing film that should look absolutely no. Woo Hoo! Review about. Give me a bud, roll over 2006 and I NEVER talk about this again. <br /> Do not watch this movie.
