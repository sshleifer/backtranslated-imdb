Five passengers on a bus stop tell each other their dreams while waiting to be collected. But are there more things that nightmare than meeting the eye? <br /> <br /> Lucky me, five bad movies for the price of one! Each segment features the worst of acting, special effects, make up and music. And what were supposed to be scary? Hmm .. I think I was more freeze out during an episode of Teletubbies. I swear, you will sit there as I was, bored with tears waiting in vain for something interesting to happen. Do not bother. He never did. In fact, I have stopped fast advertising advertising, as a good deal more fun than the main feature. AND finishing is the last cop. Yes, none of this actually ever happened. If only the same can be said for the day, I put my VCR in these Cobblers files. 2/10
