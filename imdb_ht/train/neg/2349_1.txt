There was a great movie to be made on Steve Biko. Unfortunately it did not read. Denzel Washington - never more flexible in actors - is totally able to convey the great charisma that Biko has. The great Attenborough crowd scene is ridiculous. Massacre of Soweto did not like this, three clean lines of kids (some do cartwheels!) Walking happily at the guns of the soldiers. With Biko dies the movie rapidly down to farce. If the struggle against Apartheid was nothing it was a struggle of the black man again somehow we all supposed to be gripped by the escape of a white man and his family. I'm sure Donald Woods was a decent man and would be the first to say that Biko was important while he did not. Penelope Wilton's action is most Hampshire and it seems completely unaware that it is in South Africa at all. at all. Dog's family dog ​​gets more lineage than the black maid. As the family escaped one woman I saw the movie with - incidentally the only one about a dozen black people in a big, full movies - "This is like the sound of music." He had a point. Overall this is a film not a good intention if a bit inferior to white liberal on a black radical person's struggle. And really South Africa needs well-intentional liberal colors like it needs a hole in the head.
