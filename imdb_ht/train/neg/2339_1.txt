This swirl movie looks more like a combination of music-clips in MTV than a real movie. There is no real story and how the movie goes on you ask yourself: "What will happen?"; but nothing happens. The story around Eric Cloeck, frustrated writer, is the only good thing. Others seem to have nothing in common: then why bring them together in a movie. With music you can make watchable the worst movie. When I open the tap and there come out water and music in Bach then most people will like to look at it, but this is not a movie. The principal should learn how to write a script for a movie in 100 minutes or more before you start directing a movie.
