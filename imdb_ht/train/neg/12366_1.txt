"Loonatics unleashed" is the worst thing that could happen to the classic characters created by Chuck Jones. The "Lone Tunes" have many turn-offs and different versions, some were good, others are not many .But "Loonatics" is the worst .The concept is stupid and derivative of shows as the "Rangers" and "Titans teen ". There was no similarity with the original characters and stories they're boring and wrong doing. The new drawings are ugly and the animation is pathetic. Show this just does not work .This horrible mess in animation is a complete failure and this should not be anything more than a bad joke. Lame! Zero stars
