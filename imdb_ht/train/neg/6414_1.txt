This is not the worst piece of cr4p I've ever seen in my life. It barely makes sense. He was not scared all (unless you are scared as loud and screaming) Sara-Michelle Gellar needs to stop with these sh1tty horrors. I think everyone else in the cinema agreed with me when I called "SHITE" when credit was rolling. <br /> In my list of the worst films ever made this is how it would go: <br /> <br /> 1. The return 2. Fever cabin 3. Silent Hill <br /> < The reason I made Silent Hill 3rd is because it showed some scary scenes, but the rest was absolute cr4p. Even with cabin fever, there was no sense, but the return of the list. It's worse than Silent Hill and Cabin Fever put together
