At least among those movies that have 100 votes or more. Nomination for best scenario writing directly to the screen? Brenda Blethyn nominated for best actress in a leading role? Nomination for Best Photos ?? I still agree with many of the Oscar Peaks, but this movie might very well be the worst movie ever to be honored at the Academy. Writing with the story was both horrible. Blennyn's particular performance was one of the worst I've ever seen, and probably more than-rated acting performance at all times. Movie film, not worth the screen and is not worthy of any channel or TV channel ever played, including HBO (where I saw it). I'm just grateful I did not actually pay to see one of the most sub-rated cinemas of all time.
