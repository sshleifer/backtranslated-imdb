Note that all mad scientists everywhere: if you're going to turn your son into a genetically mutated monster, you need to give him a name tougher than "Paul." I do not care if it is a scary anxiety shark with a throat of the wrist-sharp wrist and the ability to embrace people in the water as well as on dry ground. Give the kid a name worth more like, "Thor," "Rock," or "Tiburon." Because even if he eats me up I will probably just sit there laughing, "Ha! Get a charge to this !!! The monster Paul is arrested me in shredded !!!!!" This is the worst part of this film is, this shark is referred to as "Paul" throughout the whole file. He did what could be a decent, horror film movie just looks amazing. Not that there is no other culture and optimally part of "Hammerhead: Shark Frenzy." Scientists are spending the entire movie lost on this island, and all of a sudden one of the girls starts craving rashes from walking through the lush forest, and just pours water on his feet to relive the rash, which of course allow "Paul" out of the water and kill him. SciFI Channel at one thing did this in this movie left the hottie live. But this is a little silver lining in an otherwise irritating cinema.
