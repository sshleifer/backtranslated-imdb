With a title like that, it's above and beyond my understanding of how this film just did not appeal to me. Granted, there are some tricky and somewhat gigantic moments of decent, but the way in which the shotgun film and storyline in general just hit me as an idiotic attempt and lazy in tactical "shock" profits ... The consistent conspiracy begins and a guy raped and killed a woman trapped in the side of the road. He and his shelter brothers are in prison up to the brother breaking out and arranging meeting his girlfriend from the woods. He ends up forcing him to go to a house where he is in the wrong direction and later shows him a collection of men kidnapped in the basement. Prisoners are heavy drugs composed of her old boyfriend who raped her, a neighbors "neighbors," and her boss abrasive. He explains that he will kill them all. He winds up his killing and then turns him focus on the guys (or pigs) whom he tortured and killed, himself ... Most of the violence and humiliation made with ch! Food and Genitalia to destroy - all of which are far from disturbing and essentially mild. The best scene is a graphic masturbation manipulator graph followed by some hurtful people ... Surely, "I spit on your body, IP! Ss on your tone" was born as an official end to " I spit on your tone "- based, especially the title, with a reference to the main character given - suggests that his mother was Camille Keaton. I personally consider that to be a wildly inflamed blasfem! This movie is a boring, humorous disorder that strives for shock but fails miserably.
