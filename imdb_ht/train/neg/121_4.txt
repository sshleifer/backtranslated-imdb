Anyone who wrote the cinema for this movie obviously never consulted any book about Lucille Ball, especially his autobiography. I have never seen many errors in a biopic, ranging from his early years to Celoron and his Jamestown later years with Desi. I could write a whole list of real errors, but it would go on for the pages. In all, I believe that Lucille Ball is one of those inimitable people who simply can not be described by anyone other than themselves. If I were Lucie Arnaz and Desi, Jr., I would honor how many mistakes were made in this movie. Filmists tried hard, but the movie seemed awfully sloppy to me.
