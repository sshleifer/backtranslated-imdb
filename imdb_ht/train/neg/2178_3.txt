I would enjoy this movie a little more was not for Jason (Herb) Evers constant harping on experience. Many early reviews of the seven samurai accused Toshiro Mifune of overacting. But as more and more critics have seen that films have seen it as being done. Jason Evers is obviously not Toshiro Mifune, and her excitement is exactly that. <br /> <br /> Most of the actors of this classic B were rather good actors, fewer Evers and their showgirls. If you watch this movie, you would notice Evers shouting almost every line, until it smokes and blows the smoke out of his nose. <br /> <br /> The special effects have been par for the course of a movie B like this one. In retrospect, there is not much that means out of my mind as fantastically good or bad for this movie.
