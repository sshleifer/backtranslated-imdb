I can not believe I watch this wait more. It starts out OK. This film pushes the limitations of reality in far! At least the first one was a bit realistic. It rips in the movie first and even mentions Joshua Project. Anyone who knows anything about the computer will hate this movie. He does have a good message of it though, WATCH OUT TO BIG BROTHER !!! The movie just makes it seem like Big Brother is a bigger way than it actually is in reality. That was very aggravated. The same make-up on the actors was completely bad. Some of the act is very good. Some of the act is really bad though. The script was OK at some point and completely messed up in other parts. This movie plays on convenience every five minutes. As I said, I can not believe I was expecting to expect more. I think I'll pop into the original to get back to earth ... K
