The film is basically a boring string of appalling clits that do not offer a real cross-cultural insight. The Middle East on the tour describes in a particularly disappointing way: there are obviously mud village mud, dust tracks in the middle of the desert, women clad in black clothes and belly dancers. I wonder how camels and palm dates were missing in the whole picture. The personality of the two main characters is very cleverly sketched and many situations are hardly credible. <br /> <br /> The original idea might be interesting, but at the end of the day if you are looking for cultural insight, you should skip this movie.
