I walked from very few movies before they finished, but I could not finish this piece of waste. This was the biggest charge of racism trying to pass as legitimate film since "born in a nation". The characters were little more than cutout boxes. I do not see how any actor wants their names to associate with this movie. Lee should have the best thing to do to make that out of the trash. I know that I and anyone with a brain have the best thing to do .... like watching dry paint. I wish that someone would make a movie about interfaith relationships that faced the issue really realistically. There is a lot more depth in this topic ranting to the bottom of a bitter director like Lee.
