O my God, it was very bad! The story was weak - at best - and the animation was flat and thinner - even childish. This movie takes itself too seriously ... unless of course they are meant to be funny. I saw this last week at the London Sci-Fi Festival and the audience all laughed at each scene. I think my favorite was 'should not you have to study medicine in Oopsalof'! And I think they tried to see how many times they could be inflamed by Nicalo's only character 'we're going together ... it's our destiny.' I'm sorry but after the first time, words have lost all meaning. <br /> And what was the apple? I recommend this as an American lesson: You can not host, so please do not try. You only embarrass yourself.
