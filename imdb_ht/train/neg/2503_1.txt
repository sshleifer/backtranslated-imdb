What a poor excuse for New zealnd films make. I'm sorry to call myself a new Zealander when this film exists and it actually plays on TV New Zealand TV (Aug 2006). The cast is made up of a large number of local soap stars. The boat, in real life, is one of the inter-island ferries that travel daily from the two main islands and even have the company logo (a dolphin) still all over the range including on the boat coach. The boat must have a cruise ship / ferry between the USA and Mexico. It has clear signs of rust and old age all over the place is supposed to be a luxury boat on the trip to her maiden. One of the scenes shows the snow capped head to the South Island island in the background for God's sake! You must have a very cold time in the USA / Mexico area! The story is weak, the act is weaker with the new Zealand / American accents just do not work. I hope the New Zealand tax farmer has contributed to the cost of pricing of this film and that was a waste of money better than on a real production. I know high school kids in New Zealand who could do better movies and cell phones. Goof: There is a truck in the holding and tagging on it and stuck a sign of Taco company on the door of the truck, presumably making it look like it was Indian. Here are some of the signs that are on top of the tagging - you would think that they would notice that in the department's props before attaching it. I would like to go on but it just is not worth the problem in any way.
