This is a very bad movie. The plot is sentimental to boil. I suppose the production values ​​are OK, decent photography, negligence and all that. Mak Hamill was awful. I have never been very busy with it, and this film validates that perception. It's not surprising that he never really had any sort of career aside in his "Star Wars" movie. I'll just say "Buh-bye, Mark" as it sinks in well worthy obscure. On the other hand, a very young Annie Potts completely steals the show. She has shown charm, beauty, and acting all in one performance. I remember seeing him in "Texasville" lately and taking notes in her beauty. It's interesting to see her from ten years earlier. Anyway, unless you are interested in Miss Potts, run away from this film screaming for the hills.
