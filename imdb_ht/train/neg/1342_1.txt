This film is the freshman effort of Stephanie Beaton and her new production company. While suffering from a few problems, as every budget low output makes, it's a good start for Mrs. Beaton and her company. The story is not very terribly new to films like Burning's and every Friday 13 years since part 2. But the heartbreaking performances. So many great budget cinemas just have the actors going to the motions, still its nice to see actors really trying to exchanged their craft. <br /> <br /> The story deals with the murder (and possible returns) to a disguised conductor. Others are swearing secret, but the trauma of the event sends everybody in different directions in their lives. Ten years later, friends are murdered one by one by a stalker who has earned the "Tackle". Who will survive? You must look. If you are Roger Ebert or any number of critical arrogants, you probably should not bother. And if your taste runs more towards Joe Bob Briggs and you want to see a group of people honing the craft, then check out the "Bend".
