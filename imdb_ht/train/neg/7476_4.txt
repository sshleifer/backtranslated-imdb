Foreigners must be a great debt to Peter Jackson's early film Bad taste with Braindead.I must confess never enjoy these films and I say the same thing about this. Jake West is a director who clearly lacks the inspiration of his own and choosing to jump from those who it looks up. I lost counting the amount at times a major Hollywood movie was quoted most famous to James Cameron aliens. The amount of blood and gore on shows here is not funny either , the end end of the film gets tired and dragged out.Maybe it would have worked better as a short film. The poorer operators, the direction is weak and the scheme is non existent.I can see what the director was Trying to do, the homage he was trying to pay, but others did the same thing better than presented here. 4/10
