After that I thought myself, there are either some good writers & directors or many producers. At any speed, this is a terrible movie. Terrible in such a way that it is not fun, but rather to grab your teeth and earthquake. Make you call "this wrong" in the movie. Immersion is zero. Since most of you are probably using the terrible / weirdness-esters in movies with hackers etc. in them. This movie is like this in every aspect. <br /> <br /> The only good thing about the movie is the Emily girl, brilliantly played by Eliza Bennett. I hope he gets big and does this ... something at least something worth. <br /> Do yourself a favor. Do not watch it. There are no similar actions in it. Total waste in time.
