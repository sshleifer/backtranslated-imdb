* Can contain a beekeeping of type? * Mentioned exclusively at Crispin Glover is enough to send some geek panties into a bunch. His good appearance in Back in the Future as George McFly has sealed him in American consciousness forever. More recently, she was trying to get back to the subconscious of culture with Bartleby and Willard. But this time, Crispin has made a 76-minute, cheap movie father. At times he reminds me of engineering, while in general it almost insults me, but not because of its content. Content? What is it? is a movie where, in one half of the movie, all of the actors have syndrome Down, giving it a freakshow feel. The other half of the film includes Crispin Glover, Adam Parfrey, and a guy with cerebral palsy. This all felt at what John Waters tried to do with Living Desperate, and at the same time felt more successful and failing miserable. <br /> <br /> The Half and the Down Syndrome feature also features many killed snails. It is about a guy who has snails, and ends up killing one. He also suffers from a bunch of others, and a grasshopper. She fell in love with 2 girls, one of which she had sex with in a graveyard. He also had a fall out with a friend who had him tossed. <br /> In an unusual semi-interior series, Crispin Glover is the director of this show. It is something like the control of the guy's mind, and the cerebral palsy guy is something like the sexuality. Well, he at least gets masturbated in explicit scenes. Other "shocking" imagery have made humor, such as Nazi Swaztikas crossed with Shirley Temple, and black face makers say they are Michael Jackson. In the outside world, the tormentor still faced with his love of killing snails and being beaten by others. They beat him with stones, and such. Then they beat the minstrel after putting it on trial. <br /> <br /> Back in the interior, Crispin Glover is still the ruler of his series, and tries to control everyone but fail miserably. <br /> <br> What is it? makes less sense than Dr. Caligari, and has more than one style than stolen from it. Klostrofob's mental space feels very much like the non-walled walls of Dr Caligari felt claustrophobic. They also had some dialogue that had absolute nonsense. And, it was all wrapped up with absurd imagery for humor. <br /> <br /> The problem is, about 20 minutes in the movie ... maybe a little more ... What is it? run out of imagery. For the next 56 minutes, we keep running on the same sets of images, only introducing new imagery in the form of a ridiculous puppet show. The film looks more like a movie that tries to push the envelope off of offensive imagery and taboo. It tries to mock and confuse the audience. But the problem is that it only has enough different imagery for a movie 40 minutes. Even worse, the cinematography, design design, and everything else felt extremely cheap and almost unplanned. It felt like "OK, this is how we can do it and get it out of the way." It did not feel interesting, and it was well ... boring. Dr Caligari, on the other hand, had amazing cinematography and framing. The difference between the two is quite surprising. <br /> Rating: C
