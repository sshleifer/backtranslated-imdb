Belmondo is a tough cop. It goes after a big drug dealer (played by Henry Silva, virtually a big villain - seeing the "Sharky car", but here it is clearly armed, and because of his lack of charisma usually). She goes to the Scuzziest places in Paris and Marseilles, asking for some names, beating some people, getting their names, going to more excuse, asking for more names, beating up more people, etc. All the movie is punch after punch after punch. It seems that people who did it had no ambition other than to create the French equivalent of "Harry's room". Belmondo, who was 50 here, made some good exhibits at the start; Apart from these, "The Margin" is a violent, episodic, movie, cop movie and forgettable cop. (* 1/2)
