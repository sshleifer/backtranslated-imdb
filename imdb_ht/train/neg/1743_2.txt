Unlike its titles, this film offers no spice and thus the audience undergoes a taste flavor. All humorous appearances, theater, mechanics, scenes, reminiscent of these Pakistani play are available on video, including the same manner. Everyone is screaming, shouting and doing odd things for no reason. The first seems interesting as it is a straight up from the Boeing Boeing Hollywood. As Abraham is so natural in almost all his films is a complete malignant here. If we keep morality aside, even then the events rare looks trite.Akshay Kumar and Paresh Rawal, two experienced stalwarts try hard to lift the film by natural, but in vain. At least, the characters of three girls should make controversy in order to bring some interesting elements, but sadly here too are all those brainless, bukomed bimetons (3Bs) that speak, behave and even cry in the same way . The biggest hole in the plot is what made the protagonist to keep the three girls in the same house pretending that they will never get to know each other? Just do some sex, what else? The same can be done in hundreds of other ways. Therefore, many dramabacias for no reason is not something that will be easily digested. But surely, large-scale meat shows and promoting temptation always give a movie a first initial. Now, for those who call it a situational comedian, I call it a pathetic flavor. The humorous senses of these cinemas will go cement audiences to rot and demented into the boundaries that are connected to a kind of sadistic, unusual and maddening humor, where it is not the characters that they laugh at but instead of themselves and in their own frustration that looks like our sense of being this in order to laugh we have to bear with these things?
