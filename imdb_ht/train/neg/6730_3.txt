This is a movie about how people think women think about love. No woman described a one-night sexual encounters and declared her a love story. In the ten monologues I felt only three really had any kind of ring truth in them. I was waiting for the movie to get better, and it did a bit, but never better enough. This is an interesting concept, and I kept it up to be good, but it never succeeded. Perhaps if they actually loved the story would work.
