An hour, eight minutes and twelve seconds in this movie flick and I decided she was very lame. That was right after Hopalong (Chris Lybbert) drops on his horse from a tree to return the good guy posse there. I was very mystified by all Hopalong Cassidy / Gran Bar 20 gadgets that did not translate into anything at all. Obviously, Coppola's name of credit could not be anything to guarantee success here, even with more than one listed. <br /> If you do it at the end of the movie, you'll probably wind up asking yourself the same questions I've done. What exactly was the hook and the gloves? What's up with the Runeo storyline? Who was Stranger to represent? Why did this movie? <br /> I could probably go on but my energy was drained. Look, there is already a West called the "Gunfighter" from 1950 with a guy named Gregory Peck as the title character. Watching it will make you feel as good as watching this one makes you feel bad. That one I can recommend.
