Kevin Spacey is very talented, but unfortunately directed is not his strong. I had great hope on the movie before I rented it and maybe that's why I do not like it very much. I admire Spacey's attempts to make a movie that takes place primarily in a small environment, but not the attempt to count. I found the movie dull, boring, and stretched. The act was nothing spectacular. Gary Sinise has done better, especially since she is conscious of most of his other films. Skeet Ulrich was disappointing, but this was one of his first films (I did get a kick out of how young and chubby this star called look). The only thing that impressed me on this movie was to shot one of the wrecked car from above. The center line of the road was perfectly centered and the camera moved on the line and past the wreckage. However, that the shot was very "suspect poisoned" and I and my guess is Spacey got the idea from that movie earlier in it (which is your good idea). If you want to see a fabulous movie that takes place in one small setting, see the Hitchboat Hitchcock. Maybe Spacey should watch it before filming this.
