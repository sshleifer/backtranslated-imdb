As long as you can suffer it! If you like watching people wake up, take dresses, have a shower, prepare dinner, watching each other, having sex in the darkness, then going back to bed asleep ... if you Lovely tiled dish, narrow room and kitchen, long minutes of silence .... if you love getting bored for two hours, feeling the thrill of "real intimate art", then you'll love it. But if you do not, just try to see a good movie, there are thousands. "While you are here," but do you want to stay? This German movie has received the award at the gay movie Torino Festival: Italian journalists still do not understand why the jury takes such a bad decision, like the festival featuring lots of talented movies. Perhaps to be beautiful with a German, as they often do not get premiums? Well, "The lives of others" did ... but this one is excellent, but not gay. So maybe it's a matter of fashion. German are "in" again? Whatever? Or maybe just to look at a hustler to some directors?
