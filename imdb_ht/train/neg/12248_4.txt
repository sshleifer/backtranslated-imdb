The only real highlight of the movie is the death of the guy sniveling and the reaction of the characters to survive in it. In other ways, this movie is a very rip-off army of Jaws, Lake Placid, and Alligator, and a little bit of Godzilla (1998) cast in. As a standard for a movie cinema In 1990's style, two women do not start wearing their clothes at least once. Do not give up, since it's obviously a better agent. The whole movie surrounds the filming of a really dumb extreme sport calling without surfing, in which surfers cut off heads and surf in infested shark waters. In this movie, a giant crocodile crocodile is also happening to be in the area. People are eating. The movie ends. <br /> I do not mind a bad horror movie, but I really hate a movie extra bad movie, which definitely is.
