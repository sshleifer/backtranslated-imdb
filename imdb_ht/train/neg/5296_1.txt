I'm not a big fan of slasher cops as a genre, but even by the standards of low-low-budgeting, this one is really lame. Even on a nude-and-gore level, it's incredibly boring (some of both, but it's all sort of ... meh). Before the video video revolution, it could not even be teatrically released (though it might have; after all, * Plan 9 Exterior Space * played in theater). There is precisely a good (and fully-saved) line of the entire movie; I suppose they were stolen from somewhere. The act is among the worst I've ever seen. I mean, even Ed Wood has a couple of competing actors, and the rest tends to be ludicrously host, which can be fun to watch. Anyway, most of his actors could be pretty much as astounding. Here, those who do not read the lines like Cigar-Indian stores sound like they have been taught phonetically. And this movie has one distinction: it manages to seriously underplotted for most of the movie, then deceiving overplotted for the finish. <br /> <br /> (Update: I should have aimed out the actress to play the receptionist as an exception it is not to say wooden .Not that it's good, but it certainly is not wooden.) Even pure Low slasher flicks are generally good for a few Puritans meditation on their grossary offensive, but with this one, there are not even seem to have anything to work up a moral outrage on. <br /> And you know the funniest thing? They are clearly expected to make an end! <br /> It's so bad and boring that it actually gets fascinating in a strange way. I sit downstream of many of the video wondering why anyone would go through the disruption of doing it.
