It's like a bad 80s TV was released and tried to become a soft-core porn movie. Oh my god was bad. The cellar of each character was of little importance. The plot itself did not mean anything to speak. Something about a Stalker, I guess. At the end he shot himself? It's not really clear, but somehow there's a volleyball game involved. And the main character (Randy) sleeps around a lot. The only reason my friend rented this movie was because Casper Van Dien was in it, and they ended up wanting to move forward to the scene with him in it, which was barely lookable at that. Thank God I did not spend any money on it, but I want this hour in my life back.
