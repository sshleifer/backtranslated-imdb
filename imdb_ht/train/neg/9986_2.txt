The next time you are at a party and someone asks, "The other day I hear the 'willingness of the author' expression. Anyone who knows what he means?" Tell them to sit at the top of the top of the water. The only way Diaz could have survived this movie was by means of this literary device often used by bad writers. There are some funny scenes and you will have a few laughs. However the film does not stand up to the lesser logical analysis. Why does Keith spit the Diaz but before it instead of behind? Why so it can be fooled to cheat. For me the best part of this film was that I saw it on a cable channel instead of spending four bucks in the video shop.
