I'll admit that I've seen perhaps five minutes of "Jerry Springer". I do not consider myself a snob, but I really think I'm above watching at his show. You should try to elevate yourself above that too. <br /> I saw this movie as part of a social science event I did. I said that this movie really was little to do with Springer himself, rather than focusing on the lives of people who would appear on "Springer." For best, this movie might actually have been a fascinating look at how pathetic life these people are actually. I'll admit, I felt a fight in sympathy for Connie (Molly Hagan). This is all it has in life. How sad that she feels to go to Jerry's show in order to solve this. <br /> I really feel sorry for Molly Hagan to appear in this. Have you noticed that after this film, has it mostly been relegated to the role of "B" on television? I'll say this about Hagan. She is a very beautiful and smart woman. I do not doubt that he is very serious in his acting and is trying to play his role with a lot of sympathy. The problem is that Hagan can not carry a scene on his own. It just does not have that to take a lead role. His best works are still angels on the "Herman's head" (a show that was not great, but his heart was in the right place) and when he was scheduled on "Seinfeld" as Sister Roberta.
