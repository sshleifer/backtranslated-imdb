In the comic, Modesti is strong. Alexandra Staden who plays modest Blaise looks more like an anorexic fashion model. It does not either have the morality or personality that Modesty has in the comic. Modesty would never give a woman a tip to show more skin for more money. I can not see any similarity with my comic book and Modesty with this movie. It's like an Impossible Mission Movie would be on Ethan Hunt close to the detention room in high school talking to Janitor on when he went to high school and Hunt would play by DJ Qualls (on the Road Trip). So if you're a modest fan does not see the movie you'll just get upset. If you do not know much about the comic Modesty renting a movie other was not your time with this one. I can not understand how Quentin Tarantino can put his name on it. I will ask for a refund in my forex store tomorrow tomorrow.
