I'm going to blonde and to the point. This movie is not good at all. Hit the part of the film I hated acting, script, story, direction and almost all the correction. Amanda Peet has proved that she can act, as it was a high point in the 'Whole Nine Yards'. So he should avoid this movie with a ten-legged pole. However, the part of infantile I found this movie to be very funny. If you can forget about how the quality production ratio is, and if you find funny smok jokes, then you should all be right. And for those of you who can not find in your pedestal, your choice. My interior kids do not die, and I laugh a little bit. Even then, only a 3 out of ten, because as a movie, she really does stink.
