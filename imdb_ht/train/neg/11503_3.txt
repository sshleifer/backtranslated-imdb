Quentin Crisp once claimed that when things show too well, it's only a romantic one. When things show indifferent to the dead, they are realistic. But when something gets ironic treatment, they're spot on. Unfortunately for Leon de Aranoa, he fell into the second catagory. This director obviously tried too hard to make a movie "Ken Loach" Spanish, without being able to take the comedy, and heat between the characters, which elevated Loach movies from simply being 'depressing'. Los Lunes al Sol is just that, just depressing. Things are unrealistic brown. The ultimate moments of worry all come to a better point at the same point, and if the glum story is not enough, Aranoa washes the story off with a gray and lousy vertical palette. These films were ridiculous on-rated in the Goyas. A film that shows sympathy for the weakest in society, in this case by worker's port workers, does not automatically make for a good movie, though I would first sympathize with the fate of those people. This film only managed to make me grow into the fate. In 21st Century Spain, unemployed people do not live as beggars, and transit ferries have decent bathrooms, and it's hard to come across a bar and some bettors and these little happiness to be met in it. Leon de Aranoa obviously does not have a sign of working class Spain, and has no favor. Pretention is the only conclusion I can draw. The scene where people watch a football match for free, which is directly copied from a movie that deals more 'realistically' with the topic of trap 'poverty, namely "Pure Belter," which is far more engaged, funny, and yet sad.
