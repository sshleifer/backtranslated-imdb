I love the comic. Although I have problems fully understanding their stories ?? The visual style is unique with its dirt, dust and decay. So I thought I knew what I was up for. Surprisingly I understand the main draw ?? but there are some very wrong decisions where made for its visual style. <br /> I mean - really bad looking "CG men actors" - to lock ups? Why? It did not work at all !! Horus - and the gods of Egypt - were successfully made in CG and very close to the comic version. <br /> I think that with this real actor could film a movie movie. <br /> <br /> What a shame.
