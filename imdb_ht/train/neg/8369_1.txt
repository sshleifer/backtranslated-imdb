Since this photo has been classified as a "most fun" work and since there are already so many reviews about it, I would like this to address something related to the abuse of humor. We can see that Marlon Wayans plays the role of joker in this movie. Certainly as long as he was involved in the casting work, he always acts as a little man - an actor can change his ordinary clothes, but he can hardly change his physical appearance - and one of them can be an advantage then necessary. However far from what I hope, I've seen a very disguised image, pretending to exhibit different aspects of baby life by mistake of a forty-year criminal. And a ridiculous happy ending. So what is the point? Many elements are mixed, some principals are violence, gender and criminal activity, among which the story is poorly composed and in some measure, lacking common sense: where Vanessa is at peace in her home violated with her husband's life was chasing? In addition the diamond is even greater than No.1 Cullinan in the world! But the most common facial is the continuous attempt to make up little people as a superman by showing physical weaknesses. And it's called humor. A diamond is costly, tough and brittle; It can not be cut off by any other material but only be conquered by the hot blood of a male goat. Hence it does not have a diamond but a piece of debris.
