I saw this movie this year ago, and I was impressed ... but then again I was only 12 years old. I recently re-looked at it and want this time back. This movie is very bad. While I like Lee Major, Chris Makepeace (see my bodyguard (1980) if you would like to see a good movie being in the dumpling (also starting Bill Murray) for some laughs), and Burgess Meredith, This role does not do anything to their careers. <br /> <br /> Anyway, Character Lee Majors, Franklyn Hart, is an old race car driver who plans to drive his race car (from storage) across the country to California. One Problem: The Government has abolished all private transportation. I thought that the concept was OK (not the worst I heard of), but the execution failed horribly.
