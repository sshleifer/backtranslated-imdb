really awful ... lead actors did OK ... the movie, etc. Draw was completely crap and correct it might as well have been a good sequel ... anything it had little or no importance in Way Carlitos. .. and should be avoided as the epidemic by any Carlito fan of style ... there is no mention of Gail in fact it ends with some other birds, no mention of Klienfelt, no mention of how it was caught, there is no mention of how he ended up in jail. .. tried to do it as the original and low back at the start ... but to be honest when rating I was looking for a zero mark ... unfortunately I had to rate it higher ... <br / > <br /> It's a terrible cash attempt at what was one of the best movies in the 90's ... overall it was about Â£ 6 and 2 hours in my life wasted ... for all " the action "of it, it was really boring slowly and predictable ... again to any Carltio fan of the Way avoiding this fyasko ...
