This apocalyptic zombie movie tries to be greedy and shocking; but the FEEDING masses come in lame as some of the stubborn-legged zombies walk through the streets. In Rhode Island, a zombie epidemic is known as the Lazarus virus being played in the government newspaper manipulating and television stations. A couple of brave, but mute, the Soul Channel 5 TV News feels that its audience has given false hope and no idea of ​​real danger at hand. An alleged reporter (Racheal Morris) and his cameraman (William Garberina), with the help of a military escort (Patrick Cohen), life risk and members to present a "live" broadcast to show the bankruptcy. Make yourself a favor and do not look. This is obviously very low budget and comes across with the feeling of a high school playing away bad. Acting is atrocious and the meat-hungry zombies are almost funny. Also appearing are: Michael Propster, William DeCoff and Brenda Hogan. MASSAGE CONDITIONS should be left hungry.
