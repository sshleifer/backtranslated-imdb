Choosing this up for 50 cents in the bug market, was pretty excited. <br /> I found it fascinating for about 15 mins, then just repetition and dull. Mick and the gang of the prime, I wish there was not so much about doubling in dialogue so I could hear what to say and play. <br /> <br /> The politically-dated skies with incredibly naive and simple, the wrong sort writes Monty Python on acid. I spent more time looking at late 60's return to England drop rather then that was actually happening in the comic skits. <br /> <br /> This movie is a good reminder that times really change, and that's important has become just plain funny. Good song, but it was now played by death by this DVD.
