It was a decent movie, I actually liked it. But the end is so abrupt !! There is absolutely no closure and left tons of loose finish. What happens after the concert? What happens with her boyfriend? Is it hanging with Grant? Is it coming in the next semester? And what about Angela? Obviously Holly's performance would hit Angela down a few pegs, but nothing to show indicate how she reacted. There is plenty to go up in the air and it's very satisfying. I do not know if he tries to leave room for a sequel or something, but it's a terrible ending and I think he really makes the movie a joke. I was very disappointed.
