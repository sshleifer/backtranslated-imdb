Beginning of the slasher films in the 1970s and 80s, people on the dead markets were probably the second most popular sub-genre horror. While slasher movie 'Black Christmas' and 'Halloween' have found the whole thing to go, the zombie flicks were George Romero's 'dead' movie. With success soon after the success of his first two in the series, other directors wanted cash in. A lot of Italian directors were especially interested, like Lucio Fulci who made us' zombies' one year after the Romero 'Dawn the dead ', known as' Zombi' in Italy and some other countries, and having the film Fulci was known as' Zombi 2 '. Apart from the dead market he has no relation to Romero's film, but is a good movie in his own right. It was a great success in Europe and 9 years later was a sequel. <br /> Why so many beautiful scenery. Awesome notes. The act is not exactly good, but the cast is game and seems to be enjoying the experience. After a kind of slow start, the paw will move along like this in a flick of action action. Many cheese and hilarity unlawful for bad movie lovers. Good work on the make-up effects. Many blood and some decent pods. <br /> <br /> Account: Virtually draw less. There's nothing you've never seen before. Blatantly ragged about some things from the first couple of 'Return to the movie movie' movie. Carton characters. No age too well due to the bad music music 1980s (Not that I say all rock music in this period is bad), clothes, and overall feel of the movie. <br /> <br /> Last Thought: First of all, this is not a true end for Fulci's classic cult. In fact, I do not know if he ever meant to pick up where the movie left. For those who do not know, Fulci was ill during production and ended up and was replaced with Bruno Mattei. The matte films are very mischievous, but like this movie many are fun camping sites. And this whole movie really is, just something to look for fun. Rating: 3.5 / 5 (So good-by-good rating) 2/5 (Gravity rating)
