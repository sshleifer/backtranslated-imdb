It was nice to see all the characters familiar again, but the story bothered me. We liked Ariel in the first movie - why is the second one centered around her daughter? The new characters were annoying and I did not like to draw this. Worst of all, Christopher Daniel Barnes did not come back as the voice of Eric! Disney, please stop renowning classic movies and shoddy imitations.
