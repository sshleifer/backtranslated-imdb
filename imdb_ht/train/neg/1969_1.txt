Just saw this film and I must say that although showed at the beginning some efforts to produce a decent movie, this was absolutely awful - but not in that sense that my intention was to make sure. It was like a child who leaned this insult into the intelligence and belief that all would-be viewers are morons or very hard up for entertainment OR both .... Thank God for fast forward ! I can not imagine what kind of viewer the producer was in mind when making this movie. I mean, you have a tough actor trying, albeit barely, and a cry of crying for a total rewrite, .... I just can not say again. If Harlequin Romance decided to make horror movies, this would be a good effort. <br /> If you find this movie for fun, then I suggest that you look for some guides for the purpose of movies. There are many fare out. Join a club, REVIEW it, but above all, avoid crap like this.
