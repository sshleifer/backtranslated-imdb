I like Fulci movie, I really do and not in some boring way either way but I recognize that they appear hopelessly inept and hurt many of people. Conquest is where Fulci tries his hand at the genre of fantasy season and does not really succeed. Structurally, it's like most Fulci films you've seen. There are some things that happen, some other things happen and sometimes one scene might be tangentially related to another. It's really like Conan who has no sets, no script, no real actor (yes, Arnold Scharzenfartz is hardly an actor either), there is no budget, sort of looking dog looking with a bunch of Gore. a hard one to get in and I could have lived without the vaseline inch smeared on the camera to give it that Metal Hair Music watch video.
