An older man touches a flower in his wife's greenhouse that seems to be voluntary. It gets pricked by it, or bites by something about it. She quickly gets sick, and at the hospital loaded out a great white lavender writhing. An attempt later to resurrect him with pedal results in a blood splatter. <br /> A cop is at the hospital because her partner was very badly hurt by a shot-out. Somehow the cop gets scared and one of the female doctors, as well as an entomologist who brought in. There are several young children lost to the hospital, whom I think we are supposed to find adorable, but very annoying little brats. They came up to the room where the sample was held, and the dump came up with a hormone. Movie logic films would say that they deserve to die for this, but they are never even in any danger. <br /> <br /> The critter grows and begins breeding. People run out of it, and sometimes towards it for some reason. The hospital is surrounded by the military who are preparing to destroy everything if needed. <br /> There is no really compelling character in the movie, and most of the time it looks like people are looking around for the monster. It was boring justice. Clearly it must be something of foreign cinemas, and the monster was born inside a person and has several steps in its growth. There is also a character called Bishop, with the lead actress Sigourney Weaver's hair.
