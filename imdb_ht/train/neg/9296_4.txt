Normally, I'm a very generous critic, but in this case my movie said it was extremely bad. I'm sparkling by how the most positive review looks like. <br /> There are some gorgeous shots, but it's too bad to have wasted on this sinkhole in a movie. It might have worked if "daggers" were purely a flick of action movie and not a romance, but unfortunately the movie is built around an empty love triangle. There is no chemistry between either couple, whatever exists between Mei and his men seems to be much more lively than love, and for the most part the dialogue is just dummy. This can be just a problem with translation, but the frequent use of the word "little game" in particular reminds me of 8th grade, not head-on-heels, along forever, worth-dying-for love; I also felt we were beating over the head and the windmill. The audience is given very little about the characters really care about, and therefore very little emotional investment in the movie as a whole. I wanted to be a remote control soon, I was chute in my chair ready to snore, but especially I just cringed a lot. <br /> <br /> ******* <br /> <br /> Now, the mirror on the cake. Or rather, add adult to injury. The finish was really one of the most terrible, ridiculous people I ever saw. The boys have the bad battles and screaming and shouting and hacking at each other. Oh, and then it starts snowboarding. Of course. Oh, and then Mei (dolphin integrated into heart) suddenly pops up from the weeds. Then it launches a dagger that seems to take about 5 minutes to reach its destination, even slowly easily midscreen hits a drop of blood. Wow, cool. <br /> Well, then Mei died finally I guess because he threw the dagger that night spent in his chest and bleeding to death. Jin sing, sobs, keep his body closed, the screen goes blank. I, and those who surround me, are chuckling. Not a good sign. <br /> <br /> Visually stunning, but finally a failure.
