This little sad movie brings little resemblance to the 1971 Broadway Renewal that was like a hit 'nostalgic'. Keep in mind that when Burt Shevelove ruled that revival, she rewrote the book so much. I have a feeling that this senarist split as much of a change in the original 1925 version as well. I played Jimmy Smith's "innocent philosopher" on stage in 1974, and thought that $ 1 DVD would bring back memories. Not a chance. Even the pleasure anticipated to see "Topper" Roland Young plays 'I' party was a big disappointment. Three songs in the game remain, and they do much harm. Even the classic drug, "Tea For Two", is made as a virtual solo. Many figures are familiar to this 1940 fiasco by making themselves proud at all, with the star Anna Neagle, just embarrassing herself. When I feel gypped by spending a dollar, I know the movie must be bad. Another commenter mentions the Doris Day version, which actually calls "Tea For Two" and it's about doing the stage play (the original, of course), so those who are looking for true "no no nanette" might get a more recognized version.
