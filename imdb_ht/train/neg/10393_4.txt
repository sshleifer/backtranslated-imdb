Well, you have: <br /> <br /> Penelope Keith as Miss Herringbone-tweed, B.B.E. (Call of England.) She died off at the first stage - that's right, as; This show has no screams! Peter O'Toole as Ol 'ol' cricket cricket from the First World War and now the Lord emblazered at the Manor. Joanna Lumley as the Invisible Lady of the Manor, 20 years younger than the settler and 20 years her own first but still glamourous (Brit spell, not me) enough to have a little male games on the side. It is well, they have complete knowledge and consent Col. The cricket (they even come 'round for Christmas!) Still, it was considerable in the colon enough to say her own-game boy (what a gal!) <br /> <br /> David McCallum as says game-boy, equally as glamorous glamor as his pressing. Pilcher could not come up with any cover for him in the story, so he gave him a silent silence-work in the circus. <br /> <br /> and finally: Susan Hampshire as Miss Polonia Teacups, Venerable Headmistress of the Venerable Girls' Girls, served in her office with a deep grip, considerable tips for life in the world outside just before graduation. It's the best bit of advice: "I've only been in Nancherrow (the local stately house in England) once. I thought it was pretty much but somehow, not part of the real world." Well, we can not say they did not warn us. Ah, Susan - time was, your character would have to run the whole show. They do not write 'em like any more. Our losses, not yours. So - with a cast and setting like this, you have the re-makings of "Brideshead Revisited," right? The roles of 1 dimension were taken because they were paid well. After all, acting is one of the oldest working temperatures (or another!) <br /> The first warning sign: many and many backlighting. They get around not to shoot out - "Hey, it's just the sunlight!" Second warning warning: Lady Lady cries many. When they do not cry, his eyes are moist. This is the novel romance law: Leading Lady is "dewy-eyed". Now Leading Lady will be known as LL <br /> <br /> Third warning warning: LL actually has stars in his eyes when he's in love. Still, I'll give Emily Mortimer a premium just for having to act with what spotlight in her eyes (I'm surprised. Have used contacts?) <br /> And finally, four warning signs: not There is no on-screen female character is "madam" It is either "Miss" or "Lady." When all said and done, I still could not tell you who was prosecuted to whom and why. I could not even tell you what was said and done. <br /> <br /> For the sum: they all live in World War II without anything at all. <br /> OK, in the end, LL finds he lost his parents in the Japanese prison camps and six babies coming home catatonic. Meanwhile (there is still a "meanwhile,") some young Guy LL had a break on (when I do not know) coming home from some time during hard war and finding living on the street by Lady of the Manor (they must have some streets if SHE will get him there.) Both war victories are flying to recover in nanurrow (BIG has to be "whisked away" again in the romance stories!) <Br / > <br /> Great drama.
