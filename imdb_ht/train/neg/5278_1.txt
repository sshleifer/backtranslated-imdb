When a comedy movie has its very beautiful band on the back cover you know you do not cope with a tooth movie. I rent this movie with friends looking to find some chuckles but in general they find most of our laugh at each other to make fun of the movie. We could not have chosen a movie worse. The film may have been well with a few changes. The first, the comedy was painful. Physical gags were poorly performed and placed. The fat kid of the film made us want to kill ourselves, blessing him for trying out the scene and performing outside but being like a puppy begging for love. If he had pulled out of the movie everything might have been carried. There were some funny jokes, I believe one was when the group of boys steal one of the parent's porn movies and it seems to be gay pornography. But at best to sum up the comedy I will simply tell the opening gage for the fat kid. She puts an attached ticket shirt and talks about not knowing when something does. <br /> <br /> For the finish, the editor of the movie could save the movie by removing the fat kid, cutting out 20 minutes at the school scene and doing a finish longer than thirty seconds brutally random. <br /> <br /> Oh, BTW, there are two good elements that the movie owns. Kadeem Hardison plays his roles beautiful and makes his jokes so that they do not miss or under-appreciate. The other part of the movie is the beautiful lady Ali Landry. His character is ignored most of the movie which is a shame. <br /> Do not waste time or even rent this one. He did not appeal to me and I was part of the target audience (18 men).
