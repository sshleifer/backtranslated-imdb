I saw this film in the movie many years ago, and one thing surprised me so negative that I could not see any kind of remnant of the films: Dennis Quaid was cast as a policeman who never smiled or grin, while his smile and grin are two of his brand. Danny Glover was cast as the bad guy, but - yet - most viewers' imagination could not go far enough as to believe him in that role. Also, Jared Leto was not credible as the ancient medicine student. The tension was just not there, since the assassin was recognized early. The final was, again, neither dramatic nor tense: nobody around I care about what was going to happen next. All we could wait for was the end of the movie. All in all, a disappointing evening spent on the movie.
