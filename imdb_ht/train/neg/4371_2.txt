After leaving the popular TV show "Andy Griffith Show", Don Knotts gave the film a vibrant attempt with a series of comforts but comedy but fun-comedy. Unfortunately, the "astounding astronomer", filmed on the cheap (as most of Knotts' movies), is worse than others. Don plays a small city cow to accept the Astronaut training camp ... but not as a candidate for space travel - they want it like the new Janitor! Some may say that the saturated weakness capitalized on New American fever for new age in technology, but flicking the film is really just a tidal excuse to keep the restless kids busy. It gets off at a good start, with an OK set-up and nostalgic location, but it becomes increasingly more spiritless and idiotic. * from ****
