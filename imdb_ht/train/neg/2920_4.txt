Wow! I'm shocked to learn that it's a small world and that we all connect. What a waste of 88 minutes. John Dunne has placed it best in a sentence. "No one is an island." The act was not bad. The children gave it all they had but at times the thread got thin that I could not follow it with the only real "hero" of the movie finishing up in prison after being tormented by a maid master. I do not know. I just do not get it. Oh well.
