This movie was almost intolerable to sit down. I can get beyond the fact that it seems that he's fired with a home video camera and this film is expected to span over the week again the characters have not once changed team, but the act broke the wall 4th in pieces for me. I've seen better acting in a 4th grade grade. Aside from that the plot is unrealistic. If the man suspects the guy he would turn it around. I was also very disappointed that all the killings were made with a gun that kind of gore is that. That's not a zodiac copycat did not kill using just a gun the authorities would know he did not read. Another thing that really bothered me was called Disassociative Identity DSM Disorder 4 then the name of the book is used to diagnose people with mental illness by the name of the disease. In general, I think this movie is not the kind of movie that could be done with a low budget at least not as low as they were or were able to make sure they were the best actors or more gore. Many people who went down the budget low and out have to use terrible actors to look at Easy Rider who had Dennis Hopper and Jack Nicholson with a low budget.
