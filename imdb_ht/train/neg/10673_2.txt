This movie was such a bad indie and talent A-list. The plot was funny, all the way to the end. She reminded me a lot of something churned out for the home video market in the 1980s. I would give it one, but there were short moments when you could see the actors really really tension to make this refreshing. I think the worst thing was the underwater scene that took place at the pier. The underwater lighting seemed out of no being, and every time someone we were supposed to care about was close to running out of time, this tank when type would appear. I would avoid this, unless there is nothing else on the shelf. Hello.
