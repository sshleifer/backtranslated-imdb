No word can describe my utter hatred for this awful provocative of the BTK killer. Rating this one movie out of ten compliments this excuse is really disastrous for a movie. From start to finish, there was not one single highlight. All these things were put together. The script, acting, scheme, lighting, direction, ACTING, real information, ACTING, just to name a few. A number of scenes are literally laugh-out-loud-humorous, for rabid ways in which the whole thing is put together. This review can be seen as an unjust attack and attack on a low-budget film, but that can not be. Just thinking about the movie I've just seen my blood starts to boil. How this film has ever been granted the right to production I never knew. I'm almost tempted to actually recommend BTK, because it's really a stand-out to consider how pathetic, and horrible disturbances it is. I can honestly say, in all my years of film-going, this is happening. MOVIE. EVER. I wasted more than an hour of my life on this wasteful waste, and would be happy to jump to the nearest pre-built building, I knew what I was in for. ZERO from TEN.
