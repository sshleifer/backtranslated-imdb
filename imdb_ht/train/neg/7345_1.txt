I absolutely hate this program, what kind of person is sitting and watching this garbage? OK my dad and mum love lol but i'm sure i'm fine out of the room before it comes up. So depressed and sad but the worst thing is to act I cant stop all detective programs like this because the detectives are so wild and happy. What happens to detective programs and real mysteries ??? I mean who wants to know what happens to fictional characters we do not know anything about who died more than 20 years ago ??? I wish the bbc would put more comedies on bbc1 cos now with the rug in it's end to have more space for crap like this.
