What's wrong? I ignored the reviews and went to see it myself. Renowned reviews were so straightforward. What a waste of money considers its budget .. <br /> Well, I went to see Bill Kill after this one. <br /> <br /> To see a really scary movie, they would crossroads! Br /> <br /> Bottom line - I love "Girl in Boots Gold" better than this crap.
