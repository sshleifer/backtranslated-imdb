Coyote ugly might have been much more effective if the movie makers made it an R-rated movie / movie movie exploitation (with lots of nudity.) But since the PG-13 rating is what all the studio wants this day We ended up with a movie like this: a PG-13 "tormented" flicking film that does not allow them to go nowhere near as far as the movie should go. <br /> <br /> The script goes generic that it is easy to guess which point draws will take 15 minutes before it actually happens. The act is adequate, but the characters are so thin paper that nothing can do with them. There was also a lot of points where it seemed like I was watching a music-video rather than a movie. <br /> <br /> Well only the movie are driving amazingly beautiful girls. We get to see them in some very tight and very revealing outfits ..... but only so much they can show due to the PG-13 constraints. There are many clogs and tones, some body tone well-choreographed, but there are no stripping or sex to talk about. Tyra Banks (it keeps getting even more insanely beautiful and age) is also in the movie for a small amount of time. Sexy newcomer Piper Perabo is also very easy on the eyes (and it has a killer smile) and shows some potential genuine acting. The only people I could see this movie appeal is pre-pibesan boy who does not allow them to watch R-rated movies again. This audience could get a lot out of it in a stating aspect, but adult audiences will feel annoyed and cheated. <br /> <br /> <br /> Rating: Movie-1 Women-10
