Well, I can once put an end to the question: 'What is the worst movie ever made ... ever?' It is the anger of anger, beginning with co-written by Steven Seagal. Make sure you have a lot of movies famously bad, but this one takes the cake in that he cares so seriously. <br /> It is a Romanian-made movie that just narrates how far Romania was to go to catch up with Bollywood. He also spoke with just how completely devoid of intelligence and talent Steven Seagal came. This movie is so bad that you literally feel violated after watching it, it needs to crouch in the corner of the shower and cry, knowing that nothing will make you feel clean again. <br /> It was released only on video (I can not imagine why) and I suspect the workers who made DVDs had to be safeguarded and received regular advice.
