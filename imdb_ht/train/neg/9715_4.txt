This program is really covered. A detective like the warm-headed character Danny Pino was transferred to the "gun squad" years ago. The whole squad is made up of witnesses egomaniacs who judge those whose actions go back decades by the standards in 2007. Each Vietnam veteran character has never had to be the killer, unless it was a Vietnam veteran. There was only one black robber, and he was dressed up by his white man. The only Spanish assassin was a "race betrayor" who killed another Hispanic to scout a street kid for a crime (of course) of white children being committed. What a bunch of propaganda. Hey, screenwriters: minority and poor people commit murder too. Only on this show are the most massive white upper-class shows. <br /> <br /> What's more, the arrests of people in the 70s, 80s, and 90s for the crimes committed 50-60 years ago is a joke. No real-life DA will push to kill one because it means the state will stick to their medical humongous bill until they finally kick. The state should make families and insurance companies a favor. The prosecutor will just struggle to kill half unintentionally and will not serve one day. Only the old criminals who go to prison are either organized crime or former Nazi, whose high-profile behavior strengthens the DA career.
