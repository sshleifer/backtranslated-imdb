The second half of Steven Soderbergh's revolutionary BIO on Che Guevara deals with his latest campaign of Bolivian revolution. In order to keep him saintly visage of Che Soderbergh readily lead to the mass execution frogs he presided over after the revolution in Cuba and the craziness of his Congo adventure ("This is the story of a failure" he writes in the preface in his Congo Journal) to fully concentrate on Che's tent for gathering support against the government of Bolivia. It would turn out to be a disaster and Guevara's final act. <br /> What plagued the first chapter to follow suit here as Soderbergh slows his film into a pull to study the beatific figure in Guevara in conversation once again being played like James Dean in East Eden by Bernicio Del Toro. The problem is Guevara has little success in taking convert and she soon finds herself with her hungry companions swallowing up in the heart of Darkness Bolivian Jungle. Unlike Werner Herzog's beautiful, Aguirre, the wrath of Soderbergh has failed to use the metaphorical forestry potential for making the guerrillas of war. It seems more concerned with keeping the nimb che above her than exploring the panic environment in the dead endeavors. There is a brave moment where Che sits down a heady horse kicking and screaming to get it moving, but in general the Soderbergh sits on a scene stays flat, sloppy and refreshing. <br /> In both of its films Soderbergh shows it is clearly a cheating group and because of its focus it remains myopic and narrow. He spends too much time building his monument at Che and is too small to develop his relationship with key players in his legend, especially Fidel Castro. Making matters worse and doing it with a slow and expansive approach that never captures fire. One would think that it was penny in enough Eisenstein and Vertov to realize that bakery changes are featuring a lot better and sweeping style.
