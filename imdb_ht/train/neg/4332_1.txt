This movie is a bad attempt to make the original fans feel complete. One thing that people have forgotten is the fact that the original reason was as reputable, was simply done in the fact that it was supposed to make you feel incomplete. <br /> <br /> This movie makes me want to go to the bathroom. I'm not a kind of negative guy, but man acting in this flick is .... there is no comment. The plot was a bad reflection of Carlito Brigante's life and I'm sorry to have two hours and my money wasted on this movie flick. I still love the original and will do my best to not let this movie ruin my opinion on it.
