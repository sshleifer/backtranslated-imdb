First, it takes half an hour to get Hackman out of jail and start doing the job. What a waste of time, we all know Hackman is getting out of doing some work for his master, why waste almost a third of the movie on these sequences. Then Hackman stays in a hotel with the story bush again going nowhere, simply proving that Hackman is under close look and nothing he says or is perceived by their masters. Again, another 20 minutes. Then more wasting time showing the meeting with his wife. All of this should take 10-15 minutes in most simply as a set-up for real action, intricate and draw trace. By the time the real action goes, I was so bored that I just wanted the movie to end. Hackman is great as usual, with other actors as well, but this is a dude of first magnitude.
