The film had a nice opening, I really believed I was in for one of the best romantic comedies I had seen in a short time ... there was something particular "alien" on the way the movie was set up, realistic yet somewhat abstract and mysterious. But then the story line began to become more and more unrealistic. To say that the finish was CORNY and PREDICTAB would almost have an overestimate ... The most typical romantic finish where everything goes great for each character 'likable'. A scene where the main character realized that he had made a mistake and chases the "woman of his dream" only to confess his love for her in front of a sympathetic mob of souls. Come. In the end, 'good guys' have, 'bad guys' loose ... You get the picture. A WAST in a potentially interesting film.
