I'm a dumber person for renting the REDLINE DVD. Chicago Pictures made this stupid movie never paid Palisades Media Group to buy online ads on various automobiles sites including me with a Alexa rating of 16K. They tore me on the deal and now I'm out $ 16,000 and are wasting a lot of my personal time (Peter Report in Palisades Media) you know who you are! <br /> <br /> Please do not rent or buy this movie !!! It sucks and the people behind it are rippling artists. <br /> <br /> REDLINE has a cast of losers and poor actors! <br /> This movie is a joke
