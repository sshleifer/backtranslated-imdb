The SCULTING SKULL (1 outta 5 stars) This movie has lots of nice open crib credits (a warning screen screensman that the movie clients will offer a funeral fun if they die in the very scary watching movie, a scary shot of a skull emerging from a placid pool with the pervasive music awesome) but, unfortunately, the movie is all downhill from there. A widow man took his new bride to his solitary mansion ... admonishing his servants and friends that the new ladies have a very fragile disposition due to a tragedy in his past. Well, in no time at all it begins to see and hear mysterious things that no one else can. Her husband assured her that she's all in her head and ... well you can probably see this place all going. You'll have to figure out what's going on before our hapless heroine ... because you've probably seen the exact same scheme of hundreds of other movies and TV shows (and doing better, too). To add to the movie myriad transgression, most off of this movie (on many DVD DVD compilations) seems to be missing a few key scenes. You see the heroine slowly walks toward the window ... he goes to open it ... you know he will see something scary ... and then ... suddenly the scene cut his jumping in arms her husband. So what did he see ??? I guess we will never know.
