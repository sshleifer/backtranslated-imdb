Sadly, Mary Harron has decided to make a fictional fight on Bettie Page's life to go along with his own problems with men. As typical of all its tasks, every major character is described as weak, bumbling, or twisted. To add to her fiction, her idea ideas and problems are wrong, according to Bettie Page itself. Bettie did not let the biz because she thought she was morally wrong or had religious issues (though she became a born-again later life, in the influence of her husband's husband - a minister). He left it, because he was in his late 30's, his career was gone nowhere and he felt he was losing his looks. The suggestions of harassment and rape are invalid and deny Bettie's own words and are the directors' attempts to claim that any woman who did what Bettie had been victimized by men. Harron fails to point out that Bettie designed her own clothes in almost all her laces (not released by "sick fetishists"). Harron also failed to make a point that Bunny Yeager, who did many pictures of famous shoots in Bettie, also made many "naughty" shoots with Bettie and were not the morally righteous photographer described in the movie. The only grace saved is Gretchen Mol very similar to Bettie. Otherwise, there are other cinemas and documentaries more accurate and honest in his life and the people in it.
