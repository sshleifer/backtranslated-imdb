I saw the movie as a child when he was released from the theater and it was so bad that he had come to the marketing of a family joke. If the ranking had a zero, this film would get it. Dinosaurs were awful. The scenario was ridiculous. The act really does not qualify to be called acting. The only reason I even remember the name of the movie is so good is because my family always talks about how bad it really was.
