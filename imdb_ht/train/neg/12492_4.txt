This is one of them movies that has an awesome video box but has tuned Camra work with unknown actors who speak to bad dialogue. So dark when the killings come you can hardly see it more movie is hard to understand. Star Stars Here's the WCW's Vanessa Sanchez (Tygres in WCW before she folds) and she's a good actress. I like to give the specific film budgets that have mistakes because they are fun to look but Severed unfourtunatly is not one of them. This movie is ok to see if you like voodoo and head off but this is not blockbuster but if you need something new to watch then rent Severed.
