There are three movies with this animation style that I lovingly remember from my youth. This movie, "The Last Unicorn," "Flight of the Dragon" and "The Hobbit." I own copies of both the "dragon" and the "obi" (both excellent) and I did not see the "Last Unicorn" in more than a decade. That was until today and now I wish I did not. What bothered me the most was the script. It was extremely chaotic and often inhuman. Things would happen for any reason or anything that would have happened without explanation. We do not just talk about little things here either; we are talking about key dots point! The story itself is not great to begin with, but it might have worked the script was decent. Do not even close. On top of the music was awful! I know that music in movies like these rarely has that one might call classic pieces, but the music of this movie makes me want to hit myself unconscious and a bowling ball. This was one of those films that I was going to show in my kids a few days, but it just was off. I do not think I could ever sit in that crap Fest again. Incompetent will put it mildly.
