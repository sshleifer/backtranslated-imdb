Yes, MTV has really been a way to market Daria. What started as a clever young angst- "comment on everything that sucks and makes the viewer feel better about suki life of the youth" sitcom now mutated in a "how you should deal with your problem" -char. I used to watch Daria all the time and love her. Now, sitting here after watching the so-called "movie" I can only ask which point this all was. Daria tells us how to lead from college life? Excuse me? It was not Daria to point out every episode you like to do is ok, as long as it is ok and yourself does not matter what the rest of the world is sick to think about it? All this reminds me of the scene of the "Reality Bites" movie channel shows the document for the first time.
