A lower than average video game back in some sort of scheme has the following terrorists discovered in the USA grounds. Welcome to the cheapest lunacy made in video movies. It is filled with non-actors and actresses with little drawn value. <br /> <br /> Anyway, this strange game goes on with our "hero" bet real money and make good of it. It is sort of like gambling, except the gambling party goes and sucks. Rather it is a online game with little real value and you get authority over that if you do well. What makes it even stranger is that two computer programs strangely fight it out somehow and all is saved at the end. I'll let the viewer see how it all comes to fruit. <br /> <br /> Overall, not even worth a $ 1. lease. "D-"
