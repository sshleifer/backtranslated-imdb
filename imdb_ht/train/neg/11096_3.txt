I had high hopes for this movie, because I thought CLEAN, SHAVEN (Kerrigan's first feature) was absolutely terrific, the most sure movies Cinematic Budget I've ever seen. <br /> But many of CLAIRE DOLAN is completely free and flat. Scene after scene looks randomly at the mix, without much thought of narrative or character. Is Claire trying to escape being a whore or not? Hard to say. Why does he pick up the trick at the airport if he wants to escape this life? Why does he then not pick up tricks when he needs money in Seattle? Why do we have to see her hair dye in what is exactly the exact same color? Why did Claire accept some John and not others? The movie does not seem to know. <br /> It feels as if everything is etc. (though I understand this was not the case) and the filmmakers just held a camera on it as if they had made a true doctor. <br /> After the screening I saw, Kerrigan defended his lack of narrative choices by condemning narrative films as politically conservative. He sounds like learning talks. I think it was a cop-out. <br /> I'm saddened that the maker of an exciting movie like CLEAN, SHAVEN would go on to make such a movie as one and then defend it and tired of the old "political" clips.
