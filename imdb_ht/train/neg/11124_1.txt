I generally do not give much to worry about the film violence, or a vast amount of philosophy, symbols or psychology. All this very well with me and the movie brings a lot of our highest. There are beautiful pictures especially in the lake and the nature, a good setting of character, a good direction. This movie could be voted for as a good movie. However, it is spoiled for two reasons and both of these reasons in relation to making this movie simply disgusting. <br /> <br /> First of all, violence has been used against living creatures to make this film. By film violence, I talk about REAL violence. This violence alone may be justified if not with that number of reasons; The message of the film was not only introspection of directors to tighten relations towards women. Not that we all do not have some real twists and women. (Respectful person). But the conclusion of the movie breaks it all. <br /> <br /> <br /> * spoiler * our "heroine" finally died, (not here but clean though i remember correctly i saw this movie this year ago and it upset me, now the guy is out and a new movie witch I certainly will not look) and is now even more clearly portrayed as some kind of natural spirit, nature growing on it, in particular her sex. Of course she is the director who "killed" heroine women them. Women should die, especially if people are attracted by their sexuality. Which seems to be the final conclusion. ** End spoiler * <br /> Well, well all that maybe fine with me if the director would have to keep seeing him in mind. But they use great photos, artsy direction of creature creatures, just to say people can be scared of women, and the cruel men for women. It's just not enough. I knew when I saw this film he would achieve good criticism of the "philosophical, eastern and artistic" and whatever approach. But to me this movie is just totally messy.
