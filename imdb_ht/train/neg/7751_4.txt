First, the CGI of this movie was terrible. I watched it during a marathon of bad movies on the SciFi channel. At the end when the owner of the park died, it's probably one of the worst examples of CGI I've even seen. Even the night of the dead was the best animation. <br /> <br /> That said, the film was almost no conspiracy. Why was this particular island? Well, he was not stated in the movie. And why would the people continue to come to the chat area? There is no sense. <br /> One thing that stood out of this movie was moderately good acting. In what could be called a "B made for film movie" film, the act was very good. Parents Shen stood in particular. <br /> If you have absolutely nothing to do on a Saturday, watch this movie. It may be good for some memorable quotes.
