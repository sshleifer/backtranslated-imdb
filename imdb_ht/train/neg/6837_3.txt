Normally, I do not like movie revenues .... PERIOD. But Double Impact has a little more than your typical revenge scheme. You see, DI has action, accuracy, local exoticism (D. .. Hong Kong), awesome weapon battle, and enough martial arts to satisfy your desire for impressive impressions without weapons. Like all shooting revenge, it has bandits you would like to throw out of a plate-glass window on the floor of a 40-story building! However, Double Impact is not in the sensational sense that suffocates the plot with the elitist, racist, and stereotyped social venom that invades "eye for eye" and "Death wants 2". drawing double impact departments is as transparent as wrapping money. Chad and Alex's parents were killed by a bump squad that connected to a family friend and money problem or at least that I was remembering. The explanation why the boys spoke in French accent is a ludicrous one. It was not the water conspiracy that made this bad movie, but the use of clich√© lines and moves from other cinemas (from the Lethal Guns Princess Bride) really made it worse. But While Double Impact is always watching. But why is this movie angry as this bandits (for example, vicious British guy who killed Chad and Alex's parents with that lethal chick red chick) would you like to hate with the fiber of your being?
