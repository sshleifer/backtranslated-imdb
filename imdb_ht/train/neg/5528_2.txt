With this movie just running 61 minutes and nothing is all about good on TV, I decided to pop the riot of zombies in the DVD to pass the time. Even while achieving the era from which it came, I was sorely disappointed. It started with the optimistic odor quality of the opening note (what - there is no music brooding?) And then the sequences open rather slowly moving. Gosh, I figured out a movie about zombies - even in the 1930s - there would be some thrill in it (White Zombie, and Bela Lugosi, certainly did) but that was no. Zero. It was just the same dramatic (except for the few moments and the burning eyes superimposed on the movie to indicate the mesmerization of someone). Like the equally dull king of the Zombies, this film can be an interesting curiosity of own, but nothing more.
