See the version in 1936. As I personally get to see Charles Boyer's voice, it's more of a cosmopolitan cosmopolitan match, depressed Rudolf - I mean Omar Sharif is trying but no - too cute and vibrant. Catherine Denueve (SP) besides being too old looks like nothing like Marie - nothing! It seems too sophisticated even to think of dying for this man's love in such a way. The only actor in the movie who alludes to the role playing is Ava Gardner whose appearance as Elizabeth Empress on the screen is fittingly short (and looking up photos of the empress has over more than a resemblance) as historically, Empress Elisabeth Did not involve much of Rudolf's life.
