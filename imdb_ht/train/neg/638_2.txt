The good Earth is perhaps the most boring movie I've seen in my life. The plot is slow and miss. The act is Borderline Funny. While I love Paul Muni, I can now say I've seen a movie that does not fairly true to his abilities. The only saving savings I found with this film is its production value. The use of hundreds of extras throughout the film creates a very credible and interesting environment. Also, the beautiful effects used to create the illusion of millions of wasps sold easily and was revolutionary at the time. Other output values ​​I can tell little other things that are good or fun about this movie.
