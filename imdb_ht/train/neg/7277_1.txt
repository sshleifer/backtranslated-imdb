"The National Lamp goes to the movies" is the worst movie ever made, beyond even the "Plan 9's out of outer space." At least that movie was just inept; The film, on the other hand, is both stupid and mean. Once upon a time, movies used to respect the audiences' intelligence. This one, however, maintains a bodyweight, corpse of corpses to our faces - and then tries to scrub our noses into it. <br /> <br /> Another review on this site was written that the only good parts of the movie are the naked scenes; and I agree, Missel Ganzel and Dusenberry make flash a bit of body, and very pretty meat it is. But the directors seem not to realize that even T & A needs a good history surrounding it. There is no one here. <br /> <br /> Perversely, the movie makers save the worst for the last. The third of the three segments is the ugliest of the trio. In this vignette, Robby Benson plays an officer-curious young police officer reporting on his first day of duty. She is scared with a weary, Shy Oldtimer playing by Richard Widmark. For just a moment, we hope that this movie will finish triumphs. Surely, we think, the spunky young mood is rubbing off the cynic and changing it for the better. Forlorn hope! Instead, the cynic wins the day - and the young villages doused forever. "The National Lamp goes to the movies" and top right for the bathroom, asking us to follow it down the drain. Nominally, this is a comedy. But where is the humor?
