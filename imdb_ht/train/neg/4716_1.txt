This show is dull, lame, and basically tattered on all sorts of various things in order to make it "the original." The first: The animation is so ugly ... Johnny is horrible ... and all annoying people. Twins look like young Dexters from "Dexter's Lab", and Johnny is almost like a Dee Dee Dee Dee (also in the "Dexter Lab.") Secondly: The plots ... are lame, which are hard to follow. The gags are corny, and nothing really makes me feel forced to laugh a little ... especially when it tries to be funny. I saw only two episodes, but these were just turning me off. <br /> <br /> Third cut: The whole song starts off by charging off the tune in Green Day "American Idiot." And, while not a big fan of this band, I found it really mute that they would take the same opening melody, and then subtly change it, in order to make it their own. <br /> <br /> to point ... it's a great ugly fat. 1/10
