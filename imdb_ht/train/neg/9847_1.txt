Peter Sellers plays Dick Scratcher (ha, ha), a cook for a pirate ship that takes command as he killed one before. Although witnessing a treasure that was buried, he began to lose his memory and the treasure map found to be empty. So Dick is forced to find someone who can see and communicate with ghosts (or put an ad for that?) And help lead a path to the treasure. It's mind boggling how anyone might have bankrolled this movie freeware. Former Millie Spike replaces Medak as director, and gives Medak's talent to the movie The Ruling Group, you can probably guess that in the tight, illuminated scenes had Milligan's chairman's chair. Peter Boyle makes a brief appearance in the first few minutes of the movie capturing capital. It's probably very grateful that Young Frankenstein has released this year's filmed and box, so he can keep this in his summary. Franciosa looks superbly as the glorious-looking-scratcher but she and Seller both look very desperate, and even Sellers' makeup and hairs are quite awful. They knew this movie was bombing as it was filming it. With such lines, I can understand any possible anxiety: <br /> <br /> Pierre: (About to be hanged) You will pay for this. <br /> <br /> SCRATCHER: No, I did not. I'll do it for free. <br /> And that's one of the good jokes. It's amazing to me that many of Prolific material Sellers are still in the graves, but this has been made available on VHS over 15 years ago! How about someone who lets up the patch and releases in the US to receive the British TV program "A Show Call Fred" starring Sellers, Milligan, and headed by Richard Lester's great?
