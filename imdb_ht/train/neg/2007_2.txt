Throw is OK. The script is awkward at times, and takes a moment to figure out which point in the film is. I found myself looking forward to making the dishes. Little Shehan is a cheesy statement about the war. I guess we supposed not to notice it ... we did. It's a home, you've done nothing more than killing forty-five minutes. Part of shower ... huh? What was that about? Literally, it is I have a customer, "Ok you can use our shower." Be cautious. The angles are trying hard. There was a set of woods, its sudden cause you can see the right, then its next is deep and the animals are dying. At the end of this is a lurid movie in boring proportions.
