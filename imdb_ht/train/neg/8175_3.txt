The atmosphere of this movie is very good and it captures the feeling of the 80's well with some good performances. <br /> However ..... <br /> <br /> The script is run to grind with the exception of a couple of comedy moments and coming up as being unheard of where I hope he intended to be edgy . The characters are totally over dramatized and incredible with full wing wings that the script writer probably sees watching a documentary panorama on the national front. The biggest problem is this movie has no real story. It ticks all the boxes "ati" right but there is nothing actually happening and at the end you are wondering what the point was.
