ORCA is not exactly bad, but it's not really Richard Harris's best hour either. As a resignation, Ahab-like fisherman, Harris joins a game of death and a vengeful bloodthirsty killer after killing the "wife" of the candle and unborn children. Charlotte Rampling plays a candle expert who gets involved in Harris. He cries out a lot about how important it is to leave nature alone. It does not cost and somehow ends up in the arctic fighting the crazy candle revenge. There is no special effect to talk in except for what looks like a round glass for an eye candle --- Endless vaccine at Harris reflects in the eye for the hearing to understand that the candle knows who it is. Kiss Derek, as one of Harris's crews has a particularly unpleasant run in with the Orca and most of the support cast, including Robert Carridine, Will Sampson and Keenan Wynn are not very good tickets either.
