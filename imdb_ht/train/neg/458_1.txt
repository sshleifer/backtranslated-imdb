What is this crap? My little cousin chose this out obviously for the DVD DVD DVD artist and title ... I decided to look at her with it so she did not get bored, and I'm sure she was amazed at the quality terrible. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> First, the act was awful. They look like amateur actress reading cut into four cue. Delivery is sub-par with highly formulated. The slash sources were awful .. it seems to have taken it straight from the story board, if there was one. Secondly, jokes and stereotypes were not originally or well played throughout- yet, many formulas. I can not count the times I could predict next joke. I got a few chuckles from the blatant "subtle" inuendos to sexual. The Cat, The Beaver Patch, Hung Wong? .. c'mon! Just .. stay away from this movie. It's not nice, it's not funny, it's not stupid-funny. It's just stupid-stupid. It's like a movie of a PG child who has no unnecessary sexual use, vulgarity, and violence to hit the MPAA rating. STOP "<br />" Would you like to ride my yacht? "" Is what they are calling it right now? "<br />" You could ride my finger. "Oh, I think I got blood on my stool!" Worried play, guys.
