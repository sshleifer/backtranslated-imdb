Wowwwwww, about an hour ago I finally finished watching this horrible movie !!! I wanted to turn it into the first as 10 minutes but I figured I would give it a chance because it just hadddd to get better. Or at least some kind of loyalty, as I figured at least so much it would make you think of movie quality, or as really smart, or very well filmed or something ... obviously say, that was not the case with me wasted about an hour and a half in my life. I'm not even going to find out why its terrible because it's a waste of my time explaining that this "can contain defurators" ... IMDb, you should calm down on the spoiler thing and pay more attention to doing that those who rate movies and comments are not paid to write good reviews or participate somehow in the movie or anything else like that. I thought it would be funny after this horrible film came to see how bad the rating would be and I was very shocked to see the fairly high ratings ... all ratings and about 7-10 stars clearly be on some completely DIFFERENT movie ... Im always a big fan of IMDb, but seriously rethinking this rating process because this movie should be rated by higher than maaaybbbeee like a 3.
