I saw 7.5 IMDb rating on this movie and on this basis decided to watch this movie that my roommate was renting. He said he saw it before. "It's funny and sad! I shouted the first time I saw it," she gushed. Perhaps compared to other Bollywood movies it deserves a 7.5 out of 10, but in comparison to all of the other movies I've seen in my life, this is worth no more than a 3. any movie where I can ever guess what which will happen next is not good for me. The incredible characters, how the act is not realistic at all and their motives are comparable. It is about dramatic and the songs are not all that great. My biggest problem with Bollywood movies is the lack of intricacies. All the emotions are way too much and so not at all realistic. Any emotions or bonds between characters that are small to the subtle must be great and a necessary song. I think I understand that the relationship between father and son was more like one between friends than one between parents and children without having it transmitted through a five-minute song. The ridiculous humorous relief filling and laughing laugh was not funny or unnecessary (we get it, Laxman is not the sharpest tool in the sink). If a movie tries to limit tears in the most hacked means it's possible is just not meaningful, just a bit nasty. <br /> ***** SPOILER ***** <br /> /> Generally, if someone has lung cancer lungs the sons who live with them would know something was wrong without having said . Too many county counts are counted. In the first movie was fun and beautiful in Bollywood movies movies are those who do not look at them avidly but it just was tedious. It takes a lot of skill to make a movie that is fun and heartwrenching and the best way to do it is usually not having all the fun parties in the first half of the movie and all the parts heartwrenching in the end. <br /> ***** COVER OVER ***** Maybe it has a lot of depth more than other Bollywood movies that I've seen, but not much at all. I spent more time laughing at the movie's sort of passion than supposedly funny. I did not shed a single water or I felt like it, instead I was overwhelmed with a feeling of disgust at the attempt at a dramatic end. I do not recommend this movie if you want to look good, I recommend it if you want to watch a Bollywood movie that kind of sad.
