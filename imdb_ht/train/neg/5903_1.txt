I live in Salt Lake City and not a Mormon, so why have I rented this movie? Well because I live in Utah and think it would be nice to see where I know in a movie. I really knew that going into it that I was not going to find the jokes inside so I was not surprised when I sat with the deer in setting the front lights. What I was surprised at was the anti-Mormon action that was put in this movie. <br /> I know it is a Mormon movie, treated by members of the LDS Church, but I found it offensive because of the typical stereotypes of people who are not in their faith. Anyone who is not Mormon, who was not very much, drank, smoked and had an amazing selfish attitude, why? That really tickled me on this movie, they made Mormons so much better, but the rest of the Utah state I guess filled with psychos punk just because they did not follow the scriptures in their LDS Church. <br /> I can understand that the scheme revolves around all of their LDS members, but you think Salt Lake City was 100% Mormon, who did not even close to being the truth. And as I said, non-Mormons in the movie were described as jerks, please! ap.
