The script for this TV soap opera is so bad that even A. Hopkins at some point played as a drama-drama drama so as to bring some life into his script-death character. I do not know whether this was the goal of the director, but Coffin Hopkins' reeked anything but vanity, fear and lack of self-esteem. The real ciano possibly was all that, but then, why does a movie about it? Mussolini was a bit more convincing, and his long way down was as if closer to the truth. Edda Mussolini was ridiculous (not because of Sarandon, but because of the impotent script), while he was to be the central character of the drama of this family. Watch it only if you enjoy Venezuelan soap opera.
