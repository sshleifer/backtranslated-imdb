Bela Lugosi as crawler digger who uses wow brides orchids in order to steal life sense for wives of ages. The Midget in this movie is hilarious !! A lot of phenomena, plus a lot of padding and no plot to watch this movie a nightmare. I liked how all the pieces fell together at the end of typical Hollywood fashion. The story never becomes interesting, and you feel helpless while watching. <br /> Generally I would make key keys like this one bar, but the midget added just enough creepiness and fun to get a couple more points.
