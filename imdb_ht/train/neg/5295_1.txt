A teenager seems to have it all committed suicide. She leaves her family with her best friend (Keanu Reeves) asking a lot of questions ... and blaming themselves. <br /> <br /> Good idea, seriously occupying. For this starter made before 1988 - mostly in TV movies and after school specials. Aside from the swearing and dialogue (hence PG-13 rating), this has added nothing new. The result is Reeve's predictable and predictive attempt at acting really painful to look at. It is good now but not in 1988. Aside from that character he dressed as a slave and always looked so dirty was hard to build sympathy. <br /> <br /> The sideways movie is dull. I saw each scene coming up with all "surprise" being telegraph. I basically could not wait for this stuff to get over .. <br /> I have a vague recognition of seeing it in a theater in 1988 and hating it (its battery bomb). It always looks lousy almost 20 years later. The subject is worth handling but it did better (and better acting) in countless countless movies. "Ordinary people" come to mind. You can jump this one.
