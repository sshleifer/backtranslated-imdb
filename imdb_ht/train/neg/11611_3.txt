Lady of Cement - Poodled Parody with Ole Blue Eyes.Frank Sinatra is a shamus on a houseboat in Miami in this comedy "comedy" .Burdened by an annoying and repeating Hugo Montenegro notes and bunch of punchlines misfiring this 1968 flick just by ever raised above a little too rude to be on TV made for movie movie film. Blocker is effective in Mike Mazurski's / Ted De Corsia great robot role and Raquel Welch should thank his personal trainer. Make the DVD worth to watch or see is cheesy trailer collection for Welch flashlights such as Bandolero, fantastic trips, mom, frogs and speeds with Myra Breckinridge. Even if you get the DVD-skip movie is predictable and go for the trailer library of the special features. In addition to tons of mysoginistic asides- Sinatra lisps @ homosexual owners of the Go-Go bar's premises. Someone needs to be put back into the time capsule. D
