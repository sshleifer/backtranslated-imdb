We rent five cinemas for New Year's Eve weekend and watch this first. All I can say is that there was no place to go but got up after watching this one. It was pointless and vulgar. Harvey Keitel script will be easy to write - just make two out of every word a curse word. Andie McDowell is amazingly good at a character roll, but the movie has nothing else to recommend.
