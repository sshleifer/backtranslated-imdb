bad action, bad south accent, compact movie, horrible script ... <br /> I was looking forward to this movie in a recent movie festival and was so discouraged after seeing it. It includes quote / unquote talent name but does not deliver. Of course, the basis for this is the unequal and refreshing story that has been said. <br /> <br /> Do not bother
