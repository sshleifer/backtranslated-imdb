I rented this movie because I hoped it would be one of the whole family would like. Although the film is family friendly, my family did not enjoy it because it gives a fake fake god. If you obey God and follow Him, you are not guaranteed success. Your football team will not always win. You will not magically get the best score. Infertility does not always be healed. You will not always get a boost. Sometimes, you will be stuck with the old car. <br /> <br /> God does not exist to meet us every whim. Instead, we were created to praise him. Sometimes we praise him most when things seem to be bad for us. To live is Christ; for death is there.
