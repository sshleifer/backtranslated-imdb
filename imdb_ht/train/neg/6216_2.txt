9, the movie I was looking forward to months .... was little more then a deception. I was deeply surprised by the lack of 9 in history and unusual character development. All the awesome action sequences in the world do not make up for one unsympathetic character. <br /> <br /> The strange, almost cast in the occult sequence was not only from where they were infuriating. The story is about robots and scientists ... why it suddenly turns into a horrific necronomicon wannabe with mysterious symbols and green magic ghost lines instead of giving answers to what could be awesome awesome story device? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> How, what, when, why .... questions that annoy ask only if you care and it becomes less and less likely that you will be as far away from the theater. <br /> A movie like this is frustrating because of its lack of depth .... I would watch this movie draw in pencil if the story was good. But the filmmakers relied on CGI wizardry and Tim Burtons No shot in the crowd. Which ... what drew me from failed to gain respect. <br /> 9 could be scary ... and a few more redirected and slightly more respect to its own creators.
