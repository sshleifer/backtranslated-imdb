Another of many almost forgotten movie movies cranked out by Poverty Row in the 1930s, is resurrected by the magic of DVD. <br /> <br /> Starting Universal Lionel Atwill (often a supporting actor in many Frankenstein movies) as a pair of twins involved in a murder operation. One kills the victims (stockbrokers involved in a scam) and asks for the exact time, while the other is deaf and proves "innocent" because he could not talk to witnesses. where it falls apart is if it was a congenital softer, would not they both be deaf? Oh, well. <br /> <br /> Attacking a pretty good job here, faking are deaf and dumb. Unfortunately, no other person here can really act worth a jerk.
