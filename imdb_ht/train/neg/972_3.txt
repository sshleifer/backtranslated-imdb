This was a disappointing movie about a young teenage girl and her dream. For a horror movie or "thriller" with hype, it's way too tame. There are only moments of tension in here, not anywhere as close as much as they should have been for a movie in this genre. Even those "strains" scenes were not much. The music made them more dramatic that they actually were. There are a lot of symbols here, so criticize elitist labeling this "a horror movie to think of the person." Well, if they think about it, I'm sure they will come to the same conclusion I did - a waste of money in the video rental store. <br /> Summary: a yawner that offers an unlikeable and generally poor lead character. Really overrated and certainly not what it is publishing.
