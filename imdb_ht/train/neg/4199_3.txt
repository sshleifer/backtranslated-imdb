Very poor efforts that offer pretty much nothing but a hardcore fan of Stanley Tucci, who is trying, but can not save the poor structure, dialogue, direction, or talent of our leading people. <br /> The only trick that this plodding of a new naive seller for an alarm company has, is its original side character. But without a realistic set, these characters are pointless. <br /> <br /> There is nothing to see here, keep moving ... <br /> <br />
