This is the worst movie I ever paid to see with the exception of "They saved the brain Hitler" the worst film I ever saw period. At this time my film was a big fan of SNL and SCTV and therefore anticipated what I thought would be the funniest movie that would be produced since it had not been restricted to the improved TV show being cope with. <br /> <br /> Writers must be thought to be thrown into some whispers, some flatulence jokes, some cheap sex and hey we have a risky side to divide ridiculous comedies. Show them to skit their games there is nothing more than cheap unimaginable to take compromise on Let's make a deal with stupid rude. The site com takes into that involves the single girl and her boyfriend was just plain mad humor to high school. The gun chun campaign was appropriate humor for Seasame Street. The LA TEA was humorous swelling using tasteless flavor. The French driver walking around blind always pronounces "no difference" with a French accent was, well you get my point. <br /> <br /> Only the funny shiz that involves Chevy Chase lasting for a whole minute. That means you get 60 seconds of fun in this movie. Oh yes I have read the reviews nationally stoned in the 1970s and you will love this movie if you are high. Well most of the land was not stoned in the 70's. If the writers who were misleading were stoned, they would have been on drone syndrome. There were 4 other people in the theater besides myself when I saw this movie. Of course words did not get out again about how bad the movie was.
