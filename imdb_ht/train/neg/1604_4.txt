Remember a movie you seemed to enjoy in the past that does not quite satisfy those feelings as an adult? That happened to me when I returned to school .. Reunion National Class of the lamp. The film has a perfect opportunity for laughing, but surprisingly wandering as we see a rare collection of characters like a woman who sells her soul to the devil and can shoot out her mouth flames, a man who seems to be a Vampires, and a lunatic assassin dressed as a woman and put her bag on her head. You have the class president who believes it is the best thing since slicing bread (but as we see in the movie, it's a loose and joke), a couple of smokers who do not even know at their own class meetings, and a man named Gary for whom one knows even knew existed (and no one can seem to remember his name..this one is running jokes I've enjoyed). There is a rough pervert that loves to catch women in inappropriate places, a woman who is deaf and blind with a worry when calling for her dog, and the cook (you know it from "goonies" and "throw mothers out in the train ") who loves to put food on the people's plate with his hands! The movie is essentially a Nutcase (or at least try) to take revenge on his peers for a gag to pull on him (they arranged for him to sleep with his own twin sister!). The film follows the characters as they search for the bloodthirsty assassin killer, trashed halls of old high school. They were told by the killer by his psychologist who seemed somewhat odd to himself. The film has a few good gags that work (pretty much early on), but the movie slowly worsens every minute. The true movie problem is that it really does not know where to go. The movie is pretty much a quote of a joke so it has direction to die ..so it really has any direction at all. Throw is enthusiastic enough, but the material to make comics just does not have the quality to keep any interest. It's a curio for fans of early 80 comedy rumors that are forgotten (this one just so).
