This gives some of the plot, by the way. A Charlie Brown Christmas is one of the classic timeless ones that teach you the value of Christmas and just enjoy the holiday. This, however, does not. She tries to take the emotion of a Charlie Brown Christmas, there is even another Christmas play, but fails with substandard and easy jokes. Charlie Brown is not asking about the spirit of Christmas but is rather willing to buy a gift for Peggy Jean ($ 25 gloves ... what?). Sally sally it is the most annoying character of the movie. Here is one of her jokes: Sally wants to write a letter to Santa, but she does not know how to spell Charlie (for some reason she needs to be in her letter) so instead decides her name Sam, because she knows to spell Sam. Also, Sally plays an angel in the play with one word to day: "Hark!" It instead tells stick hockey (he's har). If Sally says hark 12 times (all oddly sounded exactly the same) does not kill you, nothing will be. Patty Peppermint and Marcy are a great focal point, but that hardly does it better. Marcy is funny with her response to Patty, but Patty is another story. It sounds like a boy (who does not dispel the rumors) and gets mad when he has to be the sheep in the play (terrible ruler and all). Apparently she is the sheep every year, and she worries she will forget her line (line no). He is so worried he mentions it twice, one right after the other, and gets the same answer. I accept it must have short-term memory loss, or something. Lucy and Linus are more welcome (although Linus still has annoying tips), but hardly many hours. I'm sure Schroeder is not even in this one. All in all, it tries to have a parasite in the original, but compromising the message for a quick laugh.
