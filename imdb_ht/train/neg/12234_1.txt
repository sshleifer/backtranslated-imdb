I think it was just pointless to produce a second part of a movie like "My Girl". "My Girl" was a very good movie but it is ridiculous to make a second part of a movie in which one of the main characters (Macaulay Culkin as Thomas J.) dies. The story was about after the first movie. I wonder why someone tried to find a way to make the story going on. That was meaningless!
