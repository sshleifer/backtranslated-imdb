I was very excited to see that a movie was made from my favorite books ever. I did not realize it was Disney until it was too late. I was amazed by the many omissions of the important part of the story. It was as if someone made a movie from a 4th grade pupil on the novel. Meg has done well at school and both his father and his wearing glasses. Mrs Murray (Meg's mother) was not described as much of a scientist at all; They left her kitchen laboratory and replaced it with the internet. And this is just the beginning. By half of the movie I found myself shouting at the screen, much of the dismay of the others who watched the movie that did not read the book. I wish I had more thumbs so I could give four thumbs down to this one. The only good thing I can say is that someone who does not read the book, this movie is quite good.
