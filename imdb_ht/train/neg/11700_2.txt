I was really looking forward to seeing this movie, but after watching it I was really disappointed. The best bit was when Stephen King was in it. Rober John Berk can not act to save his life, nor any of the others. A few of the same performances make me laugh loudly! The movie was not as I imagined it, after reading the scary book, I imagined it darker and a lot scarier. If I were Stephen, I would really be crazy! <br /> I do not know why to change ends, I thought the end of the book was pretty good. If you just get out the pie to kill your daughter, you would not eat it to anyone else you would ?! <br /> <br /> Books were so much better!
