Roger Corman is one of the most versatile and unpredictable directors / producers in history. It was one-sided but responsible for some of my favorite films ever (like Edgar Allen Poe's adaptations "Masque of the Red Death" and "Pit with the Pendulum") as well as some cheap foule quickies and tacky garbage (such as "Creatures from the Haunted Sea" and "It's God of the Reef Shark"). Corman also made a couple of movies that are simply unclassifiable and ?? simply put ?? almost impossible to judge properly. "Output", for example, as well as this imaginatively titled "gas-s-s-s" can be somewhat marked as psychedelic explosion. In other words, they are incredibly strangely hippie-culture influenced movies. Half of the time you have not had the slightest idea what's going on, who these characters are returning to the idea of ​​the screen and where hell is all this going. The plot is simply and yet very effective: a nervous but deadly fuel is accidentally triggered and promptly canceled by the global population over the age of 25. This * could * be cited in the baseline of a Atmospheric, fearless and naked-bitingly suspenseful post-apocalyptic sci-fi landmark, but writer George Armitage and Roger Corman decided to turn him into a "trippy" movie-comedy movie. None of the characters are even trying to prevent inevitable deaths in the future; They just went out of the streets and found little juvenile juvenile criminal. "Gaz-s-s-s" is a boring desperate and tries to overly difficult to be scarce. Script all appear to be etc. in the place and not at all funny. Definitely not my cup was, but the movie has a loyal fan base and many admirers, so who do I have to say it is not worth your time or money?
