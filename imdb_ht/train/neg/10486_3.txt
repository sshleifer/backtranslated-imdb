My main comment on this movie is how Zwick was able to get credible actors to work on this movie? Impressive cast ?? even for the characters supported, none of which helps this movie really. I have to admit if, Tom Hank's cellar almost made it worth it ?? what about Tom? Did you lose a bet? The best camera in the movie was Joe Isuzu though - not far from a classic! The situation is good. Basinger's character, struggling with existence as a Lady Pink, is making his way toward Vegas Moto by motor launching the glorious pyramid of cosmetics sales. This happens as Corbett's character is on his way to Vegas to deliver an Elvis suit to his soon to be ex-wife motivated by .. what else ... extortion. As they both make their way, they have many run-ins and elvis impersonators on their way to an Elvis convention imitating Vegas. Soon, the FBI gets involved and begins to follow what they think is an Elvis imitation serial set. Unfortunately, quotes do not mean the movie was good. <br /> When watching this movie, imagine you are back in the first class ?? when story lines and continuity are not really important. She is much more enjoyable just watching Basinger look beautiful in her outfit Lady rather than wondering why she does not really make sense. The movie is trying hard, but ultimately falls short way. Ultimately, it is full of ideas that could have been theoretically funny but in practice they were not funny. <br /> It is not the worst, but you can find yourself feeling like leaving the building when watching this one ???? Do not say I do not warn you!
