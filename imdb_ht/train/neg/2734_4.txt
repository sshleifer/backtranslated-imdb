But allowing her to face it ... she got a few nostalgic jumps from me. <br /> <br /> The show is just so great that it is allowed to have a few hiccups. I get a new season, and just power in them like I have 2-days to live. I love the idea of ​​wrap it, but it was much more of an epic sequel that would explain the following: <br /> <br /> DrCox does not suppose bald for a couple more episodes, only the explanation I can think of is to change the rotation of these episodes or re-shoot at the beginning. <br /> <br /> and my friends, why the coke hell is bald. <br /> <br /> Anyways, the show is awesome ... carries on the 7th season.
