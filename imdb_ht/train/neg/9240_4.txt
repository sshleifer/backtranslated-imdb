The idea of ​​making a minister on the Berlin plane seemed to me as one of the more interesting German cinema (post) wars. It is a term that has not been explored so much as yet. However, the singers in this series saturate it with clarity. It begins with the DVD coverage of the movie, which is a direct copy of the cover of 'Pearl Harbor'. Luise Kielberg (Bettina Zimmermann) heard that her husband, who is a doctor, (Ulrich Noethen) died in Russia and after the war it's difficult to survive. She found a job at the American base, gets work for the coolest and highest ranking (Heino Ferch) officer in the city, falling in love with me, getting pregnant, and all of her sudden husband turns. Come !!! We've seen that once too often. Heino Ferch and Ulrich Noethen play their role well; Bettina Zimmermann does not really seem convinced. For some reason it seems it's a bit too late to give the emotional right reaction to the scenes. It just did not work for me. Scenes of action and planes and awakening the air, we are sometimes interesting, more often not. The stuffy stuff always looks like the same pilot. <br /> <br /> Unless you're a big fan of WWII movies, I suggest you spend your money on something else: chocolate ice cream creates great satisfaction! <br /> <br /> 4 out 10!
