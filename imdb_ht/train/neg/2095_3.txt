Battlestar Gallactica was so great because it had tight writing, a great look, excellent actor, and interesting stories ... And yes, there were hot and women men running around in and out of uniform. <br /> <br /> Caprica was just lazy. Lazy writing. The actors smoke up a storm to give them "character." Sequence outdoors that ruin the feeling of being elsewhere (yes, that's a Ford focus sitting in the background). Many and many of the young anxieties. Many of the naked women (but in the background. I'm sure they will be cut off for the series) and a sign of signs in some towels. None of the actors except Polly Walker took my attention to all. At one and a half times, I was always wondering when she was going to do .. So what exactly is it supposed to bring me back? Science fiction? It's awfully light on that. The actors? Besides turning Polly Walker's fine, there are not many interesting things to do here. There is no "hotties" at the disposal, except for perhaps Esai, although for the younger wear it is very old, since it is over 25. <br /> I loved BSG. I was skeptical when I heard about Caprica, and unfortunately, I think I'm right. I predict a very short run for it as a set unless they really sharpen the pencils on in SciFi and get to work to do this more than the OC on another planet.
