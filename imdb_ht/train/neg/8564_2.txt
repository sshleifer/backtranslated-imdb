The film itself is so pathetic. It describes deaf people as cynical toward people hearing. True, some people who are deaf are cautious for those who hear people, but they are not necessarily upset as Marlee Matlin's character was in the whole story. Deaf people do not go to the bar and dance Matlin did. All in all, the movie itself is much more boring than pathetic. It is so boring that I would like to believe it is a insomnia-healing film. If I have a sleep problem, I can simply pop into the child a better God and look. He will put me to sleep. <br /> <br /> Keep in mind, this is a deaf person talking.
