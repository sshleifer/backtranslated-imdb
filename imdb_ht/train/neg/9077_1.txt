If you enjoy such films as American Pie, Road Trip & Wind Wilder; avoid this cinemas refusing at all costs. It is an unamusing, mean-spirited, insipid waste of resources that should never be discussed aloud; much less actually registered and sold to unsuspecting consumers. The worst movie I've seen in the past 18 months; mind-numbingly bad for 86 all the minutes of it's exe. If it was longer, I could not write this review without using profanity. Consider yourself alert!
