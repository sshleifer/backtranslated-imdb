The movie was terrible. The theater was dead and silent 'cause everyone was embarrassed to be in the watching of these garbage. I think someone gave Jet It a lobotomy and made it a script and dialogue written by a five-year-old. Martial art are 'ok', but when placed next to the movies Jackie Chan and the "Matrix" you will better see one of these people.
