A young person gets a bad hair day, goes out on a mountain, and falls into places where he can not escape. Then he met MR. ATLAS, a "mythology" dude from 2,000 years ago as his best friend, with a look-and-sound-like Arnold Schwarzenegger. Herculean forces help the boy out of danger, and later adjust to modern life. So what's the big deal? This is the lousyest idea for a "family" outing! Either way, this one should not have been tried at all, really! Our fictional character could be with brawn is nothing more than a typical stranger that looks ordinary and the rest of the universe. To add to blasphemy is the lack of new things or appeals, and before you know it, there are some non-skilled violence that's called "family" entertainment. The scene where Atlas complains of its sigh is gaggling, though. Just spend a nice, quiet afternoon in the park for a change.
