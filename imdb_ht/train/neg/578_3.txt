This is not a good movie. The act is remarkably strenuous and compelling. The film does not seem to know if it will be a real horror approach or go down the camp and firefighters. I have never seen the movie first but this one does not stand up on its own merits, there are several compelling twists of Draw and the viewer has never been aware of the importance of female lead vampires. Not worth the effort watching
