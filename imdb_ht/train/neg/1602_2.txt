Anyone who thinks this movie has not been appreciated for its comic genius has to have smoked with the two stoners in the movie. This film is NOT under-rated ... it's a bad movie. <br /> <br /> There should be no comparison between this film and the Naked Gun or Aircraft since the letters of the films are well written and funny. Reunion groups are neither of these. The sad thing is it's like potential (good cast, good story line), but the good jokes are few and far between. The scenes supposed to be funny become annoying than fun. The guys stoner, the vampire, the blind girl ... NOT FUNNY. The only funny character was Delores (one of which sold his soul to the devil). National Lanpoon has made some really good films (Animal House, Vacation) but this is not one of them. I certainly expect more of John Hughes.
