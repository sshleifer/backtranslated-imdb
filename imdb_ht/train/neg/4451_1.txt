This movie was probably as funny as the naked gun (which was supposed to be). Case of point: <br /> <br /> 1. In order to fake Roberts walks it secretly taking swim lessons at the YWCA. After her "death" YWCA calls her husband to work to condolences. HELLO how did he get his job number? <br /> 2. Before leaving her town, she drops her wedding ring into the bathroom. Days or even weeks later lubby find it in John. That means the bathroom has never been red? <br /> <br /> <br /> 3. No explanation of how it pays for her mother care in retirement home (since she made it behind her RICH husband). Towards this end Roberts's film suspicion her husband is at home. Instead of running for her life she runs in the kitchen instead to see if the boxes are stacked neatly.
