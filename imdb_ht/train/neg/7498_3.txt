Spike Lee has been in decline since his early success, and this mess does nothing to help. I watched I often expect the movie to end or go to the point. Lee's first film and a whole white cast are a great disappointment. <br /> <br /> What's the point? That Italians swear and like funky sex, but not with their wives? If I wanted to see Scorsese, I'd go to a Scorsese movie. The character incredibly coupled to the prey only adds to the stereotype. <br /> I've admired several of Lee's films, especially "Making Things Right". This movie is a waste of time.
