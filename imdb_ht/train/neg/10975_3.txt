This movie course - let's get that right now. Some gems scene nests inside this pile of pile, but no one can save the plot. Colin Farrel looks like Brad Pitt in "12 monkeys" and acts in a similar way. I normally hate Colin because she's a fairy in general but she's OK in this movie. There were two lines drawn in this film- = one on a kid who throws rocks at speed car moving and the other on a woman with a mustache. Let's face it - this movie has no frantic idea of ​​what it meant or where it wanted to go. Their character line character is interrupted on some levels, but they have no merit of being included in a script. The whole thing is weak and pointless and then there is an occasional OK scene. But in general - do not bother unless you like the Irish accent so much that you can watch mediocrity and it is saved by everyone sounding like the Lucky Charms elf - an American fetish that has catapulted some of the truly crappy movies.
