You know you are in trouble watching a comedy, when only the entertaining parts of it come from the Animal Throw. It's a pity then that parrot, cats & dogs were only in support & not the other way around, as the people of it were very abysmal at all. <br /> <br /> If I were you, Paul, Eva, Lake (that sort of name is that), Jason, & Lindsay, I would forget this milking act and doing something else, as all of you funny as watching dry paintings, and the terrible actors boots. /> The main gag of the movie is one of the crying characters, I'm not Gay, which is funny as if you did not, you could change your mind if you were set up with three bossy, tedious and give them say I'm very nervous to lead to the movie. <br /> <br /> The worst movie I've seen in years, and hopefully never seen one as bad again, even though I do not expect.
