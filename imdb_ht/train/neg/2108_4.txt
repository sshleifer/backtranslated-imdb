A number of brides are mysteriously murdered while at the altar, and later their bodies are stolen en route to the morgue. Journalist Patricia Hunter decided to investigate these mysterious killings. He discovered that before every ceremony, the bride was given a rare orchid (supposedly from the groom) with a powerful drug that succumbs to them. Patricia said that the orchid was first grown by a Dr. Lorenz, who lives in a secluded real estate, and his wife. In fact, Dr. Lorenz is responsible for the crimes, do not put the brides in a state stop, and use the fluid gland to keep his wife eternally young. Patricia, along with Dr. Foster (who works with Dr. Lorenz on the medical mystery surrounding his wife) try to force Dr. Lorenz has set up a phony wedding, which eventually leads Patricia to the crazy doctor's clutch. This movie has a very good opening coil, but basically ended with too many established vaccines and other weak performers. Throw is decent, Walters and coffins deserve better, but this life. Russell steals the show (even from hamming Lugosi-who does not give one of her more memorable performances, even considering her monogram) as Countess Lorenz plays the role and the qualities of many of the stereotyped features of many of today's Hollywood prime donnas . Swak and convert end as well. Rating, based on movies B, 4.
