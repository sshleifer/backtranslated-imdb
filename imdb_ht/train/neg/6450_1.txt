Well this movie is amazingly awful. I felt sorry for actors involved in this project because I certainly did not write the lines. That was sometimes released and sarcastically slight, leading me to believe that this movie was not taken seriously, nor could anyone watch this obnoxious off slasher monster. While watching this "Unknown Creation" I could not help but think that was not much of a budget or a competent writer on the crew. But if you go to watching this for a laugh you will be happy, the film is cynically mocking itself because I can not see how anybody could look into this and be proud of pumping this straight in DVD Disclaimer wants to cast movie / horror movie festivalfest for light.
