OK, I love bad horror. I especially love horror horrors enough to make the fun. Demonicus, or House of the Dead - these were bad enough to make the fun. Severe was not <br /> (<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I have a number of comments, both In this "absorbed" style and in the realm of current criticism. <br /> <br /> Draw (sort of) - Have a guy in this city (which is possible Seattle, see the comment below) (I will not return to find exact numbers - thank you very much), possibly two or three years. "A head of a week." And the JIS police today are now calling in a "specialist" (which ONCE refers to himself as a psychic, but never gets up) .Feds take over after, what are three connected homicides? After NEW a DIRECTIVE DIRECTIVE we should be under the franchise of martial law !! !!!! <br /> Anyway, this voodoo Chick's "specialist" was police that ignored the whole time, and the two of them came to the conclusion that it's Baron Samedi, a voodoo spirit Those who cut themselves get enough power to make themselves a body (and then presumably p rank on the world - or perhaps just go to Disneyland). <br /> For. <br /> Settings - where is that happening? Well, if you do not come from Seattle, you might not realize that in the bar / divage (occupied by ten of the movie staff and family members), there is a poster for a local radio station, and that's pretty-fun , "Pulp Fiction" dialogue dialog (like SI) between the two cops (yes, those who take themselves off about 15 minutes in the flick) to discuss the "new stadium" that can still be a problem then movie was do. <br /> Being from Seattle, I apologize to the movie and hang myself in shame. <br /> OK, here's where it gets really criticized - being a horror movie writer (not published, do not go looking for my name in the IMDb), i do research. Many searches. And unlike the writers of this film, I know that Saturday Baron - while a Loa Voodoo (spirit) guarding the halls and has traditionally been associated (by various Christian oppressors) and "Satan" - is actually a "Loki" god. In other words, it does not cut themselves. In addition, a large part of the religion of Voudoun is that Baron Saturday can have a body at any time. Religious ceremonies center around the possession of various members of the people by the laity. <br /> <br /> Not to mention, if it has already owned someone, why do a new body? , if Baron Samedi GOT a body, it would not go to head off, it would find some good rum with cigar and par-tay !!! <br /> In summary, the only thing they did get (surprisingly) right is that in completely unnecessary reading of Tarot cards (used only to show that the voodoo chick is "spooky") they did not screw up their interpretation Maps are the most cinema ways to make. Again, I did research. (Anyone remembers old late-night ad for phone-to-read readers - "The lovers - you'll soon fall madly in love ..." and all that idle?) <br /> <br /> If you've made it this far in my comment, I congratulate you. And I'm sorry again. I'll be more sorry if you feel like watching the movie on account of me, so please do not.
