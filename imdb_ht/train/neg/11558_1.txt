Outstanding horrible stories that I can barely put in words. The best part of the movie was when one of the murderous victims turned to the end, alive and well, only to be massacred again. Likely I missed some key element components since I could have been in a small coma during this time this baby was over. The box that the movie comes in shows that never performed in the movie. I was drawn to by the little images of slavery torture and promises of a 'Euro-movie waste, sexy film.' I found the feeling this was the budget version and about a quarter of the movie was left out. All the stuff is more than lucky. I received the PG-13 addition that made sense as the end of the new 'Planet of the Apes Movie'. Watch this one with a friend and a bottle of the hard stuff. You will need it.
