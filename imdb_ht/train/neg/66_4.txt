I guess I was attracted to this movie both because of the sound of the story with the leading actor, so I gave him a chance, from director Gregor Jordan (Buffalo Soldiers). Basically, Ned Kelly (Heath Ledger) is organized by the police, especially Superintendent Francis Hare (Geoffrey Rush), he is forced to go on running to form a gang and go against them to clear his own and his family name. That's all right I can tell about the story, as I have not paid the full attention to be honest. Also begins Orlando Bloom as Joseph Byrne, Naomi Watts as Julia Cook, Laurence Kinlan as Dan Kelly, Philip Barantini as Steve Hart, Joel Edgerton as Aaron Sherritt, Kiri Paramore as Constable Fitzpatrick, Kerry Kondon as Kate Kelly, Emily Browning as Grace Kelly and Rachel Griffiths as Susan Scott. Ledger does a very good performance, for what it's worth, and the movie has the eye-catching moment, particularly with a gun fighting towards the end, but I can not say I liked it as I did not watch in it all. Agree!
