I saw this "hot" movie when she was from 1986. She had an X rating for a short scene involving oral sex but played in mainstream theater (it was an "art" movie). Supposedly it is the first movie ever to show a respected actress in a clear sex scene. <br /> <br /> What I saw was a boring story about a high school boy (Federico Pitzalis) of love (understanding) and an older woman (Maruschka Detmers). As mentioned before Detmers is very beautiful and a good body but also gave a very good performance. Pitzalis was (to put it mildly) very poor. No wonder he never made another movie. Still, despite the sad seductive scene (which is explicit but very short), this is a slow moving story story that bored me funny. The good act by Detmers only helped at a certain point. Mostly I looked at my look waiting for patience for her to end. If he did not have the sequence of this movie ever forgotten. Mat and slow. You can jump this one.
