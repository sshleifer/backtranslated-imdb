There's laughing in this movie, that's for sure. Michael Keaton is a talented and used to be funny (before he decided he was a serious actor). However, what bothers me much about this movie is how unjust practically all of the characters. Other than the two main, everyone is a jerk. I mean, these small town losers are as uncouth as you can. You just look and think, people, these losers should be unemployed. In addition, the U.S. factory worker is described as a lazy and incredible slave. He asked me whether this film was made by Japanese nationalists. Oh sure, in the end they all come together as one, but I just did not enjoy the trip to get there.
