Absolute waste. The reason this is so terrible is not because it suggests from the formula, but because the plot was just pathetic. <br /> <br /> The star supposedly did not do anything to solve the case - and neither did anyone else really - he just worked routine police. Always tiring. <br /> You sat right up to the end to expect for a twist - and got nothing but a great sense of deception. <br /> <br /> There was plenty of potential to have a relative in noticeable kidnapping. Could Lt's personal involvement ultimately be his judgment cloud? <br /> <br /> All the signs are obvious to a stranger to do it. But surely a genius like Lt C, by constant conversation with the wrong husband, would gradually uncover a fiendish scheme involving a recording tape recorder in the shower room while a groom massager surprise the bride, hiding the body and Then subtle indication plant. It could be good. It was a complete waste of time.
