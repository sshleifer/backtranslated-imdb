If I created a movie thermometer, this film would be absolute zero. From ten stars, I would miss it as follows: <br /> Draw: zero star Video quality: zero star Sound Type: zero star Actress: zero star <br /> It is as if high school students were assembled one afternoon with a camera, made a plot and shot a movie. It is so lacking in any artistic value that I prefer to look at kids walking in a high school than watching this movie. <br /> <br /> HOW, something is to be said to be abysmal. The "Shooting" of the stairs is one of the most commonly-trained comic scene ever. First of all, the fighters simply wave plastic weapons in each other, dipping the arms back and the ideas to simulate reluctance. The pair actually "duck" non-existent bullets each other. No squibs, no sparks, no space, just got squirtguns spraypainted around. If you want to see two adults playing "actor", give it a turn a day ... after cleaning the fridge, pay the carpet, polish all of the doorknobs, graft the gravel, straighten the books on the shelf, etc. .
