Why this is so popular? It's beyond me why people like it. I think it's one of the worst sitcoms out there. I tried more than once to watch it and I can not do it in an entire episode. <br /> <br /> For one thing, the act is awful. Everyone is overacting at the point where it's annoying to watch. They speak in abnormal voices, use abnormal tones, and have abnormal body language. I've seen better acting in a school in kindergarten. <br /> For another thing, it's not fun. Plots are dull. They are not creative, smart, or fun. Should not a sitcom be funny ?? Why not laugh? <br /> <br /> Finally, what about seventy years? It is about as authentic in the seventies as "happy days" were in fifty soldiers. <br /> <br /> Oh and what's up with Ashton Kutcher? Who threw this untalented beb? And now, does he make movies? Oh, save us all! <br /> If people think this is high quality TV, it worries me.
