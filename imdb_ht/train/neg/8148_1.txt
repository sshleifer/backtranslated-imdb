Did I miss something here? This "adaptation" has everything that Brookmyres first novel was. Everything apart from the story, the laughter, the black humor, the political intrigue, the features, the plot, and some pretended to sense. <br /> <br /> Spoilers! start to finish. They made a mockery of the draw, they had a romance between Parablane and a cop, and that was all about, Dr. Slaughter was described as a bystander, and that hell was Annette Crosby supposed to be? /> It seemed to have made an hourly adaptation, then cut it down to 90 minutes. (Even though 90 minutes seemed to last forever.) Please do not make this any of the Brookmyres books, especially the "Country of the Blind.")
