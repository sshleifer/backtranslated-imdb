As a gamer, I can not say I like this movie. The fact is, I go down to hate it. I tried to look her as open minded as possible, but when she came down to it, she felt rather insulted in my social group. <br /> <br /> For me there are several reasons why. <br /> </ strong> 1. The characters seem unnatural. I met many players in different markets in life. I do not know anyone who acts like any of the characters in the movie. As the producers of the movie have taken the worst aspect of the worst stereotypes, it puts them all in 5 people. Most gamers are rather social people, some with rather active lives. <br /> 2. The style does not work. The mockumentary style is appropriate to the subject matter of the film. An actual documentary on gamers would actually work better. While it is good looking (I.E clears together), it's not very good. The dialogue feels forced, abnormal. It also looks like any real world context. Gunners swear, I'll admit that, but we do not have the Tourette Syndrome. The mood is missing. While self-deprecating humor is a pillar of my group and several other groups I have encountered, this is less self-deprecation, and more like humor toilets. Likewise, a large part of humorous gameplay is full of jokes and anecdotes, not humorous toilets. Most gamers would have the balcony and off anybody who made such jokes. The biggest problem I'm basically is this: Accuracy. I do not mean rules but rather dynamic. Still, this movie will compare to the budget films even lower to the gamers and gamers: Dorkness Rising, both in showing players as current people playing an actual game. The difference is, gamers: The movie presents a situation where you want to beat the unlucky players vs. gamers, where you can say something like: "Huh, I know a guy like that ... Yes, this definitely loves Gary . "
