Paul Naschy has made a large number of horror films. In terms of quality, they tend to range from fairly good to innate waste; and unfortunately, Horrors rise from the grave is closer to the latter. The plot is just your average story of a witch, wizard or (as is the case here) warlock, who can kill - but not before swearing revenge on those who did it ... etc. etc. We then to get a serenity and one thing lead to another, and the pretty soon seated executed is up to no good again. The plot is slow, painfully bothered and the film is still feeling insecure. The characters tore out the diatribe rhyme and never served the movie in any way whatsoever. Paul Naschy wrote the script, and if you ask me he should stick to act because the dialogue is trite in the extreme, and only serves to make the film even more boring than it is already. Carlos Aured, who also directs Naschy in Blue Eyes in the Broken Doll and the Curse of the Devil gives direction to here, who loves the dialogue does nothing to help the movie. Sometimes film films like this have a certain charm on them; but horrors arise from the grave do not even have that. This is a bizarre boring movie that has little or nothing in the way of interest.
