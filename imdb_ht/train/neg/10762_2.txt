This was an impulse pick up for me from the local video store. Do not make the same mistake I did. This movie is tedious, unconvincingly acting, and generally boring. Dialogue between the young priest and his uncle is particularly poorly written and rescued; I cringed in every scene to share. Dennis Hopper makes a few sparse appearances and is usual to be disoriented; His role was clearly not a stretch for him. And although the film is supposedly placed in Puerto Rico, it feels a lot more like a lot of Hollywood films; All the main characters are chess and several tends to speak English with their pseudo-Irish accents. Odd. Anyway, when you see this one on the shelf at your local video store, keep walking.
