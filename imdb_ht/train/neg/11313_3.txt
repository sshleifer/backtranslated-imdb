and it does not help the rohmer's case that some years later Syberberg came along and made a piece of staggeringly great work on the same subject (with a little help from Wagner). <br /> <br /> Maybe this movie did not look so pervading when it came out, without the syberberg movie to compare it to, which was probably shot on a step even smaller sound with less resources . I actually can not remember at this time if there are horses in the syberberg movie. All I know is, the German version is pure magic, while this one looks like some collective productions documented on film for archival purposes. <br /> <br /> The music ... music ... not even credited here on IMDb ... but someone based it on 'air from the 12th to 14th centuries' or something. .. it is not a great help to the movie it comes as inauthentic and cheesy, like le out of my prayer is one of those French people who love its leaders generally quite unattractive, too, and does not help matters Parsifal syberberg was adorable, and can be seen on German TV today selling some kind of special bikes he invented .. <br /> <br /> I'm hungry to think what's looking at the syberberg on video is like.I remember that last time I saw the movie in a theater, the print was so bad that the experiment was a whopping 5-hour travesti. But even then it would have surpassed what version this was offering, I'm scared .. < br> <br /> point for ceremonies, for chutzpah, but ... this film simply needs beau-coup more bucks .. it does not look like a medieval manuscript it looks good! good march !! oh and yeah, l It just ends very arbitrarily with Parsifal going to church and this passion fraud has interacted ... blah!
