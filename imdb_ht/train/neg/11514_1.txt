No doubt, when Madonna and Guy Ritchie were married, she was because they both thought she would help their film career. If you were in the watch watching "swept away," then you know at this level it was a match made in hell. After almost 20 years of trying to become a respected actress (or "octress" as she might have pronounced it to the "Next Best"), she still can not get out of herself enough enough to turn into a performance that Anyone who has tastes could even call decent. And that's the thing that makes people flu much off the screen: who feels that ego is so inflated that it prevents him from being able to just let go and connect with his audience. If there is any justice in this universe, it just blows it last chance.
