This movie was fun at times, hell sometimes it was even downright funny. <br /> <br /> The hidden message that I got into the movie though, was that women are responsible for all the issues of people. Every time a woman shows in the movie, she is being lazy, slutty or lambs of poor guy for no apparent reason. I do not think the message involved is good for gay or gay men. But it is a comedy, with a piece of art, so it's simply someones point of view. Even if I do not agree with it, they still have the right to it. <br /> An entertaining movie, but some of the comments made by others are just plain plagiarism. Best movie my legs.
