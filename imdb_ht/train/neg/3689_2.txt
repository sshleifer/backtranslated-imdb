The main aspect of the superstar cinema in later stage was the frequency, lacuna between one movie and the next. Being a well-established star in the South American cinema, the feedback received before Baba was great. Since Nattukku Oru Nallavan (1991), the number of movies he acts in Tamil as a hero hero in 11 years was only 11 exactly at the rate of 1 per year. All of this was a big hit. It had an image that many thought could not be easy to bring down. But after Padayappa (1999), he entered a state of hibernation. His fans all over the world, especially in South India, were ready to see the movie of any kind and superstar in action. So the Tamil movie industry decided to come with Baba. <br /> <br /> The movie makers thought that their fans will take whatever show and superstar in it. But this clearly did not work out of this movie. As usual, the hype from the media and the expectation from fans were way beyond limits. <br /> <br /> The Rajinikanth's image was totally damaged. The fans went black. The film collection did not meet the expected level. The great reputation of people has come down. <br /> <br /> Only positive aspects of this movie were singled by A.R.Rehman. Rehman is known to have composed good music for some of the worst movies such as Tajmahal, Kadal Virus, Alli Arjuna, Paarthale Paravasam, Star, En Swasa Cave, Vandicholai Chinnarasu etc. Well, I never thought that this film would be in league. <br /> <br /> You feel very depressed not because the movie was bad, it should be because of the superstar image going down. He took his five-year full to recover it completely back to two Chandramukhi and Sivaji movies and give fans back what they really look for in a superstar movie.
