I do not know what else to say about this terrible movie that has not been said. Honestly I have only myself to be upset with them. I should know best when I saw this film title that it would be a horrible piece of crap, but I love Toy Wars so I indulged my whim. I will regret this decision the rest of my life. From the very beginning when the government people explain that super computers can determine what a terrorist was just by way of playing a video game I knew I was in for a ride though good-written writing-minded a. Very sad, very, very troubled line tracing, dialogue, and acting for long I would crash IMDb if I tried to post it. For those who said they saw worse movies than this, please tell me. I'm actually curious to see something that might be the top of this steamer pile of manure pigs.
