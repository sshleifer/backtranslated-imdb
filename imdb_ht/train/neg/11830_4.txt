Ok maybe a 13 year old like me was a little old in this movie. It's about this pampered rat, who lives in a palace. Then a sewer raft flush it down a toilet! She ends up in this rat city and meets this girl's rat who has a gem a greedy frog. He will do nothing for this gem and sends a whole army after these two rats. He plans to capture the gem and city of raft raft! This cool part of this film is the bullets. They make every sound effect. They sing, make noise, its awesome, it's also very funny. OK under line, it is aimed at 7 year olds. Other wise, a big movie to take a smaller family to see. I did not think the animation was real art dreams though, more like WAllace and Gromit. I thinkthey slacked a little over that. The movie was just decent, not worth spending $ 9.50 for though, sorry.
