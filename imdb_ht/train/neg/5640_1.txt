I'm a big fan of Willem Dafoe, and really looking for this movie (I had to find a 5 Chinese DVD Region in it!). But it is really one of the worst that I've seen in quite a while. The act (except for Dafoe) is horrible. Dafoe and Colagrande BOTH have written and directed this (though not credited as a principal), and are not discernible talented to write or direct. (Stick act William, Giada to get out of the business, TANP!) <br /> Absolutely nothing happens. Except for a completely compelling, totally motivated, motivated act, by the two people (who just met) in this house. Sleeping Colagrande, I could not care less practically practically never changed. And the sex scene is outright lame. I actually cringed twice at one of them. Yuck! They are definitely not the least legacy, and yet are the only time the movie does not put you to sleep. Then it's busy repulsing you. <br /> <br /> Just awful.
