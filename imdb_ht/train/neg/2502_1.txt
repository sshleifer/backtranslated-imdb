But another Dead Hard straight to Rip off video with Cinnamon bandits ?? How many more of these terrible Gods (and seriously) made Rip off of the famous acting films in the late 1980s and early 1990s that are still cached outside? For the record (not that you will really care) this one is yet another blatant rip off in a combination of die hard, under siege and speed 2 complete with a complete complement to glide and predictability. Non-usual descriptive bandits are the usual selection of cardboard box cut off toting weapons that are sent by various means as the film progresses, the hero of course is an ancient cop or something with family problems and attitudes and of course it brings together The party is not only the usual emotional luggage, but also a matching piece of eye candy with his bitter child. <br /> <br /> It is supposed to be the luxury cruise liner that runs between Florida and Mexico to carefully describe as a cross between a liner and a ferry ?? this goes a bit to explain how come they appear to be larking around on a rust canal cross ferry ?? in New Zealand! The acting is as wooden as the pile, the unpleasant script, the one predictable material, the nets are utterly stupid and the plot has holes in it you can sail a boat. There seems to be a never ending tide in this sort of rip off straight into video garbage bursts of late cracks in television and binders to bargain DVDs in widespread shopping (although even this movie is so bad it has yet to see a DVD release yet, but give it time!) Is there any chance of something at least half decent, semi credible and most important ORIGINAL? No, I thought by ...
