This is a review of 'Freddy Mercury's The Untold Story,' released theater, Chicago Int. Film Festival, 2007 One of the no-imported and most tiring biographical documentaries I saw. If the movie I saw in a movie theater was originally released on TV, I would struggle with its producers and distributors by fooling a paid audience with the false promises of a certain feature film cinema. As a documentary made-for-television, santosella pianos accompanied interviews sitting in front of flower arrangements in hotel rooms and firefighters, the pseudo-literary narratives passed more true to a Sleepingapedic Infomercial bed. Only the facets redevniated in this "The Untold History of Freddy Mercury" - or, uhm, was "The Untold Story of Princess Diana" are the original concert, video and television footage - Freddy Mercury and Queen. Interview with testimony and eye witness on irrelevant and insane, such as: "It was a free spirit," (really .. I thought Freddy Mercury was a company ...) negligence these Freddy testimonies, by Brian Me or Montserrat Caballe new flow and light affection in Mercury's complex life and character. And ... who went up with the potions that had been mounted Harry Potter-like? How does the interview with the first girl-break ("... who now works in a travel agency") and members of Freddy's first school band contribute to what I really want to know about Mercury? Vital Milestones in her personal life, her sexuality, her artistic style and growth, Queen, the band remains unexplored. These filmmakers do not ask a single, provocative question, nor are they engaged in self-searching or visionary search of the topics, rather giving a tiring timeline to politely clean and vastly empty commentary on an enigmatic and brighter stone legend, which does not deserve to be remembered by biography history This story of your grandparents may be overweight on a Sunday night.
