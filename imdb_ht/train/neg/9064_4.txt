In fact, Adaptation "Off-Broadway" Marc Blitzstein at "Threepenny" was not so "bowdlerised" as generally believed. <br /> (I have a special interest in "Threepenny"; My dad was part of the first full production in the U.S.; Illlino Theater Guild made it at the end of WW2.HJitler was almost successful in preventing the play Reconstructing the script and recording notes in two different languages, a German script, and the same source.) Blitzstein's adaptation - not a "translation" - which has the full approval of Lotte Lenya - A much closer to the original than generally believed. <br /> <br /> The problem is that the version that most people know is the MGM cast recording (recently available on polygraph on CD) (including Beatrice Arthur {as Lucy, "the complete complete girl ", and I can not see her hand on hips and shoulders thrown back on this line - Bea was a big babe in the 50's}, Paul Dooley and John Astin) was heavily censored by Mike Curb, head of MGM Videos - I mean, 17 (I think it was) "Goddamn" was off just "damn". (At one time, MGM also offers a 2-LP set of * all * plays in, undoubtedly as much censored.)
