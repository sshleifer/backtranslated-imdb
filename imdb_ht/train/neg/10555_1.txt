First of all: I love Splattermovies good and I'm not afraid to get in touch with art, but this zero-budget-flick movie is not in it! The photo-quality is so slowly low, the most annoying band I ever (!!!!) heard, and folks for the FX ... the super-low quality does some of them look like not Wrong as they would in a real movie (what this junk here is not). There are no concepts, a wafer-thin scenario, primitive acting and rare dialogue - I think I count on 10 phrases in the entire movie, each repeated about 20 times ... even for a lot of movie sequences (they can be a indication for what kind of audience was crap was made !!!) The story seems that a young boy had to watch his father raped and killed his mother, was psychologically damaged and as an adult goes touring, doing a show in self-mutilation. So far, so good ... But for these pseudo-art-idiot-guys, this draw is just a line to put cheap product trauma scene in a row that neither has nor a message make no sense (freshly taken-out gut is thrown on a naked woman, tied to a ground-hole ... why and why this is the only time you see both women and shoots in the entire "movie" without .. .) ??? Disorder? Yes! Sick Yes! Necessary? No! Artistic? NO !!!!! All those who experience this cheap show-for art should be as soon as possible to visit your psychiatrist or should look Pink Floyd in the "Wall" to see how a similar subject can work on a racy way ... I hope this was your first ever (!!!!!!!!) movie, Andrew Cobb ... !!!! With all you gore-out, remember: Not everything that looks cheap and makes obviously no sense at all is automatically "art" ...
