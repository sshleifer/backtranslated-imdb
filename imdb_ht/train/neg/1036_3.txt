Ho-hum. An inventor (Horst Buchholz) who can kill biological weapons in danger of falling into the wrong hands. Unknowingly his son (Luke Perry) worked on the whole altogether. Join the CIA agent Olivia d'Abo and chat-with-mouse chassis machines and start shooting gunfire. Also in the cast are: Tom Conti, Hendrick Haese and an aging Roger Moore. Moore looks haggardly moving across this mess definitely by no one of his best efforts. Perry fans will be accepted. The Abo is wrong for the role, but the nice look.
