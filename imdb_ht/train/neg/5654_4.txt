I never heard of this film she played as part of a retrospective Robert Mitchum at National Theater Theater in London. Almost 60 years of the cast list seemed delicious to say the least and seven names - in addition to Mitchum's self-bills - in the public domain; Charles McGraw, not long ago at The Killers, Barbara Bel Geddes, long before Dallas and arguably still best known as Daughters in Theater Designer Norman, Walter Brennan, who needs no introduction, Frank Faylen, the nurse sadistic boy on the weekends of Lost and the much nicer little-town mensch It's a wonderful life, Robert Preston is still a decade away from Harold Hill in the Music Man and Tom Tully and Phyllis Thaxter make up their numbers. Alas, most of them have wasted their time. I look vain for any 'signature' scenes given by Robert Wise on bullhorn. At this time she would do around a dozen half film and she always found a style. The story is our old friend of war and Mitchum had to think he was barely a cut above the hopalong Cassidy oatra on which he would cut his teeth. There is no new twist - if you do not count the incredible scene when Mitchum accuses Preston of sleep and Thaxter gets information about his father's plans to move his animals. This is indeed true but how did Mitchum KNOW? We have seen or heard nothing to indicate how she discovered it. On balance not a lot to say for that.
