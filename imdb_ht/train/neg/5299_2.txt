I really love Slasher movies, but this one is really awful. The action is lame, the script is bad, and the atmosphere is non-existent.The work is as follows: a distorted field Charlie Puckett slaughters people in a small American city. This is right-this is the draw.Originally original, eh! "The night brings Charlie" is not even gory enough - if the movie will not be scared, at least it should make it bloody. With this cheap piece of garbage at all costs. If you want to see some good slasher flicks check out The "Madman", the "Burning", the "Prowler", "Just Before Dawn" or "Humongous" - just do not waste your precious time with this worthless piece of waste.
