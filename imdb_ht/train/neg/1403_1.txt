An absolutely miserable waste of films !! Nothing happens. No ghost, hardly any trains, no mystery, no interest. Constant and brutal attempts at the painful comedy. Everything else is pathetic. The first is idiotic: a bunch of people blocked in the middle of no place, because the trains were kept up for less than 3 minutes. What? And the railroad leaves no place to stay, in a heavy storm? I think not. Oh, they can walk 4 miles across the dead-black fields. umm, yeah. Make sure. Or, they can force themselves on the railroad hospitality, and stay at the train 'haunted train station .A station that has proven nothing but DEADLY BORING, net without ghosts, interest, or conspiracy. that this looks impossible. <br /> <br /> This should be added to the LOST FILMS list !! aargh !!
