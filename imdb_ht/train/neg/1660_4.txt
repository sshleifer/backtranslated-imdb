Endpoints <br /> <br /> Aspect ratio: 1.85: 1 <br /> <br /> Format: Mono <br /> <br /> A woman turns her table over a rapist-ta when it comes to an attack his house, and forced to decide whether to kill him or to inform the police, in which case he could release and attack him again. <br /> <br /> Fan tappers who might expect another rude 'n' ready fantasy rape in the style of the Women's Day (1978) will certainly be disappointed by extreme. True, Farrah Fawcett's character is subjected to prolonged prolonged attack before taking her hands on her attacker (a suitably slimy James Russo), but William Mastrosimone's scriptwriter and director Robert M. Young take these unpleasant scenes only so far before The inaugural dilemma informing the moral core of this production. Will final solutions be held in a court of law? Perhaps ... <br /> <br /> Based on a stage game that reported leaving its actor beats and tilted after each performance, the film made no attempts to open up the narrative and relies instead on a limited setting for the main action. Acting and credit techniques are good, though Fawcett's performance suffered will not play effectively viewers who might rest on providing an outlet for outraged outgrowths.
