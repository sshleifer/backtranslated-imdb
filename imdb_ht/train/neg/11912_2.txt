This story behind this film is very interesting, and overall the plot is not so bad ... but the details: writing, directing, continuity, rhythm, action sequences, cascades, and the use of CG are all cheap and spoiled the movie. br /> <br /> The first, sequence action. They are all quite unexciting. Most composed of a person who stops and gets shot, makes no effort to run, fight, dodge, or whatever, even though they have all the time in the world. The sequences just seem bland for something made in 2004. <br /> <br /> The CG features very nicely to acquire and animate their effects, but they come from looking cheap because of how they are used. Rally: everything happens too fast. For example, "Elle" is trained to fight in a couple of hours, and from start to back-flips, etc. Why is it so acrobat? None of this is explained in the movie. As Lilith, he would not need to be able to make back flips - maybe he could not, since he was zealous. <br /> <br /> Also, we have sequences like a woman is running on a car, and getting up, she just wandered into a desert room with a sink and ice, and then stabbed her head In the throat, all for no apparent reason, and without any of the spectators really care that he just was hit by a car (and then felt the side effects of another, exploding cars). "Are you okay?" ask the driver "yes, i'm fine" he said, bloodied and clutter. <br /> I watch it all, though, because the introduction promised me that it would be interesting ... but in the end, the poor execution made me want for anything else: Blades, Vampires Hunter D , even the film and vampires where Jackie Chan was a funny rescue, because they managed to stop my disbelief, but this just made me want to shake the wake director, and give the writer a good talk.
