This center on the unironic notion of coming to grips with guilt. Merrill berates the grief boy to stop her 'shining' him on Rennie's death. Old-style real men in action, here. <br /> <br /> The crash plane model and crash vehicle must have been impressive on the big screen. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> in no game with the viewer on narrative structure. This would become a rough pattern for future claims, such as "fearless". So all we are leaving with is individual performance, and at this level, it's best for Wynn's intruder, a virtual one-man show.
