and forget that. Completely. If you really need to see Madonna act, renting "Body of evidence", at least Willem Defoe is in this one. <br /> In this movie, while these beautiful sets, you can want to mute the dialogue. You will not miss anything. Bruce Greenwood is wasted, Jeanne Tripplehorn is a clean, and Madonna is so awful, it becomes fun. Why was the original movie closed in this mess, I will never know; Guess they thought he was "bankable". Madonna, as an actress, certainly is NOT. If you rent the original movie from 1979, though, you will enjoy it, and the actors in it can actually act. 1/10.
