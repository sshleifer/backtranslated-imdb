Well, I guess I'll have to be one to say "The Emperor has no clothes." When I saw this show listed for PBS last night I was both hoping and fear. I liked "Morse" (even going so far to buy the full DVD set) and felt that, while I still love the Kevin Sgt. Sgt. Lewis character, shows WAS John Thaw, period! After watching the new "Inspector Lewis" (as it is billing here), I am more convinced then ever that I was good ... That's good (though it looks terrible (both seriously older and too fat), but it simply does not have the charisma to bring the show as did Thaw. <br /> And folks for "sidekick" Fox, well ... maybe the evaluators here from England can understand what he said, but for one particular could not. <br /> As for Madam Innocent ... all I can say is that I miss James Grout. <br /> I'm sorry to say they'd must have left "Morse" rest in peace.
