Really. Will any week go to that Oprah do not remind us that he has abused as a child? <br /> <br /> It makes itself concentrated in every interview. <br /> <br /> Oprah insisted to comment on the Answer to each question she asked. It often interrupts guests before a final answer interprets their own aside or anecdote. Principals are obviously instructed to focus on his reactions rather than the guest's face because that's what counts - what Oprah feels, what Oprah says. Oprah, Oprah, Oprah. It's all about Oprah. <br /> <br /> Oprah says - Feeling sorry for me, I was so poor. Feeling pain in my fight with my weight. Feel my pain when I'm away from a fancy store after being closed. Feeling good about buying my magazine and books. Feels good for my success. Feeling good when you give me my charity makes me look good. Feel good to make me rich than belief. <br /> <br /> My interpretation of point of view: YOUR OPENERS are all moved FLAVID and you need my daily advice. I have all the answers for your life if I have nothing in common with you. I never got married or I do not want to. I never had to raise a family - but I know everything about it. I have a little respect for men or a wedding. I clearly prefer people like me on others - witnessing "Legends Ball 2006". Gayle is my best friend, but we're not gay. However, at the beginning of 7/31/2006, the title on its website actually reads: "Oprah.com is your leading source for information about love, life, self, relationship, food, home, mind and health." As pretentious and obnoxious is that? <br /> In June 2006, she crashed from private wedding reception in Oklahoma to pick up her September September show. It keeps promising to let TV but yapfest it drags on to no end in sight. <br /> <br /> Unlike what she thinks, Oprah is neither a queen, nor a goddess, nor on a personal mission of God. It is just one very lucky one, overweight, black woman who copies Phil Donahue's style and calls her own. It happened to be in the right place at the right time and knew exactly how to suck up the right demographic. <br /> <br /> Oprah is P.T. Barnum at this age and amazed me that people can not see in his facade. <br /> So ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls and you too are Oprah if you can fit that bloated ego at the door - that way now in great ...
