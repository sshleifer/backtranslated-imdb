Amaterization best describes the film adaptation of the best-selling novel of philosophy "Celestine Prophecy", which follows the spiritual lift of a teacher from a mysterious village in Peru. Home quality video actors feature the so-called spewing display displays and hokum metaphysics, while the movie is launched by the heavy-handed hand in Armand Mastroianni. Even though there are visible attempts at measuring up to and exciting fans at most fare in the vain of the ABC's "Object" or Dan Brown in the Da Vinci Code, the filmmakers are hardly up to the job. This film rook of ill-design mass spiritual spiritual propagation, and the results are so awful some can pass through this mess in place of a real point.
