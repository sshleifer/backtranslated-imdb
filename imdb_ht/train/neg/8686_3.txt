I am marking this as a "spoiler" only because of some of my comments in the content display, not in the content itself. As I read the comments it is apparent that these Republicans somehow tolerate the show, but disdain it, while the Democrats seem to relish the so-called this veracity. An even reader (so it looks) actually indicates he believes that these events have been or could have occurred when Bush was in the classroom. But as to the content as I see it, trying to neutralize, is that the band that made this series must actually really be Bush. In the episode that I saw last, s02e03, she showed that the program must have been put together before McCain became the front runner for the nomination; because, the other runners in front of the elders were all featured. <br /> Another thing that keeps my attention is used to add to wardrobe. I thought that the series must be made in Europe for sure not in the USA, because I know that no home of the USA has been built in wardrobe, and most likely in the houses of artists. <br /> <As I look at the show, yes I get caught up in it, I'm surprised to see what to be a terrific desire of writers to do to be able to embarrass our presidents. Ensure there are issues like most Americans will agree, but that's no reason to be so lovers of public displays seen around the world. Maybe the trend has now been put into this show and network, so if Obama or Hillary got in, would they continue to produce and the same sort of "humor" on them? comment on commenting a comment. IF had some sort of change in the election back in 2000, according to the writer, he was sure there would be a completely different president acceptable. Wow, wishful thinking on his part. As far as events 911, I believe it was put in motion when Clinton was president, and I can not see how if Gore was anything president would be very different.
