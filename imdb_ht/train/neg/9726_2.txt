That's a fascinatingly terrible movie. It makes so much sense that it begins to make a kind of innocuous internal logic of its own. Well, it would be if he did not keep darting in up side corridor until eventually floundering under the weight of its own indecisiveness. The movie can not make itself whether it's a straight forward 'Man Turning to Monster' flicker movie (as all those 1950s 'incredible insert ING MEN' s composite movies), or a big movie conspiracy theory film movie, or a mysterious contact history after life, or ... or what? Take your pick. That's just a mess. Gratefully on the top and shoot off in every direction, let loose loose flapping all over the place. It was as though Tobe Hooper took David Lynch seeds. Unfortunately, it did not take enough.
