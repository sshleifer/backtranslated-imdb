You were forced to drop it to Steven Seagal: regardless of his other faults, he has good taste in women. If you choose a Seagal movie, the odds will have one or more beautiful women in it. And they usually do not function as single candy; They took part in the action and fought, shotguns, killing and knives, etc. "Flight of Wrath" offered the duo of Ciera Payton (with a very sexy figure, with lustful taste to Angelina Jolie's) and Katie Jones, and get time to get involved with both a catfight and a little lesbian fondling! But if it seems like I'm spending a lot of time talking about them, it's because the rest of the movie, although peaceful, is so unexciting that it's hard to find many other things to talk about. Ironically, the weaker aspect is probably Seagal itself, which seems as though it can not even be bothered to try to pretend to care. This is a military-type shareholder, there are many fights in it, and it does not fit into its role (a stealth fighter pilot, "the best of the world", of course) very well, which can explain almost him are offensive sleepwalking.
