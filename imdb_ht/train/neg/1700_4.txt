In the movie, I feel as if it should be more than just art. I think it should be more than that, telling a story about the screen. This short of David Lynch tells a story, but not much of one. I felt it was funny but too scarce to be a comedy. It's good movie-making but there really is not anything else it's. As I said before, I'm a big fan of David Lynch but I get frustrated by some of her work because I do not see a need for it at all. This is definitely my youngest favorite thing she did so far but I know she always got a ton of talent and I'm excited to see what she was in store for us in the future. If you love Lynch, check out this, but do not be surprised when you do not like it very much.
