Dahmer, a young man is confused. Dahmer, a confusing film. Accompanying, I had a few beer while watching the movie, but this did not explain why I got that bored by this flick. <br /> <br /> Its rest is nothing but confusing and annoying, and there is no real storyline with a start and end, the only thing that made sense of the movie was the text explaining from the beginning and at the very end of the movie. The thing in between, which should be the movie, is just boring image with a waste of time. <br /> <br /> We never see current crime, everything is just a bunch of insinuations. Sometimes you just get a feeling that Dahmer dreams of everything there, but you know it's not, since it's <br /> based on a true story and this actually happens, at least most of it. But what happened? It's not easy to say. <br /> I do not encourage people to lose time on this movie. I <br /> <br /> did not like it a bit and I felt cheated when she suddenly ended. <br /> <br /> * / *****
