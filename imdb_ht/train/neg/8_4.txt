6/10 Act, not great but some good action. <br /> 4/10 Director, make some stupid decisions for this movie. <br /> <br /> 2/10 writer, history makes no sense at all and has a large number of flaws. <br /> 4/10 Overall score for this movie. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time with this movie, it's not worth it. I gave 4 for this film and it could be too much. Characters are so exaggerated than they can ever be in real life and some very inexplicable things happen "storywise", not in good ways. Because of the style of this film was filmed you get bored after 30 minutes (too many special effects: slow motion and camera shakes and fast forwards). It's always good that movies use music to make the story go smooth but there are too many tracks in this one. In the first hour there are almost 50/50 dialogues and music
