The British movie 'film industry is out of control. There is nothing wrong with classic movies, but why should all filmed by Talentless Nobodies? This rubbish film is from Orwell's hard novels, turning it into a harmless, fluffy comedy romance. 'Aspidistra' may not be Orwell's best work, but no-one reads out its superb dependence on poverty. Orwell emphasizes not only the cold and the hunger but the humiliation of being poor. In the novel, London is a weak, gray, cold, city belief, and Comstock praying for it to be dried up by a bomb squadron. But this film irons out of anything that could be in any way disturbing, and creating instead a Jolly Nostalgic journey in London 1930 good, in which everything is lit and roots in the sunlight, and even the slums of the picturesque Lambeth Lambeth full of freshly cooled urchins and happy prostitutes. Comstock's poetry on the sharp wind sweeps through the garbage-strewn streets looks completely out of place in this chocolate-box world. The worst of all is the unlucky bonhomie script, ancient jokes, and clunking dialogue. It is so frustrating that Richard E. Grant is the perfect person to play Gordon Comstock, and the film is packed with great actors. But it's all for nothing. This movie makes me so angry! Britain's literary history is something to be proud of for its wealth, complexity and power. And what we do with it? Our noble noble staff turns it into soft-minded, anodine puppies for those who want to feel that they're getting some culture while drinking the Horlicks and slowly doubling the twelve.
