The reason I intend to give this film a chance to take 2 hours of my life (actually it was only 35 minutes) wanted me to try to understand and hopefully appreciate the American movie. Everything I've ever seen was some older movies in S.Ray. <br /> Browsing through IMDb I came across this one and after seeing the 8.7 rating I conclude this must be the one that will open the gates of gender and bring pleasure to enjoyment. Oh how I was wrong! The only logical explanation for the rating of 8.7 is that most of the 970 people who voted Americans and their only venture outside Bolliwood production were Adam Sandler's movies. With this rating this film would be ranked on 9th place on IMDb's list of 250 best movies above Citizen cats, Goodfellas of psycho! I really do not have a revised attitude and criticisms because there is simply nothing that I get worth remembering from this painful experience. My only hope is that there is a lot of enduas who love me to get this movie as is - plain clown, and abundance of kitsch and cheesy music.
