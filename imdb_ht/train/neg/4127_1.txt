A movie such as this should be removed from all the world wide stores. So full of boring, dull, inimaginative characters, and a lead character and such an annoying attitude and dry voice constantly give a voice to deficiencies on each action and feeling, this movie keeps the record for my hardest movie never looked. As I paid the money to own it, I felt a duty to see it in, and how I regret it. My head hurt at all because of the tough and dull characters, draw less life. A lot of kids with zero knowledge about anything, they are all frigid and worst of all, have terrible dialogue at all, just mulling around as the main character is trying to find a date with the girl. Boring, so much for my friends shook with hatred and I was red and embarrassing that I would throw away Â£ 6. The DVD was on eBay this day, and I did not do much in my money back. Avoid such an epidemic.
