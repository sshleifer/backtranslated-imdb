Wow, a NYC political film is lost by someone who has never joined NYC. You know there is a problem when at a time you expect the credit rolls and the movie will continue on for another half hour. Characters are boring, John Cusack's accent is ridiculous, and the teeters are boring and ridiculous. A horrible movie again.
