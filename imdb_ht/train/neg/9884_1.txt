I was a fan of blood a draw from the prime minister's episode. I really can not express my disappointment in the episode of last week. This is a REAL problem that far too many African-Americans have been dealing with and continue to deal with. The lack of critical media coverage in the first 48 hours was documented by a recent study. Police including local, state, and federal are also accomplices. What was the purpose of advertising this matter and then jumping out on the finish? Without that, TV can deal with almost any EXCEPT RADIO material. This is shame. Get it together or not explore it next time.
