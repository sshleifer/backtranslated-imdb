I was enjoying a caller when he was released in 1970, but returning was a typical tip. Everything about it - budget, script, draw, casting, and acting - was inferior to the original. Gale Sondergaard as Elk Woman, an elder of the tribe but yellow, seems nothing like an American, and neither does half of the other "Indians," played by Italians, Mexicans, and Latinos with cheap wigs. And the old guy who plays the prince acts more like an old hatched hatchet than a fierce leader of warriors. It even uses the bow as a woman! Finally, Richard Harris, who did such a superb work of the original, seems to be running this time around. I guess he could not resist the easy check that he got to reproduce his role as Horse. <br /> <br /> To be fair, there are some exciting moments in the movie, as the horse undergoes a purifying purple ceremony to "find its vision" and the yellow rally but against American enemies and white opers, but All the, Return is uneven, boring, coral, and predictable - just like most.
