Really, everyone in this movie seems to want elsewhere! Not surprisingly, the casting is done by hand with the left hand, but not at all. I have not seen anything worse than Natascha McElhone imitating some sort of agent, carrying a gun. You do not use a city-brat-look city that is spoiled in such a role. The only thing I can imagine is to drop Doris Day as a whore. The rest of the cast is just as awful, perhaps with Hurt as the only exception, sometimes you can see it trying, but suffering. Oh, I mentioned that it's a completely crazy story? Jeopardizing many people live because you are divorced and want to see your family? Well, it must be because the guy (Weller) is German? <br /> <br /> 2/10, because the photography might be worse.
