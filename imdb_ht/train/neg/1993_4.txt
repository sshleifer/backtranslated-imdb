Franco Rossi's 1985 six-hour Italian mini-series of Quo Vadis is a very curious creature, creating an absolutely convincing ancient Roman world shot of matter in reality (very few long shots, no big cityscapes), but playing the drama down greatly in favor of the classic literature and stories that stories are constantly being lost in the background. The shifting structure (much of one episode played out via voice over letters) and the lack of narrative emergency to make full six-hour versions at the same time demanding and undemanding, and certainly far too often uninvolving, but it has something to go for it . The two main forces are Petronius characterization (a fortunately embraced Frederic forrest, whose own voice would almost certainly formulate his dialogue) as a man who has long been searching for a scruffy angle to survive the court life that he has become incapable of experiencing emotion , and unique take Klaus Maria Brandauer on Nero as a wannabe actor who has all moves and actions calculated on how his 'audience' will receive it. Elsewhere, Max Von Sydow briefly appeared in a few episodes, was rewarded with the most impressive and truly moving scene here she encounters a child as she tries to leave Rome. It's the kind of show show can do with the more, but it seems all too often in every moment potentially emotional, inspirational or exciting under it in the direction of many key directions. <br /> Although Francesco Quinn does a staggeringly anonymous hero, mixing in with the walls and coming out less than a Roman officer than a quiet, slightly gormless but inoffensive guy who works at the office as you never say Many of the party offices - you know, one of those you think is called Dave or something like that. The budget limits are very visible once meeting its time lion for the Christians and Ursus fights with the calf so it is definitely the key that it just passes on before the show just suddenly loses interest and suddenly ends. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
