I was fortunate enough to meet George Pal (and still have my DS: TMOB poster autograph in it) in a convention shortly after the release, and asked why he chose to make the film "camp". Prior to being able to answer, two flattened studio intercepted with my conferences on how the studio "knew best" and how "no one will take such a movie seriously". I read her repeatedly for a couple of years thanks to a friend (ComiCon attendees in the 1970s will remember Blackhawk and her band? I've been in a couple of this year with her), and she's got higher hope that we have received. <br /> <br /> The thumbs insist that there is no high adventure ever to be seriously, and thus doing 'camp' was the only way. Several other fans flew to my side, and Pal heard as best he could. At the end of the little event, Pal came to us with exquisite, who wished he could do more and better. <br /> <br /> STAR wars lie in the flashlights, and one year after the death of Pal, Spielberg and Lucas have proven that Doc Savage could easily be the next major movie franchise ... the flashlights. <br /> <br /> Tear out the memory or story of doc, and the movie would have been worth a 6/10 rating as there is nothing more than a mindset popcorn seller. <br /> But to destroy the legacy as it was no less an abomination than killing a baby in the cradle. Savage Doc may still come to the screen, and survive the inevitable comparisons by the ill-informed Indiana Jones, but it should be of all the seriousness and seriousness to claim the glory that we should expect from the first American superhero. <br /> <br /> SIDENOTES: Yes, there was a second script for ARCHENEMY in mal, and it's a lot more serious. Yes, there were simultaneous feet injections, but mostly established vaccines and very small and actors. And, yes, there is _is_ one-leaf of Ron Ely shot on a brick and explosive wall of something on his shoulder with a specially built brass pistol. The Ely puts a dust on a button down white shirt with a brass tie, and the words "DOC save: ARCHENEMY in harm ... Come next summer!" POSTSCRIPT: If someone knows that the flashlight studios have been accompanied by George Pal in 1975 in San Diego for the convention, smack the idiots up the top of the head and call them idiots that they are. At that time, dorkknobs and Fu Manchu were made of strips and cloth cloths, and brought Paramount portfolios.
