Okay I saw the preview of sneaking in this stupid movie. The first of the movie is so posh and not real, they all act. They can not sing. They are way too full of themselves. It is terrible. Yes children like 8 to 10 might enjoy but really stupid. I mean to say that the managers are a kid. And there are false labels. It's stupid. Do not see it. As for setting up and leading, not so bad. It's a nice documentary but it's a stupid documentation. <br /> Only see if you do not really like good music. Also, it's very nourishing. It's not even tastier. I hate to mean ... but that's really a piece of junk.
