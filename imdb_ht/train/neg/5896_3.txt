One missed call, another Asian horror based on the cell phone. I recently rented a Korean-based film based on a cell phone called "Bridge". One Call Call was just as boring as one. Maybe phones just are not scary or something, but this move is dull and drab. No tension or emotions for me, and the final monster was lousy cheese and uncertainty. The film is quite a bit different from different parts, and felt too long. Did not keep my attention. It looks like the tough phones scare, it's kind of like trying to make a strange pop machine sales. And it's ridiculous to compare this with the "ring", it looks like each movie movie movie compared to it and so far I have not seen any measure ups of the smallest. For horror directors - take the phone in the hook as a supported device.
