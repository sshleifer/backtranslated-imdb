This movie was not bad when compared to the first two of the original. It's headed by Martin Kitrosser on Friday 13 the fame. The act is very bad indeed, but the gore and special effects help make it interesting. It's one thing I like about screaming angry George (to make artistic effects for the movie), its effects are so off-the-wall and scarcely that they're keeping you watching a bad movie just to find out how crazy they're will get. The movie is not really all that gory, but there's a nasty embarrassing eyeball-munching scene in the middle that involves a game maggot (what !!!) Mickey Rooney makes a guest appearance that he probably was not too enthusiastic about hand Need the money at the time, maybe? If you liked the 4th tranquility tranche (my favorite of all 5), you'll probably like this one. I loved it better than the uterus! Enjoy.
