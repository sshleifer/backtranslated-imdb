Dear Friends and Family, <br /> I guess if a teen wants to become biblical with another teen, then this eternal damn - just remember the kids, "birth control" does not mean "Oral sex," I do not care what the honorable student says. On the other hand, though the help of the senator quotes himself as a "bit of a romantic guy", he has always only hit on a high school girl. If he was my sister, I would eat this knneecaps guy. <br /> <br /> Other than that I found that Mongolian does not kiss as the French have done and that baseball players are called Zoo as delicate pans. I think I would almost rather look Richie Rich once more than suffered this inconvenience slip, slap, slope. Thank you, and good night.
