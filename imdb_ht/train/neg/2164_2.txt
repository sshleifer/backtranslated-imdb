I thought perhaps a movie that had a cast including Peter O'Toole, Susannah York, Michael Craig & Harry Andrews would be worth watching. Alas, I was wrong. Utterly unmistakably outraged from beginning to end with both O'Toole and York overacting wildly. I watched it twice and still have no idea what it was about. I felt a Laird's O'Toole playing in a Scottish mansion with a drinking problem and enjoying relaxing play with her siblings (York). It is also crazy bark. But apart from that, your guess is as good as me. <br /> <br /> The movie has no features whatsoever. I can only assume the cast and the directors have been blackmail in doing this sad, inimaginative, stagy piffle. Clearly a waste of time in a talent throw and director. Risk.
