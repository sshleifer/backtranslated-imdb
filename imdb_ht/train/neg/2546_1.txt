This film is an idido attempt in some kind of thriller thriller. A travel bus on his way to Las Vegas is attacked by a group of white garbage dump drivers driving dug buggies. They drive them out of the desert and then steal everything from their value. The scheme always changes. One minute they are seeking to kidnap a wealthy Ranchers daughter, the next are looking for a collection stamp worth 90,000 dollars. The dialogue is awful. <br /> <br /> Please do not watch this movie.
