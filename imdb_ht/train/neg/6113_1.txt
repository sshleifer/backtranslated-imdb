I called myself because they saw this film was my first movie I'll experience ever in some 13 months old. I remember it was incredibly bloody and it made me angry. I watch it again on TV a few years ago. The big mistake - the act of the wood, the non-existent plot and the movie misses merit unless 23 year-old T & A is what gets you going ... 0 / ****
