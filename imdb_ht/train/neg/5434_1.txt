Wow. What a terrible adaptation of a beautiful woman. Here are just some flu. - The screenwriter eliminated two major characters in the book. - Draw was grotesquely changed. - Voiceovers sounds as if they were directly raised from written passage (which can read well, but not the same when they talk, especially with Carbon style writing). - The act is more wooden than a log cabin. (Esp. Bechstein) - This is supposed to be set in 1983 ??? Feeling more like 2003 ... <br /> <br /> To be fair I could not bring myself to end up watching this movie, so it's possible to deliver himself ... (sarcasm). I really hope that no one pays to see this, or at least anyone who reads the book hope for something decent (a Wonder Boy). I like Coal as a writer but it should be ASHAMED in this adaptation. <br /> No stars.
