Ridiculous looking little boogers who walk and reproduce themselves. So far away for the horror elements this movie has. All the rest of MUNCHIES play out like a really late comedy that's so stupid you will not find it funny again after about 15 minutes. I can imagine the kids applaud these little boogers, but the adults will leave and only those supposedly "smart" references translate on-screen things like Captain. Enter Kirk's bottle of STAR TREK, the best-known scene of ET, a blatant statement from the filmmakers will "Look! We're Homage to GREMLINS 'success here!" and a cut-out box from Clint Eastwood tells us ... what about western movies it exactly? The last thing was totally lost to me .. Oh yes, and cast the cave in the cave looks like a bad thing. Do not know where this idea was received. <br /> <br /> Do not say that MUNCHIES is the most obsessive film to sit down, for that matter. That's just really, really dumb. But if you manage to crack a smile while watching it, you'll probably feel like dumb yourself for making that after the movie ends. <br /> <br /> Good Girlfriend? Yes, but only if "mute", "delayed" & "ridiculous" is the criteria you are looking for. 3/10 and, well, uhm, 6/10.
