(There I know it was, I would not waste my time renting it in the first place. And yes, this movie is a soft porn core.) 2. The title has nothing to do and the movie. No one in this movie does anything that either deviates or obsession, let alone a combination of the. Actually, make that three major complaints: <br /> <br /> 3. That's for some reason watching the movie long enough to discover the number of points on this list. My boy sorry. Stay away from this movie. Learn from my mistakes. This movie is worthless on virtually every level.
