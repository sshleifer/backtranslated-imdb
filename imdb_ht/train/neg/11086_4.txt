As far as Spaghetti Westerns goes, I would put this man on the dull side of the genre can not die. It's not that the movie is particularly bad, but it misses the brightness and flash of some of the other SWs I've seen. Guy Madison does his best in the lead role, but the lack of charisma on the screen is needed to pull it off. With one remarkable exception, the rest of the cast is not particularly good. The direction is inspired and offers very few moments that I have not seen before. There's just not much to get very excited about. The exception to my cast mentioned is Rosalba Neri. She is one of the brightest places in this movie otherwise. Unfortunately, its screen time is limited to less than 15 minutes. (Note: IMDb page for this man can not die is wrong Rosalba Neri does not play Jenny Benson Instead, it's Melin's character I'm not sure how anyone can mistaken Rosalba Neri for some guy named John Bartha as listed IMDb credits for the movie.)
