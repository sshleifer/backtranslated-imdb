This movie is filmed in such as Conan Barabarian, but with more sex, rape and murder. There is a plot somewhere under this crackdown but the filmmakers do not do a good job showing it, which is a shame because it might be a decent story. Richard Hill provides a solid performance in the lead role, such as making the villain - who sadly did not appear in anything else of note. The fighting scene is not too bad either - I love the Deathstalker road allowing its sword to drink the blood of its victims - and there are plenty of naked and sex tempering the overall level of machismo at all. <br /> <br /> All in all, not good - but not necessarily that bad night ...
