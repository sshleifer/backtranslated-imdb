This is one very confusing movie. The movie is very difficult to follow and the scheme just did not seem to make any sense. The anger of the Wolfman made in Spain and I think when any armed film comes from one language to another, it does not translate exactly as it first meant. Perhaps this is part of the problem, but I doubt if it can be counter to all of these issues with this movie. The lining is very bad and the voices do not match the characters very well. The scene is fantastic, there is an array of weird and irrelevant characters that make little more than confuse the viewer even more. What I liked about this movie was to look at the Wolfman himself and the scenes where he attacked. Now, if they can put it all together and have it made some sense, they might have something. Do not waste your time on this one.
