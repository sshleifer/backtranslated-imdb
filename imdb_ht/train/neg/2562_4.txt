Let me start from telling this movie there are 1 comic points at the very beginning and the interchange between the narrator and George: Narrator: Huh? Wait a minute! Who are you here? George: My new George. Studio too cheap to pay Brendan Fraser. Narrator: How did you belong? George: New George just lucky, I guess. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, that's just the funny part of the movie all around. <br /> It was always fun ... but then again, I easily entertained ... <br /> <br /> I would not say this is the worst movie I've ever seen ( which titles go to the movie Desert Funny Humorous Desert ...), this movie falls # 7 under my 15 list ... <br /> If you are a little easy to entertained, you will enjoy this movie. If you are a movie-watcher who wants a good, funny movie, You will end up shooting yourself half of this one.
