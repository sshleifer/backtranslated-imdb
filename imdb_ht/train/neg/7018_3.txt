Totally forgettable. Especially because they have acted weak. This is the first movie I've seen with Dax Shepard. For my surprise, he has been around 90 years late. I thought it was a new one, since his acting was so bland. I could say the same thing about Book Tyler. Although I saw him doing well in other movies, he gave Clare Cooper a weird personality. Book is not the type of actress who will give the character a fire, emotional personality like Diane Keaton might be, but it was very strange to see him tell his line in whispering fashion. It seems that all along was simply not a very good chemistry going on between the actors, and I think Diane Keaton feels that as well. She is a fantastic actress, but looks just a bit on the top of this movie. She felt like she just wanted to get this movie as soon as possible. I would not blame it.
