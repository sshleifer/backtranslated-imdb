I went to this film awaiting it to be truly god-awful. And it was. I really felt sorry for the star-studded cast-Kathy Bates was a wonderful actress ... before she made this movie- Vince Vaughn and Paul Giamatti were disappointing as usual but Miranda Richardson could not put in one of The fabulous performances I know and love for. Fred's father, played by Trevor Peacock (in Kire in Dibley fame, among others), was on one line. The draw was predictable with all over the place, and the humor was ... missing. (However, there was a part of the movie where Santa went into the house of a Jewish family ... that makes me laugh just because the classical expressions have not seen this movie unless your alternative salt has a self- on collision with a train (actually - perhaps the train would be better ...)
