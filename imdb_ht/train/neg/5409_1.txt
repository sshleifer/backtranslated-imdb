The Christmas secret was known as a wonderful movie, but I was really disappointed. They even sold VHS and DVDs to the movie when it was over, leading me to think the producers were really proud of this project. As a screen actor myself I felt most of the performance being phoned in, although Beau Pon, as Nick, had a moment or two. If I were Richard Thomas I would not put this movie on my otherwise fine summary. It was a troublesome. I've been a fan since his Waltons day, but found myself untempted to watch any of his subsequent jobs, so the poor was offering this. In defense of the actors, led the specified, mechanical, and quite amateur. <br /> I hope this is not considered a malignant review and negative assumption made about my qualifications as a critic. I turned the movie because it was a good throw and I was prepared to enjoy the movie. However I would challenge anyone there to watch this movie and do not want their money back, even though it was on T.V.
