This is by far the worst adaptation of Jane Eyre I've seen. It is uncertain if you are not the writer of the scenario ever read the book by Bronte. George C Scott is ridiculous and bumbling as Rochester - when not only plain old act is upset. Susannah York has the most dated 1970s I've ever seen in a Victorian movie. Characters are hard to talk to each other, so the wealthy rich have enjoyed in the book which is the basis for the heart of intellectual and respectable hearts. The finish is funny. <br /> Please, rent the Dalton Timothy instead. It is so true the book, it's like having the novel read aloud for you. Dalton is superb as Rochester. G. C. Scott is ridiculous.
