This is one of the dumbest films I've ever seen. It tears in almost evergreen kind and manages to make a mess of them all. There is not one good line or character of the whole chaos. If there was a conspiracy, it was a reluctance and as far as acting, nothing good to say so badly said nothing. I honestly cant understand how this kind of nonsense gets product and actually releases, makes someone somewhere not in some stages think, 'Oh my god this really is a load of coast' and call it a day. Its crap like this has been downloaded illegally, the trailer looks like a completely different movie, at least if you have to download it, you have not wasted your time or money by wasting your time, this is painful.
