Watching this movie is like eating a feast of nothing but Mereng. It initially looks great but ultimately gives NO Satisfaction - No. <br /> <br /> The plot is a muddled mess on a toy factory and the forces of evil. So how is it possible that this draw with Robin Williams is that the movie still turns out very badly? That's because the picture is all the appearance of no such substance - much like the terrible Popeye Williams photos made at the start of his movie career. The movie should have cost a fortune, but perhaps there was not enough money left to hire writers who graduated from the classroom. The movie is one unfunny joke that goes on and over, and over and over. I'm really surprised why he did in the first place - he certainly did not make any sort of entertainment.
