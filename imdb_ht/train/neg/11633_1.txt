If I could I give ZERO stars for this one, but unfortunately I have to give one ... <br /> There is no single scene I could laugh about ... but the game did not hurt me 'ri either. So, if you are a few people late, go to your local cinema, watch this movie and give it 10 stars, as some people here are already doing. <br /> But for me ... in a movie where children were shot dead to their humor ... delicious go on the corner ... this was the third time I wasted my time to see a movie boll and it was definitely my last! <br /> 0/10 ... I'm ashamed of being from the same country as Uwe Boll! <br /> <br /> PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE DO YOUR FAVORITE PHOTOGRAPHS !!!!!
