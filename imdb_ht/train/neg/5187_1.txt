I will not approach and criticize theories of RAW. I mean, this is a site about movies and whether the movie is delivered or well-designed, and not a philosophy debate site. <br /> <br /> Having said that, this video really strokes. It's only one shot-head shot of RAW after another. Some of it is video archive, so you can see how it was over the years, and that's pretty cool. But otherwise, the look experience is relentlessly monotonous. <br /> It's a weird comparison, but I kept thinking about the afternoon on Sunday when I watched some of the Barbra Streisand star car in * Funny Lady * (another really bad movie). After a while, I was so OD'd about Barbra, I wanted to have one scene that she would not appear in: Do you know, a "meanwhile, other characters in the movie were up to something else. .. "moments. But it was all about Barbra. Well this video is the RAW * Funny Lady *. <br /> So if your mind at a good time is to look at several take with angles in the face of RAW while proclaiming on with his theory, assembled in a non-lame structure add any interest or insight, then be my guest. For me, I could not take it after 20 minutes.
