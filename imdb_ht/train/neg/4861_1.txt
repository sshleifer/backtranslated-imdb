In the glorious days of the 90s (God's rest of his soul) you could turn on the great Comedy Central at any time of the day and see the show of the greatest comedy show ever Saturday night Live. Whatt a glorious show was, whether it was the original Not-Ready-for-Primetime players or the second golden age of SNL featuring great - Chris Farley, Adam Sandler, David Spade ... then he all went in hell. I was first exposed to MadTV about a year and a half ago, and I think I must have been out of shock. How could they show a terrible damage for long? There are many horrible defections. I suppose I'll start with the writing. The word, for most parts, is terrible. It is nothing more than kindergarten bathing humor. The cast, for the most part, is talentless. There are a few designs I've enjoyed, like some of Ms. Swan and Stuart, and have a few talent on the show as the magnificent Alex Borstein. Phil LaMarr is a talented actor, just not as a comedy. Although there is a little sparse ha moment, they are not enough to deliver this endless line of terrible drivel populated by idiot babbling. This one dies.
