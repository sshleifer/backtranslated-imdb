You can consider a couple of facts in the discussion to be crowded. <br /> I'm sorry, but Spielberg did not deserve to win any Oscar for this piece, and I think the Academy was good at that vote. (Other Oscars for nominating best actors and those ... that I do not know about .. But it would be hard to justify, give what they said to do with what you see in the final product.) The Wegberg ruled that is so flawless, so meddlesome. While watching this movie a distinction occurred during a movie as the art course I took was screaming at me: "Sentiment is honest emotionally honestly sent out. Sentimentality is real and sugary, a fake lifestyle." This is over-the-top sentimentality. When in real life of two people began to loud it in synchronicity, such as Celie and Shug Avery do when sitting on the bed going on the letters from Nettie found? There are examples of types of faux behavior throughout the movie: all the men crowding around Miss Millie and then jumping in unison like a flock of birds to take in when he goes to drive away; Harp falls into the roofs of various buildings it works on (a cheap slapstick gag); The whole troop of revelers titles from Jook Joint en masse to the chapel, as if magic entranced by singing the choir ... over and over. There is nothing wrong with that. I wonder if Harpo's name has been chosen because he's in the name of his wife Sophia, "Oprah," backward. Spielberg is not the highest as "slow." <br /> It's not that Spielberg is incapable of honestly making action and emotions. Schindler's list was amazing, deeply touched for me, and I greatly admired Private Ryan also for its realism, even though the story is somewhat optimistic.
