No, it's not the horror movie ... This one is actually a love story. The ring is a silent film from 1927 that stars two boxers and the woman who comes between them. She likes the boxer known as "One Round" Jack. He loves him until the champion comes along, that is. Even though he is married to One Round, he starts throwing up flirting with the champion until the final battles fight boxing between one round and the champion. He comes back to Round One's corner, just when things look weak, and it's miraculous to find the inner strength to win the fight and win his wife's love. <br /> <br /> This movie was very early in Hitch's career, but the boundaries of the time should not make her make a movie long. Although there are special movie tricks, and some comedy relief, this movie just does not hold up any of his later works. It must have been very risky for the long period though, and the wife of cynical adultery. This may have been drawn back in 1927. While looking at all these old films, it's amazing as I think they might be redone on today's screen and really come there. Perhaps I should be the one ... <br /> <br /> Skip this movie unless you're planning on watching all Hitchcock's movie. You can fall asleep in the middle.
