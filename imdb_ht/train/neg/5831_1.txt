This film is massively boring and firefighting. There is only one good moment when a sailor binds Mr Barney (thinking of dinosaur pain less-pretense) eyebrows. The music is relentlessly-sad that Bjork, a person with many interior beauty, has brought down insanity in his art. The coast of the service made a beautiful ceremony looks stupid. The mythology and cultures are not respected in this movie are awakened. Not just from Japanese culture, but from another cinema ... (stay tuned) In a perfect "Imitate Life" artist's art-crew in the boat to find a giant piece of sh * t. What the audience was in the theater. There are some set pieces that are very composed with heart-free attitude --- then ... prepare for deflector-I'm talking to you MR BARNEY. The Emperor has no clothes! Mr. Barney you've got outted! I saw MOUNTAIN HOLY Jodorowsky. And you thin, fake veils in BS got up. You stole your idol style and your entire catalog from this man. Now that HOLY MOUNTAIN has finally left to hope that the powers belonging to the Art Tips in the World stop your funding! Poor Jodorowsky-lost in a financial battle with the Beatles lawyer when he is Lennon / McCartney's film-making. And BTW while Jodorowsky is the Beatle-OU are the brands! A cheap minced rip off just liked not easy to facilitate kitschy college. And my bTW is a cinema. If you are interested in making a reality movie-I'll legally fight you in a ring defending your Jodorowsky, defending honestly thievery.
