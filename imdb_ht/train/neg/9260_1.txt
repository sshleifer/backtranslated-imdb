The only connection to this film has to be horror is that it is horribly unentertaining. I'd rather be stinging my fingers with a rusty nail than having to sit in it again. Even for a TV movie it is flat. Throw is boring. The scenario is as interesting as a bowl of sand. How two conceived directors to create such a movie will remain one of the great mysteries of the 20th century. There is only one scene vaguely worthy of inclusion in the Ommen franchise, and it is the slot-word shot and cut short of the anticipated pay-off. If you are tempted to see it, burst into, set your alarm clock for 90 minutes and get comfortable. With any chance you will be dumping off quickly, and the alarm will wake you once the worst is over. Namely, this movie.
