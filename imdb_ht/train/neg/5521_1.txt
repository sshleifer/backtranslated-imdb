I was just out of sight this movie and decided to see what others thought of it. I'm wondering if those glowing reviewers see the same movie! This is potentially a very good story, but it fails to hit the mark. The script is very weak - the draw has so many holes that it would make a huge neutral dip for fishing scenes. Characters have not been well developed and the storyline jumps around so much that I get to ask the question "How did we get here?" at least once a dozen times during the movie. There was a lack of any chemistry between the cast members. This is probably related to the antique Lindsay Lohan during the filming. It was very clear that everyone showed and performed the tasks, but did not commit the roles. <br /> This is not a movie worth seeing ... go for a walk, play a board game, take a nice hot bath and save your money for something that's worth it!
