Previous comments made me write this. He says that the Muslim blonde and Serbian are dark (because we are mixed). This comment just says that this opinion can be made by racist.Look, race is anything.I'm color blind. I look like Pierce Brosnan but I'm not Irish. So, what? I could add that I'm not 100% Serbian, that I have some Australian blood and kow in my hand, but what the point. I'm black, half-crossed? Is that so? Anyone who uses racial prejudice with such intentions as Lantos (producer director and racist for me.Karadzhic, Izetbegovich, Milosevic, Tudjman are all monsters and I blame them for destroying my life, my family, my country, Yugoslavia everyone in Hell but not returning to my deceased family ... I'm proud to be Serbian and I'm proud of my cousin, Australian, Croats, Muslim, Hungarian, Arab (yes I'm from Serbia and I have family medicine ) .This film does not show suffering from Serbs or Croats in Sarayevo, terrible horrors of street gangs, extreme Muslim. I add: I kneel and pray for all innocent sisters and Muslim, Catholic or Orthodox brothers, died of war This film is our manipulation and misery, human frauds that do not help at all. It helps Lantos complete his pockets and more to make, Well!
