I think Jason Lee has great potential, but this was the WRONG vehicle in which to try to break out like a star. The plot is terrible, the comedy is terrible. I laughed twice, I think for relief, because in retrospect, they blamed fairly to blame. I found myself frightened for the future of Fletch, and was comforting myself that it was the movie that was flown, by Lee. Julia Stiles and Selma Blair are hot, but I recommend looking at the still pictures on this website's face, instead of this movie. Save your time. 1 star.
