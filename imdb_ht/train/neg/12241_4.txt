This is one of the few episodes (if not the only one) and an indisputable mistake in telling its stories. While touching the situation Ralphie Christopher states that he heard about the death-dead death of the fire accident. This is an important detail because in this context it is quite obvious that Christopher knows from the beginning that Tony is the one who must have killed Ralphie. There is no way Chris could hear about the crash. Who should have told him and when? By the time is torn from his delirium by calling nobody else Tony was informed. Tony knows that - which makes him even worse! Hearing Christopher talked about Death-O-Might's death could therefore only bring Tony to the conclusion that Chris himself had set fire. Given the elaborate impression writing process as told by the writers themselves on the DVD I really amazed any of them to realize the problem there. The story just does not work that way. No need to add that I'm a big fan of Sopranos. Otherwise, I certainly would not care.
