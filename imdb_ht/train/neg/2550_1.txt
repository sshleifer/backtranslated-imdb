It was the tag-line "in the American pie tradition" that deceived me in renting this movie. What I got was a junk piece in the style of Jackass, and the biggest difference compared to this Jackass film looks like a Kane citizen. This movie made me regret that I rewarded movies and other 1 out of 10, because now I can not go down there. This one does quite a few bad movies like Cinemas fairies. <br /> I actually turn it after 45 minutes, and that's something I'm very rarely done. But it was just too boring, stupid, refreshing and unnecessary. <br /> <br /> Can not believe some people actually reward this with 10 out of 10. What did your parents do? Drop you over the head when you were just a kid? Or was it the very first movie you ever saw, so you have nothing to compare it to? Are you still a virgin and are breastfed all you ever thought to cut off? Something must be wrong, at least. <br /> My advice: stay clear of this one. Even if you are in the mood for a simple movie that does not require thinking, choose something else, or you'll regret it for sure.
