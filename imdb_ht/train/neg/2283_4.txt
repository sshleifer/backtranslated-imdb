And the Oscar for the most under-rated classical horror actor goes on - Dwight Frye. Seriously its name should be declared and the same as Karloff, Lugosi, and price, and this movie proves it. Herman's character was one of the two reasons I could give to watch this movie. Dwight has given this a bit more than slightly misunderstanding a lovable yet creepy-led attitude that you hope for a larger movie role at all. <br /> <br /> Other reasons are the silly relief of M. Eburne. When you are in medical profession I must give kudos to the performance of experts in a self-pity trendy hypocondriak. Even though other "medical errors" were given a short shock especially when the doctor tested his fellow doctor 's medication ... "Well, continue to give it to her" Unfortunately these 2 outstanding performances could not keep me awake in 3 attempts to sit in this unbearably slow movie. The draw is predictable with only a few minor twists. The movie while pulling on a legitimate spooky mood was the most productive to make me yawn - yes you can use too much shadow. My recommendation - look at this once to see Frye and Eburne - but only when wide awake with many caffeine.
