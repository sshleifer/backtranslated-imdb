Fans of movie feature films have caught a lot of horrible films lately. Without hesitating, there is a list of stupid, redundant cats-horror titles about ridiculously great creatures that want to turn the food chain upside down. Crocodiles are particularly successful as we have already struggled with the 'Crocodile' evil (directed by a Tobe Hooper hero) and 'Lake Placid'. San Sur is all kind of bad like these other films? on top of that? she likes to exaggerate much. The crocodile sauce supposedly is 90 years old, more than 30 feet long (!) And it's killing for fun! During the film, he has fun by devoting a bunch of surfers-dudes and dudes that have come up with new browsing emotions in a shark-county area. Only beautiful aspect on this film is where the tropical. Even if it's a completely appropriate environment for a movie like this, the basins and nature looks wonderful. Each other is simply disastrous. There's a bit quite a bit of gore but it all looks fake and scratches. Dialogue is downright painful for listening! You will not believe some of these lines the actors must say! I know the surfers suppose a mentally underdeveloped group but I hope for their own because they're not stupid! Earlier in the movie, one of the characters refers to jaws as a 'mechanical game' but the crow here looks at least 10 times less real than Spielberg's white reindeer shark. The visual effects of 'navige' are amateur and massacres are not impressed. I will not say too much about the act since it's high in flicks like this. The girls look sexy in wet clothes and the bouncing holes bouncing while running away from the animal. You guessed right: Surf blood is a very bad movie. So his badness became pleasing again. But 'funny' for another reason different than James Hickox is intended.
