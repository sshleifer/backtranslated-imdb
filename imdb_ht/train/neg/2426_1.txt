Believe me, this is one movie that you want to avoid and this is a great fan of Washington fans. The frustrated part is that it's 1/3 of a GREAT movie. The first part of this film is an outstanding job of setting up the characters and new relationships between Kreasy and the girl she paid to protect. The trailers of this movie all mentioned that it is kidnapped. So I give nothing away when I say that the movie degenerates into a mess is almost unattainable after it was abducted. Whatever the principal was trying to accomplish, he succeeded in making the audience literally nurtured. Rapid, frantic and cut down to follow for the next half-hour as pencil slings down the perpetrators. These cuts are so unnatural and nauseating that all they do is make you out of the story. I am sure the director thinks that this unsettling way to present the story signifies a change in the character of the Kreasy and signifies that a different film was followed. Well, it was good. The movie followed was complete and unsatisfactory crap. The result is a depressing end that breaks the same quality first forty minutes into the movie.
