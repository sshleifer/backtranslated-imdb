A very filmy cheese and dull road, with the intention to be hip and modern, shown in the editing style and some strange camera angles, resulting only in sleep. <br /> <br /> The throw is wasted, the writing is stupid and firefighter. The only refreshing thing is the top-notch band Lalo Schifrin, really cool and also the opening sequence, very original and interesting. <br /> <br /> Run if you can, the bad views and comments on this movie are totally worthy; it is really pure garbage. Of course, this has its charm, in watching a movie that everyone would not drop glass beer on if he was on fire, but saved it for a long time where you have absolutely nothing else to do.
