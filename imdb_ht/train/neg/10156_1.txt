Li spell S-L-A-S-H-E-R-S. I was happy when the main character shone his saint. That was very tight. Before and after that the movie is very beautiful. The acting is like E-list and it shows well in the movie. Not to mention it is low budget that Preacherman and Charlie Chiefs are played by the same person. The whole movie seems to have been shooting with a camcorder instead of half film movie decent. The only other reason I liked the movie was because Chainsaw Charlie and Ripper doctor were funny. They said many stupid things that made me laugh. Other that if you see this movie in the blockbuster make everyone a favor of hiding behind Lawnmowerman 2. Anyone who thinks this movie is good should evaluate mental.
