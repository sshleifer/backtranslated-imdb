What was the deal with the clothes? They were all dressed as something from late 80s late in 80s. The cars were even obsolete. The school was outdated. Rackets were outdated, and the hospital looked like something from 40 years old, with its wards and wooden stairs and things. Nothing in the movie all involved took place in 1991. My mother laughed and said, "Geeeee-odd then movie was made?" When we pressed the "INFO button" on our remote, we were sure 1991 had to be tipto! Has anyone else noticed that? My favorite part, but it was when the woman said her husband, on the phone, on the cross inverted into the mirror, and she just said "Well, look, I was having a congressional meeting. I'm going to talk to you on it later. "This line was just classic. JUST love someone! My favorite mom was when they gave the "Spawn of the Child to Devil" his own Rottweiler. My mother said "Just what spawned in the devil needs ... a rottweiler" He also enjoyed all of the people falling in church, hiding their chests. His favorite thing was the guy in the school parking, driving 5 miles an hour, driving right into the truck / dump truck / front end loader truck truck. It has been about 20 seconds just to stop the car ... but it just keeps going, and a real real mute looks on his face. I mean, how fast can you go to a school parking?!?! Whatever!
