The plot was already described in other reviews, so I'll simply add that my reason for wanting to see this movie saw Gabrielle Drake in her glory without her doubt. <br /> <br /> Miss Drake was to be one of the sexiest, beautiful examples of "totty chicks" being engaged in seluloid. In his era and ilk, Jane Asher's exclusive exclamation is closed. What was it about actresses and musical brothers? (Nick Drake and Peter Asher) For those who love me admired Gabrielle, her scene in this film will not disappoint. It has a magnificent figure and none of it is left to the imagination here. <br /> <br /> As a whole, the movie is very poor and was in its time, very cheaply made. The song covering the opening credits seems to go on forever and it is appalling.
