A Vietnamese veteran decided to take on a funeral, running the city, and anyone who steps through his path to eliminate (including women). Released in the theater just before "A Few Star", which turned his career around, this action-drama mishmash starring Christ Kristofferson is wildly cut-back, thought-and-dynamic. Filmed in Simi Valley, CA, the results are really unseemly, and clinker clings and mindless violence makes most of the George Armitage director's script. Armitage seemed to be a more curious' 70s cast for his film, such as Jan-Michael Vincent, Victoria Principal, Bernadette Peters, and, in a bit, Loni Anderson; However, the center of everything is Kristofferson, who is gruffy and rude at all. It deserves points I think being a completely unsympathetic drive-in thriller, but the bad vibes (and the ridiculous climate) radiates the whole project as an ugly task. * 1/2 from ****
