The first I mean that this film deserves for more than four stars I rated it. I gave him four stars because for me this movie 86 minutes always looks like 2 and half an hour and it does not engage enough to sit throughout it. However, the "Big Alligator River" (the title of my DVD is called it) is better than your nature striking back movie nature. <br /> A tourist resort in the southeast of Southeast Asia is just opening with native staff while trying to manipulate the wildlife around. Mother Nature seeking revenge comes in the form of the god Krona, a giant Alligator. But the animal is not the only thing the tourists and the main characters (a photographer and the resort team) have to worry about, the natives are getting rubbed the wrong way too. beautiful well-done adventure / horror stories with a good music score and direction. But the alligator itself, the main attraction of the movie, is obviously fake looking. Some of the pre-ups of his jaws are good, but these should be all we need to see. Some of the underwater far-away shots make it painfully evident that what we are really dealing with is a cunning-game-cayman you can probably get to a zoo souvenir shop. But natives are credible, if not authentic. <br /> <br /> Probably not the movie that will give you that does not stop emotions, if any, but injections and products quite enough to be well-mentioned. And such a lot of animal movies, this one ends with an extremely high body count. It also has many beautiful landscape scenery. Action is below hand, but who is expected to be better, eh? Many, better than the latest US counterpart "Primeival" but nothing to compare with "Mash". But remember he can not engage at some point.
