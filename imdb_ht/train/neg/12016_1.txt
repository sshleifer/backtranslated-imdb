If Bob Ludlum saw this mini series, he'd have to call. This was complete waste on time and money. I have read the book and even though the movies are not exactly what the book can, CBS wasted time and money on this and it is embarrassing to claim that Ludlum's work was working. <br /> <br /> Let the creator should check Bourne's identity with Richard Chamberlain and see how good TV series was. <br /> <br /> Poor Mira, Blair, Anjelica and Colm, why have they signed up this low? Terrible !!
