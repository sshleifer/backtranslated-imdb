Supposedly a "social" on racial and prison conditions in the southern rural of the 1970s, "nightmares" are all bad stereotypes of South, filled with accent dissolved. Not only would it be offensive to the sensitivities of most American siders, this tawdry piece of work comes as just a thin-disguised film "babe in prison" - especially in its original version. But acting generally higher than medium and late Chuck Connors, in particular, does a great job of making viewers hate her - even though she looks a bit uncomfortable in several scenes. There's also a change-of-pace role for late Robert Reed, who looks like hound dog, and Tina Louise (already Ginger at the "Gilligan Island") has made a prison guard rather credible. My Grade: D. <br /> <br />
