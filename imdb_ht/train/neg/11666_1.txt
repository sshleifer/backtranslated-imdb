As slow as I can, I sincerely believe that this film is a waste of time. I did not get it 'warm, emotionally satisfied' the other movie did. I found it boring, and music distracted by the movie. The story was thin, the characters removed, and the pedestrian direction. <br /> <br /> Now I'm going to write some more about this movie, so I'm making the minimum 10 line. There is really no more to be said and current is important, but IMDb has its minimum, so here. <br /> <br /> Young eagle kid found talent in talent, looking for time and aging, remarkably advising in spite of the father's cartoufishi homophobia. Elderly, encouraging advisers turn out to drink a lot and teach much. conflicts occur. While I do not think this is a spoiler, I added the warning in case someone feels that this information is too much. <br /> <br /> Mostly, I just found the boring and firefighter movie. A waste of my time. I honestly do not understand that little fuss has seems to be, especially on this website, about the transandal quality of this film. I think it really worth avoiding. But, as Dennis Miller said, "Maybe I'm wrong."
