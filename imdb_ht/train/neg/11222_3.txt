Cybil Richards leads another complete Moon / Surrender Cinema in erotica. This time Jacqueline Lovell (dressed in instead looking for silver outfit) is tasked with destroying all evidence of sexual activity. However he can not resist watching the tapes and loves them. The sex scenes are well-filmed and put in a superb band (at least for this sort of movie). Throw is largely terrible and mostly very average looking too. Jacqueline Lovell is her own exceptionally attractive and between watching the sex files she managed to expose her chest and slightly down below. He also fits into a lesbian activity. To be honest, Lovell deserves so much better than this kind of fare. Here he looks great nude but actually is much more appealing to his silver attire to tell the 'drama'. Outterly films with Lovell and Soundtrack are the only real-life trailers. Mediocre even for Surrender's output and clearly a low budget for them too.
