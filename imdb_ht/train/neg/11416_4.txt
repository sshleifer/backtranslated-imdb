The fact that this film was right in the film's most successful film in the Swiss film story made me shake my head! It is true, but pity at the same time. A movie about the Swiss army might be a good thing. The story sounds interesting, at the beginning: Antonio Carrera (Michael Koch) is forced to absorb his military training by the army while he is in the church, his wedding loves Laura Moretti (Mia Aegerter). The decree in some ways does not really differ from just a few recruits getting drunk with stones in reality. Melanie Winiger plays his role as the strong Michelle Bluntschi mediocre, personally I find it rather annoying. <br /> <br /> The scenario has a comedy combined with a romance, which does not work as expected. The romance-party is too much trashy, and the comedy-party is not funny at all, it's just a cheap try and does not change the entire movie too. It's funny for pre-12-year-old kids, but not for those who search for a fun comedy. The weak humor except for some shots. <br /> <br /> Dop? Cool! Thieves? Cool! If you want a suitable comedy on the Swiss RS, make sure you did not absorb your military training again, and even then do not expect too much! <br /> I'll give him 4 out of 10 stars, because Marco Rima is quite funny during his screen time. Not a hell at a great time screen though
