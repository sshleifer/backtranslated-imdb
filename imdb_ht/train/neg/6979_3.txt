I watched this movie too, and alto it very well done, I found it a heartbreaker and would not recommend this to women with toddlers .. horror on this mother's face when she saw her child about to be running on a train is really heartbreaking. And the sad thing is - his intern is dead. Eventually it goes back to the Applacian Mountains. All the money in the world that he made out of the doll does not hide the grief he has. I remember her desperate face while pulling her money in her dress to try her baby to recover. I'm surprised that this movie takes place in Detroit, because when I watched it I thought to make sure the people had come to Cincinnati, Ohio. This was also a road for the poor from the mountains.
