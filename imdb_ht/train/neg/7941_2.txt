As the 2000 came to a close, adopted King Kong's daughter to go ahead and made a tearful announcement show her coming to an end. <br /> While Miss Winfrey was torn up, I was laughing and screaming like an Indian wood from the old west. <br /> <br /> So what does Oprah do? he takes the most famous people, and puts them on his show. what type of person is most popular? people who have suffered (just like her, except those who have lost more than girls) have suffered face to dissolve (true story), missing branches (true story, see end of paragraph), and abuse spouses (too many counts). and somehow they come on the show and tell their stories, as if we had not heard it before tonight and tons of times (Bethany Hamilton, I heard your story about losing an arm in a shark since one day, October 31, 2003. Do not tell me you have no hard feelings.) But the biggest thing about Oprah was Michael Jackson's interview in 1993, after being charged with being a molesty child. Unfortunately, Mr. Jackson has since been gone. but that one particular show told about Michael's personal life, something not many people knew about at the time. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Real Oprah's influence comes from middle-aged women and mothers football. They seem to think it is like a personal Jesus sometimes. but all I see in Oprah is some great ghetto lady who made it great, and she just shows how rich it is. <br /> I'm happy to show it will end soon. We need TV programs better.
