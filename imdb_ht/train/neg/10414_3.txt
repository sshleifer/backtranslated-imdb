This is a very funny and little movie seen on slavery in the West Indies and its Puddy stars from the show "Seinfeld"! Patrick Warburton made his first film in this film to be understood and has been noticeably thin here. Oliver Reed had top bill but was hardly in the movie at all. Warburton plays a white and humorous slave to see all the young and horny wives of rich old bucks on it because they all want to have sex with him. Eartha Kitt plays a homeowner in a brordello and they are very nude in the movie. If he does not drink the orgy of the bordello then it's the young wives they have to turn with him. Then, of course towards the end of the slave slave and there's the blood stopping. No real political message like the movie "Burn", but just another compelling tracing device to move the story together. Incredibly they made an end with Warburton and the rest of the throw back! I hope they've paid a lot of flour because this movie is very bad. The stripping to keep him look and Warburton's lack of any accent to doing it at the time of ridicule. Very bad movie but I got to admit that I want to see the end.
