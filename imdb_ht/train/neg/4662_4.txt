The writers probably had no experience in the army, and probably never glanced through a story book, but I still gave this movie film to film some credit movies to take a look at the role of black soldiers in the second world war . <br /> The action is confused and incredible - any episode of combat! There is better value production, but the cast is interesting. Seeing the New York Giant Rosie Greer was worth the buck I paid for that. The art direction is the fifth rate - the men wear the Korean War uniform, and it was very bad weather by the time the US Army arrived in Germany in 1944, not sunshine as shown here, and I did not think the spot would be Northern California. The script never made clear why black support troops were used as combat soldiers. There is a nice touch that shows some of the men carrying Springfield rifles instead of M-1s, which second percentage troop probably would be provided with. <br /> <br /> This idea idea story (racial officer captain of black troops) should be expanding into a huge production budget back then, and it's not too late to try it right now. You have to take this for what it is, and I admire this movie creator to make the effort. <br /> I remember seeing it a little while ago and thinking it was put in Italy, which would make more sense because there were black combat troops operating there in 1944.
