This film was recipient of the Award 1990 Academy for Best Animated Short Film. Over the past week, I've seen dozens of candidates and recipients received this award from the last 30 years and I really think this movie might just be the worst of them all - yet it was not just a candidate but was !! I suppose that 1989 would just be a terrible year for the genre. The movie shows a group of characters that look a bit like Super-Thin Festeres Uncle. They seem to be simple articulated figures that have been moved using suspended motion animation. All identical - with the same figures, body and clothing. The only difference is that each has a different number drawn on the backs. They all stand on a huge platform that stops, as if by magic, in space. Each has a pole and they are also a box on the platform. The platform begins to lean slightly and in response people move on to an effort to balance the platform. This goes on, and over and over for the longest time. The only relief in this tedium is when one of them acts rather nasty towards the end, but it's just not enough to make this fun to look at the youngest. In addition motion animation stopped traffic, this short offer nothing of my interest .... NO. <br /> <br /> By the way, KNICK KNACK's great KNICK has also been from 1989 and I have no idea why it was not among the candidates. It was a great deal and was far better than any of the candidates that year or year before. Maybe Pixar's success in the previous years caused a bias against them, but KNICK KNACK is so clever and so funny it looks like almost criminals have ignored it. Could Pixar have not entered it? This seems easy.
