And a few more "no" on top of that. Vodou Academy is, without a doubt, the least ambitious film of all time. What exactly does he try to do? Tell a story? It is obvious not; as they point out, most of it just barely-legal guy rub themselves. Could she, then, have an attempt at subversive homoeroticism? Well, perhaps, if not for the fact it never ever goes beyond the most innocuous and nonthening forms of male contact. (That is, to the fun at no, repeating about eighty thousand times.) Well, it is sort of a horror movie; is it trying to hurt us? Not unless the principal means to do this in extreme tedium and vacuousness to "work" it. <br /> Never in my life I enjoyed a movie less. This is the most boring and necessary thing I've ever seen. It's like Vodou Academy to take the styles of horror, zombie, and gay movies, putting them in a grinder, then running them in a coffee bar - only instead of being kind of filter coffee that filters out coffee beans of the kind that takes everything valuable, noble, or in any way interesting. The result is 74 minutes of film every bit as interesting as a glass of warm water - only without the ability to rehydrate after the 10-day Bingo gin which will inevitably reach you if you look at this abomination in human effort.
