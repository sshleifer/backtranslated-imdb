As the summary says you just make the most ignorant comment I ever heard about a RPG. You seriously thought they were gay? Are you delaying? If you've gone to save your best friend and someone decides from the goodness of his heart to help you then you are in a serious debt to the man. Lavitz was a good person and each time they helped one another make them closer to friends. They were not gay lovers like your bitching on. And let's know that the game is set in a medieval time period. Then, women were just preparing to eat while the boys struggled. Do you even know your story? Do you know how long it took for women to accept in the army on present day? This game has a lot of realism even if you are too damn slow to obviously catch it, and you really need to spit out some solid evidence instead of ignorant assumptions based on your misguided act to interpret the story.
