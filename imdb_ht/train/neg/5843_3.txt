Changing species start a Friday night in Los Angeles where Dr. Irwin (Guy Vieg) & Walter Assistant (Asen Lee Haff) will burn the midnight oil while continuing to try & perfect a new drug revolution called 'Rejenacyn'. As Walter's latest advice failed in attempting to shed the pipes to fluid the green fluorescence of the basement where Lab Rat rat started to drink it ... Five of Walter's friends, Alicia (Leah Gown in a very attentive outfit including some cool boots he gets stomp on a rat and), Gary (Richard Peterson), Burke (Derek Hofman), Frank (David Bradley) & Chelsea (Alexandra Townsend) decided that he worked too hard & needed to get out to plan his go up & the night goes off. Back in the laboratory and the Douglas cleaner (Robert Broughton) was attacked and killed by the rats now homicide in the basement as Walter injects the latest bunch of serum in a laboratory rat that breaks out of his cage as it grows into a to amazing. Walter's friend wakes up but he can not leave while the rat still misses for everyone to help her look for her. All six become potent rat foods ... <br /> <br /> Also known as Rodentz Altered species was co-edited & directed by Miles Feldman & there is very little recommend it. Scripts by producer Serge Rodnunsky are poor and coupled with the overall shoddiness of the production as a whole Altered species really are lame. For a start the character are dumb, annoying & scary. Then there's the plot usually with the mad scientist, the monster he created, isolated places, the human blocked cast & mandatory final confrontation between heroes & monsters. It's all here somewhere. Altered Species moves along in a fair march just about the best thing I can tell about it & thankfully not lasting. It's basically your average run-of-mill-killer movie film movie & not a particularly good one in that either. <br /> <br /> Director of Feldman Movie as a TV movie & the whole thing is quite weakening & forgettable while some of the special effects and scene scenes leave a lot to be desired. For a start to the CGI rats are awful, the attack sequences feature hand-held camera movement peel and really quick edits to try & hide the fact that all the rats are just passively seated there. At various points in Altered species the rat cages need to be shaken because of the rat movement but you can see clearly all the rats just sit there as a shaved cage on the screen. The giant rat monster in the end seems very poor as it's just a guy in a dodgy costume. There is no crisis, no tension or atmosphere and since when did basements have brightly illuminated lighting? There are one or two beautiful bits in Gore here, someone has a pretty big dirty hole where the figures used to be, have a target arm and decapitation, lots of stick sticks, someone with eyeball are yanked out & a dead cat mutilated. br /> <br /> Technically Altered Species is the standard of all. It takes place within the boundaries of one building, there are cheap looking CGI effects and low output values. The act is not so many but it is not too bad & a special mention of Leah Rowan as Alicia as it is a bit of a Babe & Altered Species just that little nicer & easier to watch ... <br / > <br /> Altered species is not a particularly good film, in fact it's a very bad one but I suppose you could do worse. Not great but it might be worth a look if you are not too demanding & nothing else to do.
