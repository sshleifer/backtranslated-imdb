This film is a terrible waste of time. Although it is only an hour and a half times it feels somewhere close to 4. I have never seen a movie motion so slowly and thus without a goal. This is also a movie "film" that takes place a lot of time during the day. My friend and I laughed a crazy amount at times when we were probably supposed to be scared. <br /> <br /> The only thing we want to know is why such a terrible movie was released in many countries. It can not be high in demand. <br /> <br /> The Supermodel Nicole petty should stick to patterns because although it is beautiful he has lost his accent many times in this movie, half of the time it is British and half the time it is Indian.
