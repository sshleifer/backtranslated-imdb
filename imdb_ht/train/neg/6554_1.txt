I would not give this movie a rating, it's not worth it. I watch it only because I'm a fan of Pfieffer. I love her and would look anything she did. Even in this dude, he did not disappoint. Each scene with him in it, keeps the viewer watching ... waiting ... for something to happen, but nothing has ever done. It has some good story lines but ended up suddenly as soon as it started. Some of the other characters had potential, but nothing came to him. <br /> <br /> Pfieffer was 29 when she made this movie and in her most beautiful. The wardrobe and wear was amazingly good. <br /> I can watch mostly anything and rarely come across a movie I can not find something to love about it, but this was a dude. I do not understand. <br /> <br /> The worst thing about it all, it has a huge cliff hanger to the end. It has an end scene that woke you up and said wow, this movie is finally going to be somewhere, then the credit rolls. Goodbye. <br /> I agree with the review that said .99 would have bought 3 boxes of cat food and watching my cats food would be more interesting. Well said. Actually, that comment was more fun than the movie because its amount went up well. I'm too wasted .99 cents on this dud.dud.dud.
