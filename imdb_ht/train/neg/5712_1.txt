After sitting in this pile of manure, my husband and I wonder if he was actually the product of an experience to see if a computer program could produce a movie. It was smooth and formal. But the United States propaganda cast in your face throughout the film proving - injustice - that it's the work of man. Calling me a conspiracy theorist, but quotes like, "We have stolen the Declaration of Independence to protect it" seems like ways to justify actions like the invasion of Iraq, etc. The fact that Nicholas Cage spews lines like, "I would never use the Statement Independence as a negotiating chip "with a straight face to make me and my husband ask if the whole cast took Valium before shooting each scene. The "Reasoning" behind each turn plot and new "sign" is really ridiculous and impossible to follow. And there is also a good side scheme of misogyny, and Dr. Whatever-read-no-they are chided by all involved for "never close." It is clearly in the movie just for looks, but felt the need for calm a "Dr." title on his character to give it some gravity. At one point, the Cage character says, "You never close?" and the pan to his pan looking back down to him, as it is a child. Surely grateful. The only benefit of this film was that it's so amazingly bad, you get a few laughs out of it. Things really scary is that a majority of people are watching the movie with us seemed to enjoy it. Creep ....
