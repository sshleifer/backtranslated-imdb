The act was awful and they got both in the sportsgggg ....... not only found the figure skating bad guys, but also the rules of ice hockey girder. In ice ice hockey you can not check. You also do not block anyone. Not all of them are grotesque girls gross and big. I play hockey and I'm only 4'11 and asked to go to school like the one in the movie. Also not every hockey player hates face scratches. A lot of current hockey player girls were once scratching their heads. Also we skate a lot faster then the ones in the movie. I was harassed by the film he gave the idea that we sucked ....... although I must mention that it's difficult to transition between sports because of the toe select on the face skates ..... Of these twirling moves KAtelin made on the ice you could not do in a regular hockey game. It basically triggers the person, which is illegal. It is also unrealistic that he would get a HOCKEY wallet when he skates figures. This really made me angry that scholarships would normally be used by someone who could benefit from the team.
