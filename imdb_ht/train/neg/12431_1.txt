I would like to say that curiosity got better at me. If only I've seen a trailer, I would be able to tell you the whole plot of the movie; I was able to save myself the most pointless one and forty minutes hours of my life, and about twenty dollars. This film was a disaster waiting to happen, and it's a troubles in Hollywood. The movie shows a vivid ignorance of reality. For example, controlling the kid's machine controls the race all over the neighborhood, and even enters this house. She even covered with clothes. Is it not rational to believe that a remote can not transmit a signal under these circumstances? Hollywood obviously did not believe that. Common logic and any electronic concept dictate the opposite; I doubt the race car could even get to the street, let alone a house on the street. Another unrealistic feature is the lack of criminal intelligence. Why is it in all these movies, such criminals are scientists rocking until they meet an eight year old? The kid is meant to be the smartest person in the movie instead of professional terrorists? Please be more real in the Matrix. Also, the leader puts down his real pistol and "accidentally" picks up a plastic pistol; Apparently, he could not tell the difference. Even with a glove over, one should be able to do that. Just because they look the same does not mean anything; There are other senses then eyes. Traps are unrealistic as well; If any one of them actually worked, the criminals would die. But Hollywood intends to "laugh" in the "funny" results of the traps. I did not laugh; I sigh and roll my eyes. <br /> But I recommend this movie to anyone who thinks they've seen a really bad movie; The film they saw will look like Citizens Kane compared to this one. Otherwise, skip this one for the sake of your pride. Home alone 3 also raises a question. We all know Alex D. Linz's star in the movie, but was he writing too?
