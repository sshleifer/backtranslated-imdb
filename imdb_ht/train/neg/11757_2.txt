Hey Arnold! is a slow-paced movie with a bit boring. The draw is not very creative. The Paul Sorvino character (Shenk) is buying all of the buildings decorated, low-cost in order to build a gigantic shopping mall, shopping complexes and office buildings. This draw goes back to many 1960s children's movies. It is boring. Paul Sorvino is not very interesting either, so the idea of ​​вЂ <вЂ <him as the bad guy is not very scary. Gramps recalls something about a historical document, and the rest of the film is over the past 36 hours when Arnold and Jamal must find the document with the help of the undercover Helga, whose hope has become rich in the Shenk Mall . Children must move to the city by bus, and so the exciting Chase scene involving a bus is not just funny, but underlines how this movie writes for very young children. Hey Arnold, the television series is usually very entertaining, and has humorous enough to appeal to adults. The television design is usually faster and more imaginative than this film. Hey Arnold the movie is about five times more sedated, with a great way to put anyone, including kiddies in sleep. Hey Arnold was one hard to stay awake all the way until completion of prediction and totally boring. If you want to send your children to a totally non-offensive movie, this is it. I get the feeling instead of trying to make a movie 90 minutes, the producers started out with a 30 minute TV cartoon and tried to expand it within 90 minutes. This Mall Mall definitely could be covered by the TV design. Hopefully Arnold will bet a better writer if there is ever a sequel.
