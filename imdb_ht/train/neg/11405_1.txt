I had to look at that school. To sum it up ... <br /> <br /> Talentless Talentless, talentless script, and a talentless director. <br /> <br /> This movie is like a waste of time. Do not even watch the movie. Do not bother. You will be so disappointed. My teacher said he was supposed to be good. How bad was it. He even died in it a little. The movie actor was just bad. The best actor was the old man and this did not say much. He has traumatic traits and terrible characters. So unrealistic and I can honestly say it had no point. The script was not ashamed and confused. There was point in the movie when I furrowed frows me and said, "What?" Also there were just too many loose links and scheme holes. It was just horrendous.
