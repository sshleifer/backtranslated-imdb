A very slick modern (keep it sincerely hip) to correct the story of Dracula (although staying with traditional customs) and quite an interesting, if not completely pick up stories back to masterpieces of darkness. The first time I tried to watch it I could only do it halfway before losing interest. Again it gets off at a good start (especially the scenes and the thieves and then the encounters with Dracula), but then for me she was less involved when she hit New Orleans to focus on her daughter Helsing a. A good place to put it, but never took advantage of its surroundings (despite engraving a paradise of damn, where Dracula could bloom). Produced by Wes Carven (and their names are out there), but written / directed by Patrick Lussier. Artisticly had its moments with some visual dreams, but some kinetic corrections and cheap teasers do not help. The room script found remarkably funny. Lussier does a polished work rather glassy, ​​puts a lot of blood (the make-up is suitable to achieve) and a lot of "virgin" advertising. My name does not mean girl, she's in the music company, as she finds in many vacations and Helsing's daughter's work too. Oh that was not planted obviously. The soundtrack is a fun choice of rock tunes. Now performances are all over the shop, but there are some familiar faces in place (Danny Masterson, Sean Patrick Thomas, Nathan Fillion, Shane West and Lochlyn Munro). Gerard Butler as Dracula just did not come in, as not much of a presence was formed. It was simply out-bright in the delightful ladies of the night; Jennifer Esposito, Colleen Fitzpatrick and Jeri Ryan as Dracula's bride. Love of Jonny Lee Millar and Justine Waddell are respectable okay. Christopher Plummer gives out a grim turn as Van Helsing and Omar Epps have fun with his role.
