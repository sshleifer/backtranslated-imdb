This is not the worst movie I've ever seen, but I really can not remember when I saw a worse one. I thought this would be on an aircraft crash investigation. What it really was is a soap opera, and a bad thing. They overplayed the extreme map "conflict". The first hour or so looks like a call dial, and some implassible scene thrown in. <br /> <br /> * Possible spoiler * <br /> <br /> The 40-or-so-memorial scene (and umbrella black seller and rain) to victims of libel accident victims, and I thought it would never end. <br /> Avoid this one at all costs unless you embark on 'conflict'. <br /> <br />
