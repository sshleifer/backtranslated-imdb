RKS film has always been the commercial film that fits 90 years, from GHAYAL, DAMINI <br /> Its latest movie KHAKEE has been mountable FANMI was crap <br /> <br /> This movie is a decent movie but it has can be better <br /> <br /> The problem lies in many of the old fashioned clocks thrown in and many scenes come out too filmy and long <br /> <br /> Devgan's Ajay characters show beautifully , but its character becomes heroic that might be subtle <br /> The long flashback should be avoided as thongs are simply long drawn <br /> Even playing the street in the second half look too simplistic and hardly a solution though The message is well carried out <br /> <br /> Direction by RKS is decent, though it might be Best Music is okay <br /> <br /> Ajay Devgan looks the party very well and is at ease play his part especially when at times she looked sick at ease in the light scene she excels in dramatic Vidya excellency in front of the media scene Pinnacle has a role not to define good with the third filmy she did the excellence His part Darshan Jariwala hams as the old-age old villain is okay
