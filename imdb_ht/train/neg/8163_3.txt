I agree with everything people have said about this one but I must add that the band is probably one of my worst ever heard my whole life! There is vocal vocal during times when listening to the actors listening! And the songs like a radio version in Gdansk sang, "The Darkness of the Forest! Oh the Darkness of the Dark, Dark Forest!" or something else unthreatening. The singer has a terrible vibrato and has been recorded with a twble-y microphone on some string-up and beat drum sections. It's awful !! <br /> Yes, the male leads are terrible. So they are girls. This is a bad case of sex stereotypes - it's so bad! All they say revolves around being a male or female, just play up the stereotypes of the max. Make me sick. Soooo raz !!! <br /> <br /> Children were so ecco in line, you could not understand them. And why women fantom women still put beautiful little bows in their hair, dressing beautiful blue and long hair? And ghost boy still put pants off his own and beautiful blonde hair blonde? Not afraid - STUPID. Daddy's face was way too clean and clean to be that of a man living in a cave. Nice beard and bang, not. Are you perfectly off those who have a knife yourself or do you travel through town and go to the salon? Stripid movie.
