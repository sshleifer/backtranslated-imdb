After the trail of Premiere Sleepaway Camp, which thought a franchise could be done. SC II is superior to aspects. More inspired killers and just a lot more fun. While this might not say much (compared with the first movie), Sleepaway Camp II is worth the rental. <br /> <br /> To: Entertaining, Do not Take Himself Too Seriously Like SC I. Killings Inspired. Cons: crappy acting and mullets have a lot. <br /> <br /> Under Line: 5/10 <br /> <br />
