All the hype! What is the best way to describe a movie about angry people because they can not release their films through a mainstream distributor? Consequently, they do it themselves. Otherwise, the hype of the movie does not justify the content of the movie. The story is absent and can be easily shortened. The act is poor, but the animation and music are very good. Otherwise do not waste your time - do not believe the hype! However, if you are lucky to watch the movie for free, do this. Then you will not have to waste money. Still, the filmmakers make a great job of pressing their stories and creating cliffhangers with their self-indulgent mini-series. Otherwise, they're one wonderful hit that never had a hit.
