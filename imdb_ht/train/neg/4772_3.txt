Before watching this movie, I could already say it was a complete copy of Saw (complete with the shack-like place being in with the black guy wanting someone to break his hand to get out of the cuffs). MJH's name on a movie would usually turn me away (ugh, we can say GROSS?), But I still want to give it a try. <br /> Starting out, I was a bit interested. The act is absolutely awful and I find myself laughing at almost every reaction from the characters (especially the man who played "Sulley"). MJH was even worse, but I continued to look. <br /> However, the finish was the biggest joke of them all! I seriously sit in shock thinking "what's been done? Is that a comedy?". <br /> I think this pile of crap was funnier than the "movie movie" parody and what really says something!
