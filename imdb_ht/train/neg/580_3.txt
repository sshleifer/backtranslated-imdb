Really bad movie, the story is too simple and predictable and poor to act as a complement. <br /> This vampire hunter's story is the worst that I've seen so far, Derek Bliss (Jon Bon Jovi), traveling to Mexico in search of some blood sugar!, it uses some interesting weapons nothing compared to blades), and is part of Van Helsig's vampire hunter, OK, but he works alone. She was assigned to the pursuit of a powerful vampire queen who sought some black cruise to make a ceremony that will allow her to be invulnerable to sunlight (almost an end to vampires (1998) directed by John Carpenter and starred by James Woods ), Derek begins his quest to search for the queen and some new friends: Sancho (Diego Luna, really bad acting too) an inexperienced teenager, Papa Rodrigo (Cristian De la Fuente) a Catholic priest, Zoey (Natasha Wagner) a vampire in particular with Ray Collins (Darius McCrary) another vampire expert expert. So obviously in this adventure it's not alone. <br /> You can start to feel like this movie should just look at his lead actor (Jon Bon Jovi); is a great difference in acting quality compared to James Woods, and then if you watch the movie (I do not recommend that part), you will be involved in one of the simplest, totally predictable stories, and awesome performances act, really bad special effects and incoherent events! .. I deeply recommend seeing this movie!, Rent another film, see another channel, go out with your friends, etc. <br /> /> 3/10
