I am so insulted by this movie, it's not even funny ... And I thought "Mulan" was incredible! However, I thought I had done something so stereotyped yet. There is no respect here for any true Chinese culture, just the Hollywood tradition of random martial arts. <br /> I love being tried to do Wendy in a normal teenage girl ... But fortunately, most normal girls - particularly Asian young girls - are much less obsessed with the deepest aspects of their lives . And at a cultural point, it's almost impossible. Yes, there are girls who are wrapped in popularity and fashion, but they are very rare. And even those who are always fairly decent. Another stereotype, perhaps, but a fairly true one. Because Chinese parents are working. That's how Chinese values ​​work. If they wanted to go for authenticity, they would have made Wendy a sexy girl with glasses and a love-hate relationship with her family. <br /> <br /> This just adds to my frustration and American cinema. Asian culture is not about meditation and vague, nature-oriented sentence sounds. We do not walk around enigmatically smiling all the time, and we're all not sure of some form of martial arts. We are a people, and I would appreciate it if someone would write an Asian part that does not show us some sad caricature.
