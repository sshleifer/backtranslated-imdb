Watch out for Hulu (too many ads!) So he broke the rhythm but still, it was like watching a movie really bad from the early sixties. Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis where both parties play by Jerry Lewis. If I were Indian, I would protest all the people as venom and every woman as muzaric. They cheat on their music video for western sales and use a lot of western models for the men they could handle, I usually enjoy many American films, but this was a great disappointment, especially for a modern Indian movie. The story does not take place in India (the uncle keeps referring to when Mac returns to India) but I can not find where it is supposed to happen.
