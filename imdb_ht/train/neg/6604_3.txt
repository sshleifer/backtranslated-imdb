The first was the best. The second one sucks because the dialogue was awful. Although, the scenario was not so bad (in fact, all story lines are good and bad). Throughout the movie I dosed over a few times. I know that Jackie Chan is a great martial expert but not a good actor at Rush Hour 2. Chris Tucker, too, was not good. And Zhang Ziyi, what I can say, a few lines, terrible acting (but this is based on his script). All the characters were not that good. But some of the things I love in Rush Hour 2 are always the action and less sex scenes. I know Jackie Chan does not do the right thing for her.
