I am usually ashamed by network cinema. Even the flix that attracts great name actors usually loses time by the TV people. However, this one is the worst of the worst. Simply weak and act, especially in Tracey Pollan is abominable. I was trudged in to see my school play play and was treated to better acting. Pollan acts as if he's reading in the script as he speaks. When trying to express fear, anger or grief, it is very hollow. Because of the overall quality of the production I found it hard to take it seriously. If you decide this one brave just to prepare for a great disappointment. Scary things will not scare you, sad things will not make you sad, romance will not make you feel hot and soft, and you're likely as worried as I've seen in the end. "The First Dead" says so much about this movie.
