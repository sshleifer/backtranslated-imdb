I watched the Unrated version of this movie and realized about 30 minutes in it that I never got my time back. I persevere in the end hoping that the dialogue would improve, the martial arts would look realistic eventually, the special FX would actually look special. I was so bad. I love film, I'm a full hound hound. I counted some of the eight flitzer flitzer among the world's greatest films. This however was not done in the eighties, if this movie came out of the early eighties the fax should be forgiven for so bad. It was not so he did not get that defense. The dialogue is terrible and many bad lines I have wincing in the writing rather than squirming into torture. I do not like hostels, never have, I thought it was more than rated, about hyped and I felt nothing for their protagonists, however it shone as a great post of this next-generation garbage. The back of the cover for Live Feed promised a twist you could never see coming, I'm still waiting for the promised twist.
