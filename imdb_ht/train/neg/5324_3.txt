Vovochka is every day you hooker vs. film films. Vovochka, the main character, is marked earlier as a bad influence on children in the neighborhood. With the wise words from a couple of grownups he meets along the way, he finds changing his cunning ways hard but worthy to do. Personally, I found the actor playing Vovochka too aggressively sympathized with, however, tone changes in the movie would allow most emotional wrestling to Vovochka to have when he wants good things but bad things still happen. This struggle makes the movie a little different than other movies in the same genre, this the little taste I mean. All in all, I did not really care for this movie, although it was more likely to aim for a smaller audience.
