For some reason, the late 70's and the early 80's CBS's affiliate station in New York have kept playing this movie in its late late night on Friday or Saturday nights for many years, usually at 2 am. or some time. It's a tight movie for this place since it's really hard to follow and oddly (see other reviews for specific story stories). Anyway, after catching it many times in those days just before cable TV (and even after it hits, but before offering so many night programs), I keep catching this little oddity. After missing it for many years I decided to see if I could get it on DVD. Well, it is only available (from each research I've done anyway) to a very stylish print on the budget label "Brentwood Video" as part of a 4-pack of movies (4 movies about 2 duplicate sided disc) called "Foreign Alien" if anyone is interested. It is usually available for about $ 10-but even less if you buy around. Other 3 movies on this set are readily available in many other collections of public domain movies, so do not need to comment on them here. But I have not seen "eyes" available elsewhere. Though hardly a version of "restore" in any way, this print runs exactly 92 minutes, so for once IMDB states running time in 90 minutes is incorrect. Even with the minute 92 minutes running it is not strange for an armed film in English from another language also some of the time running trampled. It seems to be a common budget-conscious practice sometimes saving money by not bothering to dub some scenes at all if they are not considered to be important in the story. Is a version yet done in any less confusing? Who really knows-unless you've seen it in his native language ... By the way, my attempts to watch this during the day does not work and I just finished turning it off. There's something about watching this in the night that just fits this movie .. well maybe it just comes out of my earliest experience, who knows ??
