It's not long to see why Name Code: Diamond Head did not make it on the network schedules. The TV pilot film does not get past credit before it's obvious just how bad it will be to be. Perhaps I miss something, because the plot did not make a lot of sense. Based on what I got out of the mess muddled, a terrorist or stealing or something named "Tree" (Ian McShane) went to Hawaii to steal something to do with a secret weapon. The world's most secret agent, Johnny Paul (Roy Thinnes), is out to stop him. Could have been more, but my confidence ?? It really does not matter anyway. <br /> <br /> Action movies should have action. Stop the moment there should be suspense. And dramatic moments should be drama. No of that's the No Code: Diamond Head. I saw others using the word "turgid" to describe this made for TV snoozer ?? and it's better than any description of the words I can come with. None of the characters are at least bit interesting or worth caring about. And Roy Thinnes makes for the worst driving imaginable. Charisma it is just a little north of a slug. Ian McShane is the easiest thing the best movie is going to be, but unfortunately for everyone else involved, it does not appear to have turned out to be a regular cast member. Now if McShane was cast in the lead series, well then you might have had something. <br /> I quickly discovered that these awful Gawd 70s made-to-TV do great Mystery Science Theater 3000 episodes. And that goes double if Quinn Martin was involved. Very funny stuff from Mike and the Bots. So while I can only give the movie a 3/10, I rate Episode # 608 a 4/5 on my MST3K rating scale.
