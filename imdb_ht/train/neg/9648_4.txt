Vipul Shah has done some really impressive works as a movie star in the past. 'Waqt - The Race Against Time' and 'Namaste London' were fun and interesting to watch. 'Singh Can Kinng' was fun, which he produced. His recent trip as a 'London Dream' cinema comes as his worst career career. <br /> <br /> 'London Dreams' has a mediocre storyline, it's about how successful become friendship hated. Granted, it has the potential but when you look 'London Dreams' you wonder what's going on? This movie may have the highest score in recent times. The Vipul Shah writer put Vipul Shah director down. <br /> <br /> The first time is boring, the second hour is best; but again The climax is horrendous. How can someone forgive someone who decides to destroy you? I will not. Ajgn Devgn suddenly decided to go to India and ask forgiveness of his friend coupler, thanks to his uncle Om Puri. When it came to India, rather than slapping or abusing him, Salman welcomed him with Baja band and said he was the reason behind the whole fiasco? Was Vipul Shah's intention to show Salman's character as a God? If so, than you've failed completely. The only question I want to ask Vipul Shah is that, would you welcome someone who destroys you with a great reception? Write your feelings, not our crazy {audience}, we're sensitive enough to understand what's right or not. <br /> <br /> This is a music but the music by Shankar-Eshaan-Loy is terrible. It is not a single song left by yourself. <br /> <br /> Salmon is superb though. She brings the film on her shoulders and really, really well into emotional scenes. But again his character shows as a God, which makes him look like a delay to the end. Ajay is equally good, but Salman covered it completely. Asin is wasted, and what is a great talent like Om Puri doing in this movie? Ransvijay came, though Aditya Roy Kapoor excelled. Brinda Parekh is known as the vampire. <br /> <br /> Throughout the dream, this is a dream!
