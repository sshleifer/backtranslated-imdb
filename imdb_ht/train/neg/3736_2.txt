This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Robin Williams fit into the party as a rhinoceros would fit into a tutu, even for his performance was always debilitating. Kurt Russell was more credible but still awful. The plot left much to be desired and the rest of the act was also terrible. The only thing this movie was going to be the trailer, which my rampage wasted 90 minutes in my life could be better than trying to lick the back of my head. <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor and burn this movie if you have it. If not, just be happy you do not.
