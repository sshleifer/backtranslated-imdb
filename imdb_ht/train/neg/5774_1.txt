This film is a modest effort by Spike Lee. It is able to be much more than this film.Get in the bus while apparenly anti racism, does nothing but berate white and degrades the black situation. The plot of this film is about a group of black people who travel to Louis Farrakhan's million bus buses. The bus has all kinds of people you might imagine: gay, Muslim, gangbang and Tom of Uncle (It is thrown on the bus though). There was only one white person on the bus. He was accused of being a racist minute he got to the bus to drive. Although he was a Jew and the fact that he explained his situation had ended up being a racist and leaving the bus. I hate to say it but films like this need to achieve their own hipocracy and reinforce the sterotypes. This should not be seen as a triumph, but a sad discipline. You may think I'm a racist for writing this, but I mean well. Best chance next time Spike.
