Well, the story makes no sense, the characters lack any dimension, the best dialogue is ad-libs on the low quality of films, the symmetry is involvement, and only correction saves a bit of muddle but Sam "Peckinpah directed the film .. Somehow, his direction is not enough. For those who appreciate Peckinpah with his great work, this movie is a disappointment. Even a great cast can not save time from the viewer's waste and effort This is the least reasonable response to the movie by contemplating San Peckinpah, James Caan, Robert Duvall, Burt Young, Bo Hopkins, Arthur Hill, and even Gig Young.
