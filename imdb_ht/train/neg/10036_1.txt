At that moment I do not understand what the directors think about when they make a movie ... I was having a look after Welke (2007) and I think they could do it again. But after loads of amazing promotions, Tashan finally ended as heart attack. <br /> <br /> These amazing 3 songs in promo - Dil Haara, Chhaliya and Tashan Mein ..... and what u get to the movie? Zero history, predictable drawings, many Akshay Kumar demonstrations and nothing interesting apart from watching Kareena after losing its weight ... !!! <br /> <br /> Music-wise another great disaster ... in the music album, have spent time on giving little pathologic dialogue to these joker 4 and not thinking of giving the background song scenes when Akshay Kumar performs demonstrations ...! The song is as beautiful, quite comparable to Tashan Mein and is not taken in the music album !!! :-( If you plan to watch this movie, I might say, look at it for listening to this song that has something like ... 'Bachchan Bachchan Pandey ...' <br /> Both of the many desi even the way Bhaiyyaji tried to talk bad English! <br /> <br /> Go away from people, i need to kiss!
