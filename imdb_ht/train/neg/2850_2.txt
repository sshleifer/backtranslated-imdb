If I realized John Wayne was in this movie, I would not look it. It's abusing in the Japanese, unfortunate for Hollywood and embarrassing to anyone who thinks. But then, most John Wayne movies are like that. Hollywood's fifty soldiers still believe that everyone in the world loved the American when the truth (and still is) somewhat different. The film deals with isolationism in the nineteenth century in Japan. Perhaps it's Hollywood that should be isolated. To put it as succinctly as possible, this movie is expansive jingoistic clapping. (Sort of a Madama Butterfly with bad music.)
