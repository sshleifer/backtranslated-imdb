I just liked watching it though and having fun with the total mechanical scandal of a movie. I've seen this film of helpful sarcasm in Mystery Science Theater 3000 and I have the DVD. If you flip to the other side of the DVD, they show the current movie, so I gave it a chance. Reliable, as is roasted cheese. <br /> <br /> Acting, special effects, and overall scheme is very cheesy and unrealistic. "Does he not need lungs" said Crow noticing how the head can still speak while not having a body, and Tom Servo just remarkable remarks "No, he's got juice!" The finish is just classic and no one can touch this band with K-Porn! I liked the "cat battle" between the debris. That "Meow" after the battle or scene, whichever was classical. So, in some ways this was a fun movie. I think for horror fans, you'll probably enjoy it. For a good time, look at the version of MSTK3, you will find a great laugh. <br /> <br /> MST3K version: 10/10 of the brain that would die: 1/10
