Mary Lou is a smart pig seeking revenge on who left him coming in his fire back home back in 1957. <br /> <br /> Well, the movie mostly takes place in 1986. The film falls into The 80 trap of weird / / stupid special effects, including some unusual demon-looking rocking horses. <br /> <br /> Anyway, Mary Lou's spirit does bad things in people trying to take on one person's body. If you do not succeed, you'll have to look out. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the movie is largely boring and based on a bunch of worthless characters. This is also not an end, the only thing common and the first is the name of high school. She had the avg. film horror falls down, gore, free nudity, knocks against the Catholic Church. First, boring film. <br /> The act is decent enough to give it a 3 out of 10. You can waste your time doing something else.
