As a national history of WWII, and someone who is not proud of the country's history in race relationships, I was looking forward to seeing this movie. What a disappointing piece of Schlock. I did it on 3/4 of the way, but I should have been turning it into the sub attack scene. The idea that a U-boat would fire a torpedo of a DDE, as if there was a hope to hit it, and then be able to "run" in the DDE while submerged, is preposterous. And this is just a small detail. The movie was all wrong written, poorly directed, and wrongly acting. I agree with others on this chart that this could be a good movie. It's as if they've decided that, since all these crazy movie propaganda WWIIs have made and all-white projects, they need to make one with black people. And as bad as these old movies were, this is actually worse. And it's almost smacks of fraudulent advertisements in titles Ossie Davis and Stephen Rea. It seems that they have many minor roles. I must believe these two fine actors have been embarrassed to be associated with this movie. I finished. I gave too much of my life to this movie.
