I finally had a look at this short Lynch experience after waiting for long ... and unfortunately, it was not worth it! Even for a fat Lynch fan, I find this to be really tedious .... <br /> <br /> nothing happens, long, long, long painful breakthrough where nothing happens , long, monotonous speech where nothing is said and everything is finished with the viewer does not know, or caring, what the hell it was all about, what happened before and what happened afterwards . <br /> <br /> There was a Mulholland Mulhouse Drive - the blonde girl and the brunette girl were very Diane and Rita -esque, and a moment Highway Lost and Alusions at some important events that happened to their hands Can not talk about clearly. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, it's all very refreshing and very dull, nothing happens, it's pretty forgettable and I think I'll delete it from my computer and forget about it ever looking at it. Padon David!
