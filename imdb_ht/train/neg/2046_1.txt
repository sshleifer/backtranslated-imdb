I can not believe that this movie has made it into video, and that video rental stores are willing to put it on the shelves. I literally ask for a refund. Take away the fact that the movie has no historical truth, and still the movie gets worse in a video store. It's not even good enough to be called a B rated film. Do not waste your money or your time on this movie. Just listening to the voice and the terrible music made me sick. Anyone involved in this film should be pulled out of the union, giving the industry a black mark, but after watching most of this movie I really do not think anyone involved is a union member.
