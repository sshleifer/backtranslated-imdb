I can not believe how horrible this movie turned out. I feel magnanimous even referring to it as a "movie". The act was flat, the correction was terrible and the plot left many unanswered issues. The quotation was OK, if unoriginal: A small group of foreigners live in the U.S. and trying to slowly take on humanity. But it goes swiftly down from there. How could they convince a "human" to accept an alien as his wife in order to make their foreign-human hybrid demands? They show a great foreigner but never show what he does. They have a plastic surgeon that can produce perfect skin on an industrial scale. They are thrown into the compulsive alien monster with the teeth. The finish was almost too painful to look. I suppose I'm especially disappointed that Bruce Boxlietner would have nothing to do with that. How can he say big monster aliens and teeth, "Get away from your son a b * TCH" with a right figure? It is a long fall from Babylon 5 days. Avoid this at all costs.
