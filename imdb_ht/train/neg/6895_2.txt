The plot is stone. The act is somewhere in the south of Jr. High School Play. Cinematography is not bad but it looks like it's cut with a machete. I could not decide this was an intentionally flickering hokey movie or if people behind it actually thought they had made a good movie. Thinking Death Valley Days Meet Mayberry RFD. Those who run around in a modern 'modern city' set rapidly-drawn 6 gun units. It has more than its fair share of 'cutsey' stuff. Photos of the good guys pulled up to an old farm house, with Ford Mustang's parking right in front of a heavy train. The clerk's photo at a hotel is watching an obviously western (sporting) film sporting a Japanese soundtrack, but with English sub-titles. It's all really weird but could improve if it's watching it while participating in a little peyote. It is a real curiosity and modern parallel to every western cliche you can think of. There's even a modern version of the girl's dancing girl-girl, and a Jewish-stuffed joints in the band. Really! If someone brings this to your home for a movie session on Saturday, say 'em your DVD player has died.
