Well ... I was going to wait until this was out on the videos to see it, and I wish I was, I actually kept paired 2 movie on the other day's cable, and it made me crave for more of the same things What I had to Airplane on CRACK ... I mean if you like Aircraft or any other Leslie nielsen car, then you'll probably be in the sky but if you are usually used to the COMEDY WAY, Then you will disapointed, there were many more Eyebrows eyes in this one that will keep young hormones young happy teen, which is probably why it was a box office hit the first week of it out. I enjoyed scary film 2 times more then this fodder, with one part 5 times as much. The best odd of 3 is part 2, but then again I still love Halloween 2 best then the original as well .. may just read to me. The funniest part of the movie has to be the alien way to say Goodbye. But that's not worth the $ 11 I spent to catch a matinee with my fianc√©. Save yourself cash and keep part 2 again on cable until this is released on video tape, and then rent it, do not buy it.
