This movie is not good.the first one almost aspired, but there was really unfinished to make it worth watching.This one has nothing.there to zero scary, zero tension or suspense.this is not really a horror movie .The most of the killers do not show anything.there is no gore to talk about.This could almost be a television, except for a bit of stripping and a bit of violence. The act is not very good, so. and do not get me started on the dialogue.as for the surprise to finish, surprise, no one.I would believe it could get worse, although I do not see how. But again, it is less than 80 minutes since Long, so I guess that's a good thing. Despite it's been feeling a lot longer. Apparently this is the cut version of the movie.I found it for a very cheap price, but it still is not worth it. You want the unut more graphic version, check out the anchor edition.anyway version, this version in Sleepaway Camp II: Career is pleased to have a great 1/10 fat in my hand. psif you watch this movie, you will probably be a bored and happy campaign. And you're a real fan, you might want to pick up Sleepaway Anchor Bay's camp (and survive kit) three disc collection that has three first movies and special features
