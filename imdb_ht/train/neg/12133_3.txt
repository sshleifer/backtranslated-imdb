The movie looks like it's trying to be a combination of the acting workshop, the movie "indie" and the theater. <br /> It's kind of stuff that loves actors - it's kind of like a workshop or play because it mostly consists of focusing on the actors acting ... acting angry, agitated, scared, speaking, swift, planning - to give performers They are a lot of free rows in really overpowering it all up. <br /> A trio of crooks, one leader, one goon, one brother, comes up with a great heist scheme. .. and a monkey key is thrown at work. For the sake of these things, there is a bit of a "fender-bender" and one of the crooks in the backwaters of the back of the car. <br /> <br /> The cops on their tail and stumble into a bar called poetic (and plain) "Dino's Last Chance." Spacey, as a director, is trying to keep focus on performing actors and deliveries in dial-ups. He pan on a lush red-passionate cigarette worship service in a smoking and smoldering Bogart. And he maintains all the screen violence, really. <br /> I think it was a mistake. Focusing on the intensity and violent violent scene would give film to some corners. The problem with the movie is that it moves too slowly and suffers from miscasting in almost every role. Matt Dillon ("Cowboy Drugs" and "Sweets") seems too young and too idealistic to be the leader of this gang. <br /> <br /> Gary Sinese seems to brooding and deep in thinking to be a spineless tag- along with these guys and Joe Mantaga is effective as the traditional malicious-swearing lieutenant of the mad-dog police All thumbs, but it does not give anything really to do here. William Fitere is the sole actor who is credible in his role as a brainless grandeur who just wants to spread blood. <br /> <br /> And the crooks in a tense situation where they either go to prison or they try to think of some way out of this. Spacey misses the ability to create a lot of tension and keep it going. Characters are mostly discussed far, trying to think of a plan ... and they're calm and too articuler. There are even a scene where crooks are playing pools and a whole swarm of army cops right outside, ready strike. At one point, one of the crooks called the police right out of the bar. Oh brother. Oh bother. <br /> These cops go to either blow them away or go to close them. Should not the squat-up robots be a little scary, a little uncomfortable? Meanwhile, all the real action is happening inside. Someone pulls out a gun, a baseball bat, which leads to an ugly confrontation on screen and there is one more crash that happens to this ... Well, kind of sad. But ... <br /> <br /> Faye Dunaway also should have spent more time with a dialect trainer, improving her New Orleans accent. Skeet Ullrich is fine in a smaller part. A costal cop reaches for a pack of matches in the worst time is a nice look. So it's a scene where someone goes straight to the rear speed. <br /> <br /> The dialogue is obviously trying to go for a David Mamet approach and it's as layman, but never as realistic or as perspicaces. The film feels as too much of what it really is ... a really low-budget film with an actor behind the camera for the first time leading other actors from a script that's "not bad, but needing a few more re-writing. " Spacey shows it not a terrible director, but he misses a sort of feeling for "wearing a movie" and feels like he's just actor acting actor. <br /> <br /> These actors are all talented and can work with the material, but they all feel out of place. As I said before, the movie really suffers from miscasting. <br /> I do not mean that the actors are wrong being cast. I think they found just the right cast, but put them in all the wrong roles. I think that switching some of the roles would have helped extremely. <br /> There are veteran mob actors Joe Mantagna playing leader in the pack, Gary Sinese as the lethal police officer outdoors on the bull's order and barking of his troops, holding the ferocity of his "goon killer" and Matt Dillion as lamb in sacrifice. That would be a great improvement. <br /> When some direct actors work, They may even have Oscars for it. But a lot of the time, when direct actors, have a tendency to just focus on their performance. Just shoot the actors to act. <br /> <br /> Sometimes it works ... but they need a good showcase for it. An excuse for it. <br /> <br /> hostage situation is pretty much the same in real life just like coming-of-age stories so it's natural only that movies will go from point A to point B as well. <br /> There are some really great entries in this genre. Spacey himself appears in a similar film on the hostage situation: "The Negotiator." This certainly will not become a cult classic, let alone one of the AFI 100. Still, it has a few nice moments with personal touch, but in the end he immediately forgettable and the kind of movie that would play best on regular television. It's just not worth going out of the way you see. <br /> <br /> I give a 3 out of 10. <br /> <br /> Other spacey spacecraft spacecraft, "Beyond the Sea" has reported a better effort. Hmmm ... maybe it's true. You need to fail before you succeed. <br /> by Dane Youssef
