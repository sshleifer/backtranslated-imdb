I agree with most if not all Tom of the previous commentator (bighouseaz@yahoo.com). The Zatoichi series is a great character study combined with great sword fighting and excitement. <br /> I saw Zatoichi 1-13,15,16; I believe 14 has not been released on Zone 1 (USA). Zatoichi Outlaw was disappointing. The story line was complicated, and seemed to be a hodgepodge in many lines before Zatoichi line. At one point, I asked if I had not seen a remake of a movie before Zatoichi. This film was disappointing because it began to depend on effect (a rolling head, cut branches, blood) and less on the nobility of the character Zatoichi. All the previous films were based on the storyline and action, and had a great following without having to go into effect. <br /> I just hope that the remaining Zatoichi films do not follow the same trend. This is the first film of Zatoichi from his studio. I highly recommend all of the Zatoichi films before - and recommend them.
