Not a 'female film' but movie for the gang. One of the worst films ever made by a male director on women. Director Andy McKay simply does not know women. Pics of bad taste, American style of humor style, great stories, no sense, illegitimate story, characters refuse. Vulgar imagination came to life on screen. Insult and definitely not funny. I wonder how three actors are good to accept taking part in it.
