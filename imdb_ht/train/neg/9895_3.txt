If this book lasts in the book then we can only assume that the author was ignorant of history. Mark Anthony never die of wounds to get into battle as depicted. She died a cowardly death by suicide and even then asked her slave to do it for her. The slave was chosen to kill himself instead. In Mark Anthony's real story was disappointed by the great slave and he decided to copy it. But even in Mark Anthony's death was a drunken failure and failed in his own suicide attempt. She called for Cleopatra and took her, bleeding. He kicks his garbage up on ropes and Mark Anthony dies shortly thereafter. If you want stories by watching this movie. If you want to boycott drivel then you'll probably enjoy it!
