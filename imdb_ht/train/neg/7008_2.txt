Annie Potts is only emphasizing this movie really dull. Mark Hamill plays a teenager who really was upset that someone had stolen the Corvette himself and his classmates turned into a hotrod (probably the ugliest looking machine to be featured in a movie), and the officials went to Las Vegas and Annie trampled under the evil genius who stole it with pride and joy. <br /> I would snatch my eyes after watching this if it was not for fun watching Annie Potts in a very early role, and it's too bad for Hamill that she did not take a few lessons to act from it. Danny Bonaduce also makes a jump.
