Against all hopes is a very harmful, sometimes painfully filmed movie. This is Michael Madsen's first film, and it shows, it is not that good at it. Some people might find the story ridiculous; an alcohol realizes his life and families falling apart so he calls a preacher as a last resort for help. After saying the story to him, he accepts Jesus Christ in his heart. I actually get lots of religious scenes, such as Cecil Moe (Madsen) going to a church but walking away from it, very realistic. I also like how Cecil knows his life is breaking apart and trying to get help, but to realize only God can help him. At the end he realized with the help of God he can go to life without drinking anymore. <br /> <br /> This movie is not quite done at all. The act is bad, the script could use some work, and looks worse than my home video, but it has a good message. Now just because you become a Christian does not mean you will automatically be able to stop an addiction or heal your broken family, and Cecil realize this and work hard to stay on track. In general, if a Christian appreciates how this movie shows Christianity and if not, you can find yourself being called to find out more about the faith.
