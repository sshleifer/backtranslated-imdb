Haunting is yet another bad horror reminder and effects subdued special effects and a great throw in on screen favorites and there is no kind of loyalty any except for the cinematography. The rumors are not all bad but renewal directed by Jion Da Bont definitely they are. I think the actors A-list (Liam Neeson, Catherine Zeta Jones, Owen Wilson) has to distract us from the boring scheme, ridiculous special effects, and horrible attempts at her horrible audience however this is a movie by a Our magazine does not take care of it we care about the characters and stories of this movie. The movie is like taking the classic Ante's House in Hill House and chips out four chapters and then use whatever leaves for the film it is so boring and a lot of it is unexplained.The characters are very thin and while the act is good you do not really care about any of the characters at all.Lily Taylor gives a horrendous performance and sounds like it's 8 years old when delivering his line does not mention what a terrible screamer it is.Lily Taylor is not made for the horror genre of all.Games are stupid with the cheese , they look like a bunch of Casper's Ghost of Friendship and ghosts of Hugh Cain looks like a fat guy dressed up like the grim avid for Halloween and a smoke car.There is this animal on the roof of one of the rooms which is a giant red lips and it's not even funny unintentionally just plain sad.The work is beautiful and well-designed is probably the only positive thing about this film it looks nice, but that does not save it from all its brutal things. I can honestly say I felt like I was wasting my time watching the haunt on TV for no cost so i would've been even more puppies if i was paid to see it, but luckily it was about worn by Channel.Anall haunt is a boring rumor that tries to cover you with special effects, a poor attempts at horrors.
