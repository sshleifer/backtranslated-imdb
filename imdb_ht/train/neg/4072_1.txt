I watch bad movies. <br /> <br /> This movie is not good enough to be a bad movie. Not a humorous ounce, not a talented ounce of all ... <br /> <br /> I am LAZY. <br /> <br /> Generally, I see a movie bad and curse. This was so bad, I actually made a review to try and save others from the completely boring mess I fell victim to. <br /> I'm breaking my copy in this movie. <br /> <br /> It's too up to you to use a room clear. So boring. See 'Bloodsucking Freaks' or 'Shock, Shock, Shock' for absolute crap that has some merit as fun. This deposit seems terrible, is terrible, and those who do it should feel terrible.
