On the burner back for years (so it was reported) reunioning this TV in two of the most favorite characters in sitcom history started on seriously - and went straight down from there. Mary Richards (Mary Tyler Moore) and her best friend Rhoda Morgenstern (Valerie Harper) meet in New York after a long stretch and catch up on each other's life. What is a novel concept! But sad are related, nothing is worth talking about (let alone make a movie about) came either from them in the years to intervene. So, instead, this script itself and send out one sad old tracing device after another (most have to do with older women in the workplace), while completely missing the original charm and The complicated thing that made the original show a winner. Throwing in support is immediately forgettable, the humor is nonexistent, and the chemistry that Moore and Harper once joined together. Moore allegedly kept this project for years, waiting for the "just script right" before committing himself. If this was the one he considered "right", what about the same earths that he turned down like? It's not the age of the characters that make this (for inevitably marching over), but the almost complete lack of imagination coupled with a flagrant respect for the elements that has done the set work. At one time this was intended as a pilot but, obviously, it failed to generate any interest among potential sponsors. Or for this problem, among possible hearings. Quickly and misery teaches forget, the movie is a travesti and a reproach to a classic.
