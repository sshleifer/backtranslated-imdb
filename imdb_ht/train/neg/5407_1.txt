If you want to watch a real 'quality' movie get caught in the Eden Field Formula. This beautiful movie has cost every $ 50 to do. It features a thin wafer script, bad malfunction, lighting and camera work, with a suspended movement, paper-waving monster that is absolutely ridiculous (it seems they sometimes use a guy in a rubber suit and / or a puppet glove for the monster - but all was equally obnoxious). <br /> <br /> The actors all talk the lines as if they have never seen them before and read in a teleprompter. Special effects are way beyond embarrassment. And the only sad thing is that they dropped the titled really diligent 'Tyranasaurus debris' that sums up exactly what you get for the full 90 minutes. <br /> <br /> This is what happens when you scratch the bottom of the barrel that's hard or break in the crud which lies below. I loved every minute of it.
