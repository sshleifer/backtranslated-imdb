This scared the hell out of me when I was a teenager. Now I find it more fun than scary, but with some very disturbing moments and with a kind of sleazy quality in it that I love. And, thinking about it, the plot is rather disgusting actually ... but is busy with some kind of flavor. If there is a problem with this movie, it is that there are great gaps where nothing is interesting or interesting is happening. Also, the end goes on forever, making a bigger potential tension seem strange after a while with Barbara Bach screaming and screaming. "The Monster", after it's exposed, is not very scary either unfortunately. Looking at a bit drab in the movie also works against her, making it appear as a TV movie more than something made for theater. But it is an example of films that rarely made nowadays for I urge horror fans to watch it, and feel a little nostalgic.
