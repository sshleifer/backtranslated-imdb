The coverage on the DVD and disc is awesome fresco, you would think that a movie on sweet tooth in twisted black metal is still a really great idea, but the movie actor is the worst then Ben's performance In Pearl Harbor, pornography has the best quality and best actors. I was going to buy the DVD, but my luck was first read, the sketch and the script were also awful, nothing seems to go in together so the movie really never makes sense. Poor tries to frighten you using the worst flashback scenes then they are used to show the 80's sitcom and in the end it will let you want to bang yourself against the wall of your home.
