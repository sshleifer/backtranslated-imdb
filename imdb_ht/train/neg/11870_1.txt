This is the most depressing movie I've ever seen. I saw him as a kid and even thinking about it now really upsets me. I know he's been put in a time when life was hard and I know those people were poor and their crops were vital. Yes, I find it all. What I find difficult to take is that I can not remember one light moments in the entire movie. Perhaps it was true in life, I do not know. I'm pretty sure the act was the top of the direction and the quality of the cinema etc. etc. was nice and I know that each film can not have a happy end but as a family movie it is terrifying in my opinion. <br /> I would not recommend it to anyone who wants to be entertained by a movie. I can not stress enough how this movie affected me as a child. I talked about it lately and all the sad memories came back flood. I think he would have all but the mess got to the Prozac.
