It looks like the brilliant team of Shonda Rhimes outsourced to write in this one a seafront location, perhaps the MediocreLand? "PP" reminds me of one of the very tedious, promising at first, but predictable of the David Kelly Flicks season (Picket Fence, Ally McBeal, and now Boston Legal). The insane cases they find are so strange, they barely suspect sympathy or sadness. And this is actually doing good drama dramatic media - your dramatic situation is frightening of, "This would be my" feeling. They are not funny either. The actors are quite good, but the plot lines are dead and can not bring back to life. I'm a therapist, and let me tell you - Amy Brennan plays most incredible incompetent, immoral, trained therapists. Anyone who writes things has flunked the ethics and transfers / counter-transference courses in Stanford. Someone should give them a Code of Ethics (the episode and the nose-bleeding wife and the therapist's participation in it). No therapists are bad. <br /> <br /> Female dance for men who moved on - made to death, we all graduated "Sex and the City". Addison in her juvenile aggression towards the guy she likes - very broad-appropriate, seems unnatural over a woman over 40, and this talented actress does not believe she herself and does not save her well. Often successful / palatable developments, Addison is struggling with her decision to attend LA, and the "Voodoo Dr" and to deal with widows. <br /> <br /> This concept could work with a new writing team.
