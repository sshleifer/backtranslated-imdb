Read the 80s early. There is a group of young adolescents suspicious old. And there is a wider maniac around. Yes, this is slasherville. This film is called Pranks. Why is it called Pranks? I do not have the idea of ​​faintest. Unless your idea of ​​вЂ <вЂ <a big tour is repeatedly striking a person's dinner with a baseball bat - on balance, not a big tower; in fact quite a garbage dump if truths have been said. But there you go. The film itself concerns an adolescent group that is tasked with cleaning out a dental office. They know that a psychopath is about to loose. To combat this development, they cracked up and wandered into the dark. It ends in tears for most of them. <br /> <br /> Pranks is a slasher movie seriously made. Disclosure DVD I saw is Vipco one. It seems to be off in a bit of violence. This makes the DVD even more pointless because, let's face it, a worn slasher movie wrapped in a waste of time. For slasher-movie and embarrassing videos only complete.
