This film is very much like "Flashdance", you know that dancing flick with Jennifer Beals. This movie is probably the most boring movie I've ever seen since it's not even bad enough to be funny. "G.I. Jane" is better than film, but it does not say much. Here Demi Moore sweats a lot and has high music, and we get to see his fight with everything, but it is certainly not very engaging. I really think the idea behind the movie is kind of interesting, but the script is too shady and Ridley Scott can not do anything about it. Well, like I said ... It's better than "Flashdance" ... (4/10)
