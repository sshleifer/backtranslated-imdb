I recently online looked at a public domain movies. In the long list of this movie movie and I thought I should be hallucinations in such an offensive title and quotes. But no, that's what it was. And since the film was only about 27 minutes long, I decided to give it a try. If it turned out to have some pornography, I would stop watching it. Instead, it turned out to be the most bizarre movie I've ever seen. The Danish production team tried, with a budget of approximately $ 49, made a Star Trek-style film on a very gay man crew traveling on the wiping galaxy from asthma girls do not kill all the women - as they proceeded to do on the Earth! And in each case, they met with cheers and thanks to the gay guys now on the planet. <br /> <br /> Subtle, this is not. With some of the most obscene and juvenile names of characters I've ever heard, I do not even think I can write them on IMDb without having my review removed! However, despite the extreme talking about it all, it was weird to look and worth a peek. But, as I mentioned previously, due to the biting names and odd subjects (though there is no stripping), it's only an adult film. <br /> <br /> By the way, this movie leaves me with 1001 questions as WHO would do this, why do it and WHO the audience has intended? It may not be the worst thing I've ever seen, but it's probably the odd and possibly the most offensive!
