Just too many incidents of violence. The film goes from one scene to another, and in almost every single violence one erupts. <br /> Now I am not a person who is shocked by violence, and me a movie without a fight in it has something missing. But please, not one after another. My reaction was not shock or horror, he was: "Here we go again." Some pretend to be a story in the middle of the scene, but two thirds of the way in the movie I have changed completely, and could not wait for the end. <br /> <br /> If this is the best movie makers can do, they should find something else to do with their miserable life, such as making shoes or delivering mail.
