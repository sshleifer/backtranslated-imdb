If you like to watch Mel Gibson's Million Hotel Hotel then you might enjoy watching Burt Reynolds in yet another movie so bad he can never distribute. I can only attest the DVD version so perhaps the VHS version is pure quality but the night cinema and black scene were so bad that everything looks red. I first thought my DVD player was messed up. It was not. If you insist on watching it I recommend adjusting the color on your TV until it is black and white. If you are not you will never be able to get into the movie. If you do, it will simply remind you of a poor movie student trying to review the style of Pulp Fiction.
