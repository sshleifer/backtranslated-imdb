This is by far one of the most boring and horribly acting accounts in the early days of Adolf Hitler that I have ever watched. Robert Carlyle is a wonderful actor, but cast it as Hitler is just plain wrong. To throw Liev Schrieber as Hitler's longtime friendship and help, Haefengstal must have been embarrassed to cry in despair and anguish at the Simon Wiesenthal Center. A J-W plays a Nazi supporter, bad bad casting. This was not an enjoyable family movie with a good historical background. This Hollywood waste was at its finest, cashing in on the force of a strong (but gravely under use) supporting the cast of actors who seemed to have all but disappeared from the acting Rada in the past 5 years. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br/> <br/> My mother is German and she sits fuming in the sound of the voices kept holding switching from American / English / German all in the same sentence. Throw in support to make the best box box in the local video store than on the screen. Jenna Malone just as Geli Raubal was sick, was beautiful, he captured the innocence and confusion of this young tragic who finally ended his own life to escape what would be his future as in the shadow of Hitler. If you would like a fantastic and historically accurate story of the Hitler's early Hitler and including the war / holocaust, the "Inside the Third Reich", 1983, begins Rutger Hauer as Albert Speer and Derek Jacobi as Hitler. It was good and made more sense then this baloney. As a historic researcher in the Third Reich I can honestly tell you, this was my reason for my book to confirm its myriad of inaccuracies.
