I have the 'guts' inform you to please stay away from 'Dahmer', the biographical movie based on the real-life story of the grotesque killer series. `Dahmer 'loses more in relation to the mentality of its focus topics. Jeffrey Dahmer, who killed more than 15 young men and eating some of the body parts, was probably the most syringe killer in our generation. However, real people are the filmmakers in this terrible spectacle that should have themselves examined before deciding the green project this terrible `dahm '. This is not an easy to digest movie, though Jeffrey might easily dig it with some `` braininside 'firearms or even some real life` guys. Potato skin. * Si
