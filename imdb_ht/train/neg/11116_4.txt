This woman works as an intern for a photographer to go home and take a bath to discover this hole on the ceiling. So she goes to find out that her neighbor is a photographer. This movie may have been a great draw but then the odd scheme of any hope. The problem I had with this movie is that every ten seconds, someone is snorting heroin. If they took out the scenes where someone eclipsed snorts, then this would be a very good movie. Every time I thought that a scene went somewhere, someone breathed the white powder. It's really lame to have many drug use in one movie. It pulls attention from the main draw and a great story about a photographer. Lesbian matters did not bother me. I was looking for a movie about art. I found a movie about drug use.
