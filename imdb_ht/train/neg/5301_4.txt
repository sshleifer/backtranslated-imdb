I bought this movie because this was Shah Rukh Khan debut.And I also liked to see how it would do. I must say it is excellent in its role.Divya Bharathi is superb in this movie.Rishi makes a beautiful things.Susham Seth supported well. Natasha was good at his role.Amrish and Mohnish had their party quite too. Dale was also good in her role.Share by a Mediocre movie.The continent is average. The correction is poor .The story is boring. He tells us about Ravi a famous pop singer. He has a lot of female fans.One of them is Kaajal.avi and Kaajal fall in love and get married. Ravi gets killed by his cousins. Kayak becoems a widow .. to escape from the Ravis cousins.They go to Bombay.She comes across Raja.She falls in love with her and gets married.Ravi returns.The story is predictable.Limay is predictable. The half halves first.It also shoots a lot.But it is saved by the actors and music. Put the second half.Microsoft is enticing and some nice songs. The cartoon seems obsolete in the first half but looks like the unimaginative.Picturisations sing are except for "Sochenge Tumhe Pyar" and one rain song. Costumes are outdated. Either way to watch this just for the actors and music rating-4/10
