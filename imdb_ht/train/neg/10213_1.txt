A lot of people seemed to love the movie, so I feel a bit bad to give it a bad review. But after sitting in 96 minutes of it, I feel I must do that. Where the heck is the plot of this movie ?! I must have missed it, I was waiting for the storyline to unfold and nothing happened. Ensuring the finish was "a bit shocking" but they did not build up to it. I forgot who was half of the time, so they did not really develop the characters. The act was so-so, most of the time it was credible, but I could see it most of the time. So ... without giving anything away, I must say that unless you like the actors in the movie, there is no real reason to watch this movie. I could make mistakes, but I just did not understand why there was little, or too much of the movie. I can not decide which one might, so I say judge for ourselves. I do not even know if renting it would be a good idea, the price and all ... <br /> <br /> Draws: 0/10 Characters: 1/10 Acting: 2/10 Overall: 3/10 I feel I like this too high, I stay with my vote up to the top.
