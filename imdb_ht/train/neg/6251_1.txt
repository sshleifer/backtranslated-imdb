I could hang in for only the first twenty minutes of this low-budget film. The most blatant absorption was that while American prisoners in a North Korean POW camp were all supposed to suffer from severe deprivation of food and medicine, go without bathing, thrill in amidal and dirty parks, and sleep on iron floors, and - Let's not forget torture collectors - they always manage sports inferior hair. With the exception of Harry Morgan constantly looking for a huge army, it's simply dead and acting. Ronald Regan may not seem to stick to describing a single character and instead creates a schizophrenia instead of schizophrenia in past roles. An especially rubber cast that describes North Korean campus officials might have been forgiven, but when supposedly Russian officers act as advisors for Korean strut around wearing Nazi uniforms are re-badged filled with jodhpurs and jackboots (evident costume-recycling departments from WWII flicks) and speaking with accents like General Burkhalter from Hogan's hero, well, that's just six silly comics. Do not waste your time on this one.
