As I sat down this mediocre televised, I asked why? Why did Diane Keaton agree with this garbage? The movie uses idle, comprehensible lines of conspiracy to deliver household waste to thousands. The film takes a political agenda to a new level. The film was nonsense, and all credibility was lost for too many stereotypes. <br /> <br /> It was obvious that Keaton tried to make this movie refreshing, but in the end he needs to remember the old age of the worries that you can not polish a turd. I hope you have not wasted your New Year's Day watching another mindless make for TV movie. I now know why the networks started serene serial on Sunday night, get rid of garbage!
