Stunning Vision? Most definitely. I've seen some films look good at some time. Captain Sky and the World of Tomorrow use cinematographic slots, computer graphics, and creative futuristic designs to create a world that is historically familiar yet something cool. The time period seems to have been the 1930s or early 40s. The film says in recent attacks in New York City by mechanized army robbers and the likes for some unexplained reason. Also, the mysterious disappearance of important scientific mind coincides. Who can stop and save the world? Well, it does not take a leap in faith to know that it is the Sky Captain himself and his girlfriend's knowledge of her reindeer always warm for a lead, and her zealous, competent sidekick. What Sky Captain has in its atmosphere and graphics is lacking in telling stories and characterization. The plot for this movie is ridiculous. What they say, the movie is going to be a series of series in the movie series. They were very far away from history and misconduct - but none of them, and I mean none of them, had the budget and the great movie name was. Two academies Academy Awards and Jude Laws could keep a movie afloat, one would think, but Sky Captain sedentary. Despite its fantastic black look, I found myself wanting the movie would just end up and I could get over with my life. I had little interest in a story that produced little interest. I did not care for any of the globe portions. Paltrow was just awful. Jolie was a joke that has a role and virtually no substance. Laws can not bring the one-liner tradition all too squarely on his limited shoulders. I mean, let's face it, it's not Will Smith, Mel Gibson, or even Wesley Snipes. The saddest thing about Sky Captain, at least for me, was that he kept many promises again to deliver so little. I was bored ten minutes in the movie - waiting for something to hang my interest - and it never came.
