In sum, overlong and full with more subplot than Swiss cheese has holes! The director and co-writer said he wanted to mix genres - in this case drama and comedy. Well, at least here, these mixes of vinegar and oil. In boots, the comedy is not very funny and youthful. In addition, the film is not really realistic. Freedoms have taken regarding the legal system of committed French citizens against their will and the apparent ease of absorption and drugs of the French Hospitals. I watched this movie on my big screen TV at home and found myself shouting in the movie to move on. Eventually toward the end I quickly send the last long speech to one of the main characters to give his ex-lover son. Then I was torn from the preposterous confused plot that deals with a dead lover, marriage of convenience and a former lover nutty. At times the duel scheme gives families of the two main characters and then returns back to one of them - either Ismael or primarily Nora. In the detriment of the audience, opinion keeps changing from Nora and Ismael, his former lover closes against his will in a psychiatric hospital. There are probably two potentially interesting films here and those well-developed. The epilogue does not really wrap much of the sub-cemeteries and looks like the viewer believes Nora somehow will get early although giving her circumstances to real life the odds equivalent to luck a snowball in hell. The actors do their best and appeal, but that is not enough to overcome all the shameless exposure of poor, educated and lacking.
