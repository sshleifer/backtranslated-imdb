I'll keep this as short as possible as this piece of crap barely guarantees a mention. ZOMBIE 90 is one of the worst films ever to make - just up with other 'Schnaas' entry awful zombies - ZOMBIE DOOM (aka VIOLENT SH! T 3). These films suck off that everyone involved in creation should shoot. I somehow manage (barely ...) sitting in zombie ZOMBIE - but ZOMBIE 90 is so horribly stupid - even when compared to other film films of Schnaas - that I had fast-forward in everything after 10 minutes first. ZERO acts agility, inept gore, horrible camcorder-style camera-work, ridiculous duplicate ... it just goes over and over. I really can not find a single thing to pick up on this garbage - and I can usually get Something Hated in just about any movie. That's truly one of the worst films ever made - You've been warned ... 1/10
