Manoj Agrawal after the failure of Pardesi BABU (1998) back to this movie <br /> The movie has Govinda in 8-9 roles, including his father, mother, grandfather, sister and later on has been disguised <br /> It's short is a futile detective sent on a case by his friends to get evidence against his wife, whose photos looses at the airport while flirting with Rani <br /> It disguises as a Sardarji in the plane and again as a girl The funny party is how easy and in short time does it? Then it disguises as a French singer and enters a television to find proof lol and then as a maharashtrian (yes inside the TV itself) <br /> The rest of the movie has the same identities to make mistakes and it ends on a predictable score Some funny scenes like Govinda being bashed by an African and also many other servers <br /> <br /> Direction by Manoj Agrawal is okay Music is okay <br /> <br /> Among the actors Govinda again proved he is one of the most occasional actors It's usually a tasting fanatic though he did these roles before it fits all ups and roles too well here again though many hyped roles 6- 7 does not actually fit in the movie Rani looks like fat, team up well with Govinda thatz it It's nothing great and keep doing these kinds of roles Among the rest of Nirmal Pandey is as usual Johny Lever too loud at luck and silly in the place 1 role and irritation as the former Tinnu Anand is okay Satish Kaushik is hilarious, Paresh is okay Tanaaz se ok
