It was a disappointment to see this DVD after many years. For me the main problem of the unequal script. <br /> While some of it is witty and hip, quite a bit of it is dull, unfunny and lifeless. Many of the gags just sit there, lack spark and energy. At the disposal, Mae West and Rachel Welch come on well. Roger Herren in the role of bright rusty (too bad he did not make more movie). But for my money, there's just too much of John Huston, and poor Rex Reed does not hardly give a chance to fight. Her character seems relegated to equip around on the sidelines, asking what she's doing in this movie. <br /> <br /> The low user rating should give an idea as the public opinion of this piece. The original Vidal has given many potentials that were pretty much wasted. Not even the movie 'classic' movie has done much. All in all a sub sub submarine, and it is not likely to get better and time.
