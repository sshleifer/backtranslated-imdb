It gets really bad. The only half way of redistribution quality is the effects from thousands of bullets used during the film. There are error contexts everywhere. The act is terrible, save Kirk. The story is like holes like the grail, and the belief that the movie is a video game in itself just kill the movie, if it was not already a corpse. So all of it's a waste of your life. I would give this a zero was an option on the rating scale.
