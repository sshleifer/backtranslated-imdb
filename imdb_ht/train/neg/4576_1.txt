At first glance this documentary / fiction / cartoon is fun and thought provoking. Of course, when something provokes thoughts, it can then be examined. The reality is this film combining metaphysics with innuendo and worthless conclusions. The link that "The Bleep ..." would have you seen between science and spirituality is, in fact, not rooted in science at all. The Transdental Meditation Study mentioned in the film claims that meditation by a group can reduce crime in a given area, Washington D.C in this case. In fact, the HRA (homicide, rap, and attack) crime rate was approximately 30% higher in 1993 than the average crime rate between 1988 1992. There was absolutely no decrease in homicide rates during the study. In fact, each claim that links metaphysics and science can and was debunked. My conclusion from this information is that this film is either a poor attempt to endocrine people or jokes. Either way, I suggest that you do not waste your time. If you are looking for a long-lasting film about science that could induce thinking, you might consider Mindwalk (1990).
