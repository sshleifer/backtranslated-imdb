Yes, this was the most incredible blow blast. We know that the French often has a fake idea in the USA, it's Puritanism and views towards sex. As an American (Hoosier) resident in France, I have ample opportunity to observe these attitudes. And while some of these preconceived notions can be true, NOT an element in the Midwestern city described in this film sounds real. A man who never had sex because he said high school 20 years before his penis is overweight? Where in the world would you get that? A juice box in a bar that plays only ancient bluegrass? A city and maybe 16 people less than two hours away from Chicago, but with no major gas stations, no Tvs at home, no McDonalds, no kids ... A population that knows every intimate detail The other again relentlessly gets together as one big family hating each other. The adult guys who have cushioned cushions in the local cafe, are firm, but do not harvest, kill the guy they do not like in front of everyone and seems to get away with it, and all with equal emotions? The French released girl who will screw 17-year-old young boy because of her sexual generosity, the excess body guy goes from receiving in the fields by the only breath of an Illinois breeze to help deflower even 17 year old old boy? EDE! I am so disoriented and surprised by the absurdity of this film that I do not expressly express how ridiculous it is. Go to the A-to-Z Elementary on what to avoid. Gosh, I hope I did not ruin it for you!
