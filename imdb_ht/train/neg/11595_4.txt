STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning <br /> Alice, having defeated Freddy at the end of the movie last, is now trying re-adjust his life. But her unborn child carries a demonous presence - Freddy, trying out of the world again. <br /> It's interesting to note the directors who have received great rest of Freddy's film rest - Charles Russell (Eraser, Mask) Renny Harlin (Goodnight Kiss Kiss, Cutthroat Island, Cliffhanger, Hard Hard 2) and here Stephen Hopkins (lost in space, Predator 2.) But while Russell and Harlin did a great job at it, Hopkins IMO did something in a pod with this entry, which should quickly forget. <br /> The story is clearly stretched as far as it can go here, and Freddy ludicrously a father himself and the ridiculous baby suffer from looking. Even at about an hour and a half, it all gets rather tedious, and of course, not afraid at all. <br /> <br /> The "good appetite, bitch" catch-phrase is the only memorable point in this other that has very unexpected meaningful entry. *
