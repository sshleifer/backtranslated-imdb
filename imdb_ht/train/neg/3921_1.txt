This short parody can be found on the DVD Millennium DVD edition of "The Night of the Living Dead". Good things like I would never go even a tad out of my way to see it. Replace zombies with sound bread just like funny harmless paper hazards. At execution, it's a different problem. This short did not even require a chuckle in my hand. I really never thought I would say that, but "Night of the Day of the Dawn of the Child of the Bride in Return of the Revenge of the Terror of the Attack of the Evil, Mutant, Alien, Food Food, Hellbound, Zombified Living Dead Part 2: The Shocking 2-D "was a better parody and not nearly as blame or boring.
