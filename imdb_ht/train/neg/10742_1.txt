I tried to sit in this bomb by too long ago.what a disaster .The act has been atrocious.there had some pathetic action scenes that had fallen flat like a lead balloon.This was mainly due to the fact that the reactions of the actors just did not ring true.supposedly a modern repository of the original Hitchcock "Lifeboat" .I think Hictcock would be spinning circles in his grave at the thought of so much of it.fom that I could suffer in, no Nothing that is compelling in this movie.it has many names of great names, but does not put any effort into the characters.But you know, to be fair, it was nobody's fault. I mean, I'm pretty sure script blow up the first explosion. LOL.it is possible that this end ends up improving as it goes along. But for me, I do not want to spend at least three days to get out.so unless you have at least a three-day weekend on the horizon, avoid this stinker / 1/10
