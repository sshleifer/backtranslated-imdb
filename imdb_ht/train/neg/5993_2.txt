I grew up (b. 1965) to watch and love the Thunderbirds. All my colleagues in the school look. We played "Thunderbirds" before school, during lunch and after school. We all wanted to be Virgil or Scott. No one wanted Alan. Counting down from 5 has become an art form. I took my children to see the film hoping they would get a glimpse of what I loved as a kid. How annoying disappointing. The only high point was the theme term dynamic. Not that he could compare with the original score of the Thunderbirds. Fortunately early Saturday morning one TV channel still plays reruns in the series Gerry Anderson and his wife created. Jonatha Frakes should be hand in his director's seat, his version was completely hopeless. A waste of films. Outter garbage. A CGI remake may be acceptable but replaces Puppet and Homo sapiens subsp. Sapiens was a big mistake mistake.
