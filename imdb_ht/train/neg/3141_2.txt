I just had evidence to confirm my suspicions. A bunch of children, 14 to 22 placed on the DVD of "Titanic" on a fantastic state of mega art mannequin type entertainment type. Only two of them have actually seen it before. But they all saw the moment of Kate, Leo and Celine Dion many times that most of them felt they were seeing the whole movie. Shortly after the season began, they began to get restless, some of them left asking the others - "Call us when the iceberg appears" More than an hour and a half in the movie, only two girls who saw the movie before, were still there. They began shouting: iceberg, iceberg. A tugboat followed, they all turned to see Sinking in the Titanic. They sit quietly, emit Oh and away. So just like I thought when the movie first broke out in the scene. What is it? One and half an hour waiting for this bloody thing, but what about the rest of it. Dr Zivagho, for example, had a long time running, but thought how many take place in that movie the same time period. In "Titanic" Leo teaches Kate how to spit. Look at the figures with the hand, supposedly, the cream of the cream in the room room first class of the boat. Look at historical details, if you can find them. The scenario is so thin that they have to present weapons and shoot in a boat that is on leak. The real sinking here is in movie standard. All efforts focus on special effects and open weekends. The movie went on to become the biggest movie ever, what do I know?
