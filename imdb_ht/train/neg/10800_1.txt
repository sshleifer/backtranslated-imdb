What was the point in this movie? What was the plot? I do not know. Shaq can not act, nobody knows how to direct, and I'm Kazaam! A Rapid Genius? Come. Perhaps Eminem or Linkin Park will be in a movie like this. I remember I was watching this just killing time. He did not really interest me. I just remember thinking, "Who put Shaq in this film ???" The whole story seemed stupid too. He did not make any sense. I guess a non-real moral in this film is that you can find anything in the ghetto and anything can happen. I can not comment much more because this movie is so awful there is nothing worth to comment on. I "want" this movie would go.
