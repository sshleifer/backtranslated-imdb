If you are waiting to see a lot of bath in Altıoklar, as promised by the tag line, you will be very disappointed to see that the film consists of anything but the populist style of Altıoklar regarding most popular issues such as gender, marriage and cheating. In many stripping, which seem to appear in nowhere and there is no connection or whatever in the scheme proves that Altıoklar was unsuccessful to "try something new" as he notes. Many sex centers joke seem to show that Altıoklar has fallen to the famous saying that is "sex." I was hoping to see a very good story being told with a very good narration technique. However in the end I found myself sitting for 90 minutes and looking at the experimental Altıoklar always still focusing on popularity work.
