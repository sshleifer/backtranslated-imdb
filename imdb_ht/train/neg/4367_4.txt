One of Boris Karloff's real paralysis. Essentially Karloff's death (over 120 years older than he) is a scientist who needs cash to finish his experience before dying. Moved from Morocco where his funding was taken over by someone else he went to the South of France where he worked a doctor while trying to draft enough money to prove his theory. Desperate for making a deal with the wealthy young woman in a dyed baron. He will fund him if he helps her husband poison so he can get his money and carry on with a gigolo (which I think married). If you think I got that out of watching the movie you wrong, I read what others posted face to know happened. Why? because this movie made me lose two minutes. I had no idea what was going on with its many characters and several line draw lines. Little is spelled out and many do not say until towards the end of that time I really did not care. It's a dull mess in peering interests for Karloff's performance which is rather odd at times. To be honest this is the only time I've ever seen him venture into Bela Lugosi rare territory. It's not all but a few scenes and make me wonder how many have been hanging out.
