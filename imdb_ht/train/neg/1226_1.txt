I, how mighty were the fallen. Kim Basinger is a great actress but she's definitely slumming when she took that role. This movie is bad for a particular reason: falls into logic. It seems like one of those movies that would have been pierced with all its scheme if it came from the 80s and 90s, but in 2008 it just looks really stupid. This is the worst thriller I've ever seen and I've seen the Bone and Twisted Collector. The details of Della's story (Kim Basinger) is just getting out of buying gifts to a shopping mall is harassed by a gang of thugs ending killing a cop who came to his aid. From then on, he chases those idiotic goonsies in an abandoned street and gets rid of them one by one with a full tool tool. So many things are wrong with this movie. As I told this movie leaps over logic at every turn with the exception of Kim Basinger, the acting made-for-TV bad. Hell, this pseudo thriller made-to-TV bad. How to kill each of these politically incorrect patients (1 White, 1 Hispanic, 1 Asian and 1 African Americans all come together in a White woman's foot. Do not you just love America?) Is rid of a fault. The way he killed the Hispanic guy made me laugh hysterical. The sex scene and the main hoodlum were so out of the left field that it makes you shake your head off shame. I only recommend this lovers of bad movie and no one else. Anyone else especially Kim Basinger fans would do well by possessing this flick of films. You do not want to see an actress you respect in a movie this bad now? Of course not. You warned.
