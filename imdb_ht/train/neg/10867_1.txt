This is a movie that makes you say 2 things ... 1) I can do better than this (act, write and direct) 2) this is so bad I have to leave a review and warn others ... <br /> Look as if it was shot and my flip video. I have too much to believe my friend who told me that this is a vendetta against me. I have noticed some positive posts for this home video; You must leave crew members or people with something to do with this movie. One of the worst 3 films I've ever seen. Expect the writers and directors to leave the business. Not even enough talents to advertise !!!!!
