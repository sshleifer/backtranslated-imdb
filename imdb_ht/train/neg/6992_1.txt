The plot is about a female nurse, named Anna, caught in a mess around the world as zombie meat - meat begins to rise and take over the world and attack the living. He escapes in the streets and is delivered by a black police officer. So far, so good! I usually enjoy horror movies, but this piece of film does not deserve to be called horror. It's not even thrilling, just ridiculous. Even the "Flintstones" or "Kukla, Fran and Ollie" will give you more excitement. It's like watching a bunch of bloodthirsty drunkeners that they can not enter into a mall in more liquor. The heroes who locked themselves in, the commercial-mall inside to avoid being eaten at the hoodlums outside, are not the best either. Even if they do not seem to drink, they are given the impression that they are mentally disabled. Save your money instead of spending it on that!
