I went to see this with my wife and 3 year old son. She seemed to love her more than my wife and I did. This writing is amazingly poor for a Pixar / Disney breakout. In fact, I had a very hard time paying attention to all. The movie looked amazing, but the story just became so weird and time reinforced that I hoped my son would fall asleep so I could pick him up and walk out. <br /> <br /> Do not say that the movie is not an interesting concept, it just said so weird, (bad scenario?) especially when we "meet the family" for the first time. I know we should get the impression that the family is smacking but good masters, they might have shortened sequences by a good 15 minutes (seemingly, I did not actually have time to read it). Then I scratched myself looking for an exit.
