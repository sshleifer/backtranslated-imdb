supposedly based on the life of Domino Harvey a model turn bounty hunter. I would say 95% manufactured. I always keep an open mind when it comes to movies, however, this movie loses its chance when it becomes apparent having narratives in the movie, something I can not stand, and to itself off, the heroine of The story is so lovely and depicted as an arrogant! I just wanted to finish it and fired at the top. It's too incoherent, too flashy and too boring, it's someone who gives a bit of tough story, and I really think big time directors need to make movies based on their own own or writer's own writings by something based about some ignorant brat's life.
