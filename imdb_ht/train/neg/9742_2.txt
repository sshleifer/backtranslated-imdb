This is a rather dull movie about a scientist who creates a telephoto device and gets horribly disfigured when it uses the car to transport itself. Simple plot to do before in the fly with others. Not only does it get disfigured, but it can also be electrified with a touch. What really dumbs about this movie is that we hope to believe where this guy is working is against him. He could probably make millions for the institution that he is working in, but the head of the institution is trying to sabotage his telephonic every step in the way. At the end of those who projected electrocutes three people for no reason then go after that was wrong to her.
