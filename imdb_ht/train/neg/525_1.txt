I looked at the other comments and were well amused to find that those who clearly only worked on the movie were commenting. I mean, I hate saying bad things about an amateur production, but if you make a bad movie and you want to comment on it, tune it down a little. "Groundbreaking" is a little overhead. This is a Boston college production that does not even achieve the most amateur-level college level. It's what you would expect a bunch of kids to do. A funny action movie without much creativity. It's very funny if you want to poke fun at it. Not something you'll ever see unless you are a student at Emerson College.
