This movie can have low output value, but that's what makes it so good. The special effects are gross out and well done. My favorite part of the movie was to be Chrissy played by Janelle Brady. It is super hot and also has a good nude scene. Robert Prichard as the leader of the gang is hilarious, as is the other member. This movie is actually trying to make a point, saying that nuclear waste plants are bad. 4/10 Fair Comedy, gross out movie.
