I can only believe that Kanin's Groom had to be two people. One of those who wrote brilliantly "A Double Life" with the comic "Yesterday" and co-writing these excellent scenes as "Adam's Ribbons" and "Pat and Mike" with his wife Ruth Gordon and then those which has been written and / or directed to this tedious, sadly acting as "Mother of Bachelor", "Some Kind of a Nut", and this. Throw is trying, but the script is so tired and clich√©d that even their efforts in always wonderful Brenda Vaccaro are beaten. The script sinks to nadir in the really offensive sequence of the character character Janssen character Drivas make sure it is not gay. An ugly sequence, but sadly one that could easily play in a movie today. "Ethnic" jokes are now totally hugged, but "jokes" jokes are always "good, clean, fun family".
