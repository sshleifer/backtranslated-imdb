Wow ... what can I say ... First of IMDb says this is in the late 60s ... which means Carlito would be very close to go to jail, he was from 75 and he said it was in for 5 years. They used a bunch of actors, and a story that did not make sense. They bring back one actor, Guzman, and hes playing a totally different guy. Why did he end up with this Puerto Rican chick? Where's Gale? He said he was in love with it before. Wheres Kleinfeld? He said he knew him forever ... You'd think he'd been in this one. But if this made sense, where are Rocco and the black dude in the first one? It was all just stupid ... This is a reproach of Pacino and the movie first.
