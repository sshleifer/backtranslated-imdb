After you see and love Code (yes, I actually love Code), I decided to try another movie Uwe Boll and I chose out Pills because I was stumbled on a local DVD store and it's supposed to be the one its best films. While the first 10 to 15 minutes of the film was very promising and seemed like the beginning of a thriller of psychological disability, it soon went down from there and eventually degraded to one of the most generic slasher films I had See too far, including a massive amount of scheme holes, unrealistic emotional and sub-parental responses. It seems like Boll tried his best to come up with a decent draw but after a while just got up on it. Maybe it should stick to comedy? The few good things about this film is that it manages to create a creepy general atmosphere, which special effects are best than I expect and the sound goes well with the overall atmosphere, but the unbalanced rhythm of this movie combines with The extreme generic nature of it makes it the last half tedious hours to look, which also ruins my experience altogether. There is a fairly well-performing scene, but they seem to have to be the only shock value. And let's not forget the camera work that was nice nauseating at times. <br /> I hope Uwe Boll will one day learn what makes a movie good, because between a lot of horrible films it seems to make a decent movie every now and then. Seeds just are not one of these people.
