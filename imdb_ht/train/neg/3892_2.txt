Want to watch a scary terror movie? Then steer clear of this one. No enough beer in the world makes this movie enjoyable. <br /> However, there is enough scotch. Single-painted, if you can manage it. <br /> <br /> If previous comments were not enough to keep you from watching this mild movie, allow me to help. NASA sends one and two unpaid expenses into Saturn orbit. A really great solar rocket that causes Steve West's Colonel bleeding from the nose. Things go down from there, and wackiness occurs. <br /> I actually read the book adaptation, published and released only in the UK. MILES better than the movie, and the book was obnoxious. At least some allegations were made towards suspension, and some sort of explanation of events has been pulled out of the author (rhyme and 'gas'). <br /> Do not say that the movie is completely worthless. Rick Baker learned that he really needed to read a contract before signing a movie, and Jonathan Demme found that he was really best suited to direct. <br /> Yes, there is a MST3K episode featuring this movie, but it is, of course, edited quite a bit. Without the mandatory glamor of the breasts, not even the healing power of scooters can save you. <br /> <br /> Please just go look adventurer in the Lost Box if you want to see a melted guy. Look at space cobbies if you feel you need to see astronauts. I can not, in all good conscience, recommend this movie to moderate film-to-public.
