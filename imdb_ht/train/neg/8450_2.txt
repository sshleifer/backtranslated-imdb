What's happening in ITV Drama. First, "Lost Gemma" simply drama TV was the worst I've seen in years, and now "Perfect Parent" is a net cut at the start of the end. Anyone responsible for commissioning this drivel should receive P45 by special delivery. In most drama / thrillers, a condition to stop certain levels of belief is needed so that the plot line can develop, but "Perfect Parent" took this to a new level, I stopped many beliefs at the end of this nonsense I felt compelled to force a truck load in "magic mushrooms", as scriptwriter decided to try and create a "Drama by Number" involving some serious problems - Religion, Education, Greed, Fear, Murder, Paedophillia The problem was just like the Great Eric Morecambe once said when playing a piano, "I'm playing all the right notes, just not necessarily in the correct order." For your next guy guy, I suggest you try reading more books on script developments than "Script for Dummies". Due to the ridiculous script and the extreme lack of tension in the Directorate, Acting was the key to decent low, not the fault of the actors as the cast was toothache. But I suggest that all actors involved in this piece of regret in drama should instruct the future agents of the Postman to attempt to deliver a script from ITV Drama Department, make sure that the mailbox is brightly closed !!
