Confused melodies taken in a story by William Gibson, produced by John Houseman and directed by Vincente Minnelli! Richard Widmark heads up the darling, rural nervous asylum, where his loose wife fights with self-appointed queen Lillian Gish, and Widmark himself gets the lost eye for employee-newcomer Lauren Bacall, who puts his life back together after the death of her husband and son. Facetious and muddled, put in a temporary moment and place, and with a story "David and Lisa" love to hide from the morale fit. Widmark and Bacall have some good chemistry together, but this script gives them nothing to build on. For precisely an hour, most of the dialogue concerns what to do about hanging hangings in the library (this wire is not used as symbolism, rather it's a red herring in a mystery-not!). The photo expects to show the loggerheads who are disparate coming to them when they work in the same profession and everyone thinks the opinions are right, but unfortunately the indirect route Minnelli unravels this draft is neither informative, intuitive nor fun. ** from ****
