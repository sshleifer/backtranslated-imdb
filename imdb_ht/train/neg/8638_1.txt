Action, violence, gender and coarse language are the things that the characters do during the whole movie. And all that they do is do without reason. Mark L. Lester is (un) known for its violent (unreasonable) cinema (commando, base). The story is strange, but stupid. The actors play stupid characters are very well ... I'm not saying they are stupid but I mean they're very bad actors. It's another movie-bar budget unknown B series. If you've seen something like Operation Delta Force, Drive, Patriot, Sanctuary or something like these bad movies from the same type of Misbegotten ... Do not rent it ... and, by the way, do not rent any in the movies I mentioned .... I give it 1 and a half out of 5.
