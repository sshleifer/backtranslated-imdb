Do not drink fresh-aid. <br /> This is a backdated piece of music as a documentary. And his title as a "true" is just plain crap. The debate on global warming is far from, and it will only be about when ecological zero begins to recognize the mountain of evidence contrary to the beloved theory. Just Google "Global Global" and "Hoax" or "Junk Science" and you'll find a stream of information refuted almost every link in the chain of Gore's logic. The reason for it is important for people to educate themselves is the economic impact of the planet's prevention measures. Wake up people. Anyone having a computer, briefly, with some common sense can find many reasons why this theory is not even locked in credible. Not only does it read articles that support your present views, and everything you can find. There is no in-depth analysis done, really. There are simply too many alternative alternatives and counter-theory for theory to have the most basic level of scientific credibility. It is so incredible, in fact, that it can be the only major fatal in the course of human existence. It's time for people to start talking about this kind of propaganda, and it's time for people to admit to others that you can both be a conservationist and acknowledge the blatant conclusion that the hysteria warming planet is a great lie.
