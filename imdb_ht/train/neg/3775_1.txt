As other viewers mentioned, this film was an exciting experience in photography. The colorful colors are bold. I think the director carried out with his "artistic vision" on watching the movie instead of attention needs much about content. Despite its stellar performance, performance is substandard and almost incoherent history. Madonna seemed to throw peppers as a cascade to get pre-released press. A good thing like her appearance here lend some credulous to her album "I Breathless (Music inspired by Dick Tracy's movie)" which was a Stratospheric hit (due to the large part of the inclusion of dance-striking "Vogue" - which is not in, nor the slightest relation to this movie). I would guess the bigger part of the money from this film came from Madonna's tie-ins in "I'm Breathless" album. <br /> <br /> If you look at the home, by end-title, you'll think "there are two hours out of my life I'd like to have back." Save yourself the time wasted - do not bother with that.
