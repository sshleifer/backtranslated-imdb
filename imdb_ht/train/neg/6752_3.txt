Unfortunately, more downs than UPS. The plot was very decent. I mean, nothing comes out of the ordinary, but it has a history, unlike the other modern horror cops. The other good was thrown. I do not say that the act was good, because it was not, but every actor / actress was warm and attractive. <br /> One of the downs is that the movie only becomes interesting after the first 40 minutes or so. The rest was quite boring. Another down (or you might consider it an optional up) is the excessive nuisance. All 4 girls were topless for a few minutes, and all men showed their ladies for a long time. It's not that I'm against stripping, but this was a horror movie, not the 'Dreamers'. Unless you're very desperate to watch some guy taking in her swimsuit, she runs around naked for a few minutes, or watch a girl get naked for no reason, or you're a dead-hard fan of Debbie Rochon, is the movie for you. But if you are looking for a good horror movie, stay away.
