I saw the movie late a night on cable and could not believe how bad it was. I usually enjoy bad movies, but this one was so rebellious that it was not even fun. Some of the films in this film include the absurd music that is still playing throughout the film, the terrible scary effects (when a shotgun and a laser gun turn green and promptly disintegrate), and disgusting act . Acting, in fact, is what I feel to steal the show. I did not recognize any of the actors in the movie, and I hope I never have to see any of them again. In general, I recommend renting this movie (if you find it, I can not imagine a video store carrying this waste) just so that you can learn to appreciate the quality movie after seeing this garbage.
