The only reason to give this movie even a single star is how much money to make me laugh. I had high hopes as I usually love bad holiday anymore movie horrors, but that's just not qualified. It's really just a bad attempt to show a slippery character slowly into madness, which again, is not a bad plot, but is hurt here. There are some scenes (like the finish) that do not intend to be funny, but actually make me laugh loudly. There was a couple of times when I thought the movie would actually go in an interesting direction, but it never accomplished what it could and should. In my opinion, if you are looking for a flick of Christmas slasher, try night silence, deadly night.
