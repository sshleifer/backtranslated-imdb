I doubt the hip was even at the time, the term of all LSD couples with a murderous mystery was an obviously-sponsored attempt to grab a young audience in the era without the least realizing any any continuous understanding of the sixties . The doped aspect, welded head suffered from many problems, including overwrought acting, dialogue and stilted dialogue, LSD flashbacks that go on interminably long even after the point was layered home in the first 60 seconds, a failure to create any true suspicion even if the actual draw is, on paper, a big machine does just that, with an end that is so trite and predictable (not to mention reminiscent of a lot of bad TV shows) that climax is actually an anti-climate. If it were a better movie, we might have been able to stop unbelievers about some things where it could help enjoyment, but their weaknesses so blatantly only serve to emphasize the improbabilities viewers may otherwise neglect. I've seen headlines on TV and it would definitely be late night TV mean filing air space and spending time to kill someone's somebody rather than anything anyone must actively seek out. At best, a third out of 10.
