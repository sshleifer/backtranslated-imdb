Woody Allen did "September", which proved that even a genius could screw up. This is the "September" Mel Brook. Stupid, boring, and unfunny monks, I must confess I did not look it up to the end. The range flick among the little ones that has nothing (e, "The Money Money", "Out Of The Sea", "Spitfire Grill") that either put me to sleep or force me to reach for the button " quick ". And I say this, sadly, as a fan of Mel Brooks fans. It should stick to comedy right and leave social comment alone. How the same fellow who made "Young Frankenstein" and "Spaceballs" could be with a dog as this is beyond me. To avoid all costs.
