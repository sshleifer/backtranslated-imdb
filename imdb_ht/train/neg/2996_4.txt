Founded Again is a sub-standard episode of one season. It deals with the subject of reincarnation and just does not fly. I've never been great about reincarnation and that might be part of my coming toward this episode. It references the Tooms case that is some nice continuation of the previous episode. But the positives are over. Which is unfortunate because that takes place at the beginning of the episode. I think it's funny that a dead guy would choose to reincarnate into the body of a girl fully related. And she waits until the girl turns eight starts demanding revenge. There's even a serious shortage of mutual Mulder & Scully dialogue to keep the episode going afloat. If you are in reincarnation, maybe this episode is up to you. If not, then at least you can learn that bradycardia is.
