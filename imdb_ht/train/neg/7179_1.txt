No matter how it means "message" is - this movie is an extreme coaching - terrible act, camera work blame - I do not know why Carr has agreed to try and crawl on a sting - it is disgusting to her. You watch their extra on the DVD and how it has a camera to follow it around - it just dipped it up - it likes being the center of attention. He is a bad actor - she reminds me of another arrogant filmmaker - Eric Schaffer. Some how Carr has this movie to show at Youth Youth Centers and New Age churches - damaged places looking for reinforcement and attention themselves to babble over how the movie touches and maybe it's done - but as A movie itself it is chop, predictable and bathing.
