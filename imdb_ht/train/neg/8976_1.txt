The first point that calls the attention of "Forever Mozart" is the absence of a scheme summary of IMDb. The explanation is simple since there is no history, scenario, scheme or whatever might remind the minimum structure of a movie. Jean-Luc Godard is one of the most overrated directors and firefighters in the cinema industry and this freaky crew is among its most hermetic films. I believe neither did he understand what this story is about; but there are elucible intellectuals justifying or explaining this movie, and it's funny to review them. My vote is one. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Para Semper Mozart" ("Forever Mozart")
