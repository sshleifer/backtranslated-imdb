This is awesomely bad and awesomely embarassing for a Canadian. We grow good wine. Our writers and poets are among the best in the world. The National Ballet is rated among the top five companies in the world. But we DO NOT MOVIES BLOOD MOVIES! This is not especially bad. It is especially typical and typically bad, injected into two small hotels with parks and minimal directions, high school levels acting with "gee whiz ... lets see what this button on the camera does" photography. If Michael Moriarity was so intent on making a Imitation Nicholson Jack, could not he at least did a good Jack Nicholson imitation? But if the film was shot in Vancouver, really one of the favorite cities on earth and also a center of yacht building (part of the "plot") why in God's name do this complexity complex Canadian Integer dictates that it must disguised as Seattle ??? Not only am I angry about this movie, I'm embarassed with more than a little shame. The Australians turn out some splendid things. We produce perfect second-hand pumps. Gawd !!!!!
