It could be a fascinating look of life in one of America's most notorious killers, but sadly it did not even come close. Terrible correction, direction, wrong act, or name. This film is literally about 10 minutes of plot stretched at 100. The only redeeming quality is Bruce Davidson as the father, but that's not nearly enough to save this stinker. A 1 out of 10.
