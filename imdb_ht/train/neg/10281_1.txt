Carly Pap plays JJ, a recently-flown Food Critique that has flamboyant, overbearing mom moves in with her. JJ, left in turn this event, then blackmails owner restaurant, Alex, amused his mother in exchange for "maybe" review his dead restaurant. Alex is the predecessor for the daughter while heats up for the mother. There are so many problems with this movie, the universal 2-dimensional characters. JJ is a self-serving, character lovers, his mother superficial and deep. JJ colleagues in the magazine are bitchy and opportunistic. The message that is hidden in a woman over -50 can do it on her own, without male assistance is bad, bad, bad. The act is exactly dull, the inspired script. The only saving films are the environment in New York City. I would not recommend this movie.
