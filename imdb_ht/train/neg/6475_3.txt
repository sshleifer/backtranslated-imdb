Even though I have yet to review the movie in about two years, I remember exactly what made my opinion go as it did. Having loved the original Little Mermaid, and being obsessed with mermaid as a child might, I decided I would take the time to sit and watch the end. <br /> <br /> Disney, I had a small message for you. If you do not have the original director and handy actor ... you're just looking to get your butt whooped. <br /> <br /> In the end, our story begins with a little older Ariel and her daughter, Melody. My first big problem was that Eric and the rest of the crew sang. Yes, I understand that Disney is great about singing-and-dance numbers, but really, that's what made my favorite chief Eric. It was calm, collected, and a genuine gentleman who knew how to have fun. And he did. PA. SING. <br /> Then there's the villain. Oh, how could we forget the dogs that shed our spines every time Ursula was poorly slinked on the screen, terrifying both Ariel and audiences around the world? Unfortunately, this young man has not spent his seemingly unusual sister, Morgana. Nothing has ever been, ever told about Morgana in the first movie; She just pops out of nowhere, trying to steal the baby. Oh, how beautiful. The younger sister is ticking off and instead of going after the trident, decided to kidnap a baby-old baby. Gag me. <br /> Other than being a flat character with no sense of originality in it, Morgana was just very orthodox. The same plan as her sister, the same henchmen (who, by the way, did not scare anyone. I had a three year old on my lap when I watched this movie and he laughed over.) He had no reason to be in; I would like to see the mother be the villain. I'm sure she would do a better job than Little Miss Tish on there. <br /> <br /> King Triton held by one of the respect he had touched me in the movie first, and not even found I started on Scuttle, Sebastian and Flounder. Triton was a father but loving father of the first movie, and in the second, it almost like he lost his will to hit fear at the heart of his subject. Scuttle, once a comic relief that made everyone laugh and 'dingle-hopper' her (yes, I'll admit it; I called my fork a dingle-hopper from time to time later). In this movie, all the scuttle but forgot. A character supports even the first, and at least added something to the movie. He was rich with a taste other people did not have, and in the end, they all, but strip it in his hands entirely. Sebastian was still the same, but twice as worrisome as before. Disney, do not. Do not even try to mess with our favorite crab. Or our favorite little fat fish, who becomes a father and has a very annoying crowd of children. It is fat, and it is bland, and it seems it will be in any second line. <br /> <br /> The mors and penguins have been wasteful, and after a while, you just start to hate everyone. Especially tunes, who have no depth in it too. <br /> And one of those days, Disney, I kicked out of my life. <br /> If I did not like your original lot.
