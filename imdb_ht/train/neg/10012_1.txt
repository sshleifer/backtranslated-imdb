This film must be in line for the most boring films of the year. Not even Woody Harrison can save this movie from sinking at the bottom. The murder of people in this movie should be the point of interest in this movie but not, nothing of any interest. Throw them not bad but the script are just plain horrible, I just sit in marvelous astonishment during this movie, thinking how on earth can anyone find this movie funny <br /> <br /> The producers of film This was very smart. They made a boring film but hid it well with the actors and actresses on their cast. People will go to the blockbuster and probably see this movie and think, Woody Harrison, Kristin Scott Thomas and Willem Dafoe will be good and rent this movie. (The boys are in for a horrible time) <br /> If you love getting torn off and renting this movie, some people actually enjoyed this movie but I love to watch a movie and meaning
