For the first few minutes, Empire really formed herself up: it appears a strong, confident, and relatively unknown film gangster. At that moment I did not know why, I thought it was good - but now I do. <br /> <br /> One of the main problems with this movie is that it is purely and completely unattractive. I do not mind movie and psychos and things, to prove a point-taking Jackie Brown, for example - but they're all so terribly deep in this, but this is obviously thrown in for entertainment. You literally feel a numb pull in your stomach. Another big problem is the protagonist. It is breathless, arrogant, yet- ironically enough-not that bad. It does not seem tight enough to be a woman drug killer. The reality is, at the end of the day, this film is completely firefighting. Not Slick, not smart, just dull, and idle - this colossal mess should be avoided at all costs. <br /> <br /> * from ***** (1 out of 5)
