I had the worst of wasting 10 quid buying new movie SS on DVD: Force Attack. Now I can usually stop my beliefs from watching movies like this. A pinch of salt and some beers in a dark evening on the sofa watching a boom window evening shooting em up is perfect for one male alpha like me. I bought this movie my thoughts would see cool martial arts and shoot em up. <br /> <br /> Was I Hell? Segal is old and stuffy, the scheme was ludicrous even by SS standards and looking to read everything in Segal act (as it started with) is exceptionally terrifying. So it would last in the fact that half of his voice was armed on a man who sounded NO as he. Either SS can not act again (a mosquito point) in the crew was so scared of their work, they could not record the sound well. The voice would flick back and forth between Mr. Whisper Segal and the man who made voers overs for Honda announcements! <br /> <br /> The plot of wisdom is not the problem because most movie action works on the same as this one, nothing new. The usual mix of characters will die horribly as cannon fodder and bad stereotypes waiting to get bleached away. <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie as you avoid walking in front of a speed train or a H5N1 Flu H5N1 dose. <br /> <br /> This was a public health warning.
