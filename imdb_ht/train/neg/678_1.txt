All I can really say is that I'm glad I was knitting socks while watching the movie, or I would be very angry because she had been wasting 2 hours in my life. The act was terrible, the plot was even worse. There were some scenes that meant being serious to my husband and I laughed loudly. I highly recommend this movie to those who like to make their own versions of MST3K.
