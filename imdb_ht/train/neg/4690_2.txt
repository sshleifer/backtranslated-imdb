This British movie is really awful, and it's hard to believe that Glenn Ford is in it, although it's pretty much asleep in it. The idea of ​​a bomb on a good sound train ... but it turns out that this train ends up parked for the majority of the movie! There is no action, no movement, just a static train. The area where the station is parked is evacuated, so it's not as there's any danger to anyone either. In fact, this film can be used in a movie class to show how PA does a movie suspense. True suspension is the product that does not let the audience know what the characters do not do, an apparently unknown fact of the director. SPOILER: The train actually has two bombs on it, but we are led to believe there is only one. After the first defraud bomb, it feels as if there is no longer a reason to watch the movie any more. But in the last minute, the villain, with no apparent motivation for his actions, revealed there are two. And we are sure when the bombs are going to go, so we do not even have a classic "ticking bomb" sequence of tension. A good 10 minutes or more to spend the look of French Glenn Ford's wife thinking about leaving her and then wondering where she is. It is like a shamper character that we do not care if he reconciles with him, so when he does, there is nothing emotional about him. Most of the other characters are fairly devoid of personality, and there are no problems or problems. Only 72 minutes, but it feels long because it's tedious and dull. Do not waste your time.
