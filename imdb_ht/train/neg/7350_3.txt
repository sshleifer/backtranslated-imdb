Despite very bad reviews, I just gave this movie a go ?? she does, after all, stars HK super-babe shu qi plus 6 other oriental lovelies as a team of all-action chat-burglarist. Is this really worth checking out? Well, as Babe-Going Goes, Martial Angels is hard to beat. Candy in eyes is top quality. Shu Qi looks as fantastic as always, and in the rest of the girls, Rosemary Vandebrouck and Amanda Strang keep my eye roving in particular. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, if one is judging this movie by any other merciful basis possible, it is an absolute stinker! The story is weak, shoddy action and strikingly pathetic effects. Director Clarence Fok and Producer Wong Jing gave us a photogenic cast and little else. <br /> If Shu Qi is the only reason you're gaze to see this one, you'd better watch Sex and Zen 2 anymore!
