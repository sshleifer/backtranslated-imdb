I enjoyed the feeling of opening the few minutes, but the 20-minute I was liberally implementing the fast-forward button. Far too many shots at Stewart (Michael Zelniker) are walking out of the room room, down hallways, through the doors and on the street, and as many shots in her are looking for and confused. Giving me the impression that the story was originally meant as a short (20-30 minutes), and then stretched to a feature as a work of love between director Grieve and Zelniker stars (they co-wrote the scenario )> <br /> It might have been more fun if any of the characters had anything to say that I had not heard of many other films before, or if the finish was not - disappointingly - the one i has been foreseen for three minutes in the movie (atypical for an independent studio / movie studio). At least her heart was at the right place - it was not your standard standard Hollywood manipulative formula.
