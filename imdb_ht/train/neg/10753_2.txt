Del - "You're the smartest dumbest person I've ever encountered." <br /> <br /> Calvin- "Well, I've got a brain but lost it to re-write them." <br /> <I think what I find most flagrant about this bastardization of Asimov's work was how the character of Susan Calvin was described. In the books, it was actually one of the first great protagonists to think about his way into a problem. Here she is just a girl in distress, waiting to be saved by Wil Smith. <br /> <br /> There are references to Asimov's laws of robotics, but are a souvenir of the CGI and action scenes. <br /> Smith is likable, as it is in most of its films, but honestly, the story is not that good. You figure it out long before these genius characters do.
