The end of the world looks like a good movie on the box cover but they warned bad.being a huge fan of mega star actor Christopher Lee I was misleading. As a good (77) a good cast does not mean it will be a good movie.the beginning seems promising then back to the Buddha, many parts of the film are too dark to see which will be on the rest of the cast shown shortly as Lew Ayres, Dean Jagger, and MacDonald Carey as a security guard. He would expect better at Charles Band who had made such fun movies as re animator and dolls. Hearing Christopher Lee was fooled by making this film . said his co star would be Jose Ferrer, John Carridine, and Dean Jagger.well Dean Jagger is there, but the other two have never made it (the chances) if you make a movie about the end of the world with a larger budget and best storyline.dean Jagger went on to make two good movies afterwards; Cayman (80) and Game of Death (79) called Lyon (Lolita) is also in the movie less it lollipop.if you are a glutton for punishment then look at the end of the world i dare you to say woke all the movie.1 came out of 10.
