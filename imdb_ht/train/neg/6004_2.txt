The best thing about the general movie movie is that you know what to expect. It's like watching a professional literary event or a day's soap opera or Jerry Springer show: you can instantly follow the dog scheme, identify the card characters, and look for satisfaction while all the clicks are fulfilled. However, at times, the director does something unexpected. It can be something extraordinary stupid, or something weird, or something insightful. The director's maker stands with the best camp director, and this is his best movie. <br /> In this one, everything looks like. There is nothing good about it, but still managed to be a coherent whole. Not once the movie slows down - the action flows over and the punches keep on coming. <br /> <br /> The strange thing is that there's no sense of time: some characters seem to take months to do something while other characters have only spent one hour at a bar. This is partially and Finnish summer where the sun never sets, so you do not experience the day turning around one night at all. <br /> <br /> Finally: there is a scheme, there, somewhere. You may have to watch the movie three times before you realize it, though.
