Bottom of the barrel, inimaginative, and practically unwatchable replenishment of the WARRIOR road. This film follows the exact plot as the Filipino film STRYKER and is worse not far! Bad acting, dialogue, effect, dubbing, rhythm, action sequence ... The list goes on and off. Italy has literally dozens of Road Warriors rip-off in the early 80's, some good, some bad. This is the worst not far, no competition. Not only was the mood of the movie completely weak and miserable, the experience of sitting in this one is a do with a half. There was 1 (one) good sequence chasing the beginning of the movie, with a cool shot of a man holding a hand grenade explosion. But all else on this movie seriously reeks! For current post-nuke pleasure, go down a copy of ENDGAME, after falling into NEW YORK, or escaping from BRONX instead. They will be more enjoyable than this garbage.
