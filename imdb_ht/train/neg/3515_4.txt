Basically a typical propaganda film for the last good war. But there was a couple thing that struck me. First used in cap anxiety. In both cases, the Scott Scott lips one, once at the start when he drops his bomb to target during the bomb-off ("dammit") and once he tries to have a stick of a pilot ("s * t "). I would be wrong about the second example but I replayed it several times and that it looks like me. The third case is when Charlie Anne Shirley wants goodbye O'brien and good luck ("Bay Hell") on the roar of the engines. It must have been thought that it was too unknown because it was clear "heck". I also found interesting characters with moral issues and shelling, especially civilian bombing. Avencular superior officer assures him that only military targets will be hit due to the accuracy of the used bombs. Given what we know about LeMay's later strategy in Japanese city firebombing in this oblivion scene play and not a little irony. I remember McNamara's statement in LeMay in the "draft of the war," one thing that if the US did not have the conflict he should try as a criminal war. The latest is how overwrought, in keeping with the movie. He reminds me a bit at the end of White Heat (I do not compare the films, just finish!). Maybe it just 'causes it to blow up. Blowed up real good !!!
