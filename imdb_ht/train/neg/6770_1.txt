I went to see this film and I 17 y.o. daughter. I insist that we go the show that shows, not because I'm a tightwad, but just feel I've got. In NASCAR spirit, this is a supporter of dreams. So much blatant advertising, it's almost skilled as a Info-mercial, if it was not for the so-called acting. Keeping with tradition, the Herbie franchise continues with its cheese story line, the car is only a 'car' (no pun intended) for this cornball in a motion picture. Earlier Herbie herb (although cheese as well) was produced during most severe times, making them a little easier to digest. Ms. Lohan, Disney's last queen drama, has little ability to act. I was surprised that Mr. Keaton and Mr. Dillon would take part in these projects. Only give the snack, it was a bigger ripoff!
