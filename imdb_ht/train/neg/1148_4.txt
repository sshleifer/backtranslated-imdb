Pedantics, manufacturing overhead that try chronic birth of the Federal Office for Investigation. Start well promising, with an important test still in an aircraft blast, however melodrams involving James Stewart and Vera Miles wife just come by the way (Miles had a habit of spitting spouse wife under duress, and her nervous nerves came here right on schedule). The director of Mervyn LeRoy helped the adaptation of Don Whitehead's book, but despite the talent involved, the picture failed to make much of an impression. Best performances turned into Murray Hamilton as Stewart's partner, however most of the dialogue is funny and the dogged doggy rhythm seems twice as long as it is. * 1/2 from ****
