Vincente minelli films are usually worth your time; Meet me in St. Louis, the Bad and the Beautiful. I was expecting this movie with great interest. But what a disappointment. <br /> <br /> Some run Run is scenes after the scene goes-now fatalism. Sinatra is a sad back, back from the war to find relentless family relationships, a disappointing floating hanging on it, living in disappointing excavations as a convincing gal will end his disappointing project. The film has a great dramatic end to which a cruel mechanic catches up with Sinatra and MacClane and something disappointing is happening. The sequence is intended for tension-filled but Minelli has no Hitchcock; It becomes so distracted by beautiful colors, it does not notice the scene is a clich√© pull and the characters are so thin-trained and poorly developed we do not particularly care for getting injections. (especially MacClane) but the only real movie is in the project. Otherwise we look at characters constructed standing around bars and living rooms on each other's nerves for two hours. Hell is others, apparently. <br /> There is nothing going on in this movie. The dolphin of the soldiers returns to the displacement and indifference following the WW2 to handle more dexterously in the 'best years of our lives.' With either of Inge's products, the 'Grass' Splendor and the 'Picnic' covered the despair of being trapped in a dead-end city, and much more poignant.
