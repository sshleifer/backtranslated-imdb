As if the scenario was not depressing enough, this film shows the cows were clogged graphically in a slaughterhouse for all five minutes while the protagonist tells his early life as a butcher. Strange thing. Then there's the basic premium of the hero / heroine who goes and cut his dick because he's been besot ten and at work he would go with him if he was a girl. Is this person a psycho, a masochist, just an ending queen who takes things too far away? And what sort of traumatic childhood did he have? Just that he did not get adopted and lived it out with the nuns who first loved him and then later hated him because he was disobedient. He tries to explain why he did what he did, but it really is really difficult to empathize. These sad and unusual ones. Was it supposed to be funny? What was it all about really?
