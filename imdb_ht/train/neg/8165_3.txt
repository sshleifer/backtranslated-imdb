It's a ghost story. It's a cannibalism story. It's a story of revenge. It's a very bad movie to do with a lot of violence. I suppose it follows cheaply on the lines of each slasher movie you've ever seen. It has the usual place to isolate, fellow comrades, titles in the desert. Granted, some very intense scenes. It's just so dull. Bad correction with all their work. There are ghost kids who sound like they are talking in a wasted world. I'm not really sure that the ghost rules and the psycho and the kid's seed are playing by. She also had the gross scene out of which a man ate a piece of meat that is actually what remained in his wife. A friend of mine once asked me why it is necessary to show this kind of gratuitous, sick violence. I'm afraid it's just another step in evolution of our descent. Three no intelligence here, there is no tongue in the cheek, only a sad garb of time. Many blood; small draw.
