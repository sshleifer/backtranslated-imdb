Given the story of the director of this film, it's hard to believe that this was such a dangerous movie bad to sit down. I was at European premiere last night and one of the executive producers was there. He still saw the movie and, boy, he was in for a surprise. I have not read the book that's based on, nor I know if it's highly rated or appreciated, but I read "Captain Correlli's Mandolin" and to give as badly was adapted for screen and how bad this movie was, I can only assume that something similar happened here. The act was not wrong albeit that there was a couple-too-many raised eyebrows from Farrell. Honestly, I can not believe how little I care for any character in this movie. Situation plays out on the screen in an empty sequence of anything. Donald Sutherland's party includes a few scenes where he opens a door, says something and closes it. I kept looking at my look when I was not cringing in the dialogue on the screen. I never walked out on a movie but I was tempted to start it during this. I gave this movie a note of '2' for similar reasons horrendously my fundamentally, but these are the best things I can say about this movie. The first is that I really enjoyed the all-short-short earthquake scenes and the second is that Salma Hayek got naked and looked nice. I can say something positive about this movie. Do not ask the dust anything, it can not speak!
