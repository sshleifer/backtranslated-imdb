** They may include Spoilers ** A dude in a Kong-looking costume (the same used in King Kong VS. GODZILLA in 1962) provided much of the laffs in this very-mock flick monster. Kong resurrects on Mondo Island and helps out the hero's heroes and other good guys around this time around. Vampire is like the villain named Dr. Who - funny, does not look like Peter Cushing! Kong finally dukes it out with Who's proud and happy, a giant robot giant that looks like a bad metal sculpture in Magilla Gorilla. Like many of Honda's flicks this might have been some merit before American audiences diddled around and added new footage. The Rankin / Bass animation company had a hand in this mess. They should be attached to higher-school programs such as the Little Boy Drummer.
