When I saw the movie preview I thought it might be dumb, but it will at least be funny. Well I was wrong. Even though a deeply-paced producer had an interesting message to tweet about the parents being left alone and re-evaluating their lives, the way they tried to deliver this message was terrible. The first time fifty times a funny thing happened to the couple was relatively funny. But in the end, I could almost predict what is absolute sort that will happen next. <br /> Throughout the movie I like a total of perhaps five lines of dialogue and everything else was at best, which is still much more than I can say for the movie itself.
