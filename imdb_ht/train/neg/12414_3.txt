Jennifer Jason Leigh and Mare Winningham are a good match showing many different siblings, but only Winningham is able to bring something compelling or considerate in his role. Leigh, playing low-band singer and alcohol in Sadie Flood, constantly relying on the greatest six Georgia, a popular acclaimed singer of Joni Mitchell's mummy. Perhaps due to her double duty as co-producer on the film, Leigh seems to have box itself in a corner: it's not credible as a singer, and, though this is intentional, it gives herself extra time screens in the microphone. Probably hoping for a two-force trip, Leigh is thread-drawn and nervous and sharp; However, we simply do not see any talent of this character (Leigh is obviously a solid actress, but it makes the decision here that our wall cuts out of it). If Sadie was even better in charisma or appeal, we might be able to buy at the concept that she (small) breaks that she does. As it is, the chance to ever get up on stage is thin. Director of Ulu Grosbard crafted a few dramatic intense sequences, with the correction in the final Sadie's juicepap performance bar and show selling ground in Georgia - both singing the same song - and it's a sad moment nuanced ... but really what's the point? * 1/2 from ****
