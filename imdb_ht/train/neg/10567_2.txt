I thought this film seemed to be a case study for not making a movie for the most part. Since I'm a movie maker, I give it a 2 consistency. The problems remain from the beginning ends with the plot being highly predictable using bits and pieces at most, if not all, before successful war history. The computer generated graphics was too much like watching a video game at points and it seemed that no attempt by the director to add some realistic quality to the story. I was interested in the budget for finding an idea about what he worked with, but did not get this information. <br /> It seems like this project pushes the boundaries of a too low budget film that can result in a production aimed at the viewer and the story without the imagination being engaged. The actors were not bad, but the draw needed more innovation.
