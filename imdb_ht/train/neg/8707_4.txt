This is one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. I rent it as a joke, hoping to get a giggle from the first few scenes, and let me just say I never laugh so hard in my life. The first scene where ninjas randomly pop out of the air and start a great battle with fire ridiculous is one of the most incredibly funny comic moments in my life. This is not a dinosaur movie, but more a movie that makes fun (and does not mean at all) in the genre of action. I did not see the first two, but judging by the complexity of the draw, I do not think there's much I missed. If you want to see a movie that goes great with a six pack or any herbs, than I insist you rent this movie and sit back and watch a 100 years of cinema advancement to get drowned in the trash and get shat on not carnosours
