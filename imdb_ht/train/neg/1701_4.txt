David Brite and Scramble Draws on South Park presents us with a nightmare of disturbing limits on suburban middle-class families. The father is a gruesome monster with three teeth and a large circular hole-hole from which the most horrendous sounds, the sounds and the moments are permanent fears, incoherent creatures are a way of life. A number of equally absurd characters are presented throughout the series. <br /> <br /> Lynch is not famous for its comedy (ie on the air, the wild aspect of heart), and I'm not particularly fond of comedy in general. However, there was a couple of scenes in Dumbland that made me laugh loudly. Some clever bits of animated cinematography - where Lynch translates wide chains in reaction to his character in a synthetic arrangement of vaccines as opposed to facial expressions (which never really vary in Dumbland). <br /> I believe Lynch was really trying to give his audience a straight-forward, if disturbing, comedy hosted here. Interestingly, he chose to follow in the traces of the last wave of ultra-low film humor (that is what Will Will Farrell film) while adding elements of vicious social criticisms with comical classic and gross-like humor. While the mix does not really work very well here, it is nothing if Lynchian. <br /> <br /> Worth seen by Lynch fans.
