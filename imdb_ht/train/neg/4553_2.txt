I read the Book of Celestine Prophecy and was looking forward to seeing the movie. Be advised that the film is wounds based on the book. Many of the most interesting points the book does not even come from the movie. It's a "B" movie the best. Many events, characters, how the characters communicate and meet in the book simply change or do not happen. The flow of events in the book are very smooth, they are chewing and eating the look as if you are a kid. Development of the character is very poor. Personnallities of characters are different from those in the book. The direction is similar to a horror movie "B". I understand that it would take six hours of film to present all the contents of the book, but to play screen screens missed many points. The casting was very good.
