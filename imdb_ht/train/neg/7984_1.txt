Too high line draws without a primary. Too many hot pots are pushed for no reason, they have been managing this boring film, which does not say anything, and all the drama elements that are there: death, divorce, money problems, parenting issues, suicide, psychological problems, drug abuse, adoption, rejecting love, travel problems, gender, generation misunderstandings, theft, legal issues, weapons, medical ethics, "great love"? You would think it would make for an exciting movie, but hell does not ?? All these events are high in one of the main things that are not there. Boring. Not to mention that "super-deep" conference (and super-long) gives the child the end of the movie is a total nonsense. Mercy. <br /> Oh, forget to mention: the actors, all of them, are good. That was holding me out of his turn. Bad talent went to garbage, the film is well shot, too: the light, etc. in motion in every episode - that's all in place. That's just the meaning missing.
