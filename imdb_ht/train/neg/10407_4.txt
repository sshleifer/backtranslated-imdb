I found tremors 4: The legend begins, to be dull and boring.All the action scenes were stupid. The so-called "GRABOIDS" is reduced to the size of a modern day cat cat, if not least. The action was horrendous, and this film was just an unnecessary film of the Tremor Legend, because even though it tells the story of how the graboids were formed, the story is so dumb and useless. Also, if you mean a story back In time, make sure you use the same ACT (Michael Gross), to be someone in the past, when it is someone in the present in the movies other movies.Geez ... If you have not seen this movie Do not waste your time.Stick Tremors, 1, 2, and 3, for a good time. This movie however, make sure you're remote to sit right next to you with the STOP button working for a quick withdrawal away from this nonsense.
