I saw many bad films. Most of the time I can enjoy a ridiculous movie movie for what it is. But this really takes bad things in new extreme. <br /> It is bland, the plot for what it never really goes anywhere and it takes its time on it. There is no trauma, no horror, no suspense, just a charge of guy rubbing their heads for an hour and a half and then a quick finish. <br /> <br /> A blight on the cheat horror genre, avoiding all costs. <br /> <br />
