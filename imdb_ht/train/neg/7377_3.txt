Even though the plot was very well-detailed, and the story line was understood by the fact that Steven Seagals voiced armed with some of the other people from most of the movie was distressed as you were finished who spoke. There were many parts where he would begin to speak in his deep racepy voice and then the next some someone else's voice made the talk for him. I do not know the reason however if he had difficulty with his voice during film production I think they might have shot in the events that did not have his own voice when he recovered. I rated this movie 3 out of 10 based on the quality of the movie. When one pays for a movie whether it's in the theater or on DVD movie is not worth the admission fee charged. I was a longtime follower of Steven Seagal and his movies that she did over the past years. For the date I think this is one of the worst we've ever seen
