I'm not a big fan of the slapstick stooges, but I find the interesting stories. I recently tried to check out items from every Stooge era, but the opportunity to see Joe's shorts do not seem to become easy; This is the only one I've seen too far. <br /> <br /> Some say the quality issues and Joe-era shorts are really not Joe's fault, and I suspect that in the case. Joe as a scene is far from the worst thing about it. The thing that bothered me most was being pointed out in another comment: The pitting of the other guys against the third violated the entire comedian-team / Stooges ethos. Maybe Joe's style was known, not those in charge, like not really tight in - though there was no real conflict in camera between him, and the others - and this was the way to work around that. /> And what's the title of this and some of the other Stooges late shorts? Definitely a lack of creativity goes on there; Was that sort of thing the cause or the effect of the market wipe shorts?
