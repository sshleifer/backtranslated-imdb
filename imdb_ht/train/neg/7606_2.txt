Beverly Garland was born in the wrong time. He was an actress ahead of his time, bringing power and favors even cops as blame as the Corman movies she starred in. In Gunslinger, she is the wife of the city sheriff. He gets away, so he takes on his job to pursue his bloodthirsty. It's better than the material it works and, by far. The film is gray, vibrant, and mostly boring. There are some humor moods (unintentionally) humor and rubber tracks everywhere, people are pursuing a building to emerge suddenly before another (I've heard of fronts, but this is ridiculous!), And the line really stupid at the new sheriff Widow fell in love with the guy to kill him. Even though she did not love her husband, she was only something like a week or two since she would die! And he ends up the guy to death in the end, anyway. No luck with men, this one. <br /> <br /> The villain of the piece is another woman, the saloon owner. It's planning to buy up a bunch of land just in case the railroad goes and makes it rich. Plan it in action if it is not very blame-she'll just steal as much from the city as it can and skedaddle. Hell, it's just her and she hurts weapons to the end against an entire city. Do you tell me these people are not armed? Watch what happened in the real city of the Old West when bank robbers came to rob the bank, then they were cut to a hail in the town's harmless and dangerous town. <br /> <br /> There are lots of freeways talking and climbing around, interspersed with a few lame outs. The finish is as mad as usual in a flick of Corman movie, although thankfulness it lacks the proselytizing morale at the end of what it has to conquer the world. The Sheriff turned his badge into Sam Bass and rides at the sunset, although the film was so gray that you never saw the sun.
