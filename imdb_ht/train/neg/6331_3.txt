Mr. Mike was probably the most memento comedy of all time, so I was interested to see what he would do with a total creative control over a movie. Unfortunately, it is inactive, but not because jokes are not funny - some (I will not say much) of them, and in fact Mr. Mike has done a great job to translate his mentally unbalanced screen into visual gags. The problem is that the technical quality (simultaneously, lighting, sound, correction, or name) so God-terrible, the film is intolerable. Some outfit called "PKO Productions" gets credit products, but does not look at all products; It looks more like Mike stole one of the cameras from the SNL series and did everything around an afternoon. I realize Mike's goals are the turtle audience, but even deserve some basic standards, such as ability to actually see, hear, or understand what is supposed to be shocking. Still, the DVD is not a total waste: it includes an eulogy for O'Donoghue by Bill Murray and the three "Dear Mike Dear Dream Sleep" from SNL. Plus, the "swim cats" section of the movie is a great scene to keep watching if you want to freak out someone. 3/10
