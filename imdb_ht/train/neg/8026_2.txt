He only wondered how this show is always on the air. There were only one couple living together, married, and having children, but everyone else was broken. What's the point to continue this? The show can be fun at the start. You see all the girls swooning about one person, which almost all of them as immediately. That's just like in real life! Girls are beginning to take place, bitch another out, and show their true self (or to think). But one person is left to decide who chooses to think he can get married and live happily ever after. <br /> <br /> What Love Really Exactly? How can you fall for someone when you are forced to choose? This show is incredible. You thought dating online was bad, but who has to go on television to find love? It's not realistic. How should a girl be with a man when it comes out with several others, making out with them? None of these questions are answered, and finally when the show ends, you know there will be a happy ending of the future. For all we know, everything is scripted.
