I agree that if this story by Melville just might be unfilmable, this is not even a credible attempt. To move the story of the 20th century just outraged the original story's intentions and natures; Maybe you might have been able to move it to England, but it must be a piece of period. Even our story story - the proprietor - says it's a flashback, going back even further, somewhere around 1800. By the end of the 19th century, a disrespectful worker would be abandoned without a thought. And the 20th century? Come! Give me a exploit break clear! Even around 1800, these behaviors did not work very well, in view of the finish. With the end of the movie? I do not know what it was, because I did not look the whole travesti - I stopped. This was like setting "Streetcar Desire" in Elizabethan England.
