Chilly, alienation adaptation of Rebecca West's book on a Captain Army returns to the WWII Duty and Memory (now there's an original idea!). He seems to remember the old flame Glenda Jackson but not current wife Julie Christie, which would be enough to put in some emotional sparks. This very well-rounded combination brings together the leading man Alan Bates and director Alan Bridges and co-stars Jackson, Christie, Ann-Margret, and Ian Holm, but burners are all on the bar. There are a handful of good scenes (particularly whenever Jackson is on screen), but Bridges' rhythm is sluggish and the dulled-out movie is enervating. Long on the shelf, this "soldier" best left to forget. * 1/2 from ****
