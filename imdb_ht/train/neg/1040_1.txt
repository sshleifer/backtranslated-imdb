I can not believe that this movie managed to get such a high rating of 6! It is barely looking and incredible boring, certainly one of the worst movies I've seen in a long, long time. <br /> In a no-budget way, she reminds me of star wars episode I and II for the absolute impression that you are watching a total creative train collar. <br /> <br /> This movie should be avoided at all costs. It's one of those "movie festivals" that only please pseudo-intellectuals because they have so badly made those people think it makes it "different", so good. Bad movie-making is not "different", it's just bad movie-making.
