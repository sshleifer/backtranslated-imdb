Company Robert Taylor (as Terry) is "dizzy, slap-happy" and can not be seen right on otherworldly Norma Shearer (as Consuelo). "It makes the sun shine, even when it rains," Mr. Taylor explains. But Mr. Taylor gets a ball in her throat every time she gets near Ms. Shearer. Finally, in Palm Beach Shearer Casinos, Taylor proclaims "I love you!" Shearer haul her, as she engages George Sanders (like Tony). However, to resolve a gambling debt, Taylor's employee Shearer poses as "her cardboard lover", making Mr. Sanders jealous. This film title invites obvious and inappropriate three-word review: "It's Cardboard Movie". She is most notable as the latest film appearance for Shearer, one of the largest stars in the world from "She's Slapped" (1924, Playing another Consuelo) to the "Women" (1939). To be fair, this was likely the kind of movie Shearer MGM believes audiences wanted to see. However, the party is unflattering. <br /> <br /> Hacking and walking, Taylor and Shearer were the best of the "escape" (1940). If Shearer continued, she might become an actress better than "leading lady"; Apparently, he was not interested, and certainly did not need the money. Taylor had a big scene, recipes by Christina Rossetti in "When I Die, My Dearest" while threatening to jump from Shearer's balcony, as directed by George Cukor. <br /> <br /> **** Her Cardboard Lover (6/42) George Cukor ~ Norma Shearer, Robert Taylor, George Sanders
