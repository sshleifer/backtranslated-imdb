Stop complicated and drab. I'm a bright guy, but that's just too much for a tired brain. It would really benefit from some early indications about who these people are and what they are doing. Probably better for the U.S. market. GC herself hinted that this alone did not give her Oscar, and you can see why. <br /> Always the sand dunes are beautiful. The pull nail is embarrassing. Attorney's drinking father is a mystery. The cricket is good to see. <br /> <br /> Very difficult to write the necessary lines ten on this, despite being over 2 hours long. Thanks to the skies they are shorter. Admittedly we did not find the many photos, but the last movie we saw, the Walking Line was 10 times better and I do not really like Johnny Cash. My wife says George always looks good with the beard and a few extra pounds so have that ..... I almost have yet? <br /> <br /> How about now
