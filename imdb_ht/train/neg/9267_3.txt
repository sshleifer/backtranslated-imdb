After the already disappointing "Final Conflict", the rock hit rock bottom and this very weak fourth entry. At least the third movie tried (unsuccessfully) continued the story of Damien, while this one simply rehashes with copy of the idea from the "Ommen" (the scary animals of the Antichrist, the death of one man is similar many and the death of photographer in the first movie). But what's interesting and creative to look like just dumb here. And the little girl seems simply like a spoiled kid.
