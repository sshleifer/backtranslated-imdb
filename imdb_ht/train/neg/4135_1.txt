This movie was so bad I had to fast forward in it to get to the good bits. Hah That Good Bits The only bit that was worth it ended (those who saw the movie will know what I mean). I hope a lot of this movie like a midfielder meets the early dawn of meeting Freddy vs Jason but what I got was this crap. History was forgettable, the cast was used seriously with what was thought to the director when he did. This could be a great but I turned out to be the worst movie I ever watched. OK so what if there was a nice bit of T and A, I was after the gor and I was annoying shame. Do not expect a good movie, but if you want a bad cheese cheese then do not all mean this look and see how a horror movie should not do.
