A family of terrible people must stay in a house for a week or else they will lose their legacy that will go to the servants who will only get their heritage if they agree to stay on and keep the house in order. Dead people (and so you'll be if you try to sit in this) If you've ever had any desire to see bad actors - many and ill fitting danre-acting or trying to act in a bad movie horror this is your chance. This is just awful. It was so bad I thought Al Adamson, one of the worst directors ever, ruled it, but I was wrong. <br /> So I do not mean anything more about it, not because it's not nice, but because once I start I can not stop. <br /> <br /> Avoid
