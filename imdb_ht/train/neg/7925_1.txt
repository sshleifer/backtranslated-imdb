Want a great recipe for failure? Take a s **** y scheme, add to some weak, completely unfolding characters and spend cast in the worst special effects a known horror movie. Leave broth for a week (the amount of time probably has made this waste). The result is mill grinder, a movie that takes bad movies where dangerous and exotically low. <br /> <br /> The movie completely blown. My words can not convey how painful it was. This is not one of those bad movies that you and your friends can sit around and make fun of. This is not Plan 9 in outer space. This is a long, boring, sad garb of time. Corpse Grinder II is the biggest waste of energy and talent I have ever seen. I depress me when I realize that people actually took time out of their life to act in this shit, if you can call it act. But, again, when you have poor direction, poor history, poor things, acting is the last thing to criticize. <br /> <br /> This movie is like a torn, torn lousy that you crave to quickly out of existence, fearing that a friend or someone likes to somehow view it. I really and I could somehow destroy all copies of this movie, so it will not disturb the minds of aspiring filmmakers. Thanks, Ted V. Mikels, to give me new respect for each movie I've ever seen. You showed me what is really terrible, and why I should appreciate all those movies that are simply crappy or boring.
