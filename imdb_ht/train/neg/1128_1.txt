This movie was one of the worst I've ever seen. Most drivel. How can someone develop a connection to the heroine, or have sympathy for her, is beyond me. I felt like I was looking at a story of someone who had a disorder and borderline personality disorder. Just awful. In her most generous light, this can be seen as an attempt to produce and film "art" - except I could not, for the life of me, to find any art in it at all If this woman lived in Today's world, it would earn a mental institution and provide a couple of days of treatment with anti-psychotic medicine. That, or simply allow them to roam the streets and become a woman bag. Why other characters from this movie get anything collected in it - and tried to help him in his quest to become an actress - speaking more of the pathologies than any convincing feature he had made him worth the effort.
