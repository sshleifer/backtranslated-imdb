But again one of the most misunderstood goddesses in my country was twisted by "Westerners" who can not understand the esoteric symbolism of the goddess in black form. The mother takes on the fearful form of Kali Mata to destroy our inner spirit, and our eagle fear. Even though without sacrificing to Kali and Durga, the events shown in this film are just absurd. The mother takes on an angry fury to be bad on interior demons, boundaries, and ego when no other form will suffice. It's also in the form of her anger that it burns away all your Karmas in the fire "Smashan" that you cultivate in your heart so it's dance if you love it, and it will bring you into reality and truth. Reality and truth have a black side as well as light, which serves a purpose. Mother is the embodiment of the Physical Universe as well, it is nature. Nature can be cruel and destructive to maintain balance. You can not have growth and life without death and destruction. Kali represents destructive forces for growth and life of both worlds and spiritual in the universe. It's very outrageous to me that people who know nothing in India or divinity can just take one of our dear goddesses and use it as a cheap whore to make some low-budget, talented movies. How to dare to take our beloved Mother and show it as a horror that makes people cut the bridles off! It is only awful to those who attach to the months and who live in arrogance, greed, anger, and other interior-spirits. It is very clear to me that the person who wrote this film must have a very serious self-deaf ego, and serious interior-the spirits see Kali as terrible and terrible. When the month goes down it becomes a form that is breathtaking, beautiful, and young, a beauty that is so enchanting to see that it enchants the whole universe with it. Kali Maa is an ancient mother, not to be trifled and for the sake of entertainment, let's just hope that in her endless compassion and mercy she does not take the form of anger and those involved with this movie. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It can not be understood, is totally ridiculous. It is clear that there is no respect for what people live, breathe and believe when it comes to these types of flicks. <br /> <br /> Kali Maa in reality is a caring mother and compassion, whom we shed tears of delight in devotion and love for. And I am happy that my mother takes in the form of anger sometimes protects her from herself and from outside force. <br /> <br /> Many praises to the real Kali Maa, who showed the way God's ways and realization.
