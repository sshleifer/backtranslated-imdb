You really should not be so negligent with your stuff. <br /> <br /> Girl: Yeah, whatever. <br /> Crash! Boom! Who! Krake ?? Baskets: I think something bad is about to happen. <br /> <br /> (later) Basket: MMM. Vicodin! What ?? ? (Tears open letter.) Wow! Writing my writing has really improved. And look, her missing daughter looks a bit like the girl and the doll I accidentally was sort of responsible for getting killed, in a way. And then it's kind of my pearls.

Honey is not a plant, though. <br /> <br /> (On the Greensward) Willow: Oh, yes, and I'm sorry, you're my dad's father, Conan, he, I mean Rowen. (Yawns.) I could stay and have had a life with you. But I did not. I wanted to be Princess in the BEEHIVE, rather. I mean, never mind. (Nod slash, wake-ups, eyes usually for proportions of anime). Mwah, bo bo. Love ya! What did we talk about? Baskets: Who burns it? Who burns it? Who burns it? Who burns it? Who burns it? Willow: Edward. Snife. Blink. Why. Did. You. Yelling. In. I '? Is it because I jacked your Vicodin? Snife. Snore.

Do not Cher Cher's throw in the face of Moonstruck? (Lick mouth.) Banana: I was about to ask you the same. Where's the girl? Sister Summersisle: How do you hover over. Let's talk about the meaning of my wastefulness. " Baskets: Watch out for semi-truck barreling in our direction! Aaaaah! Oh. Never mind. Goddammit! (Pops another tablet.) Mmmm. Thorazine. <br /> <br /> (Back in the Bistro) Big-Boned, gorgeous beaver: I tried Weightwatchers, Jenny Craig, South Beech, and I still got a bears-stock size since last year. <br /> <br /> Tree-called crown: HAHAHA. All the best to roast that the skirt is, dear. <br /> <br /> Basket: That was the last straw that broke the Basket back! Take that, walk! (Jar.)

Can you hear me now? I'm ready to close. Goddammit! (Six months later) Voluptuous attendance at modern-day slutty attire: I was told that eponymous baskets can take me with him. <br /> <br /> Innocent Honey Bees: I love to help people. /> Volontuous wench: Then make me out of my contract for the end! I think something bad is about to happen. EEEEE!
