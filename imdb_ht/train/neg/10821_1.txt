I read the novel 'Jane Eyre' for the first time back in 1986. It was round that time that I saw the BBC version with Timothy Dalton and Zelah Clarke. It was an excellent version and much like the book. Years later, I watched this version and was frightened. William Hurt is totally miscused as Mr Rochester. Mr Rochester is a passionate character, where as William Hurt shows him as a block of ice. The same goes for Charlotte Gainsborough. It was like watching two zombie together. This is story about love and passion, but I could not see it in this version. No, go back to the BBC version. A wonderful time guaranteed.
