It definitely fits the time period as the Axes & Allies have played spying games throughout most of North Africa and the rest of the world. It's not the best of film, but certainly not the worst of the budget films as described already in the compilation of the Classics War. Duncan "Cisco Kid" Renaldo was actually pretty good at one of his first feature films. I really enjoyed the performance of Harry Parke (credited as Parkyarkarkus). Why he never has any major role is beyond me. He plays the role of good friend / partner and saves the movie ... imho. As said, this movie was part of a budget package from Superbox-Mart entitled War Classics. Eight cinemas for eight bucks, including other never-heard-out films that have some decent stars trying to pay the bills. <br /> <br /> This script is ... well, not so hot. The correction and movies are ... worse. If you can not pass all that and want to see the Cisco Kid's future & a great sidekick that sadly never fulfilled his true potential, definitely pick it up! Otherwise, there are other WW2 films to watch. <br /> <br /> -Thunderossa.
