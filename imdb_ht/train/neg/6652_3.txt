This was a strange kind of movie about a low life in New York City and centered around a main character (the title titled, played by Brad Pitt) who thinks he was called Ricky Nelson-type musician, except that he has no real talent. <br /> It's kind of fun to look for a New York city-type type of diabetic and horrible accents to enter the picture and take on. Who loses the movie for me. It must have been Catherine Keener, who usually plays hard and garbage women. <br /> <br /> The hairstyle on Pitt - an exaggerated Pompadour - was fun to look at. I can picture Johnny Depp playing this role best. A recent note: it's odd to hear a movie made in 1992 (other than Woody Allen) and just sound sound.
