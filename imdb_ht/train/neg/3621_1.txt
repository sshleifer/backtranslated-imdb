I hate this show when I was a kid. That has returned to the day when children show characters actually have been accentuated, not only bland, generic, General American dialect we are using. Jack Wild had a British accent and the Pufnstuf was south. Like one of the others mentioned, though, I never quite understood what the deal was with the witch wants the flute. That always seems to me impressive, probably because the flute just harassed me and I would not go into any trouble to take it away! <br /> Just a comment on the similarity of Pufnstuf's early 70s McDonalds advertising that others have mentioned: Pufnstuf worn off McDonalds. At the height of McDonald's popularity, the television show (or rather, the creators) sought McDonalds character licenses for their show, but when McDonalds refused to show TV change the characters a little and passed it as their own. They even hire senior staff at agency agency McDonalds and the voice actors performing TV shows. McDonalds sued and won. Search for Pufnstuf McDonaldland trial and you will find lots of items on it.
