Student college Alex Gardner (Nicholas Celozzi) is the worst nightmare of a ghoul plot in Alcatraz. He dreams of cutting his own hands, spitting up a worm, a ghoul vaccine opened his chest and was roasted on an open fire. After his friend saw him levitating "6 feet" on his bed, a helpful, occult-obedient teacher (Donna Denton) suggested that sneak around Alcatraz facing his fears. Of course they go to the night when no one is around to help when things get out of hand! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Toni Basil's "Mickey" fame portrayed as the useful ghost of Sammy Mitchell, lead singer of the band "Bodybag". He teaches Alex how to get out of his body and performs a rock music dance music with footnote repeated pad out the running time. All of the victims show up as crowded ghosts and a Griffin Dunne character in a US WEREWOLF in London. The script is all drawn sketch, cheesy dialogue and white tune in comedy. Good FX works with fresh open credit (both by Ernest D. Farino) are the only things to take out any merit. Basil and Devo ("Whips") make some songs on the soundtrack. <br /> Score: 2 out of 10
