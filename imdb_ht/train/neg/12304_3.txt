I watched this film last week and was the biggest laugh I had in a long time. The plot of the movie is very mute and entangled in a hearty manner. The only one to be found anywhere in the film is the absorption of Corey Savier's abs. Alexandra Paul (I think it's his name) is horrendous as the wife of the preaching with a depression story. Ted McKenzie is gross and his character has a twitch on his head. And as if the fact that you think he had sex with his son is not enough, they are cast into socially wise sages of all opportunities! The end and the highest point in this film is absolutely abysmal and also sad. I mean where the hell wants to bring the child to a con who tried to make you think it was your son and that you had an unstoppable relationship with him!
