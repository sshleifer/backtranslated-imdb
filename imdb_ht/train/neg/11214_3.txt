I also saw this movie in a local screening over a year ago. First, I'll say it looks great. Cassella is incredibly talented and a fantastic kinematographer. I just want the movie was as good as it looks. I would not call this a horror movie. Put in a few shots of a rotten ghost by making it a horror movie. There is no mystery, no suspicions, you know who does it all the time. <br /> <br /> It's a drama. You know what's going on both sides of the entire movie. The act was okay, I guess, but nothing special. <br /> And the slogan, "Revenge can be dangerous" .... really? ... should have checked how many hundreds of horrors / comets has that exact same slogan? <br /> It's my pain to say some of this, but I know a lot of people who worked on this movie, and I know they do not want people blowing smoke up the ass, so I give honest opinion .
