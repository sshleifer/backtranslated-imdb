It seems that the intention of the film has shown the aggressive (mafia-loving) character of Russia, or at least in those Russians can travel outside the big countries; that it is too easy to rob a bank in England; and that the British police are so ineffectual that it can not find people who steal the bank even when these subjects are leaving the country by air. In addition, Nicole Kidman and colleagues assumed Russian spoke a language that is not yet identified anywhere, probably spoken by foreigners in the Ural Mountains but far to be the Russian one. So, Nicole, if you really want to speak Russian, kindly go to Moscow or St. Petersburg and keep yourself busy learning language grammar and its pronunciation.
