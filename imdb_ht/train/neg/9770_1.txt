This is the version that the same author hates, because it's so schmaltzy. They gave him a 'happy ending' and changed a lot of the dialogue, and it's just a big pile of sacraments. The 'Step Manager' is quite good, I believe it comes out of the role, but everyone else falls into that style acting in the 40's that's really just posing. A great feature - the music. This has one of the best scores ever recorded, and it's worth looking at a record store. Overall I think 1989 Spalding Gray / Eric Stoltz / Penelope Miller version is far superior.
