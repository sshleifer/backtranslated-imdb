I bought this movie on DVD so I could get an episode of Mystery Science Theater 3000. Fortunately, Mike, Crow, and Tom Servo are watching, because the movie itself is not. Although there is a conspiracy, a story someone can follow, with a few actors who can act, nothing else. The movie was so boring, I was well upset that I would never look it again without Tom, Crow and Mike. As summarized above, however, it was better than the featured movie in the previous MST3K episode; Mitchell.
