SUKS. That's all I got to say about this excuse to regret for a movie. Sucking. Sucking. Sucking. I mean, what the hell they thought? Identity involvement should never be allowed to make another movie. The act was so bad that it even failed to entertain on a bad level. The attempt at a "lesbian scene" was sad. I felt bad about the women involved. This movie sucks! Suck! Source! <br /> I hear rumors at an end. <br /> <br /> Help <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> All
