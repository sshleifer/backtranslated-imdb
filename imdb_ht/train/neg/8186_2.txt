Is anyone reading the script? This has to be some of the worst written and directed throughout the year. Three great actors, Paul Giamatti, Rachel Weisz and Miranda Richardson could not pull this one out. About two-thirds he looked like Giamatti's eyes said, I can not believe I signed the contract. It's not the worst movie I've ever seen, but it's really really movie movie list. Not enough lines, but what else can you say? Well, the movie just does not move Vaughn's diagnostic behavior, her character is just a creepy guy that you just can not get past. It was just a middle walk, that no one seemed to be able to enter.
