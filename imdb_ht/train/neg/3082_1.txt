Good Lord, what they thought ... !!!!!! Here is your spoiler abortion, though I do not think it will really matter. You will not see this piece of trash anyway. <br /> A group of handpuppets goes chasing after a really stupid group, who goes to a really stupid hunt to try and kill them, and the puppets complicate things by letting them live out really stupid imagination them. In other words, the whole thing is really stupid. <br /> You know it must be wrong when Mike and Bots can not save anything! And they did not! I know, some of the lines were funny, as those added to the sign "HIT" and the comments but, but, geez, this was very dang sad. <br /> All I can say is NOT WATCH THAT THE CRUD. It does not have any signs for you.
