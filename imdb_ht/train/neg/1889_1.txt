This film is in no way entertainment, but more to a deep look at the depths of the dark side of human behavior. Injuries involving a half a dozen stories of the worst kind of degradation, perverted gender, greed, violence and intolerance. All the action played out on very hot and sticky days during a heatwave in Vienna and the heat is perhaps responsible for some of the anger and hatred of the movie. For me the treatment of the delayed girl of the safety equipment seller was on the worst episode, well followed by the scenes of drinking and perverting of the 'slags' flats. You will be gripped and I hope to be engraved by this movie. I hated it but I felt compelled to see it. 1/10 for 'fun' 8/10 to show 'people' as it sometimes is.
