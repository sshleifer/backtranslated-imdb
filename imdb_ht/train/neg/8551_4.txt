It's 1982, two years after the Iranian embassy siege involving SAS's dramatic rescue from the balcony, and a war with Argentina on the Falkland Islands are now taking place, the best film performed by a Gung-Ho "SAS" The movie that re-writes the Iranian hostage, also using British Number One hero action of the day, Lewis Collins. Thrown off Edward Woodward and some other well-known actors and you've got a winner on your hands? ... Well maybe not! The film itself does not make the situation serious enough, also the act is quite second rate. It's like an episode long episode of the "Professionals", but without the formula. This film goes nowhere and it is quite predictable. Maybe Cubby Brocoli watched this movie and decided to fight Lewis Collins as a Allied James Bond Replacement for Roger Moore. Look at it if your fan of Lewis Collins or SAS stuff at General, if not, save your time.
