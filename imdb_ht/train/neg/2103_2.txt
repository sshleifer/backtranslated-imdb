Bela Lugosi is an evil botanist who sends brides poisoned orchids on their wedding day, steals the body of fake ambulance and hears it and takes it home to his midget assistant to extract the glandular juices in order to keep Bela's wife eternally young. Some actors second detective play attempts to solve the terrible, terrible mystery. Bela Lugosi hosted it nicely, but you could say he needed the money. <br /> <br /> This movie is quite awful, and most of the actors would be best to stick to waiting table, but the plot is pretty ridiculous. Tell anyone that's happening to it and tend to laugh quite a lot with their request to see the movie. I got the DVD in a 2 store discount for Â£ 1, which I think is a very accurate valuation, anyone paying more for this would come from their minds.
