One of the most amateur movies in computer programming. <br /> <br /> See the author that movie does not know the real specificity of world programming. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> 20 world top lineup, programs that own satellite (for which?), programs using freq satellites., Someone kills someone in flying the ropes (why? ) and many more at stupid moments in this movie. <br /> <br /> Non-programmatic countries will not see something horrible in this movie, because it's not professional. But people will not see real things. <br /> <br /> Programmer will find odd and horrible films - because many of the time inside film does not relate real life (why does not scifi film in this case?).
