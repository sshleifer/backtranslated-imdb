There is nothing worse than renting an Asian film and getting an American movie experience instead. <br /> It's only my opinion, but a good thriller is dependent on the establishment of interesting, intelligent characters. As far as liability is concerned, the protagonists say Yes is an amazing married couple. Just done. Unfortunately, they are stupid beyond belief. Let's count ways to disassociate being terrorized by a stalker. <br /> 1. After a hitchhiker threatens to kill you, be sure to tell him what your hotel will stay in when you drop it. <br /> 2. Beat the hell out of the loudspeaker in the big day and before dozens of witnesses, thereby allowing him to press charges in attack. Do not bother telling the police about the stalker and simply assume (for no apparently good reason) that the cops were bribed by him. While trying to escape, leave your lady out of your eyes as much as possible to ensure that the stalker kidnaps it. After you get help from someone to get the partner after your wife kidnapping, make sure you send them as soon as possible so you can face it one-on-one. No point of being unfair, right? <br /> Now, I would never expect that anyone should be immune to a few mistakes under the stressful conditions, but the characters in saying Yes are so dense and make so many incredible mistakes that it's effectively Impossible for the viewer to care for their safety, since they are their own victims. This kills fun in the entire movie. <br /> <br /> In the case of your request, the scriptwriter did not stop with dimly-witted characters. Since they are certainly dumb-injected to write this crapfest, they decide to make such absurdly unrealistic situations that every sense of reality goes out of the window. The Stalker killed a cop inside a police station ?? while the protagonist sleeps no more than ten feet away. <br /> <br /> 2. The stalker is engaged in all kinds of dubious activities of age and widespread people, but no one other than the married couple looks like his odious behavior. The assembly continues to live in the absence of violence that would kill anyone. "Stopping" the scenes had no imagination too. In fact, some scenes were direct rip-offs from the American cinema. <br /> <br /> Only the positive is the decapitation near the end, which was a pretty brutal scene since it has been inflicted on the wife. It's too bad filmmakers followed her with a stupid stupid ending that came out of the left field. True <br /> <br /> <br /> Surely, the Koreans are behind the iron in Yes to say they should be disappointed. Better yet, they should just go to California and take work with people who make movies with a disrespect similar to quality and intelligence.
