(SPOILERS at this) <br /> <br /> "Rosenstraße" is a movie about heroic women in the Nazi Nazi time. But it is a way too long, it does not touch and sometimes even boring! There are also many clichés and not enough good acting. <br /> <br /> The storytelling (scenario) is bad. Like in James Cameron's old woman Titanic remembers events in his life. Well, now we've had a point of view. Spend another woman is presenting the same thing. Confusion is that they both recall events in the lives of others! Come! This is a lack of knowledge in basic story telling ... How Riemann knows about the fate of the girl's mother and her interrogation for example? <br /> The scenes are shown in the wrong order and you rarely know when it took place. For example the scene when Riemann is proposing Fabian. When did this happen? The scene looks like it is set in the wines ... <br /> <br /> The character Riemann is of course a talented pianist, well, it is even a baroness! Wow. His brother returned from the Eastern Front, he received a "Ritterkreuz" which he showed in some scenes. So he is a hero of war and still a fine man who considers his conscience. And he took knowledge of massacres committed by Germans. He even did some pictures! So it goes, cliché after Kliché is stacked up and this is why the movie does not work. <br /> <br /> Basically from Trotta made a flick of chick from something that could be a decent movie. And in the end it is all very simple. Riemann finds a way to get Goebbels in bed and - would be there! - Everyone is free. Which is not a historical fact but much more imagination than the "true claim" claim at the beginning. Like "Sass" it is vaguely based on a true event. <br /> It's sad but true, this is the typical German movie these days. It's bad! Macaulay J. Connor <br /> <br />
