If you made the mistake of viewing the movie before reading the book, please do not give up on the series. I bought my first copy of any of the books in May of this year, and I'm almost finished with book 10. I dare say the movie is a piece of garbage that does not make the same series a smack of justice . While "Left Behind: The Movie" only vaguely follows the story of the "Left Behind" (the book), the characters are not even close to accurate. <br /> A few examples: Rayford never acted on his feelings for Hattie (it's about when he was informed about their disappearance); Buck Williams is a haired blonde, magazine writer, not a TV reporter; Chloe is in Stanford, and a lot of details book Rayford asks if it 'survived'; Buck and Chloe do not meet until later, at a meeting in New York, set up by Hattie; Irene and Raymie are never 'in the book,' instead of reflecting Rayford's reflex; The roads are so jam packed with debris after rapture that Rayford and Hattie have helicopters back in the suburbs ... etc., etc., etc. ... And just in the first movie; they are about to publish the third. Please, even if you did not like the movies, give the book series a chance.
