I must say that during my childhood I was very proud of a lot of movies I had rented. Exception of Being Theodore Rex. Talk about all the movie pirates time in any resume of the actor. Can you just imagine that Whole Shot Whole had to tell her to sign on this piece of crap "Hey Whoop, you ever see showing dinosaurs, yes well they're doing a movie out of it, and you get them see Germany! "After that silver should have reference to Star Wars a lot. <br /> <br /> This movie was so bad I figured Whoopie must have bought out every copy of this movie and it was destroyed. I just want he could do the same thing to my memory, because my sister always gives me crap for watching movies. I mean c'mon, I'll even admit I looked at Nanny and Kazzam in the theater (good reason why I gave up on both Hogan and Shaq for a while), yet this one beat out of my head as the worst of my kids, and the biggest regret for renting in my life, and that was 16 years ago. I'm right now if you want to do the math. <br /> Every time I think of the list of all the time in the worst movie I do not even mention this one, because as a raping child, I try hard to reprimand that it has ever happened. Take a look at Whoopie, just for those who are happy to only recognize Eddie and Sister Act 2 as your worst or hardest guys.
