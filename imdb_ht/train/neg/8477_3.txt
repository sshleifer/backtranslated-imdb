I personally hate this movie because it was predictable, the characters were stereotyped, and the whole idea was a rip off of the "Edge of Cut", and "Cadet Kelly". <br /> <br /> The main character is a snotty girl who comes to a place where she does not belong. Everywhere hates her, she makes things worse than having a hot guy who is lost by her love (well-being the school is damn all can not stop you). Amazing she finds a way to fit in and makes everyone love reading more, the guy gets head on heels in love with her. Then comes the choice, where he must choose between figure skating and hockey. He chooses hockey then he goes to the skater figures, and gets to be on the Olympic team. There is no real surprise. <br /> This whole movie was so damned predictable You knew what was going to happen before you even saw it. This was so terrible I was almost puked, and by the time I finished watching it, I had a terrible headache and encouraged to shoot myself to watch these crap. Do not watch it unless you're under ten, or actually like crazy between movies.
