Maybe I miss something because I've read something more positive about the man who cheated on himself than I read bad reviews - and I just do not get it. I love my noir having a little bit and words that speak, look, and act like Humphrey Bogart in the Big Sleep or Gene Tierney in Laura. None of the characters in this movie have that style or presence or whatever you want to call it. Take lead actors, Lee J. Cobb. Its range, roll-out-of-bed look is about as far from superbly, smooth-talked archetype as you'll find. Or, take Jane Wyatt as the femme fatally as another example. This is one of the worst cases of miscasting I've seen in a while. It is just not convinced of the role. <br /> <br /> As for the draw, it tired and miss any real surprises or anything new for the genre. I could predict the outcome of the man who was cheated after about five minutes. And that final cat-and-mouse chase scene is plain old dull. Ten to fifteen minutes of nothing than really ruined any movie rhythm may have gone for it.
