Anyone who wrote the script for this movie does not deserve to work in Hollywood at all (not even live), and those actors need to find another job. The most obnoxious hours and a few minutes in my life ... and I just keep watching them see if it would get better that, unfortunately for me it was not. <br /> Even in the end, the credit gave me anxiety. I guess there were not many people behind the movie to roll their credit slowly ... very slowly. This movie is definitely a great "How to Do a Movie" guide. Too bad I can not give a 0.
