Melissa Sagemiller, Wes Bentley, Eliza Dushku and Casey Affleck play young students at Middleton College in Middleton. The young adolescents form two loving triangles. One night during a full moon threat to drive and discuss a slippery and twisted mountain road. Not looking good to handle another car and one or more of them have been killed. The ghostly start begins ... Pretty lousy and politically incorrect flick of films without gore and nudity. It's obviously influenced by "Soul Carnival". The cinematography is decent, unfortunately there are zero 4 suspects from 10-just another instant forgettable waste-bopper garbage.
