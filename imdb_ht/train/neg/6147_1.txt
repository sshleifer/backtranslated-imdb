I really do not get any adulation that this movie has received. It's mawkish, unnecessary manipulative and dodges much of the big problems - meaning Nash's affair and predilection for sex with men in public places. That, I suppose, in the context of a commercial Hollywood movie is just about tolerable, but this and the glory of Russell Crowe's performance? The man just seems to shuffle on, hanging his briefcase and wearing a grungy hat and somehow looks alike as fine acting? Anyone who has ever known a person with mental health problems will realize that Crowe's performance is little short of caricatures. It is also rather offensive. And, dare I say, just to the right of being really awful
