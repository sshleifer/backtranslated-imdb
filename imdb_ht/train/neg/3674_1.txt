Note: I will reveal an important part of the plot, but if you've looked at the DVD cover or any promotional material, you'll already know it. This movie seems to have been written by an eleven-year-old son who is not very bright and has probably been very tired when she wrote it. The writer does not know the difference between a chemical and an organism. <br /> <br /> Forgot the fact of the UN and the NSA seems to be running the show in Hungary. Forget the fact that when these intelligence agents go crazy after someone who just touches will kill you in about a minute they do not wear protective gear (not even gloves). These are quibbles in the context of this film. In the scientific world of this story, 2 + 2 = 6.34 and gravity go sideways. The fact is that people in this movie do not (with a few exceptions) behave as they behave. Almost every time a character responds to something it is appropriate. Love stories (of course one) make soap opera screens looks like Shakespeare. <br /> I can not believe we wasted a free movie rental on this stuff.
