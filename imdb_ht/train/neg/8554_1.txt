The motion picture was, in all likelihood, made in the 1930's and released in 1931. I suppose that motion picture speech had great difficulty in making the transition from the silent era. But this particular Zane Gray draws appear very weak. Also, Gary Cooper was probably just learning to act. The result is something that would not be acceptable by today's standards. For 1931, maybe. For 2004, not acceptable. Some of the actors do well. Unfortunately, the Indians always find the short end of those early west. They lived in the country long before the white man came, but according to twisted stories, they had no right to defend themselves.
