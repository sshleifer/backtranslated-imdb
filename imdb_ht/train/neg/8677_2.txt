I loved Chiba street fighter, and I figured hey, no matter how stupid this movie will be, I'll at least get to see her kick some ass, right? Move. This is an unpleasant, sad sadness of useless talk, half-assed scriptwriting and nonsense plans. There are some action scenes of any kind, even fewer martial art scenes, and some of them being shot and edited so badly that you can not even do the things in the world that are going on. The Dub is also atrophy, and perhaps the idiosync that this film is best illustrated by the fact that it supposedly features the Italian Mafia ... ETAP are all Japanese! Avoid such an epidemic - you might see better martial arts by looking through the window in your local kindergarten class for five minutes.
