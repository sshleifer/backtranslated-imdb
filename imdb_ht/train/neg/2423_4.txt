I got this movie from a private collector and was very curious about it. It had a 7.8 in IMDb (9 votes only) and some external comments were nice. But I must say that it is a very usual and refreshing jealousy. Yes, big movies, the movie is well directed, but it never freaked me out. It starts well, but although it does not bother me at all, the story is so ordinary and things that happen so ordinary, that I did not like it very much. <br /> You can make a few laughs. And you can see some tits. But if you like the kind of juice I like (scarce, surreal, nonsense, gory, atmospheric, brutal violence ...) you will not appreciate this movie very much. <br /> I give it a 4 for good LED and editing, with the final twists, making the movie fun. But it might be best.
