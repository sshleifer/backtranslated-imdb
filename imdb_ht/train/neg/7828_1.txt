Along with 2 days in the valley, I think this is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Just another of the long line of tarantino rip-offs that has appeared since pulp fiction. The film's atmosphere creates is fun for the first five minutes, but then the movie makers make the flawless mistake of allowing fat and groteque violence to cling to the "hip" cotton. You are the best to skip this one.
