As I watched this movie I thought, OK it would get good sometime ... I was wrong. The best part of this movie was when it was over. A complete dump of 92 minutes. All the gravity aside of the best was when Wendigo finally showed up that was in the end and you could not really even see her good. And the tail end was really kind of mute as well. There were too many sections in the movie where you thought something was going to happen but was down. The worse part was to have more talk at the Wendigo then Wendigo. For the creature to be so bad, you definitely could not say it by this movie.
