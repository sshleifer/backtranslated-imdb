Not that "a film by Ulli Lommel" filled me with hope, but I must confess that ZODIAC KILLER managed to shed under my lower expectations. There is a recent trend among young filmmakers in using digital video for early projects, which are all good and good to give these kids the opportunity to create jobs without spending all their money on expensive movie stock. But many of these young filmmakers were also wised up to the notion of filtration films so that it appeared qualitatively more like seluloid. The effect is never perfect, but it helps. Unfiltered digital video really works only for the "mockumentary" style, because it never seems to be anything other than video. In lies the main problem with ZODIAC KILLER. Watching the movie feel like watching a soap opera on a bandit. He does not feel like watching a movie. And what is more detrimental is that the Lommel is NOT a young singer. He must know better. It must be known that it is virtually impossible to generate terror (or even suspense!) On video. For the love of God this guy has been ruling since the sixties! It can only be the director who failed to improve over a forty-year career in the business. And our luck, he wrote the script too! So you can expect complicated actions that mean nothing, unjustifiable behaviors, and at least a really pretentious element that will leave you completely dissatisfied. Please, please miss this movie. You will thank me later.
