This comic movie offers 1970's standards of "hippie mentality" in a black shell and our tincture into the process. It is an attempt to streamline absolute weddings of teens, innocent women aged old sex and washing ups. A young hippy hay was played by ascending-like (Kay Lenz) machki and sleeping with all the bad guys, and then one day he meets the ridiculous (Holden), already in old age, drinking fluid Hard and washed up as an actor, and she decides that she is in "love" with her. If you think that is superficial, the whole movie includes these scenes. He keeps saying how he "likes" him, he only met him, and puts thin and really quick. I could not help but laugh at the movie. Obviously it's just using it as a meal ticket but the director is immature enough to think we'll buy that there is actually any love taking place. A disgusting scene is where the two are naked and have sex, I have to be fast ahead because it almost inspires me to vomit. An incorrect offering from music from the 70's also spread to the movie. Avoid this if you can. Grade D.
