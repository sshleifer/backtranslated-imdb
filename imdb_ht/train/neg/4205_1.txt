The ALARMIS is so abysmally scripted that you have to think of yourself why the world has made an actor up and coming as David Arquette agrees to be in it. It has one of the weakest ever I've ever seen and without any humor at all, it's on the border of tedious. It staggers together in an obnoxious conclusion that appears only happen because the director was bored and just wanted to wrap up quickly in order to get home for his dinner. Stay away!
