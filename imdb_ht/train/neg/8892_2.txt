Have them admit, this version shames Shakespeare upfront! No one can act except the nurse who has been my favors! Juliet had good skills as a teen but can not give her emotional depth and we can never connect with it. It's worse to make the scene when it is gay to drink the sleep portion ... God remains whining! I would have poured it into her mouth to close her! Anthony Andrews ... yikes! Considering her other great movies (Brideshead Revisited, Ivanhoe, Red Pimpernel), it is quite a shocker of this one. And do not get me started on Romeo ... puhleasssssee! It's always good to see if you're on the hunt to see every Romeo and Juliet ever made in the story of films. Olivia and Leonard's version are still better, followed by Leslie Howard's version and then the current Leo and Clare!
