I read somewhere that when Francis refused to take a cut in pay, Warner Bros retaliated by filing it in inferior projects for the rest of his contract. He decided to take the money. But his career suffered appropriately. This can explain what he did in "Comet Over Broadway." (Even though he does not explain why Donald Crisp and Ian Hunter are in it, too.) "Ludicrous" is the word that others are used for the plot of this movie, and that's right on target. Judgment of murder. It's quilt vaudeville quarry. His success in London. His final scene with his daughter. No party logically leads to the next part. <br /> Also, along with the costumes looked like B-movie stuff. And her hair! Turner will show a lot and lots of movies this month. Look at any other thing and you will make yourself a favor.
