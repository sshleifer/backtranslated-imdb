A terrible movie that is supposed to be an independent one. He needs some addiction to something. <br /> This movie is totally miserable to deal with the interactions of Irish people. They tried to imitate the wonderful movie "Injury?" If so, this movie has crashed whole. <br /> There is just too much going on here to culminate by a little spitting running around and throwing rocks at buses and cars that obviously cause destruction. The movie is just too great to work. A woman loses her husband after 14 years to another while her younger sister is torn off by a suicide. This resulted in the ancient sister becoming a bitter vest and walking in clothes is not worth believing. The older sister also gets refreshing, but soon finds romance. <br /> <br /> Then we have 3 losers who buy a bank robbery mask. Obviously, the flight goes awry but does not seem to have any punishment for the crooks. Perhaps, the punishment should have been on the writers for failure to create a movie itself.
