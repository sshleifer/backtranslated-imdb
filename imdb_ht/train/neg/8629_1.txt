Dear Richard, I know we all loved you on Home Improvement and Tim Allen. But seriously, do you have other things to do besides air buds? I would think that Tim could actually give you a little bit now or even become his personal assistant. I know that looks like ironic, but the paid benefits are much more rewarding. <br /> <br /> Everyone would see you around Tim and immediately think "Time Tools". You would even find the role of Bob Vila more often. Instead, you appear for 10 minutes with a Golden Retriever and smile. I know there was not much of a script, but you could add to it. I mean, come on. Tim must be yours one. <br /> But badly, this movie does nothing to the Bud Air line. On the contrary, the puppies talking to pigs than actually seeing the dog play sports. The original was the best. And you, Mr. Richard Karn, know that more than anybody. <br /> This is a movie "F".
