This film has many pitfalls and everything I could see. It is painfully long and awfully direct. I could see all the hearings getting impatient and waiting to finish. Time runs is a way over 3 hours that could be edited less then 2 hours. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Transition between stories is average. Most people confessed that they were sitting waiting for something better to come out. <br /> <br /> its funny comedy only in pocket. an ambitious project with a downward execution. Govinda does a fair job, my abuser shakes me, our rest as expected. if you are waiting for nothing close to babel or love actually then it has no close location.
