This was a classic case of something that would never have been. Gloria was now a mother, her husband left her because she did not live in some neighborhoods (she was angry that Reagan was elected and wanted to turn her away from society). Right then and there I was having trouble with the series - coming up, I say to myself, is this noble Michael Stivic who has attained the right archie Bunker's zeal philosophy? The series was gone, but it just did not have any pizazz. Regardless of the momentum Sally Struthers came from all the family has long gone. Perhaps, if the series were given another name and presented as being totally independent to all of the family, it might have worked out. Ah well, this business show.
