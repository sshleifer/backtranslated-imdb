Can I please get $ 13.00 back? I would like to see "Hydro-Electric Power coming to North America". Again. This is a movie with one voice. The same voice, from every character of speech regardless of age or sex. To listen to this voice again I should charge at least $ 150 an hour. And I do not take insurance. It was strange to watch Will Ferrell morph in Woody. But I do not think imaginative casting is enough. One should wait until they have a history before they bother to make a movie. Unless it's just doing it for the money. But if it's the case why not just review an all-Rap version of "What's up Tiger Lily?"
