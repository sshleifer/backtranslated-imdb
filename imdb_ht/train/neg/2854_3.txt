Dreyfuss plays a boss crowd who loses his head, but now it's "fixed." Lane is her girl who was pity around with her Number One (Goldblum), who's supposed to have something to go with the Lane Sister (Barclain). What people might consider an all-stars throw support (Burt Reynolds, Gabriel Byrne, Kyle MacLachlan and even an appearance by Richard Pryor) can not help draw this, as Dreyfuss proves it not "fixed" and tries to kill just on everyone's eyes. <br /> You know, it's not like you did not know what was coming. The first ten minutes had nothing but the guys tried to tell Goldblum what was in store for him when Dreyfuss came out, but I'll save you all the problem: skip this movie. <br /> <br /> The real reason I chose this movie is because I was on a Diane Lane shooter recently and was trying to see all of her movies. Really left-down for me was not just the terrible draw, but also the fact that it does not show up to the last fifteen minutes of the movie (although we hear about it all in the movie). Even though a fan of more than half of the cast could not help me enjoy this movie. The parties where the suspense was supposed to be mountain to get me laugh at what was actually going on. <br /> <br /> 3 out of 10 stars.
