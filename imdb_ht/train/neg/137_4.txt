Its plain to see why the singers in scary films find it so easy to parody those movies slasher 'teen'. They are so infinitely formal. And if Valentine has released a year or so earlier, I'm sure they would have spoofing this movie too - this if they found any original material original to distinguish it from their screams, I know what you were do last summer, and Urban Legends. <br /> <br /> Valentine offers nothing new in this genre, except a better than normal finish that, of course, leaves lots of room for the inevitable end. As always, a masked psychotic killer footage of a lot of beautiful young women, killing friends the main character, one by one, usually on the top style. Many in T & A on display, there is no character development, bad acting, and overly elaborate blood flow. The thing I can not stand on these kinds of movies is that they pass themselves like 'who makes it? '. The thing is that they are not because the motif is only revealed once the assassin was unmasked, and says the main character of their friends has now all been murdered. Usually something that has never been done at all during the movie anyway (eg fishing mother's main fishing partner to kick her father's dog dog). Everyone still alive in the movie is a 'suspicious' but more 'Red Herrings' than suspect. As we all know at this point the main character manages a plausible escape and kills the psychotic demo killer after the motive appears. <br /> <br /> Valentine follows this formula almost in the letter. *************** SPOILER !!!!!! (mini beke anyway) *************** In the Valentine's motive was not revealed, but more, let you think about giving the movie was not well concluded in ' teen cut '. The problem is only partly solved, and the goal of the lead or assassin may have been fulfilled by surviving the bloodshed and killing almost everyone. Does the killer want more, or are the demons really victorious? <br /> This still did not make Valentine a good movie, instead it simply saved it from being as bad as usual, which still does not count for much. For anybody to think of doing another movie along these lines, please do not. Originality is so important, and its hard to see any originality coming from this genre.
