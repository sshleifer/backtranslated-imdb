Why movie makers always go against the author's work? I mean, yes, something to be condensed for viewing interests viewers, but look at Anne of Green Gables. They have done a great job in combining important events in a whole group that is simply delightful. I can not believe that they chose to combine three novices together for Anne of Avonlea in such an objectionable mess. Look at all they miss out on by doing so. . . Paul Irving, little Elizabeth, widow, Windy Poplars. . . and Anne's college years, for the heavenly peace !!! Would not he have been delightful to meet Priscilla and the rest of the Redmond gang? Kevin Sullivan should take things a movie at a time, instead of jumbling them altogether and combining the characters and events the way he did. This movie was good, if you left the novels out of it !! But nice job L.M. Montgomery is something that should not be denied. This film was a bit down after seeing his successful successful Anne Anne Green Gables experience.
