I also had hundreds of children's movies in the past, considering that one of the worst I've ever seen. <br /> 1) I join this day and age to explain my children to Russia is not the "bad guys". Also, mocking Russian names like "Poopchev" is inappropriate. <br /> 2) The birthday scene flying at the grandfather has a quasi-sexist joke in which she involves drinking beer boys and women talking on the phone. Two other flies also use the word "crap" twice. The whole movie was smackingly smacked in the 1950s stereotypes and propaganda that I thought we, like a nation, were proud to rise above. br /> <br /> At all it's just bit, badly animated, even more seriously written and not worth the time to see.
