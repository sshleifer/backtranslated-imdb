Well, I rent this movie because of the director ... he did some interesting flicks in the past (if you did not see your Waxork to miss a fun ride). Anyway, I had doubts about this movie in the beginning but I decided to suck it and give it a look. It's bad. Very bad. If you did not see the movie and do not mind spoiling it before them. First of all, the old saying 'You can not judge a book by it's covered' applies here. The box for this flicker film seems to indicate that Jill is the fox stone and long hair and brush. Back in the box has a cool shot of the red-yellow jill and some other shots. The description makes you want to rent the movie because it sounds good. You start to look at it and suddenly you find that the film takes place (inexplicably) in 1977. Jill is a totally dog-free dog on the cover. The movie is not as predictable as you would think ... and that's not a good thing. Characters do many stupid things without any modicum of motivation ... it's embarrassing to watch. 10 minutes before the end of the movie dolphin and another sex lady for no good reason. Also, what was the point of having Dolph killed this other cold lady who helped her. The Anthony Hickox director should see a stinker when reading the script. He was put in the midfielder of the new millennium and made the half-intelligent characters he might have been decent. They put it in the 70's make no sense and no carry on the story too. Avoid it!
