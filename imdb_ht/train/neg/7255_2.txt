I was not particularly impressed by this movie with subtle music and only 40 minutes. Thank God, because I fell asleep. I make excellent use of photography mistakes time to show the passage of time in the movement of light and shadow, people, water, clouds, etc. Unfortunately, that's all it is. <br /> <br /> My preference is for its predecessor, the excellent Koyaanisqatsi made in 1983 in 87 minutes and proves that a sequel can be better than the original, Powaqqatsi made in 1988 running 90 minutes. <br /> <br /> Try them both.
