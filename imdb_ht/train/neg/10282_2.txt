I did not expect this to be a great movie, but neither I expected it to be so awful. I hated the very mom's character I was turning the channel. I turned it back, hoping it was just a part of the movie, but no. And the daughter sitting there was harassed, or almost done out of a job, or driving in madness inside her home? Are you kidding me? I was raised in respect (and even scared) my mother, but I would put him fast at the nearest hotel if it proved annoying in my house. I was hoping to follow a set of rules in my mother's house, after all. <br /> I did not buy any of it. I tried to give several chances, I really did. Padon.
