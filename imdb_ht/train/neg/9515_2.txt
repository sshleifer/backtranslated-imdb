OK, I watched the original French version. But I can not imagine being better with subtitles. <br /> All I have to say is this is the boring movie I've seen in a long time. There is almost no kind of redefining this movie. That's why I can not fully understand any positive reviews. It might be realistic in a sense but some real stories are best left untold. I still love to slow down movies as long as it serves the purpose of the movie. Solaris Tarkovsky is very slow to rhythm but it allows intersections and sets the mood of the movie for example. But in this case, the film is just filled with stupid dialogues that manage to tell us little about the characters. None of which I could identify with or care for. In a lot of scenes I found myself thinking: "When will they be closed"? The act was very bad. Not in a sort of imbalance obvious in ways. But it seems none of the actors care about their characters and they all seemed to have wanted to be elsewhere in most of the scenes. This would be due to the uninspired dialogue being given. Also the whole flow of the film felt mechanical. Go to the next scene. It looks like this movie was just writing (badly) but never ruled. This is one of the few films that I can tell products have no emotional response from any of the scenes. No suspension, no fear, no anticipation, no mourning, no intrusions, no intellectual curiosity, no interest that forever. <br /> A perfect example of what I call an anti-film.
