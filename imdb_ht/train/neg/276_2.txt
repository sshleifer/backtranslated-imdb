Characteristic are predictable and predictable, and everyone who was either snow-white or completely wrong. The act is too stilted for it to be bad in a fun way, over-the-top. It is doubly disappointing if you are a fan of Davis, because its character is not a typically fun Bette-Davis-type character; it just gets fruity pensively a lot. <br /> <br /> In the whole, both my wife and I have found the movie to be interesting, moving or enjoyable at all.
