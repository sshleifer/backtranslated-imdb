I've seen all four movies in this series. Each one loses more and more of the books. This is one of the worst again. My problem is that it does not follow the book he titled after in any way! Directors and producers should call him anything else other than "love loves the love." The only thing about this movie that remotely resembles the book is the names of some of the characters (Willie, Museum, Henry, Clark, Scottie and Cookies). The names / ages / genders of children are not wrong. The entire story line has no place in the book. <br /> I found it a big mistake to give Janette Well, her books and her fans produce a movie under her head that's not correct in any way. The music is too strong. The actors are not convinced - they miss emotions. <br /> <br /> If you want a good family movie, this might be. It is clean. Do not watch it, though, if you hope for a condensed version of the book. I hope this will be the last movie from this series, but I doubt it. If there are more movies, I wish Michael Landon, Jr. and others would stick closer to the original plot and story line. The books are excellent and, if well followed, would make excellent movies!
