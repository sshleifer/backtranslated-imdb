I'm sort of people down to the local library and read books on Babbage's Different Motorbike also my comrades have played football etc. So if there is anything like a target audience for this movie, then I guess I 'm probably be included in that. <br /> Maybe I just have to look it over again. An earlier review does not look at this movie as being tired. Perhaps that was my mistake. <br /> I tried my best to enjoy this movie, and there are aspects of it that I love, but overall I found it amateur and well plodding. /> When you a bit of a computer Nerd confess yourself, I just can not help but pick up on the exact frame when the movie was actually made, and how the graphics work to reflect that time (ie 1997) . Having played games in c.f. era. "Mind Grind" cites one example, this movie can not escape the 16-bit color to resonate multimedia explosions at that time. Now, fortunately, this has diminished somewhat in recent years in the gaming world at least, in favor of playing the actual game. <br /> <br /> Having resorted to watching this movie through a German FTA satellite channel (as I did not think it had ever been revealed on UK FTA TV, well lately anyway), i Was lamentingly amused to see the credit to end Goddog notes (God Dog) had 4 people working on it's design. Perhaps it means my mind to be this amusing, given that ten years have passed since the movie was done, nevertheless the end result of making movie graphics from the eighties look good by comparison. For the main story, I agree that the format is not the best idea. As with other people, Ada deserves a movie without a sci-fi angle, and a simpler biographical approach might perhaps be best suited to cover the life story of this remarkable lady. There are fundamental errors that undermine my enjoyment of this movie. First of all, the concealed idea that somehow lost real-world information in the past can be well-rebuilt in some sort of extrapolation through software-based smart browsers, seems somehow funny. <br /> <br /> Also, the term runs in films that a computing device can really predict the mechanics of everything in the course of time (eg the wind) is now known by the case. <br /> OK, so the Victorians could have made this view, but the 20th century works of GÃ¶del prove that no math system can be completed, Turing's work on the boundaries of calculability, not to mention chaotic theory and Quantum mechanics are all completely faded to the ideas, which look like central to how the day-to-day modern software researcher is supposed to work. <br /> <br /> Finally, clicking the mouse in the air means "programming" is also just plain wrong, as mentioned. <br /> <br /> This movie maybe been OK, but at least some techniques a nd scientific consultation should give the movie some necessary credit credits to the credibility stakes. <br /> I will not forget the movie though, such as "Pi", it is clear a unique job, but with too many fatal errors so I really enjoy it, 3/10 from me.
