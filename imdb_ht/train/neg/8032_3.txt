This was a great cast with big-name stars such as Tyrone Power, Henry Fonda, Randolph Scott, Nancy Kelly, Henry Hull and Brian Donlevey with a wide array of name-less-known and shortened roles. It also has Technicolor, one of the few movies made with it in 1939. <br /> <br /> Now the bad news ....... sorry, I can not say much positive for the story . He described the James boys in a totally positive light .... and Hollywood did this ever since. Why these criminals always show to be the "good guys" is beyond me. This movie glamorized and made the enemies - the people railroad - in vicious human beings. The letter was exaggerated he was preposterous. Well, this is the movie world for you: evil is good; good is bad. <br /> <br /> Hey Hollywood: Here's a news flash - The James boys were criminals! Really - look at her!
