Never seen the original film in the series ... I only hope it was a better movie than this or the end made in the 1980s as if it was not how these two terrible endeavors were justified . This movie has a really good lead in when its advertising has to be shown on one of the old independent stations that is something of the past now. Anyways it looked like it would be a great good movie scary. It was, however, a movie that would make some movies Walt Disney look black. Really, this movie was just a bunch of light flame and virtually no animal boggy creatures to be seen. Only the real real is near the end when you see its shape during a very heavy rainfall, other than that there is virtually no sign of the beast that was really disappointing as a kid. The story is basically the old evil hunter to kill anything to see with them after the boggy Creek creature and the kids out to help her or just some guys guys guys on the trees who love to pull random chips in the water . Not really worth watching I would however like to see the original, granting the marker in which would also spoil the boggy beast in the 80's but it also made a very good slasher movie in 70 in the "sown the sown town".
