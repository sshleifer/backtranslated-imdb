Teamo Supremo is three children, including leader - Captain Crandall, girl ropes and skateboards, all with their own battles (buza! Chika! Woopa!) And equipped with moving. They work for the governor Kevin, and they are recruited after they want hero and play in this game. They bring normal lives as well, and they have family and homework, but most of the action takes place away from fighting fights. The bandits all have unique and singular features, such as Mister Wave and his men who never seem to know what their plans are, but acting anyway. From an evil robot to a wicked baron three have to meet them and stop their evil and often strange, plan to gain power, take revenge etc. <br /> <br /> The top animation It is quite nice and smooth, but the style appears to be simple on purpose. The schedules have overlapping colors and the buildings look like futuristic. The music is quite nice, and the show is not too bad all along, although the style is not my favorite. <br /> <br /> The plots are almost always nonsensical and ridiculous, but after all this is a cartoon and one can not blame them for that. However this should not be in the same rank as Fillmore! or Pepper Ann.
