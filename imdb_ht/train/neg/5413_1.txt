After MASTI has been very successful with the best Inder Kumar has come back with a PYAARE MOHAN movie based on the Hollywood movie SEE NO EVIL, heard there is no harm <br /> <br /> The movie reminds you of HUM HAI KAMAAL KE (1994) Where Squad and Anupam play blind and deaf <br /> <br /> This movie is a tedious exercise <br /> The movie has jokes in nonsense that you do not feel like laughing like head Snehal Dabi is getting stuck in the back of the horse and all those types of comedy that we do not laugh at now but weird <br /> <br /> The movie begins in a tricky way with the few funny scenes sadly this moment they do not last time as the story never moves in half this same comedy gets boring The tight well occupied with the second half gets an action movie where the blind guy and the deaf go to rescue the heroines and we have all scenes kick OTT and battle scenes <br /> <br /> Direction by Inder Kumar is bad Music is okay, a song stands out I love you ANGEL <br /> <br /> Vivek is terrible in the comic scene, its distribution is very bad and is okay in serious scenes For some reason it keeps comedy and ruins his career Fardeen Khan is tad better but too wild Among the rest of Esha and Amrita They are heroine Boman Irani annoys here Snehal Dabbi is okay
