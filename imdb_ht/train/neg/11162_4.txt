Jack Black is an annoying character. This is an Indian movie for 14 kids. Do I have to write eight more lines? Ana de la Reguera is fine fine to look at, as a Mexican tile that is set up and instead of the groggy progress of Jack Black. This is a PG version 13 in an independent movie. I really love a movie that has the courage to explore Mexican culture. This film explores Mexican-deep culture. I just choke on her cultural rudeness: Jack Black is just so rude. Someone white as Black Jack is not my most important emissary in Mexican culture, as it was. Wrestling expert culture is not the most diaphanous venue for a white guy, as I could look for. I suspect Mexico is more opaque than Jack Black has to feature here. <br /> I think IMDb changed my review. Had anyone else had his review changed too? Just a question.
