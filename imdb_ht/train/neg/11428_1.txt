OH I AM .. WHO I BELIEVE THROUGH - The main idea is that my mind right after watching the movie. And I really do not understand anybody and opposites. Though, perhaps the idea was good but the miserable effect. I especially mean the role of H. Graham. What was that ??? In my opinion it has destroyed all positive intentions of producers. The character has been played in affected and annoying ways. Each time it appears to remind you that you are watching a movie and it destroys a spirit at the time, then the whole movie because most of the time you can see has its stupid face and more stupid attempts to create the emotion. Terrible, do not waste your time.
