These issues and the movie are many, but I'll try to mention the most blatant and bothersome. First of all, while the theme suggests a number of vines on Manhattan's life, the fact was that everything, as usual in movies and TV, was about something rare, usually in a sexual nature. The storyline was thin or nonexistent, and virtually every scene, camera shot, line of dialogue, and expressing emotion was absolutely, and totally false. It finally got to a point after an hour of these rubbish guts that I walked out (something is not uncommon for me in recent years.) I would have been fi9lm headed by some jumping request starting out of some study curriculum, but I believe (at one time, pre-Amelia, talented) director Mira Nair participated in this disgusting travesti, so maybe the talent directly in America has gone down en masse in the cesspool.
