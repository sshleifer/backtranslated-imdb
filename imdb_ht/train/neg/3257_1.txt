After having seen the movie the first question that happened to my mind was: Is this supposed to be irony or not? After reading a few comments about Savage's doc and the comic book, I knew this movie was not meant to be ironic. So the story tells us about a US-American super-doc saving a South American republic from evil. Sounds like a typical story. But this one comes in such a way that it is ridiculous. The final boss is obliged to show the worst presentation of martial arts I have ever seen. The film might be interesting for budgetary film designers as a bad example.
