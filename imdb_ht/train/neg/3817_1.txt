Seriously. This is one of the most stupidest families of all time. <br /> <br /> Draw-A family without a mother and 3 "dad" raises 3 girls in San Francisco. Character - Neat freak Danny, Joey's favorite design, hair obsessed Jesse, spoiled Michelle, stupid DJ, and almost normal Stephanie. The creators of this show really want you to hate the characters, are not they? <br /> <br /> Therefore, I do not think anyone should watch this show. I only chuckled in a moment to run all the show, and I think instead of lethal injection, all the criminals should be forced to watch this show, a torture far worse than anything else. <br /> 1.5 / 10 or: D
