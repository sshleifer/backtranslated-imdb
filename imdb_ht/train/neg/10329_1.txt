I'm trying to locate the pitch for black Angel. "I think Matrix, I think Bladerunner, I think Chick is playing the angel 's faith, wearing bright black leather - or some chick just like her, leaving one with us only - to get this! You will do it without them Not any draw, dialogue, character, decent action or budget, just a few bang loud and a warm chick in bright shiny black spotting a great vibrating bike.Fanboys dig loud loud and warm chicks in bright shiny black large vibrating bike frames, right? "Flash, deep, sad, formulous, passionate, tiring, dull, dumb, humorless, desultory, barely competent. Live animation action without any action, or indeed any life. SF just way Joe Fanboy likes it, in fact. :(
