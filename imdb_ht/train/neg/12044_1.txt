Went to the movie "Troy" this afternoon. Here's what I learned: <br /> <br /> Unlike popular opinions and stories in general, Greek guys were not gay. EVER. This was clearly established immediately at the beginning of the film and reinforced every five minutes or so later. So it's safe for American dude to see this movie. <br /> <br /> Helen in Troy always had impeccable hair and makeup. She looked gorgeous at all her stabbed scene that, though many, were probably all filmed on the same day one after the other, and the director said, "Well, now look nice ... good. .. OK, now look awesome ... good ... now look depressed ... good ... now look interested ... good ... now look nice again ... good ... " <br /> <br /> Most Greek and Trojan users had British accents. People with American accents could not act. <br /> <br /> Trojans look just like Greeks, but they tend to stay on the right side of the screen. <br /> Brad Pitt does not blink on camera. <br /> <br /> Helen at Troy's biggest line, "They're coming for me." Music music sounds remarkably like modern Bulgarian music. Brad Pitt's twist went around the road. <br /> <br /> Achilles had a boyfriend with whom he was very close, but she's OK. They were cousins. Never think this story says. Peter O'Toole can tell a whole story and just an expression. <br /> <br /> Trojan War apparently all had Greek names, but the statues either looked Egyptian or like Peter O'Toole's drag. <br /> <br /> Greek people have never touched each other unless they fight, as many as Americans. All of the thousands of extras in the movie had exactly the same color of the skin ... Egyptian Lights, not Max Factor. <br /> <br /> Troy had only three women. <br /> <br /> There were lots of Blonde Greece, which is good news for Brad Pitt, who would otherwise have been really stuck out. Despite deserts locally deserted, Greeks had the uncanny ability to find unlimited amount of timber built fire, funeral pirates, Trojan horses and the like. Brad Pitt changed his expression only when the sun shone directly in his eyes. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />, but the teams always look impeccable. <br /> <br /> Apparently the Greek temple was still in ruins, even back when they were all new.
