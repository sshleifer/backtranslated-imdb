As a girl, Hinako moved away from her small village in Tokyo, leaving behind her two best friends, Fumiya and Sayori. She returned as a young woman, surprised to find that Sayori died when she was a teenager. He is meeting with Fumiya and is afraid to learn that Sayori is mysteriously being resurrected across the island of Shikoku. Oh boy. I rent this because I love Asian horror and I think Chiaki Kuriyama a nifty actress. Unfortunately, if I had to describe Shikoku in one word, it would be "fruity." This film is funny, boring, filthy, inimaginative, and most of all, unscary. Kuriyama has minimal screen times as the resurrected Sayori, and its character gives little work to them.
