My husband is a great Robin Williams fan. I also love him but have generally found that he should "stick to what he does best" and focus on the role of comedy. My thoughts have been confirmed with this movie. I was completely bored of the whole movie. The story was predictable. I realized he was inspired by a true story. But I guess is that there could be some suspense or intrigue even while keeping the truth in the story. None of the characters were well developed. There was a side story about the main character and his partner. This relationship could explore more. More importantly, though, there would be a deeper exploration of the mother of the "boy". Psychological profession it would be interesting to dig through. It obviously has a long history that has not been touched on except in the most superficial ways. If my husband was not such a big fan of Williams, we would have left 20 minutes into her. Too I can not get $ 20 or 2 hours back.
