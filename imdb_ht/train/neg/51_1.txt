This movie was a big disappointment. The level of unrelenting cruelty and violence in this film was very disturbing. Some scenes were really unnecessary ugly and mean-dynamic. The main characters were impossible to identify with or even sympathize with. The main character of the protagonist was as slimy as they came. The classroom / lounge atmosphere lends itself to the over-the-top theater. little or nothing can learn about the Spanish civil war from this film. Fortunately, I was spyware and realized this is not realistic! In addition, the use of same-sex attraction as a horrendous "horror" was also very offensive and poorly handled, while the DVD was packaged and advertised attractive gay attraction. The actors seemed uncomfortable in their role, as if they were trying to distance themselves in this mess.i guess if you love watching kids and pets being brutally killed, this movie might be especially appealing against you.
