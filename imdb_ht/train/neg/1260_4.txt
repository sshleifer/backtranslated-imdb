Yes, CHUNKY, this is the nick-name that Donna Reeds's romantic lead plays by Tom Drake's Tags with! So let's get this clear away. From his first-ever engineered role in the GET-away (1941), his latest, Dallas (1984-1985) Madam Reed can never be described as CHUNKY. By this actress and slender actress. The Role of M.G.M. Rarely lived up to his talent. <br /> <br /> Ms. Reed is supported by a cast of competent character actors, who unfortunately must flounder in this alleged 'vice-ball' comedy. Clearly M.G.M. was from the depths of this type of film. A better quality product in COLUMBIA, PARAMOUNT, RKO and even UNIVERSAL. Neither 'touching' Ernst Lubitsch nor the Preston Sturges understanding could save this movie. A rather conventional romantic comedy that has all the brands in a pre-war effort (WWII). If Irving Thalberg was still alive the screen-play would either go through a significant rewrite or never see the light of day. He was fit into Louis B. Mayer's 'safe-area' in any family-challenging family. A form that could not stand in front of the post-war challenge in the 'DeHavilland Decision', loss of theater chains, television and would contribute to M.G.M. decline. Fortunetly for Donna Reed its best day is ahead of its culmination from here for eternity (1953) and winning Oscar as best supporting comedy.
