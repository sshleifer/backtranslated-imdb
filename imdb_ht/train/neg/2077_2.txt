Need an excuse to get out of the house while dipping paint - leaving the film after an hour to return and watch the paint to dry. <br /> <br /> I do not remember ever going out on a movie before, but I really tried to stay. The script was not up to the throw and just kept "going and going" badly - come on! Uma Thurman does this thing? Effectively blame special effects. These were the greatest characters and actors to make life superficial horny 20-something - just sort of annoying and outraged. <br /> <br /> This review is based only in the first hour - it might have been better. I just had the house and saw if the paint dried up a darker shade than when it was gone.
