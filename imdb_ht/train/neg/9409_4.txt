I liked this show! I think it's nothing wrong with it! Only that Spidey does not punch anyone, but only for that show does not suck! Some people only think that this show is bad because of that. The story was great and it was fun when other heroes appeared as X-Men, The Punisher, Daredevil and Iron Man! Sometimes sandman never appeared, but I'm just like it! Best Spidey shows ever !! My favorite episodes are: 1. turn point 2. war spider 3. hobgoblin 4. foreign suit 5. mutant agenda <br /> But some episodes are really really bad as: rocket racer and nasty emotions they look. And I do not like Morbius and Hydro Man. First of Morbius sucking plasma instead of blood and I do not like vampires. And it irritated me that it was almost the main villain of Season 2. Of course I have to mention Hydro Man! It was awful! I prefer to see Sandman! His last appearance was so terrible. And I do not like Spidey as Spider's man! <br /> But I guess everything was wrong!
