A break would be senarist and it would be silver (Tom Wood and Arye Brit) were forced to live in a clean warehouse facility run by a unique and intimidated manager (Ron Perlman) whom they believed to be the serial killer that is terrorized The city, the "costume killer" (so called because, after injecting its victims to Windex, he dressed in comical costumes). They convince him his life story would make a big movie and gather together a group of wannabe movie mixes (John Considine, Joe Pantoliano, Kris Swanson) and discover that the art of making movie deadly. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Our losses (and the actors, who do all work fine and deserve better) as well as have the makings of an exceptional black comedy, but only get up pretty mediocre. <br /> <br /> If you're a Ron Perlman fan this is absolutely worthwhile getting just for her performance. His comedy cadmeter is excellent and is likely to make some really great impressions (he was not kidding when he told Hellboy movie commentary that he needed an intervention when he joined Jerry Lewis mode). It's just just fun to look at this one. David Dukes also shines in a two-stage role (but pivotal).
