A family with Louis Dale (Dale Midkiff), mother Rachel (Denise Crosby), 10-year-old Eileen (Blaze Berdalh and approximately 3 year old Gage (Miko Hughes) moved to this beautiful home in Maine - lost Unaware of the semis that roar down the highway in front of the houses every 90 seconds or so! The neighbor along the way (Fred's beautiful Gwynne) makes them feel at home ... and show them a pet cemetery where kids bury pets .. But a little more is a sacred ground that can bring the dead back to life ... but the dead return to a nasty mood. <br /> <br /> "" DEFINITE SPOILERS ** The novel by Stephen King was good - it has long been, but it has developed characters and situations that have made you care of what happened This jettison has ALL the character development and just plays up the gor and violence. The dead died camera (I know it's false, but it's still repulsive); hit by a semi and his caps pops open during the funeral (in a totally staged scene alad); he brought back to life with assault and murder including his mother (I DO NOT ask how a 3 year old could hang her); a ghost jogger (not asking) try to help the family for any reason ... The movie just works the audience on cutting all deaths or violence in your face. She just goes out of her way to your trauma. ** END SPOILERS ** <br /> <br /> Actors have no help. Midkiff is just obnoxious as the father - it's nice and scrub, but totally empty. Crosby is no better. The two children are just annoying. Only Gwynne single-handedly save this picture and its effective acting good. <br /> <br /> This picture shows a total scorn for the audience to capture great logical leaps and characters that make things incredibly stupid (especially Midkiff at the end). This film was (inexplicably) a huge box office hit in 1989 which led to the end even worse in 1992. I saw it in a theater back then and was disturbed how the audience was holding to beat Professor of the violence and was just surprised by what I saw. An impoverished movie horror movie. A 1 all the way. When you think it's all over and can not be worse Ramones to sing a song !!!!!! ("I do not want to be buried in a pet cemetery"). Really than belief.
