Joe's opening line says everything about this movie. It takes place on the island of Malta (the island of pathetic people) and involves Joe Don Baker following down an Italian mobster. Charon Joe Don is called Geronimo (pronounced Heronimo) and all that he does in this movie is to shoot people and get arrested on and agin. All of the film hated it, as everyone hated Greydon Clark. I liked a Greydon earlier photo, "Angel Revenge" because it was a shrine for the old boy. Avoid this movie at all costs !!
