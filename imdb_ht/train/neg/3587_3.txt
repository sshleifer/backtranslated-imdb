How can they come from Joe Don Baker (as Bufford Pusser in the first sequel) Bo Svenson (as Bufford Pusser in the end of the second) .Why did this for. Just because Bo Svenon looked more like Bufford Pusser still must "change it because the first one it was Joe Don Baker as Bufford Pusser and that one of the things I wanted to see at the end of the second. <br /> I would have given this movie a 7 out of 10 and I'd given it a 1 out of 10 if the story didnt have anything to do with Bufford Pusser's life but he did and why I gave This movie is a 3 August 10. <br /> <br /> I strongly suggest that anyone planning on watching this cheese I suggest does not look at the first one instead.
