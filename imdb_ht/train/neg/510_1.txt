This is surely one of the worst films ever made and published by a great Hollywood studio. The plot is simply stupid. The dialogue is written in piano; you can file a great many sentences in the script for that purpose. The act is ridiculous, especially those of Rod Cameron. The "choreography" is funny and utter unerotic. One can only pity the review that saw Yvonne's 23-year-old dance as sexual; It's just pretty bad choreography. The ballet scene at the start of the film is especially funny. If you are in bad movies and enjoy laughing at some of the Hollywood turkey, this is for you. I bought the colorized version of VHS, making the movie even worse. Yvonne's heavy makeup, when color, has its look like a clown all the time. And it is the best part of this movie. What is a way to launch a career.
