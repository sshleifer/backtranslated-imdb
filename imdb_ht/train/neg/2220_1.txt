What hell is in your mind? This movie sucks! Every minute I became more and more bored. I've been monitoring them to look at the end because I expect something at least late! But instead, I was amazed at how dull they were treated at the end ... What is this story about this "Bogeyman" without? How come he does not die? It's a bloody human being! A little boy who killed his comedy sister 15 years ago. Then what? Does he stay on a psychiatric hospital made him immortal? This movie is a fascinatingly stupid ... It's a must of silliness. I'll resell it now to some funny guy who will understand this funny movie.
