This is one of those "bad bad ones" movie that you always hear about but never seen! Unlike Troma films that make mistakes with campy (and I'm not amused) this one is 100% more serious. <br /> However and features such as supposedly super-lethal murderers robots that are prancing on like one of the Solid Gold Dancers on an acid trip and a first spell magic calling down lightning and transforming into the Good Witch in the East to the fact that it carelessly pushes it too far on the wrong edge that makes it full of circle around back to fun. <br /> <br /> Wellable enough because of that.
