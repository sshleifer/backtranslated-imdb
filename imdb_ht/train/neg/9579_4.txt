Here's a horror version of PRISCILLA: KNOW in the desert (they want!) Begin Melinda / Mindy (RETURN IN THE TRUTH OF THE TRUTH 3) Clarke as Candy, a Desert Dweller who pulls on a bank heist and Johnny companion (Jason Durr) . It ends in a South-of-the-border prison that runs by the sadist Chief Screw (a Robert Englund-surtout of a toupee). He and his beloved little poodles are hidden in a gas station store until they are transformed by a newly dropped meteor. The dogs turn into insuportable drag the queen "Bitches" and Candy to develop a long, talkative, killing tongue forbid it can not be controlled. Thieves looking for stealing thieves and other assassinated numbskulls add extra hassles. <br /> The first, Clarke is fantastic and does have to do in this movie. You look at her and see a very funny person during the slapstick scenes, very convincing during the horror scenes and very sexy scenes of various disguises, including an eye-popping, tight bodysuit of latex ... and wondering How come this actress is not a great star. It is too bad to have the rest of this attempt to live up to his promise. <br /> <br /> Blame director / scribe Sciamma, who thinks the citizen is quoted alone is enough to sustain and laugh ... but his vibrant gamut, annoying supported characters and stupid dialogues are not substitute for a real sense of humor. Another nail in the coffin; The film looks cheap, lots of garish and lying colors are unmistakably muted by mud and local dusty deserts. Luckily for Sciamma that Clarke is in her movie, because she alone keeps you watching.
