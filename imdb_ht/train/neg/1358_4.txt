The words "Swedish" and "Action films" do not mix. Which becomes more and more obvious and all attempts made in the genre. This is yet another attempt fails. <br /> <br /> Lasse Brunell (Shanti Roney) is working on a military base and secretive computer system. An alien criminal day threatens to hurt her family if she does not say so. They want secret equipment and they will do anything to get it. <br /> <br /> This movie has its ups and downs. And usually in Swedish action movies there are no "ups", just "Downs". So, I guess something in this movie has shown some quality. To begin with the positive remarks I can mention that the film is technically well done. The footpath of aircraft and helicopters fly well and look very nice. Acting is of very varied type. Shanti Roney performs a decent performance while Maria Bonnevie is stiff and abnormal as usual (I wonder how Swedish Swedish direction will be maintained using it though she has the skills to act in a wooden beam). Stefan Sauk is ridiculous as the "cool" special forces who come to the base to investigate. <br /> And what about the action scene? Well as I said above the scene of aircraft and flying helicopters are beautiful. But aside from there is not much action to talk about. And that's a common problem with Swedish action films. There is just not enough action to go on. Maybe it's a budget issue, perhaps the movie that is doing culture. I do not know, but it negatively affects the experience. Because quite frankly, the story and acting are not good enough for this movie counts just about that. <br /> I miss this 4/10 for effort.
