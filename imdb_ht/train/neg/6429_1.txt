Personally I would advise people to stay clear in this movie. It's on the whole one to look at them and the battle is wrong choreographer. Slow and not very compelling. If you buy Hong Kong legendary DVD released in this movie, then the only thing worth listening to is the Bey Logan audio comment. <br /> But in any case, since ever there was a ninja movie worth watching. I can not think about one and frankly do not want to. <br /> <br /> In general, when it comes to movies, I have one golden rule: Avoid any movie with the word 'Ninja'.
