Lots of funny funny holes in the movie. First we see him watching his master Kung-Fu practice, and dies in the middle of his practice. That's fine with me. Then at the end of the movie, we see him using the kung fu that he just learned not to watch his master when he was still a kid. Is it even possible? I do not think so. <br /> This show is purely for fans of Jay Chou, and the movie lacks a depth in terms of character development, cinematography and unfolding of scheme. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> same? Long hair, sun-boy look, tall and strong. Two of them looked like they were from a mass production factory designed to degrade out products that make young girls call wild in orgasm. Not that these two actors had anything of value to contribute to the movie as a whole for the movie industry at all. <br /> <br /> jokes were lame and not funny at all. The scene and considering the 4 guys at Jay Chou come back to helping him out of the basketball court, to degenerate into a pointless plot when they began to bashing opponents to ala Royal rumble style. Worse at all, when the 4 masters won the battle, the crowd began to beat cheering, and the match continued. Was it really a WTF? moment. <br /> At the end of the show, when they win the match, all thanks to Kung Fu Jay Chou's excellent skill. How it has acquired these kung-fu skills is a mystery, because the show somehow shows him to catch their skills just by observing his master. Then his father lost a lot out of the carpet recognized Jay Chou as his long-lost son seemed just a tad too fast to the director to wrap up the movie. <br /> <br /> In short, this is a Jay Chou-flicker movie (instead of the usual "flick of the chic film"). Watch it only if Jay Chou is your fan. If you are one of those who have the taste of movies coinciding with the top of the IMDb top 250 movie movie ever, then this film is not for you.
