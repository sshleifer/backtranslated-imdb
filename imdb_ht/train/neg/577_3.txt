First of all, Jon Bon Jovi does not seem to be in place in a vampire movie. Along with the other characters that are not so interesting and the poor scenario scenario all become predictable. If you keep that in mind and you are a total movie fan vampire, you can have some fun with a few of the scenes. Do not expect any Tarantino-style chapters here and neither a scenario Anne Rice. (I hope they have forgotten the movie all by tomorrow;)
