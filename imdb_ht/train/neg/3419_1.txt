Ok, so, Chuck Norris somehow found a way to get this product end. I have a question-why? Who reads this script and says, "The great sound! Originally!" This film is crapy reluctance that I would not touch my toilet bowel with them. Of course it is another story, followed by the tradition of MIA, Invasion USA, Walker, Texas Ranger, Delta Force and so in which Chuck Norris, of course, is one person who can even America in some bad guys. It does not even need a gun more often. It's stupid patriotic newspaper stalking your head. Surprisingly, the only one who is leading these Norris films is Eric Chuck's son. Eric Norris has primarily worked on all his father's films and TV shows. Is not this anyone strikes as a sign that he has no direct talent? And he led the same people as before in the same stories as before ... only the difference is the characters' names. If this should make me patriotic and applaud for the USA, spend our country in shape worse than I imagined. Hopefully, this will be nail in the Chuck Norris coffin to act.
