What I found so curious about this movie - I've seen the full 4-hour way version, is how oddly dispassionate it. For a movie about 2 very charisma - Castro and Che, engaged in a political political league, it's nearly totally devoid of emotional fire. The scene between Benicio Del Toro and Demian Bichir (which is the best of a second level actor, with a slightly upright voice) has no drama or depth and basically down to Castro di Che: go here, go there , do so with that, with no explanation of what effect or use of this action will result in. Odder still has an actor in the cast that has the power to play Castro - Joaquim de Almeida, but has been shunted aside from a minor part in the second half. Without the tension or passion that you would expect to fire these guys and followers, the movie has become a dolish epicurious film about hairy men, bearded men running in various jungles shouting and Shoot no particular purpose or end. Several of the comments I had read show praise over the work of director Steven Soderbergh while ignoring the actors almost completely. (One in fact has spent more time talking about Soderbergh's new movie camera than the scheme or actor or the fact that it's entirely in Spanish with English subtitles.) This is an odd, odd thing to do since a) Soderbergh only a weapon hire on the movie and b) it's no more than a competent job at work, and an unremarked top of Oliver Stone's JFK's black and white cut-camera work when visiting New York. If you can imagine Reds directed by Andrew McLaglen instead of Warren Beatty, you would get an idea of ​​dull skills in this movie.
