I'm really surprised that this film finds a sorting like this! I have not seen such a bad movie for years.Omg this was a really bad movie. Splatter is not enough to describe unnecessary (almost funny) scenes without). If you did not like hostel2 or Wolf Creek or Halloween (2007) ..well this is 10 times worse. The story reminds me of RL Stine goosebumps. <br /> I can not tell about the act since the script was so awful.Clear all the time. (Why should I write 10lines? I never understood this.) <br /> <br /> The story is about a murderous murderer all the time in the metro. We are talking about thousands of assassination and no notice. Actually these people just miss. And that's the good guy who tries to solve the mystery (well there is no mystery for us because we know from the beginning the bad guy) and as usual no one believes it! what a surprise! At the end she wears clogs and battles to death with the bloodthirsty killer!
