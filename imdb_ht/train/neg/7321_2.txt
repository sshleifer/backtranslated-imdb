Maybe by my genre, but plot was awful as she acted by Nancy Allen and Linda Farentino. C. Thomas also seemed comfortable in the role of being seduced here (while on marijuana? Why this need to be included? This scheme is weakening considerably). Also features Farentino's features. would be best if he had more respect for a relationship. Does the movie try to say? not a lot.
