I bought this movie about the cheap in a stomach, it was returned to the DVD case and assuming that either way I can not lose it if it was trash then no loss, if it was any good time this, bargain ... <br /> <br /> then I watch her ... <br /> I'm usually a fan of Christopher Walken, but in this movie she has ordered very little The presence of screens, seems to be not a whole lot, even the death of his friends near the start that the spark of the "action" of the plot seems to affect him so much, and eventually revenge it is just boring and undramatic. Normally a movie that has grand themes as revolution and revenge can take the audience and the traps to feel something for the characters, however watching this movie felt more like seeing a series of confused, and almost Do not cut the wound together toward its conclusion eventually ... At this point I cry ... <br /> <br /> I thought this movie was the most horrible painful piece In my view I was told that the scene where the pilot killed himself does not refuse to jump out the explosive truck loaded due to not wanting to kill any civilian is not so sad sad as it is unnervingly terrible and painful, although not quite as bad as Emergency surgery on the injured girl. The act was poor all round, the script and the story was weak, the "action" was even weaker, and the "visuals" were flashy but not all that visual. Summary has good movies, bad films, films that are so bad good, horrible films ... <br /> Then on a whole new level is "McBain"
