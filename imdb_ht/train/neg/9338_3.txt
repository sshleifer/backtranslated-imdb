Pam Grier star as Coffy. She is a nurse seeking revenge, on drug dealers who got her sister hooked on bad heroine. Like any 70s Blaxploitation cops, you can expect to see the bad racists guys get their just dessert. <br /> <br /> There were scores of these films made during the 70s, and they were really abusing in both black and white audiences alike. This is mainly due to the vicious racial hostility of these films, and degrading, the stereotyped characters. Especially the female characters. Other common threads between Coffy, and other films of its kind, include brutal violence, police officers, hunting cars, generous abundance of stripping, and gender-crazed gorgeous women. Not to mention urban ghettos that are populated by drug-dealers, pimps, mobsters, and other crime crimes. <br /> <br /> Pam Grier, was the queen of the heroine 70s Blaxploitation heroine. It was beautiful, they were both hard-like-nails, and gout-dead gorgeous. Like in its other film, Pam outshines the other characters, at Coffy. In fact, Pam is so charismatic on screen, that these types of film are unmatched, without it as the main character. <br /> <br /> If you like Pam Grier, you better view its other films, such as Foxy Brown, or perhaps Foster Friday. These films have much less tragedy than Coffy does. Pam the character of Coffy, degrade itself too much way to find the bad guys. Pam's character in his other Blaxploitation movie, does not jump as low as they get revenge, as Coffy did. <br /> <br /> I would say, only look Coffy, if you can not see any of Pam Grier's other films. Otherwise, Coffy is a waste of time. Only Pam talent as an actress, makes Coffy bearable look.
