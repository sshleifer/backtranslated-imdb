Ah, the sex-and-gore movie. It's too bad to do that again (unless you live in Japan). But if they all turned out like this, that's not a bad thing. <br /> <br /> The movie basically consists of two lovely vampires picking up "Johns" on a land road, taking them home to castles, having sex with them, and then, Eat them (except the first victim, who is kept around for any particular reason). Things are complicated when a woman and her husband gets too curious about those mysterious women she sees. It gets real ugly here. By the end, the two vampires are in such a bloodlust that they eat everything in sight, and manage to let the fascinating victims escape. Oops, so much for secret existence. <br /> The fact that the two vampires do not mind getting their clothes off and distorting around each other is the only thing that's going to be the movie. Otherwise, it's a bloody, confusing mess (why are the graves far away from the castles?), Look only for the minutes minutely some vampyre gamers. The only thing I got from this movie was that of two valid bits of advice: lesbians shoot will not kill them; it will only turn them into vampires, and do not pick up hookers on a land route; they are probably vampires. Other than that, it really was not worth my time.
