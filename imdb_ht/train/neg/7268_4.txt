Boring, long, firefighting, repetitive, self-involving ?? This movement felt like a bad date. Worst, the art-school-directional direction - with a heavy-handed use of the whirlpool shot that gets so overdone it almost makes me throw up - is constantly screaming to be noticeable. Add more to scheme and virtually no dialogue, and the movie begins to feel like a season four season 30 to 30 minutes It gets worse: instead of dialogue there is wrong writing voice-overs AK quotes and songs that comment all too obviously about characters. Really loud music opera too. Blame it all about the director. <br /> <br /> The actors are all good. The lead actor Miguel Angel Hoppe is particularly suited for movie stars. He and other actors have some sensitive erotic moments. Even these begin to get boring after 5 minutes however, with one wonder if the director is audition for a Bel Ami porn work. The university campus university architecture as a place in Mexico City is inspiring. How to become universities in the United States, so bland (SFSU, UC, etc.)? But wait for the DVD on this movie. You will want to use the fast scan button ?? very much.
