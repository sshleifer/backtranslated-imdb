This was to be one of the most terrible and awful terrible gods and only saved by 2 matches. The Hardcore Match between Edge and Mick Foley, also Vince Mcmahon against Shaun Michaels. The main event between Cena and Triple H was a complete display and to be honest I almost fell asleep it was so action, the circle match did not deserve to have the Undertaker to appear in it with the match between the Boogie Man and Booker T was a complete joke. If you are really a big fan of the WWE and have missed the early days of the WWF and the Wrestlemanias 17 and 19 you will probably love this. But I found that this Wrestlemania left a lot to be desired.
