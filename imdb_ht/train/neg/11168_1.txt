- A Mexican priest gets a wrestler to save an orphanage or something - <br /> I went to see this movie because it was about non-WWF wrestling and so I thought it might be funny. It was not. It is shocking to watch. Anbarasan. Any and all comedian opportunities are mercilessly wasted. <br /> I admit I do not like Jack Black anyway. And I was racking my brain to think of one good role that he did. The only thing I can come with where it was o.k. was such a foil that needed to character Jan Cusack in 'high Fidelity'. Jack Black is one of these terrible relentless flat-out guys knockabout but-to-do (as little in one fat at Abbot & Costello or Jerry Lewis) who should say that being overbearingly idiotic is not the same as they were funny. <br /> It's not even slapstick. It's just disappointing. It's not stoopid, it's just stupid. <br /> I hear good about Napoleon Dynamite too, but if this is anything to go by I'll rush out to get it on DVD.
