Well most boring stories I've seen in a long time. The plot was full of irresistence, and the act was the worst I've seen in a long time. To make it worse, camera angles that made me feel sick were used, the occasional music was awful and drowned out the dialog (maybe not a bad thing then), and the shots in San Francisco look as if they were stolen straight from video promotional tourists tourist city. <br /> Oh, and the binding sex scene was not even half well done. Best lighting next time, please.
