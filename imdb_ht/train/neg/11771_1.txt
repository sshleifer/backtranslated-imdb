This was shown as part of the 59th Edinburgh International Festival, though for the best reasons left by the powers that must be. A lot seems to have been made in the fact that it's the first Thai movie movie, made with Thai actors & crew, but led by a west. Need was not bothered to be honest, as this movie is dull, dull, dull. Why dust in something, why hide an idea of ​​mystery, why subtle invoke a feeling, when you can hammer the point home with horrible voice ovaries, obvious shots and on top of the head> There is nothing that leaves the imagination as time and time Again Spurrier director gradually churns out endless clichés. Do not encourage, no guess, it's all up on screen, do not need to use our imagination. Wonder when the bit of 'scary' will come? No shame, 'cause the band will get more and more intimidation, rising in a crescendo of ominously. Hell, I make up the word to describe how bad this is. Asking whether the devastating demon is real or imaginary? Why tax on yourself - it's really a snake, and yes it really is biting his side, and there's blood splattering everywhere. It's a strange, uncomfortable film for many reasons. It is supposed to be a horror movie, but it's not scary - the yolk will emphasize & evident. It could be an assault attack on Sideier side of Thailand, but the director has a lusty style, when it comes to showing young people pibesan. Maybe she dropped herself as the maiden-taken nail that planted the seeds of doubt in my head. Or maybe everything was just pants. Uninspired, insipid, repetitive, recalculate - all candidates for better description, but dessert looks more inappropriate and honest. It's all seen before, probably better, often with more thoughts, rarely with less imagination or rocket. Padon. Head down on every count. Surely.
