George P. Cosmatos' "Rambo: First Blood Part II" is most likely to progress. The United States clearly did not win the war in Vietnam. They caused damage to this country beyond the imagination and this movie continues the fairy tale of the oh-so innocent fate. Just the bad ones were the leaders of the nation, who made this war happen. Character of Rambo is perfect at this notice. It is very patriotic, bemoans that Americans did not appreciate and celebrate the achievements of soldiers in salt but nothing but challenging for leading officers and politicians. Like each film that defends the war (like "Our Soldiers"), this one avoids the need to provide a clear reason for the commitment of South Asia. And for this also the reason for every single US-American soldier was there. Instead, Ranbo gets revenge for the injuries of a whole nation. It is best to work on how to cope with memory, rather than deleting them. "We get to win this time?" Yes, you do.
