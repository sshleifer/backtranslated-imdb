When you look at this now and hear all the language in here, it's amazing this was rated "PG," but that's the 1970 rating system for you. Peter Falk expects the Lord's name unreasonably six times in the first ten minutes of this movie! But some people consider that offensive, and certainly not the scumbags that make movies or those "rates". <br /> <br /> Throw is a sign of how this film profane can be: Falk, Peter Boyle, Allen Garfield, Warren Oates, Gena Rowlands and Paul Sorvino are not exactly the actor you would not find in the "Sound in music. " I love heist movies, and a lot of films by director William Friedkin, but this script does not save and it just has way too much of the "70 Sleazy" to feel it, visually and audibly. For those who liked Falk in the "Columbo" TV it must come as a shock to hear him use as much profanity as he did in film. This is far from the case only.
