I have never seen anything as horrible as this movie for some time. The movie was boring, drawn long and terrible draws. Special Effects Sucks Like Hell - It's like watching a movie back in 1999. It's a total waste of one hour and a half of my time. Matthew Settle's performance was pretty bad. I saw him in the Band of Brothers playing Lt.Speirs, he was not that bad. In fact not bad at all. But in this movie, his act did not convince enough, he was quite bad and there was no chemistry between the rest of the crew either. Plus, her eyes seem empty as she does not feel it. It surprised me, really, because it was good at the Band of Brothers. <br /> <br /> Anyway, do not even bother to watch this movie. It's a huge big garbage time. Even if you have killed an hour or two, get something else besides watching this movie. Believe me, you will regret it!
