That's what I find I say time after time in the remarkably third 3rd act of this excuse for a movie. The first, the computer effects are absolutely mind-blowing! Those computer wizs' really deserve a pat on the back. The rest of the movie, though ... <br /> <br /> None of the characters act in a realistic way, especially the aforementioned, jerking 3rd act (I promise I will not give it away, but trust I'm not worth keeping a secret!). A lot of laughs in the movie come involved, as when trying to explain that an invisible skin does not work. Please give the viewers more credit than that !!!! Some of the sexual aspects of the movie were interesting. What would you do, after all, if you were invisible? No one can catch you! These problems have made a lot more intelligence in the classic invisible man from 1933. There is a particular scene of violence that is so incredibly ambiguous, and not to mention once later on. If more attention was paid to, Kevin Bacon's upset scientist could have made a little more sense. <br /> <br /> The movie would actually be much more successful than a porn, since the site might actually be carried out in a unique and exciting way. But this piece of work ... go see something else. Or do not, and live with the consequences! <br /> <br /> 3/10
