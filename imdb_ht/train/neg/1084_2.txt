I rent this DVD for two reasons. A cast of big actors, and the director, though Robert Altman may hit or miss. In that case, it was a great miss. Altman's attempts to create suspense falls on its keester. After seeing Kenneth Branagh in a good movie like "Dead Again," I did not think he could possibly contribute to such a turkey, and I hope he did not ruin his reputation. Robert Duvall seems to have dropped the way to most single-time winners Oscar. On a bottom spiral including the acting movie-like act like this one. Duvall was once a great actor in excellent film, though his best performance did not "Merit Tender", but "The Great Santini". This film was really a great time garbage. I give it a 2 out of 10.
