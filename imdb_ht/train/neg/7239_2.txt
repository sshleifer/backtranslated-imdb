This movie is released as a smart romantic comedy. It's neither smart nor romantic and it's definitely not an effective comedy. The fortunes of the well-meaning minor character, "Tom", are outraged by a very embarrassing disaster of another. The only saving seeds are competent performance by Toni Collete and the frequency with which we look beautiful Paltrow's face. In general, they must be avoided!
