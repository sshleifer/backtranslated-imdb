I did not watch the entire movie. I could not watch the entire movie. I stopped the DVD after watching for half an hour and I suggest anyone who thinks of watching themselves stop it before taking the disc from the case. <br /> I love Mafia movies both tragic and funny but Corky Romano can only be described as a tragic attempt at a mafia comedy. The problem is Corky Romano simply trying to find the laughing audience, the plot seems to be an excuse for moving Chris Kattan (Corky) from one scene to another. Corky itself is completely overplayed and lacking intricacies or credulity - all its strange manners come in all manner of conflict - Chris Kattan is clearly 'acting' rather than taking a role - it bounces you right out of the story. Each stage is absolutely predictable, the 'comedy event' that will occur on the series is obvious as soon as each scene is presented. In comedies like Mr. Bean the disasters caused by the character of the funny titles because you can sympathize with the character motivations and initial events and the character's character ends by not telechrafe. Corky however gives the feeling that he is deliberately blown up in a desperate attempt to draw a laugh at the audience. <br /> <br /> If Chris has not played as a foreign character (who never really connects with the other characters in the movie) and whose behavior is completely inexplicable (except to try to draw laughs) and the comedy scene was not so predictable and stereotyped - all the jokes seemed far too familiar) this movie could look. But it's not. Do not look at it.
