This motion picture comes straight from the dark dungeon at Full Moon Entertainment. This production company became fame and fortune during the first half of the 90th by producing terribly bad films and horror cheesy. The most popular disaster disaster is "Subspecies", "Seedepople" and "Trancers". None of these are recommended and neither is Dr. Mordrid, actually. Harness director Charles Band came to the company right for his film. Doctor Mordrid is amazingly dumb and cheese and almost completely humorous. I only saw it because it stars Jeffrey Combs. I learned that it can have several disadvantages if you are a fan of it. For every good movie, it looks like it did 5 people inferior. Anyways, the story is about the fight between 2 ancient magicians. A good person from 150 years to protect people (Jeffrey as Dr.Mordrid) and one cruel called Kabal. He wants to destroy all forms of human life for some reason I have already forgotten. Combs gets her instructions from counselors. That "guy" only exists in a pair of eyes in space. Very cheesy, that's what! Every once and a while a blizzard lightflash is shown on the screen, but this is the only form of special effects this movie has received. The whole thing is just a piece of envy and nagging and when the assistants of finally face each other, it's about you before you know it ... I'd expect the wicked wizard to at least fight back a little, but nooooooo .. In some scenes, you really can detect some originality and creativity (such as Jeffrey's Jeffrey's influence on the moon's influence on criminals) and if you really pay attention, you might even get some very small beautiful (like the rogue called Edgar Allen) but in general it's a terrible waste of time and energy. I'm a big fan of Jeffrey and maybe he's a superhero in my eye ... but he sure does not have to put on a stupid maillot for that.
