This movie is mediocre at best. Angie Harmon is as funny as a hammer bag. His attitude toward Bone from "Law and Order" brings about in a failed attempt to comedy. Charlie Sheen is the only one out to unscathed in this terrible anti-comedian. The only positive thing that comes from this disruption is Charlie and Denise's wedding. We hope that efforts produce better results.
