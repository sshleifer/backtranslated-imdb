Some elements that save this movie from being a total catastrophe, but are covered with bad actions, drawn draws, dein machina cast ins, stupid dialogue, weak script, and predictive rhythm ... What we have here is a horror movie with a scenario that goes nowhere for most of the time. An easy hero group including a black guy who gets it first (yeah, that glimpse seems to be very lively even in Finland), seems to have trouble trying to escape a mysterious hospital. There are ghosts called (very imaginative), zombie (at one point I thought at least they did not use zombies, but they came), with Finnish glam-rock band and demonic make-up on, getting in their way . There are also some time-changing doodle present, but it adds up to the scenario. Autistic girls and a hobo seem to have some deeper understanding of a situation, but they never spell it out to the viewer, or friends confused. The lines consist only of thinking profound life lessons like: "What will happen ..." or "Light can not live in the darkness ..." or threatening "I need a red pencil ... red pencil." So all this character (including dad worried and sweet doctors of distressed qualities) is done to run around black floors, and out of their demons mistakes. Occasionally a ghost or a group of zombies show up, and if it looks like a demon keyboardist can not spot a group of six people coming toward it, lifting a flashlight and conversation, it was just pretending. And apparently this demon can break into walls without much hassle, but open elevator doors are beyond its capacity. <br /> <br /> At the end we even get a "it's all a dream" sequence twist. Or maybe it did not. Oh, boy I wish this movie was, with what kind of time seems to move faster for it all to play out in just 10 minutes or so.
