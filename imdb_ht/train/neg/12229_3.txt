This movie started out good, I felt like I was watching an adult version of Seinfeld. Many of them quickly began to question their situation with actions of the main characters, and they did not find any answers to why they did. All the act was superb but only a few scenes were short moments where they were actually funny. Then Cortese was amazing. I loved him in this role. His agent should show this movie of silver cast. Look at the first few scenes and then get something better, or else you will find yourself totally lost in this mess. I found this in a bin in a video store. It cost me about dollars due to the richness of this movie I feel like it was a good price.
