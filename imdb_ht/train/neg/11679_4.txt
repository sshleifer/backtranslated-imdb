First, this movie is not a "thriller." Nor is it "inviting, tired." It might have been so based on the script, but speeding to slow down the direction makes it difficult to get through. The draw itself is very interesting and ingenious. Unfortunately, we only get a sense of * how * inventive spirit after the picture is over. Which leaves us with more than two hours of long sequel and music plays on them are punctuated by some unexplored action scenes, and "scant scars" scene that inhibits a little more intelligence sustained. I wish this was thrilling to recall the promised box. It would be an outstanding movie. Instead, Spike Lee did it all alongside the end.
