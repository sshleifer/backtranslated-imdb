Having read some good reviews about this movie I thought it was about time I went and saw it. Well I do not know why I bothered. Basically this family is entrusted with a sign that leads to a huge big treasure of ancient treasures, hidden by the Knights Templar during the War of Independence. Apparently he had to keep out of the hands of the British at all costs. Firstly, why are they said that Knights move the treasure in Europe America? How Nic figure figure knows that 'Charlotte' was in fact a pirate? How to figure out all the clues and riddles in about a minute? And how did people suddenly come to steal master and steal what is probably the best little watch in paperwork in the world? These are just some of the holes drawn in this horrible bit of Hollywood action to go wrong. Cage was in some big action movies - 'Face-Off' and 'Rock' - so why did he bow himself to this? Is it getting too old? Her character is very annoying really - Somehow the 'stupid' guy stole the Declaration of Independancd, outruns stealing and guns, escapes from the FBI and generally looks irresistible. The whole movie does not really make any sense and all at all it was quite a disappointment.
