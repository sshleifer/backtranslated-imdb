I wanted to read the other comments before leaving my review with the majority definitely rule: This movie is awesome! From the act of unrealistic animation to the countless mistakes. I actually hoped that the flashlights would be extended by a stretch of the imagination (can not extend flashlight without engine). The landing gear can not be lowered unless you have electricity. That little fan was gone was not enough any stretch to the lower gear landing. The one thing I thought was quite peculiar is when they landed, the wheels turned handled down and then one crushed nose, so stop the plane and both rubber back into the air. How did the commander apply left and right hand brake to tires that did not touch the ground? Have they forgotten scheduled? Word to the director: Find out * all * you can on airplane before trying a movie "plane". Sorry for technical breakdown, but I give this movie 1/10.
