Every Sunday, a trio of the buds is found together at a NYC dinner to boast about their sexual conquest of the night before. Sometimes they are together with a newlywed former boyfriend and hoochie hunters hanging on them like a pulley craft. They are looking for cows / dog dogs and Mia, who witnessed on the prowl, deciding that they need to be taught a lesson, dammit. Ergo, it will date with dump - why not? All three of them! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Gasp. What a wild idea. What a radical, naughty gal. Women are now allowed to date and sleep around as much as they want. As many people do, even! <br /> There is one clear remarkable element of "pouring" - namely the fact that not once, during the detailed amigo discussion of the bodily functions and tantric talents of the garbage bed partners, making the other customers in the turn diner around and saying, "dude, we are trying to eat here." Indeed, a heh-heh gag has a most ancient lady pressing into the useful sexual properties of certain beverages. A large fat kermit frog "Sheesh" in this. <br /> It's really unfortunate that a buddy movie with a great environment, a clever, beautiful heroine and three possible cuts had such a cop-finish finish. <br /> <br /> PS - 30 "whip-oosh" sound effects of the senarist for use in the phrase "You go, girl". She was tired of 2000, and she was tired right now. <br /> <br /> Save your time and watch some "Sex and the City" reruns ...
