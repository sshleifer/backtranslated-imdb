I can not believe that this piece of wood is written and directed by the movie club. There are approximately four good shots looking for (the director should think about switching pictures still) and that's it. A strong cast is utterly wasted, repeat ends in the least interesting moments and the script says nothing new. Please reserve yourself this movie.
