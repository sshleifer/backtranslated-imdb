This movie worries Eddy's story as mentioned in the title and her residence of old friends in a seaside community. The plot involves a group of friends as it comes to light that Eddy leaves as a means of dealing with the death of a friend in which he feels in a responsible way. But this is inconvenient, as the choices in the production are very poor and not fully realized. Screenplays do not always need 'chatty', but should at least help development of the story. Here's one line attempt like "it just took" or "I know you do not have love at heart" just to do a completely curious thing worth the time of the audience. Also every time the writer feels at a loss where to go to his next cut into a musical installment of the protagonist walking in the field of some indie mood music. Talk about trying hard. If you are interested in a good movie, the quality that gives quality and substance to just style then this is not the movie for you.
