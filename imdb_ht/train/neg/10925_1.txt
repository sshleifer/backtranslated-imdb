I'm at this moment very much debating if I should even end up watching this "poppycock" in a movie. They had a very interesting idea, and put in film buried, and that was it. So far this incomprehensible chaos has no real story. The series has been buried, some wild animals headed monster running amok, an amulet, and a bunch of bad actors attacked by wild beasts masking what it is. What I would have missed, I had the right sense to remove this nonsense is a buggy dug chase, some really bad C.G.I., some extremely stupid, worst C.G.I. dialogs, and heroes fighting papers off outs. Other than the original idea, this film has absolutely zero kind of levies. My mistake to continue to look. - MERK
