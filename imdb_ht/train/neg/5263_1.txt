This is but the worst movie I can ever remember watching. Everything was incredibly clich√© and delayed. The act was also terrible. The camera work was not bad but still could not buy it. Writer / director of this film must suffer from the syndrome below if he believes this movie would help his career. I want hours and a half of my life back that I wasted to watch this crap. I prefer to watch a video of the growing grass. I cant believe IMDb will make me write 10 lines in order to post this but I feel that this movie is so bad that I must continue to warn others about it. The reason I came to this film is that my girlfriend asked her in the local library to think that she was Christof Kristoferson movie that ended up being entitled to "Disappearances". I do not know the fault was for this garbage that ended in my DVD player but I feel that someone should pay me at least $ 20 for time, pain and suffering. In conclusion, the director / writer of this film's best hope I ever recognized him on the street.
