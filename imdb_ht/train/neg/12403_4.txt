ANDY HARDY MEETS DEBUTANTE (1940) is the ninth film (9th) of the series and shows the direction it was inevitably ruled in. Character ANDY HARDY (Mickey Rooney) and JUDGE HARDY (Lewis Stone) went to front and center. The rest of the cast went too fast to score points and collect the checks. The series would be up to the occasion again and have its moments, but it was a fatal decline put in. <br /> <br /> Lewis Stone throughout the series would continue to show the character of JUDGE HARDY in a sympathetic way. The rest of the cast should be professional even if they provide less and less iron. Mickey Rooney on the other hand would continue his character as if there was no learning curve. ANDYs' reaction in any situation was in a naive and incredible way. Even after she returned as a veteran of World War II at LOVE LAUGHS in ANDY HARDY (1946) her reaction to any 'storm teapot' was the same, juvenile. <br /> In this movie it is clearly illustrated. ANDY gets herself into many incredible situations with a simple explanation. This writing screen reader is known as the 'Draw Idi'. A way to extend a bad story writing. Maybe it was less Mickey Rooneys' fault then the director and writer. Most likely George B. Seitz has led one too many with a hand that firmly needs too much to control Rooneys' excesses. To see our overview of the entire series going to you is only YOUNG ONCE (1937).
