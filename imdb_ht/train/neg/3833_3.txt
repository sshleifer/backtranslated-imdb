This film is a travesti, and it does not fit holding company with the original superiority. The plot is an absolute mess, and the movie is way too long. Each time they are struggling, they desperately inject a sentimental reminder from the movie first. <br /> <br /> The "Gregory Girl" is one of the top 10 British films of all time, this one is terrible.
