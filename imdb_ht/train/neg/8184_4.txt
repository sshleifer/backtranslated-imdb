This is almost like two films - one literary and engaging, the other stupid and clich√©. It's really a shame all the issues have not worked out with the writing, but consider how quickly the most B-movies were written and produced, this is not too unusual. It's a real shame, though, as this could be a very good movie. <br /> <br /> The first good. The film is original and involves WWII Code-breaker. This is very fascinating and I loved watching the leading man (Lee Bowman) going to his march as a rope-breaker master. In fact, the first two-thirds of the movie were pretty good. But now for the bad, the movie just goes on too long road and loses steam in about 50 minutes. In addition, the role of Jean Rogers as "kooky girlfriend" is to rank as one of the worst-wrestling and distracting role in movie history !! For every clever movement made by Bowman, the fool Rogers then resigned to the vice things as some sort of executing "comedy relief". If his role was intelligently written, the movie would generally have improved! Instead, look at it, it's hard to understand how we actually won WWII !!
