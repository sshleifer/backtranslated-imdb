Or: It's a Bird? Is an aircraft? No, look ... It's a disaster! or: Do not look in the sky. <br /> or: (... ok, that's enough.) If singer tried to make a titanic boyfriend like the movie crash file box folder, he failed. The SR structure can not do this, black color scheme and restriction (I would call it "wanti-washi"), the usual usual dialogues, the sort and advanced foreign technology, the missing and magical fun, etc. make the film completely disappointing. <br /> <br /> It simply does not work. <br /> <br /> The main thing of a character like Superman is, that it is a superhero. That's the core, the most important thing. <br /> <br /> Love problem with a sad depression Supersoftie can only be the only one to have a facet of a 2:40 long film Superman, not the whole time. <br /> <Because then it is not a superman movie or superhero anymore. It's like (and in this case a very bad and boring) social study, where every 30 minutes a person jumps around. <br /> <br /> This is a big difference. a joke. Holy Skywalker, this is Superman, so gives us supervillains, superaction and most important things, Superfun. <br /> We want ENTERTAINMENT! Singer, if you want to make a 2-year long soul love drama about losing and sadly? Then take abnormal human character and make a yawning reminder. <br /> They say: Superman returns. Then, supersadlysoftie standing at the door. <br /> <br /> Perhaps singer tried to kill the saga without kryptonite, but a bad movie can not do that. Do not give up, they plan an end ... <br /> Next time singer (and Warner Brothers), make a superhero movie, not a superabsorbable depression, or let it be. A superhero movie means a colorful fantasy and a lot of fun and magic. This movie is like a very cheap chocolate box with a super blank. Yes, technically there are all kinds of, yes, there are a lot of small talks, there are a few jokes, a scene seen scenes, etc., but the only one that all these worst pieces in common is poor quality. br> <br /> It's not more than a super boring patchwork and one of the worst movies I've ever seen in my live. <br /> <br /> Strategy to throw ridiculous (Put as fast as possible, so we can do the end of the next 25 years) to give the rest. Kate Bosworth plays a 22 year old reporter star, she was looking like 19. Superman was full five years away, so she lay with her 6 years ago, so she was 16, (looking like 13) and a daily planet reporter, wroting "I spend one night with superman". Warner Brothers, that's too much. <br /> <br /> Routh is not so bad, it is playing a little wooden, but the movie all is wooden, so ...? Temporary bonds were massage and sometimes posey. All the rest, forget it. Even spongy, this is not his terrain. <br /> <br /> Reeve / Hackman / Kidder has been acting so easy, and fun. What a difference. <br /> <br /> Jesus also poses in the end to ridiculous too. What the Hell Should Be? The problem here is, to say this serious, not like a joke. The next time Spiderman or Batman or Ironman fell and rose like Jesus or angels? Or talk to God directly. Why? They are superheroes, saving human life every day. So at least one talk and weekly weekly should be possible ... Oh my god. <br /> <br /> Perhaps this was not the real movie announced, instead it is from a scarce parallel to universe. <br /> For the warner brothers this overpressive film will be the greatest disaster in history. Not only because of the money. <br /> I understand how difficult it (perhaps) was to create and transport some messages or feelings, but showing salt, losing and unfortunately not new and thousands of movies or TV shows made it the best, in pretty old or new ones like Magnolia. And the flying frogs were more impressive than this superwoman fly, sorry, superman of course. <br /> <br /> Singer and WB, this simply has nothing. In fact it's even more than nothing, it's like a black hole that destroys the passion for (comic / superhero) cinema and steals us three hours in our lives. Smilla's younger brother. (Very angry and green like the mountain.)
