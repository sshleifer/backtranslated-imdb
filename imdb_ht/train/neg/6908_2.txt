This series was potential, but I suppose the budget would not allow it to see the potential. An interesting setup, not dissimilar to "lost" it falls flat after the 1st episode. The whole series, 6 episodes, could have made a 90 minutes compelling film, but the musicians chose to drag him over and over. Many of the scenes were uncertain to slow down with time without moving the action forward. The music was very annoying and did not work in general. There were some characters we care about as the characters did not grow during the time frame --- well, one grew up a bit. The finish was as terrible as the rest of the series. The only kudos here is the art unfamiliar with putting the dressers, to create an interesting look, too bad to the writer and director was missing the prospect to do something interesting with this element
