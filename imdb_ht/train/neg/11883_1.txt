After waking up at 3:30 in the morning and unable to go to sleep, I decided that I could as well be entertained while I was suffering from sleep deprivation. This movie was about HBO and I decided to watch it. What a mistake! <br /> Here is the plot (Potential Defeat, if you care): a neurotic person with a candy addiction (Josh Kornbluth) works as a temp for some ridiculous companies. At the same time, she offers the opportunity to "go perm," which seems to be the favorite hit-phrase movie. But with a safe job and a safe income from him, Josh decides for whatever stupid reasons he does not want to do. He hopelessly bugles several minor works and his laziness and lack of ambition to fill me with contempt. His inability to send "very important" letters to a given amount of time is supposed to be hilarious, but it's simply stupid. Josh meets and deceives a lawyer and winds up her bed (obviously a fantasy of Josh in real life, as something would never happen). A lot of other things are happening, but it's too scathing and unkind to now. Despite the fact that this film is billed as a comedy, I only laugh twice as it; The first shot was the opening shot of Josh Kornbluth (my initial reaction was one of the fake passionate) and the second was when she was in bed with the attractive woman (yes, right). Josh Kornbluth is perhaps the worst-looking person I've ever seen in my life. It is an unattractive, overweight, balding Jewish man who I suppose to have sex with beautiful women. I'm not in all sympathy with Josh's character. It is lazy and unmotivated and I just do not appreciate the failed attempts of humor. Skip it, though your life depends on it.
