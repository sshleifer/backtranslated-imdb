I just read a review to defend this movie because it has a low budget, now taking me on things. <br /> <br /> The CGI monsters were reasonably well-animated but were applied in the worst possible way. The fighting scene did not even fight it was just one shot of an actor then one shot of monster with lots of interaction at all. When the monster interacted it looked like it did in the paintshop pro. In my opinion if you have a low budget you should use patterns and puppets. They can not look like fancy but at least interact, just looking at Peter Jackson's early film. <br /> <br /> As for the Beowulf acting a descent work but the rest of the cast were either not trying or forgotten where to location. <br /> <br /> The script seemed to be confused with me. One minute they would talk as if it was a modern day the next setting you found to Shakespeare's Shakespeare club drama. I do not say it should be all 'you' and 'that it owe, but you need to get a balance so the lines are sound like they are from the same person. <br /> I've noticed one part near the start when Beowulf quoted the old test that would get it not spent the rest of the films talking about the gods and the ports. In short, this film is a very little polished Turd, but a spin no less.
