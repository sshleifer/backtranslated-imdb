Seriously, I read some of the reviews on this movie, and I must ask, you've been watching the movie. Yes, I gave the directors a lot of credit so they could recreate 1930's old Los Angeles, but so what? <br /> <br /> None of the characters is unmatched, the story looks haphazard, Karen Black is simply not a very good actress. Donald Sutherland is just icky. (and his character "Homer Simpson" makes me want for the animated version .. D'oh!) Then you've got the clown kids actor, Billy Barty's Creepier, and so on. <br /> <br /> This is one of these movie cinema movies and the rest of us look at each other and go, "What the heck!"
