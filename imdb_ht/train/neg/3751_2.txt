I'm a big fan of David Lynch. This movie, however, was a very disappointing experience. Apart from the background background music? which really sets the mood in the movie ?? It misses almost all the qualities that I have become associated with Lynch work. The visuals are dull, say the least, and the dialogue is vague and monotonous to be of any interest. <br /> <br /> This feels more like an awkward movie student trying to make an artistic dogma film than the work of an experienced director. I've seen a lot of amateur movies and far superior camera-work, scenery, sounds and script. This movie lacks almost all kinds of art. I feel as though I'm watching one of David's home videos, which was produced during a weekend trip with some friends.
