No spoilers. <br /> I love horror movies, but this has to be the poorest attempt to make one ever. Calling her "a movie" is also a stretch. This "random-click-clip-of-obviously-false-and-tacky-violence-and-an-ugly-woman-trying-to-act-sexy-edited-harm-together" is not worth seeing. <br /> <This look is about as interesting lentics as pictures of some random family holiday, and it has on the same quality you would expect when you send your ten years old son in the woods and your new blank-cam, and tell her to make a movie. <br /> Terrible.
