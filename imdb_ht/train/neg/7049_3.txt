The only thing worse than surfer without any waves is a movie about surfers without any wave. For viewers who like to browse this movie will be a gigantic deception since the total number of minutes of literal foot navigation to reach three. <br /> <br /> The story is a slice of life on beach surfers that are waiting for perfect waves, but for any wave at all. J.C (Sean Pertwee) is a super surfer surfer who is flirting with a commitment to his girlfriend Chloe (Catherine Zeta Jones). Just as she's about to get grown Bliss and the woman she likes, three old surfing friends turn up and convince him to hit the beach looking for monster waves in the bone yard. The problem is, there is no wave until the very end of the movie, so most of the story disappears itself on a shaft succession of captivating beaches disconnected. <br /> <br /> The act is mostly mediocre. Sean Pertwee has a funny moment, but especially his actions were Munden. Ewan McGregor was decent as the drug faces wild people, by far the most interesting and peculiar character of the bunch. Probably the funniest performance was turned into by Peter Gunn as Terry who turned his corpulent into an ongoing eye gage. Catherine Zeta-Jones was sexy as usual, but her character did not really have enough meat for her to show much acting ability. <br /> There is really not much here that was about comment. I rated it a 3/10. It is a real beach bomber.
