This is one of the most boring movies I've ever seen, its awful. Christopher Lee is good but it is hardly in it, only the good part is the opening stage. <br /> <br /> Do not be fooled by the title. "The End of the World" is really a bad movie, I stopped watching it close to the end it was so bad, only to die hard b-movie fans whose brain has stopped this vomiting.
