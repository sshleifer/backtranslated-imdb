Before watching this movie, I had great expectations and I went to see the cars. Eventually I was even sorry to go for that purpose. Drawn is almost non-existent. Character development non-existent. So many cliche and many jaw-dropping cheese existed in the movie that I could only fix and wonder how it was even released. If not for the exotic, I would not have even rated this movie a 1. An attempt at a coherent story line is destroyed by the sheer absurdity of this elite racing kitten and the scam characters that make up its members. In fact, drawing the movie is so predictable and simple-minded that an average child could foretell the majority of the storyline. Bad act, draw bad, bad jokes, bad movie. <br /> <br /> Do not see it. Play Gran Turismo HD instead and it will satiate your thirst for fast speed cars without leaving a bad taste.
