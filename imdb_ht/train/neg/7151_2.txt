I am proud to have seen all three quick and furious films.Well, the plots are kinda funny, and can be a little cheesy, but I love to chases cars, and all the beautiful cars, and the clandestine night races . And happy to see a fourth. <br /> <br /> <br /> Want to know which differences between these three and Redline? Acting slowly, somewhat thought out drawn, though potboilers, and last but not least, directors with a sign.All three were made by very competent directors, all of them taking the movies into a different directions, equally interesting. Redline looks like the producer chooses out a dozen women she sleeps and on the casting couch, and makes them extra, then picked up her lead from Hollywood's unemployment line. With her script.ikes them. Mystery Science Theater 3000 is bad.This is the 70's made for bad TV movie. <br /> Yeah, the movie has a few cool cars, but you do not really get to see that much of action, and the action is so bad that you cant get excited by the chases, a D if the machines are not thrilling Do you, why go to a movie like this? <br /> Im the audience with a bunch of adolescents, and I cant stop laughing loudly. I'm getting dirty looks, but this was just a faculty. <br /> Rent F & F movies.Go Race Race Mask .Go through a karting track and race yourself. Whatever you do, avoid redline like evil cheese.
