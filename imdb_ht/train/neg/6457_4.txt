I guess I've seen movie worse, but that may be because I'm so jaded by how these bad horror movies are. The killer monster bag is really really bad, basically it's a guy of some kind of green body suit. There are many worse to act as far as B movie goes, but do not think for a second this was anything stellar, hell no. He actually had a plot and substance, but it was still very stupid. Basically it's just a bad movie movie. But at least not its as bad as Titanic, that film sucks balls, this one just sucks. The blood seems really fake in this movie. One complaint I have about all the horrors of the new milinium, low Gore class, looks stupid. A good, virtuous, and bloody scene is so stupid. At least there was a nice shower scene
