I was looking for the right words to describe this movie. At first I was inclined to simply jump into more important matters, such as the movie does not rise to a level that deserves comment. <br /> But I stopped, believe how to describe things and somewhat intrigued by the challenge presented by the question: "What can one say about this movie?" Garbage? No, it does not waste, trash can be recycled into something useful. Fuel greenhouse gas? No, gas does not produce its greenhouse, greenhouse gases help grow plants and health. Finally, I was struck by "Not even bad," a rework of "Not even Evil" phrases sometimes used in theoretical physics to describe a theory that is hopelessly flawed and not even worthy of correction. This is when Georgia regulation: Not even bad.
