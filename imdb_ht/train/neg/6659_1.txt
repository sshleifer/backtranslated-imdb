During the first 3 seasons Enough parents parents were as tasty as hard candies, bright and sweet and addictive. Now it's as delicious as Pepto-Bismol. And unfortunately Pepto-Bismol is what you will need after watching the most recent episodes, where all the sweet was replaced by insult and violence that can cause no laugh. Cosmo, once one of the more undesirable Nick characters, has been revealed to an unfunny abusive crisis that is thrown into Family Guy would not even want to know. Timmy became an arrogant jokerwoman who Bart Simpson would happily beat the snot out (and give Timmy's snottiness, which would take a lot of beats). And poor Wanda ... a real charmer who became the victim of her husband and godchild, she's now labeling a "nail" to care for other people's welfare. Plus Cosmo's stomach causes pain to all others but it never punishes for it or learns any lessons. What a splendid sum up Butch Hartman's attitude toward the kids: they're rude, vulgar and not too bright. Thanks to this tone to the silver tone, and Butch Hartman's darling, Danny Phantom. At least Butch got what he deserved - unlike cosmo.
