I had good luck in reading the book before seeing the movie. It was a season of adolescence, a summer summer dream, a great independent film or big drama budget. It somehow got into the hands of a hack, who clearly took notes watching Boogie Nights and Rushmore without actually learning anything at all. The script loses the flesh of the book in favor of forceful emotional notes and leaf gums. I feel sorry for the actors, since the characters in the book were rich and textured, but cut down into embarrassing characters in the movie. Mason Gamble is great when giving the opportunity, as is Dylan Baker, but the skeleton left in the story plays out as a bad after special school. Poor = GOOD, Rich people = BAD. Even though it's almost worth watching to see the South California beach where Gary Sinise parks its trailer is meant to pass for a Bay in Delaware. <br /> It's a good book, but a nasty turn for first-time director Goods Mills. <br /> <br /> K.
