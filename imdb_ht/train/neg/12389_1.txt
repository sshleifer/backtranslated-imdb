Model Chris McCormack (Margaux Hemingway) is brutally raped by a teacher (Chris Sarandon) at his sister Kathy (Mariel Hemingway). It has led to trial but goes totally free. She then raped Kathy! <br /> <br /> Censorship and Sex Rape Rape. This movie has been published as a major drama that deals with rape. What it is a wrong writing and (for the most part) seriously acting drama. He claims to be sympathetic victim of the rape, but shoves the scene in our face. To be honest however, Hemingway's act is so bad in the sequence that it loses any real impact it might have. The trial scenes were boring and predictable. And the movie just goes too far when 15 years old Mariel is violated (thankfully not being shown). I admit if he did lead to a great end when marginal tram a gun and sarandon shoots die. But seriously - having a girl raped is just rioting. <br /> <br /> Interim does not help. For example, Margaux had no actress. She was certainly a beautiful woman (and a real model I believed), but she acted out a lot to be willing. It reduces the movie. Mariel was just OK but this was one of her first films. Sarandon does what she can be as violent. It was not wrong, but the terrible script worked against him. <br /> I remember hearing that in a screening this back in 1976 some women got up and happy when Sarandon killed so maybe this works for some people. I found this boring, simplistic and really sick. A 1 all the way.
