Watching Smother was perhaps the longest-not-well-90-minute life in my life. There was not a laugh to be; In fact, I do not remember ever cracking a smile. Diane Keaton was critically infinite as a dog-dog dog among the dog-smoking dogs, the overbearing mother's book, a relentlessly irresponsible woman who clearly suffered from some type of personality disorder. It is manipulative, conniving, melodramatic, nasty, narcissistic, and worst of all, boring. <br /> I think I should briefly mention the other characters, but why harassed? It was just a long string of film - dippy's cliches, socially stupid distant relatives who are just trying to break into the "industry", the gruff and suffering but somehow still lovable father, the mild-who-wife just can not take it again (but eventually move beyond the chaos and homework coming home), unheated breed dogs who love to throw pillow while everyone is away, etc. <br /> <br /> God, what a snore. I've never been a fan of Keaton fans and Smother just remind me why. Overlap is overacting, no matter how many photos you have done in your prime. His attempt at physical comedy was mostly humiliating. What was the director thought? <br /> While I love Dax Shepard and may even sometimes tolerate the Book of Tyler, the performance was so subtle and dull that it was clear that neither actors had given a curse on this movie. That was okay, because it was not I. Keaton 's independent principle was absorbed and intolerable in Shepard' s times to look genuine. At the end of the film I wanted to calm him myself. <br /> <br /> Fear.
