This "math" aspect is simply a guard to try to put this TV apart from millions of other cop shows. The only redemption aspect of this show is Rob Morrow, although his career was due (uneservedly) decrease after Northern exhibits if he signed for this slip. <br /> <br /> Army-ness in the "math" aspect of the show included in one episode co-starring Lou Diamond Phillips (which just confirms that this show is the last refuge of the Dane.) The order to catch a save, the "math" uses some theory about "bubbles". So it gives this explanation so long ago, if we saw the suspect in places A, B and C, then we can use "bubble theory" to calculate where it might be. It does all on a board, or maybe with a stick in the dirt (I can not remember). <br /> <br /> Anyway, when you look at the finished product, it basically took three spots, and took a right point in the middle and said "Ok, math, here's where we have more likely to get saved. " At that point, another character points out "Oh, this point is also happening to the cabin where the guy lived." Is this math? It does not even connect f ** k ** g-points !!! This show reminds me of the greatest math I used to work with the Banker who had a mathematical analysis that he could do in the "support" point that another one had already agreed on in either less complex or common basis analysis sans. > <br /> It's just going to show - When you're a hammer, everything looks like a nail. I can not wait to beat the team's NUMB3RS on OSAMA ... They will use calculations, call an airstrike in the middle of the hills, and hit Osama and not even scratch the five children he uses as human shields. cuz hey ... it's all about the numbers. <br /> <br /> Totally funny TV shows.
