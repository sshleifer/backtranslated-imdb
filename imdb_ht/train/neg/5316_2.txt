Throw this dog host a bone. Sooo bad ... you can look anyway. Col (Ross Hagen) is a malicious intergalactic guy who survived being vaporized by a zealous Spatial Commander (John-Michael Vincent). Kol managed to steal a craft that crashes Earth on Earth. An irresistible Android killer throws back the villain dead or alive. John Phillip Law plays a jungle / park ranger who fosters caution in dealing with those two far, far away visitors. Costumes are outrageous and the script is missing intelligence. Vincent surely took the money and ran. Laws show the only sign of effort. So bad it is almost funny. Also at disposal: Dyana Ortelli, P.J. Soles and Dawn Wildsmith.
