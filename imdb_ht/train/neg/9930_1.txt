A relentless and undue painfully patient attempt to grab the character of Sheriff Bart from Mel Brooks's sudden saddles at his own weekly sitcom, this is really as bad as some people say it is! Only serve to remember the unamused viewer that all of this comedy is supposed to intend a joke and just how desperate for laughing it really is! <br /> However, it is a bit interesting to see Louis Gossett Jr. trying his best to imitate Little Cleavon. Her embarrassment shows off in every scene. He was funnier much of El Diablo's HBO movie than he was here in this slab of cheese! <br /> <br /> Surely the best and funniest thing about Black Bart is the name of her horse!
