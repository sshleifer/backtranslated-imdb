*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** When I saw a preview for this movie I thought it was going to atleast a slightly admirable storyline. But as most original cinemas superstitions I left disapointed. This gullible family ends up driving in this "deserted" city to take a brake and get this video camera showing people doing everything they laud and finding them all eventually disappearing, the family goes through all the mysterious steps and never discover or show what the heck will follow. They are more gaps than I can count and do not explain anything that happens how or what. It ends where the family gets into a car crash and get owned or brainwashed or something (never explained). The next thing you know is hoping to somehow find out how everything has happened, but it does leave you completely confused.
