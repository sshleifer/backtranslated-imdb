All you really need to know about this movie comes after the opening stage, where a guy falls into a lake and gets to eat. Then start rolling the title credits: You see "jar!" In big letters, follow shortly afterwards by the "film." WHEW! I was worried I was accidentally hooked in "jar: Music" or "The jar: The game show." Anyway, out of the movie has deteriorated into a kill-fest. You see a guy cut his hand because he had bullets in his gardening gloves, two people get attacked by bullets while having sex, and a girl falls on his back in an underground passage to get rotten to death by ball assassins. It's a very funny movie, falling into this "bad-it-good" category. He also shot so badly with the fruit films that you are shocked to learn he did in 1988 (I guess in 1974). I am very surprised to have received such a score as much as he has here, because most people here do not give these types of films any love. But if you want a movie that tries to be afraid but end up being mockingly, this is one of your first candidates.
