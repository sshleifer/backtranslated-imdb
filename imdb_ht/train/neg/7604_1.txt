Ensure it takes place in the west, but the title makes it seem like it's a conventional west. Instead, it is a movie of a sheriff woman. Make no mistake even though this is a bad movie about a female sheriff. She becomes sheriff when her husband goes down; It's just a bit tough. Its main goal is to go after the villain who is also a woman, but the villain hires a guy to kill her. So this is what happens, the hero falls in love with the killer and vice versa. Outterly stupid, as anyone who dies in this movie has the new sheriff thanked. He had more than a few chances to put the killer behind bars, but I guess because he liked it he would not do it. The assassin is also after the mayor of the city for personal reasons that are also rather dumb. This film is very boring and not really worth watching ... is not one of the best episodes of MST3000. I can not imagine anyone who sees this without them because that would make it more painful. Corman is a low budget director, but even he should know better than having people go from one place to another.
