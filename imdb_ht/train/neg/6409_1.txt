I just saw this movie yesterday ... I can not believe the reviews on this site. That gives it to one-star to be fancy buffy. Well, I'm a buffy fan of the first order, but I know crap when I see it. On each level, this movie is terrible. Technically, many of the time you do not know where you are in this movie, even in one scene, it skips Pov like crazy for no reason. There is no logic as well in the cinematic terms. Emotionally is weak for weak relief and attempts to be a psychological thriller when it is just confusing. Sending embarrassing-looking red-haired to your movie is a cheap way to convey "atmosphere". I ran out of patience with it a long time before the last act, but I had too much fun with my friends to make the MST3K riffs to turn it off. Since leaving Buffy, SMG has had 2 successful successes, even if the list of "Scooby Doo" on summary can be counted. Gellar is a fine actress, but she (or his agent) sure can not find a car for her. And Mr. Shepard, if you have problems paying your mortgage, I'll send you a few bucks if you promise not to appear in a movie like this again! (Also, Real Estate of Patsy Cline should go prosecute for libel!)
