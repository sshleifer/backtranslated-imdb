I said this in other reviews, without a story, you can give the audience all the smoke and mirrors you want, still no one gives a damn. <br /> <br /> The principal seems to have a great eye for 30s art deco (which I like), and I think the idea of ​​using all digital backgrounds and what might be true wave of the future to make films. However, it is obvious that the director was so interested in the digital rendering of his films, he forgot the many scenes that would enormously help this movie to overlook the echo. (SPOILER) To cry aloud, they forget that there is a wicked person in this thing! OK they have one, but he died for 20 years by the time the movie takes place. Conran misses the point in hiding a villain. As far as action goes, well let's see, Sky Captain (Law) throws down one robot, two or three of the wings flapping wings (before Dex (Ribisi) tells him to stop shooting them down !!!), and a couple robot, but mostly spend her time superbly looking and getting the other people to fight her fight for him. Paltrow as Polly or Peggy or Punky or Whatever totally wasted in this movie (the review commenting on her body and the Law of Chemistry is so right) and I for one got a little sick of seeing the repeated shots The top of her camera, showing her only been from left side shots, both of which she wiped immediately to the movie, one consent, one quite funny, although I saw it coming from 70 years gone. No one except Law and Paltrow has any significant time on the screen, and that's the real movie fault. An audience is not identified with robots, they need a root hero for, with a visible, hateful jumble. Without that, plus a good story engaging, all CGs in the world will not help.
