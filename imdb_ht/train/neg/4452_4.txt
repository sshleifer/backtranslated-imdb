Let's just say I had to stop my disbelief less for Spiderman than I did for Hooligans. That is, say, I'm less of a problem believing Toby McGuire can stick to building than I made Elija Wood throwing down and hard in Manchester. I'm not going to get into specifics, as I do not want to write a beck, but the idea of ​​adult, professional, British person getting in close to Scraps' death every weekend is, well ... funny. And this movie is not. The battle, the idea of ​​battle, is to take away too badly. The gravity of the pugilism, the reverence and the subject of treaty becomes irritating, as it establishes or resolves the conflict. It looks as though the plot, with huge pits enough to drive a Guiness truck, was slapped along with a "theme from the theme" water so that viewers can contemplate the eyes of Woods as he learns how to become a person ie. Hit other young men in opposing football flavors and blunt objects and then run away as fast as he can. Characters are cartoonish, especially Americans in Harvard. The character development and story lines are telegraphed to the viewer throughout the picture. Unfortunately, the absurdity of the movie does not reach its height until almost the end, which is not then you will spend almost two hours in your life will never be back. Pick up the "football factory" or "Fight Club" instead of this shark, and irritating dude. It does not waste time with blank melodrama, tired of the old "Yankee at King Aurthur's Court," or parable, the parable comes to Bullsh * age. They're just pure, dark, and smart fun; the way the violence is supposed to happen.
