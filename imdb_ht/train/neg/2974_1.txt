I'm a nice guy, and I like to think of myself as genuine tolerant. And, I guess, I mean I try to consider a movie in the context of the genre that she lives in. If there is nothing else, save me to feel like I should say really nasty thing about people or films, which I do not like to do. <br /> The plot of this one was eventually obvious, the production value is very low, it sets, uhm, simplistic. The act of "good for a high school play" territory from time to time. I feel this was filmed in a day - please tell me it was. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />, chicks while lying on a bed pulling to suffer an arm ...). There was definitely no "corner" of it at all - nothing distinguished or interesting, and surprisingly fast cut. <br /> <br /> My vote is a "1" then with this statement the following summaries: better if the filler material was fillered into the expanding club, and the rest of the condensed film.
