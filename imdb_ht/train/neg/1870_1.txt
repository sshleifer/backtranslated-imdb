I used to still love the bill because of its great script and character, but lately I felt as if it had become an emotional kind of soap. If you look at promotions / posters in the bill now you will see either two officers hugging / kissing or doing something with friends while promoting photos of the bill a long time ago would have shown something done and crime. This proves that he has changed a lot from being a dramatically dramatic drama drama to an average type of soap TV. When I look it I feel like I'm watching a police version of Coronation Street or something similar. I've always said I'm like the bill as I'm interested in police work and what kind of stuff but I really miss the magnitude that the Bill used to have. I want to rate it as 2 out of ten because you have admitted it was totally ruined by the person who took the bill on. As for the script and the characters have both gone down, most of the great characters are going now (although a few still stay I think) and I'm not saying that the newest characters are poor or nothing because they definitely are Not that, just that they miss the hard looks, personality and script lines that all of the old characters used to have because most of the new ones at the moment are involved with comical relationships and family issues . <br /> <br /> Overall being one of the only TV programs on these days, the Bill is still something interesting to watch, but as I say it has lost a lot of its uniqueness (si this spelling of rights) and would now be classified as a terrible, real TV. <br /> Recommend to look for a good laugh about the sort of police officers involved - 2/10
