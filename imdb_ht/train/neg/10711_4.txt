The minion is about ... well, a minion. A servant of Satan and his goal is to find the key that will unlock the door where his master is trapped. It is some sort of evil spirits who own human beings and when the body dies will possess another. Anyone who owns will go on some berserker dreams. Dolph Lundgren plays Lukas, a member of a secret order in Templars, who is tasked to keep the key away from the minion. The movie starts a thousand years ago, in the Middle East where a couple of templar knights ran out of the minion. Then flash forward to 1999, where the key keys go upstairs in New York. An archeologist is assigned to study / locate where the key was found. Needless to say, the minion is after the key, and the movie becomes a long scene chasing between the minion and Lukas and archeology. <br /> <br /> The movie is just that, a low budget B movie movie flick. The movie lacks energy, and just trods together. You will follow the chase, but you will never feel involved in the story that voluntarily takes the idea out of the movie before (especially the Terminator films). The fighting scene and the minion is troublesome, in which you never get the sense of how good or how a bad warrior is the devil. It "skillfully" becomes a one-man host when fighting a squad in but full time absorbed when it comes to one-on-one. And it is assumed around for a long time. All this goes to show that any sense of logic is just dropping down the drain for convenience. The whole idea of ​​a secret order in Templar, a door to hell, and the key is not well explained. We simply accept that they just exist. The film seems to have made and the feeling there's not much potential in the story, but only enough to make a few bucks. Dolph Lundgren sure he wants to be somewhere else. <br /> <br /> The verdict: 2 of the 5 stars.
