I have not yet decided if this will replace Anaconda as "the worst movie I've ever seen". Even if you ignore the dodgy accents, low output values ​​and graphic camera work this movie has absolutely nothing to do for it. I only saw her as I read the book and wanted to see how they would work the complicated scheme of a 2-hour movie. <br /> <br /> The simple answer is - they did not. Character appears and little has no explanation of who they are and continue to play no significant part in the narrative. Even the main characters act unreasonably so that when the movie reaches its bigger you do not care what's happening to any of them. <br /> I can accept that books occasionally need to write to the movie fit and that it is perhaps unfair to judge this movie against the book she has adapted to. But after my friends and I came from the movie I spent most of the tour home explaining what was supposed to happen. <br /> They even change the true meaning of the book titles "Aluminum Rancid" by pressing it in again another piece of freeware voice just so they can allow the movie to have a cool title. <br /> A real mess in a movie from start to finish.
