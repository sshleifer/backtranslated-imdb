I saw the movie last night here at home, but I thought it was too long first of all. Secondly, the things I saw in the movie were way too out of text even in this what I thought they were going to have a movie type of comedy like the previous one. Things are not funny in the movie: fianc√© hit her girlfriend, beating. The movie was way too long - talk about wanting to go to sleep and wonder when it will end when you wake up and still have it playing! Some of the things at the meeting were too much to take - like the song lady - I felt like I was almost watching a spiritual song shown here! come on Perry, you can do better then!
