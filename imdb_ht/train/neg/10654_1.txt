Big hair, big boobs, bad music and a giant security pin ....... These are the words that best describe this horrible movie. I love cheese cinema movies and I've seen hundreds .. but this has to be over at the worst ever ever made. The plot is thin and ridiculous paper, the act is an abomination, the script is completely ridiculous (the best is confrontation at the end with the cop and how it worked out who the killer is in just so modest terribly writing), the clothes are usually and funny in the same measure, the hair is great, lots of bounce bounce, men wear these teal-off shirts that show off their abdomen (libelous men actually put them !!) and the music It's just rubbish that plays on and over again ... in almost every scene there is music, sane and paramedic to take away body .... and the gym is still not closed for weight loss! All joking about this place is a really bad movie that has only charms to look back on the disaster that has been around 80 and have a good old laugh in how bad everything was back then.
