I enjoyed the film, emotionally, intellectually, and visually. It does not have any violence or gender or drug or special effects, and it does not need to be a bit, keeping my attention at all times with the visuals, stories, and interprets of wisdom. <br /> However: 1] some of the foreign language accents have made the dialogue difficult to hear and understand; [2] There is too much to swear (especially the F-word, which is the only reason that this movie rated R). [3] The film is balanced with humor and emotion, but most of the emotion that keeps you in the movie, except the final minute resolution, is unpleasant due to exaggerated long-lasting dysfunctional responses to some of the characters of losses, the living The depths of bitter and depression are too long. [4] I will not recommend this movie because of the 5-second background narratives, which did not add a bit of side-character to it applied to, or the movie - it only turned me into the movie and Stuck in my brain in the whole movie and later: the mother of the main character of German ancestors, when watching old WWII cinema, "rooted in secret for the Germans." There would be no "local color" or art if the Nazi won the war. I do not know in any German today except radical scouts who think the world would be a better place if the Nazi was the Nazi.
