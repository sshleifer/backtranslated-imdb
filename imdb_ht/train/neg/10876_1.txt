What the hell of a D-movie was that? Bad acting, adverse effects and the worst / storyline dialogs I ever come across. The only cool thing here was Coolio, who had a nice comedy as a freaked cop out. However, the rest of the movie is terrible and boring. It's not so bad, you can laugh about it. Just plain crap. And whoever compares this to Death Might Series might as well compare Tomb Raider Indiana Jones (well, although at least there was Angelina Jolie in Raider)! 1 out of 10
