WARNING! Do not even consider watching this movie in any form. It's not even worth downloading from the internet. Every bit of pornography has more substance than this scattered piece of seluloid. The so-called filmmakers apparently have absolutely no idea how to make a movie. They could not say a good joke to save their lives. It is a reproach to anyone. If you are looking for a fun-filled movie - go look elsewhere. <br /> Let's hope this Mr. Unterwaldt ("Jr." being a good indication of its obvious inexperience and childhood) has died a slow / painful death and NEVER made a movie again. <br / > In fact, it's even a waste of time to write all about this crap, that's why I'll stop now and rather watch a good movie.
