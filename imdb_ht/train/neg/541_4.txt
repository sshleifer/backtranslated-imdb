I found this movie to be quite a square. From the many get going I found it very difficult to like this movie, and now after a little thought about it I can pretty much pinpoint the reason why. Jean-Marc Barr, although I love him in bits (I think santropa is one of the best movies ever to do) is quite bad here, and although I can not figure out the life of me who would be most Well, I'm sure someone would take his place easily and make this movie work. Everything else is good, except for the elves of weak comedy (A Meet Joke Parents Do not Really Want, Filmmakers!) And I really love Richard E. Grant as the Great British. It just suffers from one thing .. Jean-Marc.
