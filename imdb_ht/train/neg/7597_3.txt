I love the deposition of the 30s and 40s in film. I love Salma Hayek. I was more than ready to love this picture. men. . . <br /> <br /> BONOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO! ! ! !! ! <br /> No gentleman, nothing good about that. The only aspect of my being Colin Farrell's character is an insecure writer and this movie, despite addressing the juicy topic of racism, approaching the audience in the fashion of an ABC Afterschool Special. did not sound like he was "acting" was Sutherland, and his minutes were few. <br /> <br /> Rules approach to a tired draw.
