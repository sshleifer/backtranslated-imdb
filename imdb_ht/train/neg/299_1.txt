This was noted by the third in SLEEPING with the Nemesis After YAARANA (1995) and AGNISAKSHI (1996) <br /> <br /> AGNISAKSHI was the only one who worked and was a better movie <br /> DARAAR is led by Abbas Mustan who sadly failed in the attempts here <br /> <br /> The story was good but the touch was not that good and the heroine showed too aggressive and the climax was also disappointing <br /> <br /> Direction is bad Music is good <br /> Rishi reiterates his role in YAARANA (strange who also was a remake of SWT) and looks too fat for the lead and Juhi okay is decent while Arbaaz tries too hard in his debut, he manages to perform a lot of frenzy audiences, but his voice was awful Johny too strong
