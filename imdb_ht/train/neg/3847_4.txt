There's a lot of problems with Helen and none of it's good. Shelley Winters and Debbie Reynolds play mom in a pair of Leopold & Loeb as Killer moves from the mid-west to Hollywood to rescue the past. Reynolds, a starstruck Jean Harlow wannabe, opens a dance studio for kids and Winters is her piano player. Soon Winters (as Helen) starts to crack up. It's all going slowly and although there are moments of real crizu (nasty phone calls, a visit to Timothy Carey Carey), the movie is devoid of any real horror. But it is always worthy of entertainment. Their division acts fine and the production values ​​are terrific. A music note by David Raskin, cinema by Lucien Ballard and Oscar-nominated costumes contributes greatly. With this, the position of the SUN and his credit lolita, anyone crazy as well as Winters? Directed by Curtis Harrington, a master of this type is not quite A-movie exploitation. In addition to Carey, Oddball supported the cast include Dennis Weaver, Agnes Moorehead (like Aimee Semple McPherson as Evangelist), Yvette Vickers and Micheál MacLiammóir (Irish Orson Welles) as Hamilton Starr, Justice Nicknamed Justice.
