This is a sad movie about this woman who thought her ex-beloved was probably dead, but really dad scientists she just put a spell on him to turn her into this really cute shark guy . Kinds of Beauty and Beast. He could probably use a salon dance scene and maybe some candlesticks, but there are some nice british plants instead. They make this one girl really scratched, so she allowed herself to get food by the shark-guy instead of scratching in the entire movie. The scientist guy is a good father who tries to meet his son's shark son and the woman he is engaged in, and even arranged to have private time for sex, but the woman in this is a really deep snob and He thinks that shark is an ugly, icky monster and he wants nothing to do with him. He gave up on love! Just because it was a shark! I thought it was very sad how all she had to do was kiss her, she would turn back to normal and would live happily ever after, but not the kind of movie.
