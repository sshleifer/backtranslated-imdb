Diana Muldaur appears on Star Trek for a second, but this time as a different character. No one on board seems to notice - maybe it was the hair. Regardless, this time it's not the outlet for a god (see the previous episode), but it's a very popular lady with magic powers allowing her to communicate and see a Medusan without going crazy (human standard response). Unfortunately, the most man in love with it is a few short cards in a full pile and it tries to kill the Medusa ambassador (which, unusual, lives in a small coffin - this is a disgusting way of traveling). And, unfortunately, Muldayr does not hurt all that well herself. What's next is kind of mute and by the time the episode was for the first time I saw it, I was very relieved. Watching all the guys on board go ga-ga on Muldaur was very funny and acting in Spock when it was a little crazy time was very camping. Make yourself a favor - if you have not seen the previous show, choose a different episode.
