"The secretary" is one of those cheese, cheese, "thrillers" that one victim is watching over a Sunday afternoon, when there is virtually nothing else about. While the plot (a woman is offended becomes jealous for everyone who succeeds in the office and decides to do whatever he can to stop them) can be one of a kind, I recognize countless sketch wrinkles, probably taken from other TV movies I was undergoing for the very same reasons. <br /> <br /> To make matters worse, I was not wild about the cast. Mel Harris is one of those actresses who appear in many TV movies such as either a "mother" or some sort of "victim" of bad play or abuse, that one must ask what kind of life he leads. In this one, she becomes happy to play a mother with a victim of psychiatrist Sheila Kelly secretary, who was not a very good choice as the villain. While Sheila Kelly has made some good career move (Singles, Breaking In, and I Guess, Act and Order), she is also busy by a string of sensitive TV movie role, and this one just adds to her. As for the others, I have no clear memories about them, so to say something. <br /> This one is playing on the entire lifetime network (I think that's where I saw it), but Don did not bother watching it, unless you're too bored of the words. Not that it will make you any more excitied.
