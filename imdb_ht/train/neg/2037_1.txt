If I could give it a zero, I would change my mind and give it a 10-plus. Absolutely filmed movie that has no film footage, does not make sense of what's happening. ONLY PLAIN BORING. Please do not waste your money on this one. Please Like !!! This movie could do so well if it really shows the story of real zodiac killer, but nopes, I do not feel anything but disgusting while watching it. Make yourself a favor and rent some classic movies instead, it's best to watch a movie you've seen as 3-4 times than watching this crap! I do not understand why people even bother doing these movies when they know they will not do well. Zodiac Killer would be called 'Boriac Killer' rather !!!
