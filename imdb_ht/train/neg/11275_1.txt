This is a copy of victory victories victory with a stellar cast and a terrible script. I have no idea why many British actors have signed up to this junk, they must have been bribed. A match missing in a story goes on forever and ever and if I had not paid good money for it I would have to turn it in after 10 minutes. By the worst movie ever seen, the honor of going to the swamp really patog in a movie '(I use term in the wounds) `GUMMO' (I feel like sue what's called 'director' for the lost hour and a half of my life) but this waste is almost right down there with it. Definitely one of the worst 5 films I've ever seen. Stuff like this is reminiscent of Hollywood that they do not have a monopoly on really awful movie.
