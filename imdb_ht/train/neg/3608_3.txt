I have a nice collection of movies going, and added this one. Number 274 must be exact. <br /> <br /> The title I went to first. Splatter University. I thought this would be a great horror movie. Was I ever wrong? Do not get me wrong, this is not the worst movie I've ever seen, but it could be a lot better. I love all movies, but this one was one that was more of a laugh then scare. Poor audio quality, poor acting, and poor injection arrangements are some of the areas that might have been improved. 3 out of 10 stars. <br /> <br /> Movie is ideal for a good laugh. If you are looking for one of those cinemas to make the fun, then this is one!
