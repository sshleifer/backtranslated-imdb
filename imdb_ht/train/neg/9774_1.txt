Hubert Selby Jr. gave us the book "Requiem for a Dream" and co-written scenario of Aronofsky's film in it. This movie has succeeded on every level by providing an intimate, fair portrait of the horrors of life characters and vices that have been destroyed. "The latest from Brooklyn" still has the screws and the multiple characters living sad, but it hardly makes them the same Judge Aronofsky did. The movie looks ridiculous anti-gay at times. Especially when in homosexuality homosexuality films. A gay character stumbles, launches Skyward by a speeding machine, and land that dies on the pavement. Another is crucified and it is always much easier to beat. Another exaggerated piece of traumatic value, which could actually have been ignored if it did well, is the stage of the labor union workers literally to fight and strike-breakers. Who would have thought a drama about Brooklyners would be the sequence of action sequences and truck explosions? The director, Uli Edel has a skill level like this at a TV director, but it is far below the cut for real movies. The film is clunky that can not even seem to settle on a genre. The Lake provides an unreliable role that any mannequin could fill out with Baldwin only seems to know how to look stupid in its equally lean part. Then comes Jennifer Jason Leigh as our lead, an angry hooker called Tralala (believing it or not, I do not play it joking). His performance is nothing great and the fate of his character is the dirty saying at least. Poor use of color and composition makes it look cheaper than it is, and also takes the "real" edge of the more provocative bits. A failure.
