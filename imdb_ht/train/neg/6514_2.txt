The movie tries to be a mockumentary - shot in the documentary form but with many parts obviously scripted - but the failed does not give the audience and any character with which to create the illusion of the mockumentary. Also, the film pretends to be about finding real love in Los Angeles, but there is nothing more than a refreshing look at an amateur movie trying to make his first "big movie."
