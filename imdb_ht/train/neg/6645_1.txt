This guy has no idea of ​​the movie. Well, he seems to have done a show of interest to some of his teens, and on two accepted cinemas that have been more successful in political reasons than to mislead communist censorship. That's all very good, but look carefully: he does not know his job! Scenes are unbalanced, without good start and, with a clutter content and full of empty. It's nothing to say about the subject, so it's over-licitates with violence, nakedness and kindergarten. How is it possible to keep alive as a corpse who never understands anything in cinematic art and art? Why not let it fall into pieces?
