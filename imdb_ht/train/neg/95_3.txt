You have to admire Brad Sykes even if you do not particularly want to, a man who churns outside horror budgets following the horror budget less than enthusiastic receptions. But keep on doing it all the same. Even the half-happy praise over surrounds her Blood Camp film is grudgingly and I'm guilty of this as anyone. Brad normally manages to throw something interesting into the mix, a neat idea, a kooky character, regardless of that, but without money to take it beyond the base level, it depends on the audience to cut it some slack and appreciate it's for what it is and what it could be. Joe Haggerty gives a very funny and humorous performance as Ebenezer Jackson with a credit to Sykes that he may feel that this oddball turn will work on the film. Come to a multiplex near you, in a parallel universe, somewhere.
