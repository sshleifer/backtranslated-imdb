After buying the DVD into a bargain bin because of the impressive amount of features listed on the cover, I popped it to the DVD player and everything looks good. Nice animated menu and a whole lot of extra features ... And when I played the movie itself, what a down. It is the worst thing I've ever seen and I've seen some bad movies in my time. The commentary that honors the movie here at IMDB is actually from those who made the movie. So do not believe it unless you like to waste your cash!
