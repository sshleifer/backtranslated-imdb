I never found Charley Chase very funny, though her screen characters sometimes remind me of John Cleese, whom I find very funny. (Charley Chase also reminds me of Fluff Hen Broon from Post Sunday's Sunday Post Post Scotland.) In the Best Chase Movie, I tend to admire her professionalism rather than laughing at her. I'm going to give credit to Chase that her very best movie - like 'Mighty Like a Moose' and her 'Wooden Wedding' - have inspired a fandom that is fiercely loyal to her ... but I'm positive that even most fans - Launch the fan will agree that very early and very grossly 'married in Order' just is not funny at all. <br /> Chase - eager, awkward, gormless, naff - is a young swain hoping in the beautiful Rose court. Oliver Hardy gives the best performance of this movie as his blowhard father, who chases Chase as a 'mollycoddle'. Leo White, who did more remarkable work as a foil for the essay Chaplin, is on hand here as a rival. <br /> Some actions involve a look at Ingersoll. I intrigued the brand name mentioned in the dialogue headings: this is an early example of placement-producing? <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, a major defect in 'Marriage Order' is the casting of Rosemary Theby as Rose: it meant to be a standard-problem ingenious, but Theby - flat-chested, eagle- to face - is physically wrong for the role. Theby (the wife of Harry Myers) had a successful career as a screen actress, but she never was an ingenious credo. Film historian William K Everson has been dealing with it very dismissively in one of his movie books. <br /> I'll rate 'just order' rates of 3 out of 10, and I have been charitable ... because I hold suspicion that Charley Chase had something that everyone else came, but I continued to miss.
