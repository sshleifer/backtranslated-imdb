I'm not sure why I click "there are shots" because quite honestly there is not enough explanation ever given in the movie to know enough of what would be going to spoil it. Visually it is mostly delivered. Well, apart from some 80's throwback rubber-mask monsters. I'll say now that before watching this I have never seen Lord Lordi nor knew anything about being given Eurovision. Apparently the monsters of this are members of the group, very beautiful in those stages. Whatever. Anyway, I did not know this while watching. I just thought the monsters / demons were mostly beams. Just over. <br /> I almost ensure that there is a semi-adherent explanation behind what we see on the screen but it can actually be best known. It probably would actually have been incredibly lame to come to think about it. The action keeps him rolling together pretty much well enough to keep the viewer especially entertained, though half the entertainment factor playing and playing on wtf is supposed to reach this movie exactly. <br /> I gave it a card mostly because I got a good laugh out of it, especially from how it explains pretty much nothing. You must have been the mood I was in, but I found that hella funny for some reason. Then I watch the movie online and find out that nobody knows what the hell it is supposed to be about. That amuse me further, and raised my score an extra half point to a 4/10. <br /> It's not scary, or particularly coherent, but it's very nice visually and soundly. In general, far from bulk, but look. Do not expect too much and do not expect it to make any sense and it might entertain you if you are in the right mood.
