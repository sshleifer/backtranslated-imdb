I really have no idea how to comment on this movie. The special effects were substandard, the act was terrible and if there was a plot it all, it was on the back of the box. I do not think I can remember a movie being this bad in a long time, and I'm a big fan of lesbian sex and boobies! ;) Even that could not save this movie out of being just a terrible excuse to pay someone to stop (or lie in that case) in front of a camera. <br /> I was pretty much left down in the overall "zombie" effect. Since apparently in this movie, the zombies are so common where running on a couple here and there, and relaxed talking about it at a gas station (one with a steam in-house repair but there is no inner toilet) The genre of zombie-film is not even a factor until the end. Even then, a mess by a dozen zombies captured on a girl's dress does not really constitute being a zombie movie. <br /> <br /> On the Vampires: Apparently all the zombies are male and all vampires are female, which is OK by me. I'm not sure how the vampires come out of the day, or why / how a soldier vampire came up in the middle of the road, still holding his gun with a stake in his heart, just waiting for the Queen The vampires smashed his movie all the way through. The latest segment of the old nunnery made no sense, and when one hot lesbian vampire asked the other vampire lesbian vampire "do you think we did what's right?" Do not kill the two apparent heroes of the movie, which about to put it on the head. Their special effects and effects have been at an all-round low. You could almost see the tires that the blood fake was pumping out during the impressions of the zombie that was reversed by the General. Speaking of the General, where did Kenny Rogers look-seem anyways? Do not know what it was the General, aside from generally confusing and misleading. <br /> In all, watch the movie if you have nothing better to do or if you have to encourage the strong waste $ 3. Just $ 0.02.
