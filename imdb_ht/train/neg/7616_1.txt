The good news was a movie made, drawing on an assumed Aztec myths and featuring a very Aztec-American (is like a word that exists) cast. The bad news is, he died at birth. <br /> <br /> If Ed Wood was out of retirement and coach George Romaro in his classic night, what could we have come up with. 'Legend of Diablo' is well-fed for any future resurrection of 'Mystery Science Theater 3000!' I do not think anyone can even call this a 'B' movie. The output values ​​are so bad that I kept feeling I was watching either a long skirt from a variety of shows or a 8 mm film shot film by a group of schoolchildren. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />! A California rural sheriff finds a box with an Aztec spirit and accidentally escapes the unsuspecting community. Her daughter, one hot and one family, team with an FBI grandmother and a priest, to try to re-cage about her devil. <br /> Meanwhile, every single zombie scene has ever seen before unwanted re-adopting movies - wrong. These zombies walk more like an army of Nutty teachers than the undead! The scenes are supposed to infrarude from the devil's opinion they have nothing special ?? and he / she / it sure seems to back up a lot (as opposed to turning around moving forward). And the scene where the priest attracts spirits from the cave of fast-moving is funny! It really, really appears to be for funny-although I know it was not! I hoped that Benny Hill theme music began to play & for the whole gang of zombies to start chasing the priest over the beach! In the course of Darth Vader / Field in dreams, call the FBI agent becomes downright funny. Then again, so was most of this cheese ball! Robert Napton, director and writer of the scenario, should have something for this effort! (How about a bullet life, like the 'Hollywood 10?') This one, I now see, is rated 1.5 on a 10-scale. I'm afraid this would be a generous tad! <br /> <br /> Is there anything good about this movie? Well, Lindsey Lofaso looks pretty hot as the youngest girl of the sheriff dies. This is probably why her older sister (Calvi Pabon) really runs away from home! Fred Estrado is reasonably decent as FBI agent. I wonder if Mario Soto, who played Father Rodriguez, is Mario Soto who camped for the Cincinnati Reds? If so, it should have stick to baseball. In fact, they could not have made any worse if they went with a baseball theme and called it 'The Devil's The Outfield! '<br /> If I find this was actually a project for a college class Cinema community, I'm going to be exquisite problem. It might be good enough for a B or even B + as long as the gang got the college camcorder back to the campus in one piece! 'Blair's Witch Project' has proved that a cool, campy film could be done on a jigsaw. 'Legend of Diablo,' though, did not appear to have a jingle or shoes at work! It was low-budget, low-talented, low-everything. The very ultimate scene and I mean about the final 10 seconds of the movie-only the creative or interesting moments. <br /> I pay $ 3.45 to rent this. I could have better spent on a hamburger!
