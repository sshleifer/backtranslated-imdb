This show seemed to be a good thing. Kyra Sedgwick is an OK actress and I love police series, but somewhere in the production of this program went awfully wrong. <br /> <br /> First of all, the writers should have more suspicion than one, you know who did it every time !!!!! That makes it boring. The main character is unbelievably annoying and not credible in any way. I know they wanted it to be tough, but chess means, stupid and a bad ruler. The crimes are refreshing and bland, and just lame are all the way. As stated above, I hate it .... <br /> <br /> All in all, this was a great disappointment and very bad indeed.
