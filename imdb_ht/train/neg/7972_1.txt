I love b movies .. but comes over .... this was not even worth a class ... the end was dumb ... b / c was no really finished !!! .. not to mention that it comes to life on its own ... I mean there is no storm lighting or crazy devil power? Slow as hell and then they just start killing about the characters one by one in such a 15 minute time period ... and I will not even start on the part of the killing one single one without himself ... and then you do not even get to see what same Jigsaw do with so-called "new top puzzle" .... Unless you have nothing better to do ... Id look dirty paint before Id recommend this movie to God-abandon anyone else ... oh and make it even the best movie totem you can see the guy sends the one animal to the basement scenes from the window .. these were funny as hell and probably only the right part of watching the movie garbage
