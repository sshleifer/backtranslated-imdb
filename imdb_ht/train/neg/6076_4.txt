In FAN FAN Robert De Niro plays Gil Renard. Or is it Travis bickle? or Rupert Pupkin? Or Max Cady? You see the problem with this type of role is that De Niro played very similar characters to the taxi driver, the king of comedies and CAPE FEAR and unfortunately the characters were better developed and were the best scripts. I found it a little hard to believe that Renard would have started out as a fan of crumpled obsessive sports in being an out and out psycho <br /> <br /> The Arc's character is not the only problem with that script - It also missed a character concentration (A problem I had with UNTOUCHABLES where De Niro would have been superb but ended up a little flat), for several stretches of the movie I had to keep thinking that Bobby Rayburn was the main character Then the story changed back to Renard. It also looks ashamed a lot of sports fans who seem to think this should focus a bit more on baseball. I'm not sure if this was meant to appeal to original baseball fans but again there are elements that hint it might have if the producers made up the minds in which and that the story should focus on <br /> <br /> I'll admit I was amused by FAN (especially by the band) but it's a very fluffy movie and it should be remembered that by the mid-1990s character being backed by Nutters as in singles single white, incredible ENTRY etc. was run out of steam a long time ago
