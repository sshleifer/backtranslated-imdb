Adding to the list of cartoons: a South publisher and "Congregation," a torch singer (Sophie Tucker?), A dance chorus, and brother mills - it only makes it worse. The "Negro" performers, who themselves often appear in the movie must be parody themselves and their race. Even though the "Comedian guy" may have been accepted in his day, he is very offensive today, and I doubt he was ever funny. Though I would not have been offended, I do not think I would have laughed at the weakest attempts of humor. As a 11-year-old boy, however, I could not understand some of her.
