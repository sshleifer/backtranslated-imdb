Tim Robbins is strangely well-liked here, thrown as a garage mechanic in 1950's New Jersey who fell in love with a perky blonde that turns out to Albert Einstein's niece! Although it is on many screen at the moment, Robbins cancels out the inside-functions of his intense characters and disappears in the background (it's easy to forget it is even in the picture!). Comedy Romantic comedy with a gadget, Walter Matthau played Einstein (which makes it possible with a cartoonishly character conceived). Otherwise, it's sugar and sun, directed rather drowsily by Fred Schepisi, who shows heart but there is no understanding or brain. Meg Ryan is his own independent self and the chemistry between himself and Robbins is good, like those of a affectionate sister and his big brother. ** from ****
