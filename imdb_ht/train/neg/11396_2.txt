The master of cheap erotic thunder, Rolfe Kanefsky, finally made a movie that does not go straight to the Playboy Channel. The "Hazing" borrowed heavily from everything that came before he came out of Nightmare on Elm Street in the Bad Dead, but still managed to make it and humor enough to make it look ... just barely. Characters are cardboard boxes, the dialogue is wooden, the story is paper-thin and the actors could not act their way out of a shopping bag. Put that all together and you have a pulpy ball in the mulch for a movie. Sometimes, when I'm bored, I like to eat paper. Watch this movie is a lot like that. Go for it for 90 minutes and leave with a strange taste in your mouth and have no nutritional value.
