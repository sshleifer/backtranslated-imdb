Did the movie makers even preview this before they released it? The script jumps out of places they put without giving explanations. The beginning does not clarify whether it is a prequel or not. It starts with the start of the Superman on Earth and then jumps to a point after the last movie - but does not really alert the viewer of this. VERY confusing! Superman himself is weak and in need of Prozac. It is described as a potential home-trimmer, a stalker, and someone who is clearly depressed and confused. This type of character rarely makes for an exciting hero. The finish is absolutely ridiculous. Superman ends in a hospital just making me want to kill him in my head. I'm seriously waiting for a SNL SNL place to appear on Maury Povich and Maury, "The results are in - in the case of kids, Superman, you are the father." To sum up - OK acting by this superman and Kevin Spacey, but horror script. The movie is basically constrained.
