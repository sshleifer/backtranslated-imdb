A wealthy Harvard dude falls for a poor Chick Radcliffe in his strict father constancy (Ray Milland). Syrups, sugars, and most of all, bad stories about a fight in the 'classes' when rich-kid Ryan O'Neal brings home a waiver to a library for his besieged parent. Ali MacGraw is the social derelict and the dirty mouth while John Marley plays his devil-Catholic father, but no one in the movie is more annoying than O'Neal himself and his paintings whimpering as Harvard's yuppie champion. They followed 8 (!) Years later in 'Oliver's Story'.
