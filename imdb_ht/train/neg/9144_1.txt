This movie is just really awful, eye-candy that plays Ben just can make up for anything else that is wrong with this movie. The writer / director / producer / lead actor team has probably had a good idea to create a movie related to the important issues of gay marriage, family acceptance, religion, homophobia, hate crime and just about every other problem that is effective gay at these times, but trying to burn every problem into such a bad movie design does little justice to any of those causes. The script is poor, deposited in very ordinary, but the dialogue and acting is just pampered. The actor's brother's hired is played by actors in camps and there is absolutely no chemistry between the two lead actors (I think I've seen more passion in a cornflake announcement). The act is stiff, and the dialogue is forced (a scene where the fee is eating the detective line was the highlight). <br /> I'm just glad to see that the creator of this train wreck does not have to push any other garbage out of distribution, and if it's thinking of doing so, I have some advisers - Just do not.
