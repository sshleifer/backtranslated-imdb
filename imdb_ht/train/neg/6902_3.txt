Despite the reversal of this sticker being garnered in New Zealand, any hype surrounding the production is unfortunately sanitary. Apart from a sketchy-only scheme, the film is descended by some weaknesses, accents, and the general lack of tension. <br /> Also there is the general view of a great budget (for NZ), the feeling is small tiwi town Kiwi ... <br /> <br /> Is there anyone who does not see the Brothers ?? (http://imdb.com/title/tt0250274/) Holders will pick their similarities straight .... I've heard comments that such scenes as boys are playing basketball etc. They have shot keenly into the icons " boy speak crap ", but it comes across as forcing ... <br /> I believe Oscar Keightley sees himself as deeply paradoxical, but yet his delivery always looks just vaguely self-conscious. With any skepticism left in all that Samoans-living-in-NZ culture was deeply, hopefully not permanent, affected by American speech, culture, and everything in between will certainly have the spirits made up of end of this movie. / <br /> Robbie Magasiva always looks good on the screen, but is left down to the script .. <br /> It still rubbed me up a wrong way when a "comedy" has scenes that are set up in a way So obviously, you're leaving feeling like having a good plot of punchline in clich√©d - see the wanna have white boys ... <br /> I know someone who found this movi and hilarious - though, this person have the brains in a tadpole, and would struggle to spell his name if they offered a million dollars ... <br /> <br /> This type of sum up the mentality of this movie is OK, but not great, fun , but not funny ..... Waking NZ - this is not a movie 5 stars despite all the glowing (middle class blame guilt :) :-)) review .... <br /> <br /> tips me? if you watch it, get first drink !!!
