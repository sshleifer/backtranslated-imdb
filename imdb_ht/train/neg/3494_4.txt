Looking at her popularity, I found this movie a great disappointment. Perhaps I was expecting too much of this movie. After all, it is one of the best known martial movies in the 1970s, but I can never figure out why. The story is refreshing. It is also a very talky movie and sequential actions occasionally. My biggest problem with the movie was that the story does not offer a character that I could root for, since the intended hero is a fool. Director Chang has no sense of style, and it is able to hide the blatant allegations found in the narrative. I know this is not supposed to have great art, but I found the boring film. Definitely not the best example of this very beloved genre. His cult status saved me. I recommend you skip it.
