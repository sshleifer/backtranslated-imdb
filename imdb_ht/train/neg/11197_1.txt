What was the worst movie in 2003? "Cat in the Hat?" "Gigli?" No! I propose that it was this little movie fraud from earlier in the year. Poor writing, seriously edited, and (if I can so bold) seriously act, the "Order" is black hole in film - a movie so dense by the slightest bit of entertainment could escape from its events horizon at sucking . It's not even accidentally funny, like (for example) "Showgirls." <br /> You know that the producers are assuming that the audiences will not be very smart. The movie name, originally titled "The Sin Eaters," has changed, because they figured Americans were too stupid to understand what a sinner was, even though they went to great lengths to explain what a sinful eater is in the movie in. Instead, they figure a generic title with a picture of Heath Ledger looking for them more than enough to get you into there. And, hey, what you know, was good! My ex girlfriend saw the picture in Heath and dragged me off. Congratulations, producers, you met your target market. She also liked "Fat II," so you are in good company. <br /> <br /> Back to topic, Heath plays a Catholic monk from a specific (or guessed) order that tries to investigate the assassination of his counselor. It has celibacy problems, perhaps because nobody in the right mind would believe that he knew the slightest thing about religion, much less there is a celibacy monk. Only other members of this order are a comic fat guy. As much as I wanted to see the return of the funny comic screen to the big screen, his attempt at humor reminded me of all the dorks in my high school that made imitation of Monty Python, thinking that if they just told the lines like Pythons would have to automatically be funny. You know the sort of person I'm talking about. <br /> If I say something else, I would be in danger of generating crowds. Frankly, the thing that spoiled this film for me was the fact that it was created.
