An incomprehensible secret mess. Most things in the movie look more or less like 1987, but then there are futuristic things just thrown in, like the policeman's rifle gun. With this machine! The director seemed to be in love with light colors. The only truly remarkable performance was the girl who played Valerie, but since there was no list thrown, I do not know which actress was. This one is worth missing. Grade: F
