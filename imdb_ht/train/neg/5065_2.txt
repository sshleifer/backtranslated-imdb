This film is just plain bad. Fair history, weak LEDs and below average acting. The thing that really exacerbated me was the blatant advertising - constantly - for a well-known internet provider. It is obvious to some scenes to write just to do that, advertising. This movie is a slap in the face of anyone paying for that. <br /> Do not watch this, it's not worth your time.
