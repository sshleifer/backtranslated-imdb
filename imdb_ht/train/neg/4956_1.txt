When this cartoon first revealed that I was under the impression that it would be at least half of the descent, my boyfriend was wrong. I must admit that this cartoon is almost as painful as watching Batman and Robin and George Clooney all those years ago. I watched a few episodes and two of Batman had literally found her ass loaded left and right by the penguin who fought like Jet Li and beat the crap out of Batman and I looked at another episode where Batman got His butt run off by the Joker, who apparently was using Jackie Chan to move while flipping through the air as a ninja. Since the Joker or Penguin has ever been a match for Batman? and worse again when they were joker and penguins kung fu tokay of jackie chan and jet li. It is truly embarrassing, depressing and sad the way the image of Batman is described in this show. The animation is terrible and the dialogue is awful. Being a Batman fan of my childhood, I can honestly and strongly advise you to stay away and avoid this show at all cost, because it does not project the true image of Batman. This cartoon is more like a Wannabe Kung Fu Flick and if you really want to see a cartoon Batman class I recommend Batman to the animated series, but this cartoon is nothing more than a piece of S --- T! Get Batman: The Animates series and do not waste your time with this cartoon.
