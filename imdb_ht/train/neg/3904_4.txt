I confess - Emma, ​​in my opinion, is the single greatest novel ever to write. It is as close to perfection as any mortal creation. Jane Austen came to the pinnacle of her art here. <br /> <br /> Comparison of the Gwyneth Paltrow version is inevitable - that version is far more faithful to the witty spirit of the book and far more enjoyable to watch. <br /> <br /> Some good elements here - Kate Berkinsale (she has already played Flora Poste at Cold Comfort Farm, Emma's clearest spiritual twin) is a wonderful Emma. Raymond Coulthard makes a Church of Churchill appropriate. The production is beautiful, but the interiors are far too dark. <br /> However, there are several major issues. The first is Strong Strong - first of all, it does not look right for Mr. Knightley. This is perhaps because he plays the role of a Victorian senior sentiment. It is wrong from tune. <br /> <br /> The second problem is one in length. Simply put, the movie is too short - to get high quality feel, it would need twice as long. <br /> <br /> Finally, and much more, there is the quality of the adaptation. Austen is an adapter's dream - the whole dialog is already there. It only needs cutting and fixing properly. Andrew Davies seems to think otherwise. First, this is a rather gloomy movie, and the last thing Emma would be is gloomy. More significantly, Davies saw fit to rewrite the finish as some sort of big holiday. What is planet, or minor works in Thomas Hardy, this out? It is absolutely out of the style and spirit of the novel. And I believe it is hugely provocative for trying to make improvements over-perfection. <br /> <br /> Look at the Paltrow version, or view the Cold Comfort Farm Kate.
