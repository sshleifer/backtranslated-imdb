Chances are if I look this again I might get physically ill, the movie is so annoying ... unless you believe in psychics, re-incarnations and other hocus-pocus that's great time. "Re-riding the soul bike," he calls it here. This story is made several times before and films such as "Heaven can wait." He also did a lot better. Too bad had to waste their talent at Robert Downey Jr., Cybill Shepherd, Ryan O'Neal and Mary Stuart Masterson. At least it's a very tame movie, the language of wisdom. That's about the quality only purchased in this movie.
