Yes I admit I was calling during this movie. It was so incredible disappointing that I could not help myself but cry. TBN (Trinity Broadcasting Network) did it again. First and Man's Million Man Man (formerly professional wrestler) on the programs, and now this. The Omega code follows a stream of religious slave oriented movies. It was very fun, but at the same time it was disturbing to find it for correct libraries. The movie follows the so-called "Bible Code" rather than those true biblical writings. This movie is very badly done; from his writing to direct it to his hilariously awful act. Its depressions that people actually put into effect in this movie. It appeared more like a late night movie someone would watch on the USA channel or a home video right rather than a movie theater released. <br /> I highly recommend you do not watch this movie, even if your life depends on it.
