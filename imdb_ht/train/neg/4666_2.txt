This film is about a Japanese woman with an obsession with skin scruffy. The draw is absolutely rare. I fail to see any "sensual" or "erotic" undertones. The plot turns an ancient art form into a fetichistic pornography. In addition, the scenes that are filmed in Hong Kong are certainly portraying bad parts of Hong Kong, such as the airport in the middle of the city, poor living conditions and noise pollution. Throughout the film, I continue to think that the "Book Ear" is insulting the Japanese culture and environment in Hong Kong. The "Early Book" is a perverted, yet boring movie. Seriously stay away from it.
