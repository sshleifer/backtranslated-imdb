This is a weak film and a troubled story of cutting and re-appointing. It does not work at all. Firstly, the dramaturgy is all wrong. It's very slow moving the first and then hurry and satisfactory move to an end. But there are also (and which can be done with the cuts) a comfortable move between jaws. It starts off being a thriller to be taken in nominal value and then degenerating into a farce rather than Satir. The finish can be funny but it's also so wet that I almost felt it insulted my intelligence (which little has). So the movie tries to be everything but does not really succeed on any level at all. You can also see in the very unstady character development. You almost get the Connery impression playing three roles rather than one.
