I'm a hungry B-Rate movie horror movie and they've seen my fair share of slasher photos, so I have a substantial gauge to judge this movie. It's easy to hang in the top of the worst horror movies in 1980 being offered. It's not as scary as the night of the demons, it's not like gory as Re-Animator and missing the camp value in Nothing Out. That said, this film has no value. Keep in mind, the movie work is for a completely different movie. The injections are always on the back of the DVD box they do not take in this movie. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> movie horror used). <br /> <br /> The story focuses on Francine Forbes - who wisely renamed him for Forbes Riley after this film was make - accepting an instructional job at a university .Start starting to die and Forbes believes the assassin targets him .. is it new heartthrob and a past checkered or libido-dig student? To be honest, it's impossible to care because the script not meat out any character outside Forbes). <br /> <br /> ACTING: $ (terrible on all levels.This laser has a high school-based output that is because college students can make a better flick of this movie. Forbes shows a modicum talent as making Seminara as one of the students, but everyone else is in the "extra" caliber of acting).
