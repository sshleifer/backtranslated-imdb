I watched this Canadian movie video as the "Witching" that somehow did its way to New York State. Audio was quite bad, I had to raise it on 7/8 just to hear it and the soundtrack often was overwhelming the dialogue. Orson Welles was a mumbler, worse than usual, and some of his dialogue, and others were running into an echo room. A ghost figure that holds reappearing was his voice distorted. There are some close photography that might help! <br /> A group of witches or satanists (credits at the end of the group did not mean that they represent any real group!) There is a ceremony in which they get naked and cause a miscarriage by stopping a doll. The woman who had the miscarriage and her husband moved to a city called "Lilith," where she offered a job in a toy factory. Although one of the AKAs in this movie apparently was the "Toy Factory," we never saw it, and it only occasionally referred to all. <br /> <br /> On the way to Lilith, her husband becomes impatient with some of her questions about what new boss Mr. Cato wanted to know about convincing religion. It drives aggressively, and causes another car to go through the road and blow up. After the police arrived, he took a doll that fell out of the car, the second of many handmade dolls in the movie. It looks like Mr. Cato and all the townspeople are witches, and that they are people who caused his miscarriage, even though he does not realize it. They want it because it has a natural ability for necromancers, in which it was not really aware. <br /> <br /> Some images in the movie have some impact, but on the whole the movie is not very involved. The film seems a bit of a mess, and this is no doubt largely due to its re-correction and the addition of new footage. The original version, according to the end credit, was called Necromancy - A Life for a Lifetime. Magic in DVD could let you see both versions of a disc, but re-releasing this movie probably is not a priority.
