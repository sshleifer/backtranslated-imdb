Julia Stiles is a talented young actress, who and advice from a reputable agent has a lot of potential. Obviously, people who guide her to this travesti are not someone who cares about her career. I sat in the theater surrounded by adolescents who left droves to get another movie sneaking in asking people who thought this movie would appeal to anyone. It was wrong to write, the casting director could only put 1 or 2 minutes of effort into the characters and the director obviously did not care.
