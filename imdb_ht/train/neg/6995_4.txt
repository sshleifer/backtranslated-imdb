Funny how many of the people who say this is far superior to Romero's version tends to be very young (judging by other posts). What we have here is a slick, action packed, gory and "Whoopee" full of 2 MTV videos. Frantic editing, pop-video camera work, "cool" music blah blah blah <br /> <br /> Actually it's not bad compared to other recent remarks (massacred chain was a total disaster) ... very good acting all round , totally predictable to "who will die next" stakes with a total cash on Dawn of the Dead Name that will generate lots of revenue alone by fans of the original who will go and see it from curiosity ... <br /> not the classic rumor to get your nerves? Are they really not coming up with something original? Why Dawn rumors of the deceased? Things that have made the original original (middle of the children think that so boring is supposed to slow down to show how when you find everything you ever want you are still unhappy) are totally missing. This is an action, plain and simple flick. The faster the better. If you are in action flicks (and as such, the 2004 version is well done) is just enough, but for anyone who loves a small substance in the films ... ready to sigh (again) ... <br / > Look at the movies over the years as we find the godfather series remade by the most fashionable pop director is at this time, with star wars remade, and all the kids are telling how the new version is kilometer pi The good old cos version is slow and boring and keeps a camera shot for more than 5 seconds ... <br /> <br /> Not bad, but in 10 years are still discussing the Romero version,
