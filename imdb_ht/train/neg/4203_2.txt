What starts as a smart smartphones on a security surveillance company somewhat shady turns, almost instantaneously, into a worthwhile and completely innocuous manslayer mystery. David Arquette and the great Stanley Tucci try to force them to train this wreck trail, but some things are just not human. <br /> <br /> What, for example, causes gale turns suddenly into a sweet mother's face in a wet drinker at Tommy's parents home? Why would Heinrich, although admitting a sleezebag, want to destroy the business that he devotes to his life, not robbing and possibly killing his clients? Why Tommy's seemingly sensitive believes that Heinrich could be a murderer (based on almost entirely on a dream), and even though these were credible, why would not he go to the police? And why did not Gale activate the alarm when he got home, especially after howie scolding on it being off? Of course, all of these events are needed for the scheme (and I use the very, very wounding theme) to unfold. And he would be forgiven if he's in the slightest bit of comedy. But everything, from Howie's description of its date violation, to the misidentification coroner of Gale, in the final "joke" on Gale and Howie still died, is much more flavorful and pathetic than anything else . check the box indicating that my comments contain "mobs", but nothing more I or anyone else could do to spoil the thing that is already feeling in the high sky.
