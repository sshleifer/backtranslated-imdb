STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning <br /> <br /> Ray (Ray Winstone) has a past criminal, had problems with alcohol and now forms a drug habit that makes him paranoid and prone to domestic violence for his wife Valerie (Kathy Burke) who tries to keep the family together but finishing up more like a doormat. Meanwhile, mother Janet (Laila Morse) is aware of Ray's, Billy (Charlie Creed-Miles), and the habit of scrubbing his drugs on the rails. The film follows these desirable characters as they tredge along with their lives. <br /> It is said that the British seem to enjoy being miserable, and that would include watching movies that entertain them in this way. Movies like Nile by Mouth emphasize this. It's a story of a broken family, torn apart by crime, poverty, bottles and drugs, Jeremy Kyle's type would ever go as a three-course meal. It is also essentially a story of own destructive person, three generations apart and each copying the other, tearing a separate family and women trying to keep it together, although not strong enough. If you pick up a little bit of what it's off from the off-range, you can see it does not promise to look happy from the start and it certainly does not disappoint at this. True that everyone has said about their performance, and the lead stars, Winstone and Burke, deliver some great act. We see Winstone losing it with his wife, beating senseless after some more coke paranoia induced, breaking down during a telephone conversation with him and unleashing a typical arsenal of f and c words when he refuses to let him see his kid them. Likewise, at a private time, we see Burke skillfully losing her consciousness on a stairwell, the full impact of the night before kicking in. That's another of those films where there is no 'trace' to follow , as such, just a real life feel of these hopeless lives carry on from one day to the next. It was acclaimed by many (including the Baftas!) But it really was just too grim and weak for me. I can not criticize it for this, knowing what I knew about it from the off-range, but sadly this is how I found it. **
