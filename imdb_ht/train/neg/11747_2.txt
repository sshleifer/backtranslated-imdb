Although he received some favorable presses after playing in the Toronto Intl. Film Festival, there have been a number of reasons that do not expect too much from this. One - it's an ultra-low Canadian movie budget. Two - he writes, directs and starts the same person (usually a bad sign, unless it's Woody Allen, George Clooney or one or two other filmmakers respected). But despite looking at her and lowering expectations, she still turned out to be a bigger disappointment than I thought possible. <br /> In a nutshell script - bad, bad acting, horrible direct! Do not waste your time or money on this turkey. She claims to be a comedy, but I only laugh twice. Plus, there are terrible music bursting at all. How this has received any attention I will never know.
