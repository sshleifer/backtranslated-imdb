This is another North East Florida production, filmed mainly in and near by Fernandina Beach and Kingsley Plantation. I was rather surprised that the company could take over the main street of Fernandina Beach as long as it was necessary to realize the street scene. The movie is beautiful, and pretty bad. Tami Erin is beautiful, but overacts. Eileen Brennan shakes even more. Good for small children, or for those who love fluffy dense. A 4 from the Miller-Cinema formula.
