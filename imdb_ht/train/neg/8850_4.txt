Now this movie will not scare anyone, but it was interesting for two reasons - two great reasons and a smaller one- well, this three reasons, is not it. <br /> <br /> The first reason this is interesting is the special effects. I found them to be very interesting and somewhat spectacular. To see the hair growing on Marsha A. Hunting and Sybil Danning was climbing, especially when they participated in a toilet disposal. <br /> <br /> In interest, is the fact that this Hunt Hunt is the famous "Brown Sugar" of the Rolling Rock songs, and that it was at the naked hole scene at the London London Rock Stone music. <br /> <br /> In addition to special effects, there have been two other score points in this movie, and are being carried out repeatedly during the closing credits. I've lost count, but I swear that Sybil Danning prohibits these points for us in credit to close at least a dozen times and maybe a lot more. They were the most outstanding feature of the movie.
