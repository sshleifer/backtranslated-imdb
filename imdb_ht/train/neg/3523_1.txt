Oh, what a bad, bad, very bad movie! Nautilus and Start Sylvester Stallone ?? which should have enough ?? and featuring too much rock-climbing scene, vertigo, collapsing, and scene-grinding bandits and an exotic herb bot. There are two plots, both lame. One involves a traumatic survival fails, and the other involves the evil man crushing an aircraft to plunder, and killing various harmless whenever possible. Generally, John Lithgow's, perhaps depressed by the sheer frustration of the product, reduced the sneering and call those for whom he does not care "Bostid!" in a wave approximation of an English accent. Janine Turner, who was sprightly and enigmatic when he played Maggie on North Expo, is sadly wasted in part in a rescue climber and pilot. Stallone is stolid and muscle-led. There is no death line in this one. No line is alive, either.
