This is surely one of the worst films ever made. Each scene is painful. You will groan in the flimsy humor attempts, the left camera work, the sexist and racist, the story of ridiculous stories, wooden acting. Poor Joan Bennett; It is the only one in the film that is not a troublesome. At all, obnoxious.
