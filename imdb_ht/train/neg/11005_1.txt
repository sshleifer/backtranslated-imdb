This movie shows a row of drawings, partly over on one another. I realized the passing on the end of the movie, at first it only irritated me. Many of the episodes in this film come together without any punch recognition and simply try this environment, using absurdity and obscenity. Try it to stay comedy without any funny bits fails. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> . But it fails. At least the director did something out of anything. But it's not a good thing. Many movies have not turned out as funny as planned, but this one is all. It's the real life manifestation of the scenario can be worst of making films. No. Correct myself, it is worse than that. A movie with gag very badly, that's not funny at all. It's not even fun to watch the lead-actor, writer and director (all three guys in the way) perished by drowning in the ocean of bad movies. The movie is too bad for that.
