The world's largest inside joke. Bigger, most exclusive in the joke of the world. Emulating the bracelet and humorously 'humor' of office space, this movie drives the appeal of this film to the ground by making the humor as it would only be well appreciated by legal secretaries writing books. The audience is asked to assume the role familiar to a legal secretary, and then to embed with the dumb drug protagonist. The movie is all centered on the legal secretary to get free time, listening to music and writing a novel while working. These are its goals. You can not imagine the slap in the face it is the air hearing (around the half) to find that it has a job that fit all three of these criteria, but then give it up! The director and senarist (Jacob Kornbluth and Josh Kornbluth) completely remove the audience's motivation from empathy or even find fun a protagonist who has already driven away that he is complaining about the lack thereof. <br /> <br /> Apart from this great block of guilt, the secretary's secretary insemination fail because they must clearly explain the hearing whenever they arrive. Without these, the audience would not notice anything particularly strangely. Humor is only effective if it does not need to be well explained to the audience what's funny.
