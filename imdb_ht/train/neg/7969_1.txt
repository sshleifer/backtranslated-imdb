OK another movie purchased by me and Joe Swatman. OK this is not the worst movie I've reviewed this week but it still sings royally. We had a lot of fun watching this piece of crap. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />, As gory as we expected, I mean about the deaths are a heart attack. Again I think the act is absorbed, the sum of the actors must be porn star and one finds in it undies for what ever reason. <br /> <br /> The absolute worst part is the end and leaves it open for a bit of a head 2 but never gunna gets allowed to face it. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
