John Pressman (Micheal 'I should call Ditech' Lerner) to work at a doctor's office as an order. His mother (Zelda 'Poltergeist' Rubenstein) hypnotizes him about those who see his evil thoughts. But this turns out to be a film in a movie, but the lines are soon blurred as John goes a movie theater to kill. Pushing a guy watching the movie doing the same thing. Lerner is decent on the head of this, but Zelda repeats lines of dialogue over and over again. It gets bitter. But not as annoying as the two girls watch the movie in a movie. As a single horror movie that fails, it's too busy trying to be smart, trying to give a message and looks like a flap of slasher must evoke a sense of tension, or at least one jump or two. No, what we have here is the worst kind of slasher: An art-one house. <br /> <br /> My class: D +
