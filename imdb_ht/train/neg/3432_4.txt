A killer, violent cannibal killed by a crazy cop on the scene of his latest kill. In his grave a cult looked like plans to resurrect him by peeing on the tomb. This of course works with it wakes up the archeic penis off guy and is back in his old way to kill with a whole new zombie look. Two cops one of those who will be a little crazy on the back of the city and it has a drug problem, they are back on the case. Two of the members of the original cult trying to stop the killer by resurrecting some other dead stuff. Thinking they were filling them away from the tomb came a baby plastic doll used in the original resurrection. Remember a bit confusing really but not just its garbage. The act is terrible and one of the cops is the same guy who plays Dr. Vincent van Gore in the faces of Gore series and is just as terrible as annoying cop of this movie. The other cop just over the struggle to find her horrible line out. Now, I'm all for low budget movies but this film is just awful. If it was not for very easy on the eyes and naked ladies I would probably have fallen asleep. There is a bit of throat but it's never more than some intestinal creatures put on the stomach of the victims. Makeup of zombies in the other hand looks great with his legs penis long as it used to violate his victim and is kind of funny at times. There is also a half decent scene where the killer falls in love with a sex doll. The doll and the chipmunks voice are the stupid thing I've ever seen in a movie. It's just a plastic game on a fishing line. The finish is very bad. You would expect the killer to put more in a fight than it does. God knows how to make enough money to make an end. <br /> <br /> 4/10
