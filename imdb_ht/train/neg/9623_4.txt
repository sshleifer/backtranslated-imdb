Ben Stiller does not act as a reaction. And he does so well. It's highly dependent on the comedy going on around her. In having something about Mary, the hairstyle hairstyle scene only works because of Stiller trying to keep a straight face. When she met other Mary's lenders, she is the guy moving in the room but the scene is hilarious. <br /> <br /> Together Polly, the formula breaks down for difficult reasons in fathom. Stiller is surrounded by an array of comic talent. Hank Azaria and Philip Seymour Hoffman get the best lines, which are too few. When you said that, Hoffman relies a little too much on physical humor - you know we are in trouble when going to jokes fart raising a laugh. A basketball scene where Hoffman hams it is completely overplayed (though it launches up one situation in the form of a shirtless opponent that raises a smile - noticeable in the reaction of the Stiller). However, everyone seems to act in a bubble, there are very few reactions. Hoffman and Stiller's character could have played in each other much, much more. Aniston again regains Rachel's role, but Stiller does not have Ross. It is more of a "Joey and a crush on Rachael" storyline. <br /> <br /> Polly is a not-to-number rom-com and that is failing - it lacks heart. You're not rooted for the characters. And a little more work we could have had a deeper story, but at the end of the movie's failure to come down to write the poor. Worth to see if she pops up on TV at a slow night, but you'll regret forking out cash to see it.
