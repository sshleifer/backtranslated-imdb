This film is an attempt to calculate cash in the City Sex Success with the success of the Weddings and a Funeral. In fact, if they were called Sex in a Funeral, they could do better in the box office. <br /> But the movie fell between two benches and can not get up. The characters are outlined improbably bright dialogue, but never acts in any way remotely recognized as people. One arbitrary, unreasonable action follows another in advance of what's happening to a plot, with one tire soon to the falsity of the entire enterprise. Andie MacDowell gets the point for acting his little heart out, but honors are stolen by Imelda Staunton, as in all of this, a police detective (do not they have a high heptitude)? Ms. Staunton seems unable to make a fake motion. Can we say the same to the writer-director. <br /> If Notting Hill annoys you as being bogus, stay away from this one. Phonus bolognus on half the shell.
