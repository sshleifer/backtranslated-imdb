Randall "Memphis" Raines is a thief stealing retired master who is forced back to the "game" when his youngest brother faces death to fail to file a British criminal boss Raymond Calitri. The work involves "lifting" 50 cars in 24 hours or Calitri will unlock his punishment. So rain quickly gathers a team he can trust and sets on the work at hand. But the police on him and some of the cars in the list are not easy to take. It looks like an impossible job can be completed. It was quite a throw away in 60 seconds, Nicolas Cage, Angelina Jolie, Robert Duvall, Will Patton, Delroy Lindo, Vinnie Jones, Giovanni Ribisi, Christopher Ecclestone, Scott Caan and Timothy Olyphant. Everyone who deserves better. Enough acting power has pushed a Porsche 998 Turbo. The problem is, that this is a lot of cases in overstocking car park cars, many characters, not enough zest. Out of our cuts in no doubt that this is a Bruckheimer / Simpson production, scripture laced script and loud noise and lashings in cheese, scattergun corrections, and directed with sledgehammer subtile by Dominic Senate. It's essentially a huge budget humor H.B. Halicki's 1974 self-contained film of the same name, and the offer offers up the potential for a based-based adrenaline film film. Potential that sadly never achieved. There are only one or two high impact moments, Daft for sure, but enjoyable no less there. But if you forgive the pun, the movie never gets out of gear first, it's more content to work with it's character characters who were about to try to make movies in Scott {Scott Rosenberg} work. The fans will get something from {the cars are ace on the eye}, as they will be fans of the unwittingly comedy movie {check the ecclestone grief}. But no, it's really rather poor all said. 4/10
