I was probably spoiled by having first seen versions in 1973 with Michael Jayston and Sorcha Cusack so the 1983 adaptation is like a deception. I just did not find any chemistry between the 2 main stars. A lot of staring and theater acting just does not for me, and that was all about putting Tim in Rochester's role. The Casting Director has actually ever read the book. Very weird! She is a fine actor but Mr. Rochester is definitely not! And Zela was just, quite, weird, bit of a matching matching couple. In favor of his throw in support was very good and the Lowood scenes for me was the best of the adaptation, but in general did not take any of the magic of the novel. Certainly would not ask anyone to watch it as a true adaptation of the novel. A real let down!
