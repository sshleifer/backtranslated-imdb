My dear ... Peter Sellers was one of the strange actors that was weird who was weird. But his choice of films, say, after 1964, was very unfortunate. He did not seem to realize how to use his talent. It would be better to work with more of the Kubricks in the movie world than those he did. In his later film, the only "Optimists of Nine Elms" and "When they have" impressed me of what I saw. <br /> <br /> That said, the boultings and Sellers made a few films before that hardly sounds bad - I have yet to see "Carlton Browne" and "Sky Higher!" - at least in the sense of using Sellers well to a degree. But "There's a Girl in My Soup" really is a poor movie and a foolish choice on Sellers' part in terms of character. In its film from 1955-64, you can usually expect at least a very tiny twist invented and still an enigma conviction in her role. Here, you have Peter Sellers trying to play a typical romantic lead. It's almost Sellers to play a coveted Covernous Coventry. It certainly does not convince, try as it might, or create an interesting character. It should leave these parts to follow-up masters like Cary Grant, and focus on those intriguing and dramatic role roles. <br /> <br /> Do and Sellers really do not establish any genuine chemistry; This is not easy, romantic romance in love is perfected by William Powell and Myrna Loy. It's pretty artificial looks, all the way through - I know that it is part of Danvers character that he is a dry prosecutor of ladies, but he does not really change that in a convincing manner. Sellers have a very grateful way to play "charm" as well ... this character really does not have any depth, and really does not get the liking of the viewer or interest. Sellers go to the motions in one way one would not think possible when reminding the magnificence of his sedentary, iconoclastic performance in "Lolita". <br /> <br /> There is really nothing to say about the scheme, direction or character, as frankly left little or no impression. This is really one of the most anemic films, satisfying, upset and cuddly that I've ever seen. A nonidentity of a "machine" for talented Sellers' talent. <br /> Rating: - * 1/2 / *****
