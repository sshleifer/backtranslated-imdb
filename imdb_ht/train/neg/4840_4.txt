This whole movie should last 45 minutes - maximum. Although an interesting concept / theme, it really did not develop as a story. Once the initial idea of ​​a brave (stupid?) Bomb driven experts (cowboy?) Are presented, and this happens very early in the movie, the rest is repetitious. Character did not explore, and aspects of the location and politics were ignored. There were some nice insights into the terrifying difficulties faced by troops in such an alien environment, and the difficulties in differentiating between friends and enemies. But the way in which the unit operates extends beliefs! Individual performance was good, and the special effects were adequate, but not enough to overcome the lack of basic content.
