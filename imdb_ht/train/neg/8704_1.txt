Overall I like dinosaur movies but this one is crap crap. There is no script, no dialogue, no act. And Ranson's brave colonel tries to show it is difficult and thus curving his mouth looks like a twin brother of the stupid Proctor of the Police Academy. So this was a complete waste of time (fortunately not wasted in money as I saw the movie on TV). And I really can not understand 7 people who graduated this 10 * 10. They must have been joking. My advice, if you see this title run out of it!
