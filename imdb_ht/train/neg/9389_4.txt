According to IMDb, as well as providing all other web sites that maintain a review; This "thing" does not have a director. Well, that would surely explain so much! Just a bunch of people gather together to shoot some porn sequences and throw them into an ultra-thin storyline of devil-worshiping and self-sacrificing women inside the walls of a solitary sanitarium. "Hardgore" is a prime example of the fully offset 70 smut, as it really did with a minimum of value production and inspirational script. Horror movies about satanic culture have been widely popular during the early 70's and porn as well, so why not combine the two? Here we have a simplistic story about a nymphomaniac girl who is engaged in a mental asylum, and in the first night, she has been drawn into a network of drugs, psychedelic orgies, rape, torture and dildo-action. Really, a lot of dildo-action. The lesbian interracial nurse tries to warn her, but she has slit her throat even the same night. The horrors aspect are really poorly elaborated, going out of the cruel mask-scary adventures of virulent off-season adventure. The photography and current performance are almost intolerable to amateur, but what do you expect in a movie that features footage of dildo-shooting and talking poisonous reproductive male organs? Leading lady Jisina Lynn is a charming girl looking for a ravishing body, but most of her co-stars (men and women) are horrible and too bold.
