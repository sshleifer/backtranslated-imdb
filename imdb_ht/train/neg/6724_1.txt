When you choose a movie I expect a factor you will consider, are the actors in the movie using their fame to influence the moral fabric of our society in a positive or negative way? This is not a political statement that's a moral issue that affects society. When a comedian / actor makes sexual harassment and racist remarks on a teenager with his father we should ask ourselves (i want to support this behavior)? In this case Mr. Foxx water behavior in the social fabric that teaches our youth right out of bad, good behavior from the bad of goodness is better than hate. Mr. Foxx should remember it is just entertainment, and there is a lot of that out there to choose from. Say sorry not to get it into the hook. It will not suffer the injury or remove the bad behavior it spread to our youth. One way to stop this behavior is to stop being a fan of it. Do not see anything to belong. We can not change them but we can stop the fame we give them.
