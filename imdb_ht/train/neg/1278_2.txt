Imagine a woman alone in a home for forty minutes in which absolutely nothing happens. Then this goes about twice more. Writing this is flat and dead, with unfunny jokes, and the bad act keeps you from taking care of any of the characters, even when fighting heavy packages and getting beaten by fraternity goats. Anyone who ranked this movie above a two is not completely smooth.
