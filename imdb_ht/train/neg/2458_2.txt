I cant describe how awful this movie is. Am I the only one who finds the way to host his totality disgusting? Men in Rohan look 100% fake and the hair is badly colored, which does not even come close to matching what the actors look like. The orcs looked terrible. Why gandalf walk with a bad one? Why cant to correct things correctly? Saruman is not Aruman. Others have sounded like awful SP * pronunciation of Tolkiens characters. All in all the happy studio that made this pull the plug out of the sequence, it was just a terrible awesome adapter. Go to the hobbit drawing for a better cartoon in Tolkien's work. Hell, even the same cartoon version of ROTK is better then this brilliant. 2/10
