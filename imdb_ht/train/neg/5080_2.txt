This is a review of the Wizard, not to be confused with the Wiz, or Mr. Wizard. The Wizard is an end-of-eight film about a boy's ability to seriously silence to play video games and walks throughout the opening credits. The Wizard is an unnecessary upgrade to the Wizard of Oz, and Mr. Wizard is that guy who sticks 100 straw along with some Tang kid drink from her. Now that we have all got out of the way, let me say this: there's really no reason to see this movie. It's simply a minute 100 commercial Nintendo designed to capitalize on the Powerglove, the legend of Zelda and Super Mario Brothers 3. I used the word "born" in the sense of loosest possible, because it seems like this movie was written about a weekend by a crack team who never played Nintendo, and headed by a man with less sense of style than my grandmother. Maybe if the writer and director sit down and actually play some games together, they would realize they were on garbage trash and instead went to professional schools to learn how to install stereos cars. hope this was an instrument for you. It is certainly not for me. In fact, I think I could lose a few Braincells in the act watching this movie and writing about it. The next time you are in the video store, and you see the Wiz, the Wizard and the Wizard of Oz all sitting there on the shelf in a nice little row, giving them all a miss and duck hunting rather.
