I'm sorry, I had high hopes for this movie. Unfortunately, it was too long, too thin and too weak to keep my attention. When I realized the movie was indeed only on a older guy reviving his dream, I felt cheated. Surely it could be a device to bring us into something deeper, something more important. <br /> So do not buy a big drink or you will run into the rest room. My kids did not enjoy it either. Ah well.
