Very disappointing version of Lorna Doone. Too many characters lack, there is no romantic scene, change in story lines, too short, to appear budgetary. Hardly enough dialogue to understand the story if you are not familiar with the novel. In some scenes it looks like Lorna has a bad cold on its upper lip. I'm sure make-up was it's best to hide it. I guess they did not want to stop film until he healed up, pity. Most likely why this movie was missing scenes kissing. There is one disappointing scene kissing at the very end. Lorna Doone is a great epic story and should be true. The 2000 version of Lorna Doone is twice as long, more romantic, much more enjoyable and more true in the book.
