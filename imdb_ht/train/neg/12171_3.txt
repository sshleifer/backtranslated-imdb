Being a slasher movie affiliate, I typically will be resolved to watch every cut film on my retina, which sometimes does more harm than good to my brain, I'll say. While other night navigation canals, Sleepaway Camp II has crossed the path with me. Of course, I wanted to check it out, as I heard in the Sleepaway Camp franchise, but never actually seen any of them (for shame, I know). I will remember that since I have not seen the original, my criticisms should probably not be taken too seriously, because perhaps I think it's wrong and it is totally intentional by designing the own franchise. I assume that the franchise at Sleepaway Camp is, in itself, a joke about himself. Hell, the same name comes as an intentional joke. Sleep away from camping? It's good fun. I can appreciate the movie for wanting to just put together something for value camps, but that's as far as I can go. Acting in this movie has cast the original Friday 13th look like thespians make a Macbeth proposal. Campy requires bad act, but comes over. Pamela Springsteen as evil out-of-touch-and-fact killer has made a better job of killing in my interest than being killed on the whole cast. As far as comedy goes, there was a few times where I chuckled, but it was some and far between. <br /> <br /> Finally, SAC II is pretty boring, and I really wanted to sleep away from the camp. Deaths are so obviously scandalous and fake that you can barely appreciate them. If you are looking for a slasher movie comedy and good camping, I recommend Club Dread. If your channel browsing takes you through this one, check and see what else is on.
