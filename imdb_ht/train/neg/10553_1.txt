I bought this movie for 1 euro, not knowing what it was all about. I thought "hmmm, a movie called human mutilation must be not very funny at least full of Gore." It was not funny Well. It was disturbing. Very disturbing. And I do not mind disturbing movies but this one just did not mean anything, except that child abuse is not a good thing to do. hmmm ... The quality of the images was terrible. Acting in ... there was no act. Just some fcked-up fuck fucks herself for over 90 minutes. This is probably material for the sicko to seek off on extreme gore. <br /> <br /> Do not watch it. It's not worth your time. It's just awful. I wish I never bought this. <br /> The guy who had to do this would be to mutilate
