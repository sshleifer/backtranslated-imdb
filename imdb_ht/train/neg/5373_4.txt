This is a classic example of an increasing problem with films. Why is the background noise and the band dramatically stronger than the dialogue? What does that mean? This movie is not alone. Most films seem to be doing so now. For 2 years, I was surprised if it was just something wrong with my TV, but then I got a new TV & there it is again. BACKGROUND noise that would take place a town block behind the actors drowning out the dialogue. <br /> It was even more disturbing in this movie because, in English version anyway, the woman mumbles constantly. I was hoping Jean Reno would say "excuse me, you would talk or find the marbles out of your mouth." If you look it on DVD & you have the same French high school, I recommend the French version and subtitles. I give it 4 because Reno was so good at Leon. Those who devoured the landscape, but I saw it on a TV & I lived in the Rockies for a few years, so "Enh".
