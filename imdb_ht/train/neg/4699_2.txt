Wow, the Naked Brother Band. What should I say. I guess I can say this show just sucks. number one: they have no talent, they probably can not even play the instruments. Number 2: On the commercial it was said to have been famous, but nobody even heard of them until there were bad shows coming over. Look, I really do not hate what's bad, I would give it as a 4 out of 10, but what annoys me is how everyone says they have such great talent and Nat is SO deep and writes lyrics fon. Deep my ass! She talks about hardcore wrestler with inner feelings. Wow, I could read what he said about the walls in a bathroom and it would be deeper than that. And they did not find the famous ones themselves, parents are famous celebrities and wanted their kids to be too much of being made up of a bad show. I have a feeling that it will be canceled soon.
