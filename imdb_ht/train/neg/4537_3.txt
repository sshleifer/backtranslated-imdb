I actually did not enjoy this movie. <br /> I saw it in a camp, and we did not devour it, we laughed at it. Sure, some parts touch, but the act is terrible, the effects are terrible, and the whole movie idea is terrible (now I know it was based on a book that I do not read, but I hope the book was better than this, because frankly, I thought that this movie was very bad and boring). As I said, I went to him with a bunch of people on a camp, and we were excited to be there, plus I got a caffeine drink but, however, I struggled to stay in the wake. The only thing that kept me (other than my fear of being embarrassed once I got up) was the gunshots, which were quite pointless as well. I just really did not like it.
