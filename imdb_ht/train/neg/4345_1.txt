Rewarding Advertising ... I Saw a Commercial for Carlitos Way: Raising Power Declaring "From Scarface Producer to Carlito's Way" LET REQUIRED ... Michael Bergman did not produce Scarface, in fact he was' editing editor room 'for Scarface. Do not take away Bergman's talent ... But in my opinion it should be there was a little more class. I think I can speak for the masses when I say ... We hate being blatantly lying. As far as the movie goes, It was the poorest. I thought Puff Daddy did a good job. Although Luis Guzman should be ashamed of working on this film. Overall, this film did not complete a good job at the empty spaces for Carlito Way. Obviously this project was an attempt to make a quick bucket instead of a good movie.
