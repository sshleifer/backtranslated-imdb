With an absolutely amazing cast and crew, this can be a classic. Instead it is a repetitive paraphrase of all the old scheme theory in 1979 on the JFK grafting attack, rather unnecessary, over to a vaguely incoherent plot on the assassination of President Kegan in 1960. Many actor superb characters They wasted as they either did not give enough to make - Sterling Hayden or Eli Wallach, for example, or asked to go rather luridly over the head - John Huston. Jeff Bridges and Anthony Perkins manage to find themselves very well, in their very different ways, though. The photography is gorgeous, but not justified an hour and a half in your life, or the cost of buying the DVD.
