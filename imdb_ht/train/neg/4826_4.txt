I see what the director tried to make but he missed the brand. The main actor was really good, but correction at the time it takes you out of it. The camera work, meaning lighting and exposure are kind of amateur that I could forgive if the direction was more talkative but it was not. The sound was a bit off and that took you out of the movie as well. I have seen this director can do a little better in the future is not a complete right but does not expect a DVD movie almost as good as 28 days later or anything, keeping your expectations low and you'll get more out in it. At least it was only an hour and a half. Oh yeah and other than the acting act was very bad if you asked me. But I'm a movie snob so take that for what's worth.
