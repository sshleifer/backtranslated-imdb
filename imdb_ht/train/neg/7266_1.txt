... and again, we said there was another hour and 20 minutes left. <br /> <br /> Why, oh, why did not there an editor tell the writer / director of bar, cut, snip? Apparently writers / directors have already made shorts; As a brief, this would be okay. But the lack of dialogue starts to grind after twenty minutes. The lack of music glares. The background noise (talk, traffic, and especially an omnipresent helicopter) get old really fast. But the worst failure is in history. There is little bit more than a short one. <br /> After an hour we've seen variations in the same scene over and over again. I almost scream at the screen, "We get it, we get it !!!!!" It's amazing that after leaving the theater, we could drive home, watch the Daily Show and part of the Colbert report, ready for bed, and know that the audience was always blocked in the theater. It's not enough to appreciate your vision. You must give the audience enough to share your vision.
