Protocol is a plausible film that only saves grace is that it stars Goldie Hawn along with a good cast of supporting actors. The story revolves around a violet violin restaurant that becomes famous after inadvertently saving the life of an Arab dignitaries. The story goes down half of the film and Goldie's charm just does not save this movie. Unless you're a Goldie Hawn fan does not go out of your way to see this movie.
