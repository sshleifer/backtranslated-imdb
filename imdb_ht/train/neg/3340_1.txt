This is the kind of movie that wants good but sucks. The first thing, what hell is these punk trying to do with the school? I think children do not seem to realize the gravity of the situation. Decer guy says the girl is under his responsibility when he asks why he wants to go back to them, but right afterwards he gives a gun to the dude seat chair and wants him to go alone repairing the phone line . Where is the responsibility there? I understand that poor actors must pay their food, but why not just give them the money that takes a movie like that or gives money to a charity. Oh yes and none of them know how to target. The guy punk guy shoots in the cafeteria nowhere like an oven. They all want to look professional but they all suck. Another thing I do not think there is no emergency exit in the school kids trying several doors, but they are all closed. What happens if there is a fire and security guard to dumass die? It is illegal to have an emergency exit from the school. Anyway, there is a lot more to say but it would be too long. I spent some time in my life watching a crap.
