Director Fred Schepisi (Roxanne) directs this intent but comedy inferior to Albert Einstein (Matthau) is trying to catch his scientific science (Ryan) and ordinary guy Tim Robbins in order to find her relax and enjoy life in the 1950s . To get Ryan like Robbins, Einstein tries to make Robbins look like a brilliant scientist. The idea is beautiful, but the movie falls flat and blows with unusual dialogue. Tim Robbins, Meg Ryan, and terrific players support doing their best to keep this comedy comedy afloat, but they can save the movie. Its painter is so talented to enter products like a substandard film. I would not recommend anyone unless they are big fans of Meg Ryan.
