Ahh, t.v a. shows and the pilots who were slamming together in the 70's do equally t.v. movie! Some examples should rise and kill (hysterically cheese in the lot), locked in space (confusing and refreshing), San Francisco International (horribly dull and unbelievably confusing), and this turgid bit of Quinn Martin glamor. <br /> Shot in Hawaii (although you would not know it out of the outdoors), it's apparently a pilot failed for a spy spy spy. The real problem is that you don; not like most of the characters, including the main drab Diamond diamond head, who seemed half asleep for the entire movie; her husband 'boss, who had a really unusual delivery in her line with white hair bells as well as the time that looked like she was stuccoed on; Girlfriend Boyfriend Diamnt Head / fellow (hell, I can not even remember her name) a slim, wooden woman with a flat way to talk that's just not sexy or exciting; and Zulu's sidekick song (again, I can not remember the name of his character) that was not bad at small doses. The most interesting person in the entire production was Ian McShane, who aspired as a bad guy but still proves his acting chop. Alothugh make-up works so called 'argument' used to disguise himself was just ridiculous. I have absolutely no idea what he did or what he was trying to steal into the laboratory that caused him to dress as an American Indian dictator as American cameraman. I do not care for myself. The plot simply was not interesting enough to keep your attention for even ten minutes at a time, let alone the hour and a half or so it goes on. Just call this one - Hawaii Five No!
