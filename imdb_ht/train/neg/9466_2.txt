This movie was physically painful to sit down, perhaps because (as many as my age, and younger) I grew up with Dr. Seuss and loved her books - funny, smart, capricious and subversive at the same time. The "Cat of the Hat" sucks all of the interest and sparks from the story, and Mike Myer's performance as the cat is especially bewildering. Why is the accent Bortch accent, the unfunny partner, the jokes are appropriate, the charm charming? I went back and read the books to see the real problem: The books are simple. This movie is OVERBLOWN and way, way too long. <br /> You do not expect all movie films to be Toy Story or the Iron Giant, but this one puts a new bar. How Mike Mike needed the money?
