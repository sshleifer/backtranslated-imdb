As with some of the other reviews I've been talking about, I'd like to know what Moron actually reads the script, it goes, "Yeah !!! This is it. This is the next movie we'll be green light !! " And who this person is, should be self-examined for current brain activity. Because anyone who is responsible for actually dishing out the money having this done after reading the script, well, I would like to give you my email address and maybe you would just give away some more money. This movie is at risk in every way. <br /> <br /> The funny guys, at least they can. They did some good movies and had some incredibly funny performance on the road. But in here, not only in the quarrel challenged all logic, not only is the terrible act, not only is the film offensive all from start to finish, not only is the direction as amateur as you can find, but they actually want you to pay to see this movie. Perhaps if it was free ... naaah, it would always be a waste of time. <br /> <br /> Generally I should be inclined to write some time off, detailed review of why this film is so bad, but just enough to say that let's make the decision to speak. This is the lower part of the common denominator film and it is about as unfunny as a heart attack. <br /> <br /> 0/10 .. list my top ten of the worst movie ever!
