What a shame that Alan Clarke has to be associated with this trick. That does not rule out however; get a group of boys and some stellas together and have a candle in a run this one time again and again and rolling around on the floor and tears of laughter. Great wasted night thing. Al Hunter home on a well-publicized theme in the late 80s - that rowdy was well organized and not really interested in football in itself - often with respectable works (real estate agents ???). But how Clarke can convince us that any of the two-bit actors lost out on other low-quality TV productions (Grange Hill) or soon go to drama drama quality (Eastenders) case for a nanosgond We believe that football is difficult to seduce. Are we really convinced that the ICF (of whom of course is the drama based) would ever go to another city to fight with just six socks? The ICF would crowd the tube station with the likes and HUNDREDS. Andy Nicholls' Scally needs to be read before even contemplating a story of this nature. The act is appalling and gives most of the laughs to Oldman so it's incredible. Most of them look as if they should be in the bath of Mr Matey. A true inspiration to anyone who has a digital video camera that thinks they can make a movie clip for him.
