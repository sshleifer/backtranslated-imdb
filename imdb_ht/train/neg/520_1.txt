After counting the word, oh, about 22 times in the first 10 minutes or in the movie, listening to some really bad actors going on a woman with a horse, and pretty much acting like 12 year old boy was naughty together, well, we turned it around. Relying on the unrestricted freeze and humor bathrooms is a certain sign of a Hollywood movie deficit, the product of inimaginable and no-talented writers. <br /> <br /> We gave it a second chance, surely think it would get better. No bones. And my boyfriend jumping to the rest of the film in case it improves, there is still no bone. <br /> <br /> The main character has a cool bike. <br /> <br /> I would not recommend this to anyone except perhaps really imitate adolescents, or frat boys.
