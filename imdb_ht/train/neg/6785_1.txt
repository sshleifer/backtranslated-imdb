> You have been warned that this is a barge! > This movie is so bad that I doubt I can write enough lines. The large number of vaccines were well thought out. The actors were pretty good particularly Richard Pryor tho I'd love to see more of him. Madeline Kahn and John Houseman were classics. Dudley more blessed God he could do better. Jan Ritter again I would like to see more of it. In my opinion this failure is due to totally failing writers. Perhaps the producer could pull the plug once he saw what he was creating. It's just too bad that a lot of money goes into this pan, when with little change here and there would be in my opinion fixed it. They must have paid the standard rate writers. To produce one chuckle.
