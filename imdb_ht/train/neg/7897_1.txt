This movie was made for those who found Gremlins mild and hardcore critters. Like many of the critters / trol / gremlins movies in the 80's this movie is bad. The sad part is that there's no punchline this comment. It's just bad and not in a funny way. The problem with this miniature monster movie is that it actually tries to be funny and ends up as successful in doing so as Howie Mandell was in walking as a Man. What made the 80's other horror movies in classics was that they were really trying to scare, but they were hilarious because they failed so miserable. One must have told Bettina Hirsch (yes THE Bettina Hirsch) he had a talent for comedy before he started directing this film. Unfortunately they were wrong. <br /> Make sure you see an unusual little cross mutation between a ferret and a tumor wearing a brown trunk and throwing pool balls into an outcast from the Lost Boys but is not enough to save the movie. <br /> <br /> By far the most annoying part of the movie is the character of Paul. Paul Reiser wannabe schtick is enough to make you start fast expedition from the time of his first stage until the credit ends only stand once to see a scene where a munchie throws ball pool into a guy ... not what I did so. <br /> So, the line runs down, does not walk, to your nearest blockbuster and shake hands with the manager and thank him for not having the stock grapes this pile of rubbish on the shelves.
