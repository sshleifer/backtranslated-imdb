Jane Eyre_ is one of the greatest novels in the English language and this scenario should read her. I hate her when writing writers use Spark for what a novel is all about. This movie is unbearable to see if you have read the book. <br /> <br /> All the 'red room' so down to play that I wonder why they even bother putting it in the 'red room' book is predicted for the whole story and the rest of life Jane a. Helen Burns is treated so badly in the film I'm sure she was happy to die and leave early. In the book it is one of the most compelling characters and it was not the red head. All Christian terms are missing in his life and the rest of the movie. <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor and miss this movie and read the story as Charlotte Bronte masterfully told her.
