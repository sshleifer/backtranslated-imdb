When the employees of a theater get an old coil in their films, they decided to show it to Midnight Screening at night of dead life, assuming it's a pre-old reel. Unfortunately, it's actually an old Nazi control idea that turns the audience into a horde of gorgeous zombie shufflers. <br /> I can not understand the hatred for this movie. It is an independent budgeting campaign that has many camps, but it does not deserve a "1.1" here on IMDb. It's just so much fun. It is obvious that the filmmakers have a reasonable knowledge and love of old horror movies, and they have created an entertaining amount of money to send with references to homage to a variety of them. He has the feeling of such things as the night of the living dead (in many ways, very similar), Evil Dead 2 and Army of Darkness, and various others. <br /> I love the explanation of how zombies, though really just hypnotized in thinking are zombies, actually come to have the physical attributes of living-the incredible living, maybe, but I appreciate the effort by the writers explaining li. These effects were decent for the budget, the action was indeed, and the story was fun. <br /> I love it.
