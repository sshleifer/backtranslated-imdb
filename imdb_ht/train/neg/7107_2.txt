I'm sure there are some sort of IMDB cult that loves movies that MST3K has made fun. After seeing both this and the "werewolf" and dozens of readings on comments on how underated, I became convinced that some compilers will be over here. Many people say that those who hate him "are only scared by Gore", "Do not know good horrors" or things like that. Well, I do not really care for Gore, but I want Something to get in a movie! Most of it is just the wife sitting and looking around! Or walk around the house / garden! A film requires something to be atmospheric, not finding it by just having the freeway scenes being someone walking around with stares. Oh, and "Do You Think"? Yeah, I thought "MOVE! You @ # $ 0 &% !!" One of the worst horrors movies I've ever seen! <br /> <br /> For the record, I'm a big fan of the old style of horror, Dracula, Frankenstein, That kind of thing.
