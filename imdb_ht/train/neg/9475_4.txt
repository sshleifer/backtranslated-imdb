Many pictures and abilities act, generally, but are written very slipshod. There are scenes of such uncertainty that there is no joy in watching. The fact that the young lover has a twin brother, for example, so optimally that I cried loudly. And "emotions-light bulb connections" looks like gimmicky, too. <br /> I do not know, though. If you have a few glasses of wine and feel like relaxing with something nice to look in with a few funny scenes, this is a very good movie. There is no bigger effort on the part of the required viewers. But Italian film, especially Italian comedy, is usually much, much better than that.
