Assassin Hauser's (John Cusak) mission is violating a mid-east oil minister, whose name is due to be Omar Sharif (Neikov), in Turaqistan who is run by American interests. Hauser poses as Trade Show producer to allow him to go to Omaha. Sometimes a satire can be so annoying that it becomes more annoying. Here it is too much: government, politics, music, war, people who are not generally accepted by society, and I mention "war." And that's what we have here - a most annoying movie that borders on a very bad nightmare brought to life. I always wonder why I continue with the DVD. Also, there are so many Cusak family members that John Cusak appears to be embarrassed by the family just being there, or is that just me? <br /> It was used to be that a movie Jan Cusak, while slightly Offbeat, was, in the end, rather good. Not here. Believe that John Cusak had a hand in writing and produced in this mess. Do what you will. <br /> There is too much going to the movie accompanied by constant gun-fire, bombings, and shouting that you really can not focus or was that point? Probably. It just takes too long to set up the hit, which is largely forgotten until the last 15-minute. In the meantime we have interior sense among all of the cast. And chemistry between John Cusak and Marisa Tormei? I do not think so, but you know: the boy ?? girl thing ???? and they need something to take more time. <br /> Yes, for what was supposed to be, (cut and annoying) their performance in Duff, and Kingsley was good. But when I saw Dan Aykroyd's character, from the beginning of the show, sat on a toilet seat, I knew the rest of the show would go to the tank as well. I was not wrong. I'm sure some will sing praises in this effort, but if a rose is still a pink by any other name, too, is a mess ?????????? <br /> I now remember why I continue with the DVD. I was hoping that the story would somehow level out and save itself. Never do that. <br /> <br /> Violence: Yes. Sex: No Nudity: No Language: Yes.
