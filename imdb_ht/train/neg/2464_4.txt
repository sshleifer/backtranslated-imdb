Loved one part, The Planet is impossible, but whoops, what a part of the deception of 'Satan's Pit' is. Cliffhanger in something apparently rising from the pit was - nothing is out of the pit. Then the old man had to pull out the air bladder out of the story, the animal was a roaring thing of intelligence, so there is no doctor / cruel confrontation I would anticipate. The TARDIS is somehow inside the pit despite the pit was not opened until long after the TARDIS fell into the planet's crust. And finally another solution made that there is no logical reason - I mean, why not dive the animal into the hole as soon as the hole opens? Why not immerse him in those years ago instead of his prisoner anyway. Why not - I could go on but I lost interest ...
