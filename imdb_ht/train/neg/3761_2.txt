Foywonder reviews in this cheap STV hit the nail downright on top. Be sure to read it. In case you are not, a group of top scientists cut into the deep woods of the Pacific Northwest, fumble around with a bunch of bones in an animal cemetery. Families of Big Feet do not slowly and this, and the proceeds are chosen from the team one by one, largely screen. Big foot itself has a face-like face, but is less scared than Harry than Harry and the candidates. Most of the film has wooden, the generic actors pretend to be trumping scientists around in the woods and yakking away. This is a movie that has no budget in which much has happened, at least on screen. We get to watch the sexiest of women to take a shower while one of her boyfriends boy watches, but nothing comes to this.
