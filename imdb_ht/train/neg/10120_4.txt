This Hitchcock movie brings little movie lithograph to her later appearance, and looks more like a very old fashioned story. A young couple receives a legacy that they believe will make them happy. They spend the money traveling over the world and living a very hedonist existence. However, after a while the excitement starts off with the couple becoming followers and useless to their existence. However, from no place, when on a luxury cruise, the boat sinks and they lose everything - and end up very happy at the end because they now appreciate life! What an odd movie, funny and preachy! Personally, I would like to inherit all the money and find out if it makes me miserable! Their production value is relatively poor compared with later production - a rough film with poor sound quality and rather amateur acting.
