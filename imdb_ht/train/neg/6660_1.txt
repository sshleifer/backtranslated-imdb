Seriously, the fact that this show is so popular just boggles the idea. This show is not funny, it's not smart, it's not original, it's just a steamer deck of bull crap. Let me start with the characters. Characters are all one moron and loud dimensions, exaggerated voices that just sound like nails on a board. Acting in voice could have been better. Then there's the animation. I AM, it hurt me just to look at it. Everything is too flat, too pointy, too bright, and too candy coated. Then there is the humor, or lack thereof. It's completely idiotic! They just take these B-grade jokes that are not even comical in the first place and then repeat them to death. They also drown in some soft humor moods that are sick to me. And finally, the last and youngest, the music. It's just plain annoying. It sounds like it composed on a child's computer and generates no emotion as well. I wish there was a lower score than 1, I really did. Show this seriously need to cancel. It's a show I try to avoid like the epidemic. Whenever I heard this song, I instantly turned the TV. If you never watch this show then do not. Look at programs such as The Simpsons or Futurama.
