Man, I really wanted to like those shows. I'm hungry for some good TVs and I applaud TNT to give these "opportunities". But sadly, I am the minority I guess when it comes to Cinematic Stephen King. As brilliant as writing the king is, the irony is that it simply does not translate well into the screen, big or small. With some exceptions (very few), the King's experience can not be filmed with the same impact that the stories have when it comes to. Many people would agree with this, but I am sure that at the heart of their hearts have admitted that the best story-filmed is but a memory spoken in the one they read. The reason is simple. The average royal story takes place in the mind-the-scenes of the characters in the story. It gives us glimpses of inner thoughts, emotions and sometimes fractured or real-life views. In short, you'll find the readers where you can not install a Panavision camera. As an audience watching the movie is filmed, we're leaving with less than half of the information than the reader has access to. It's not too far a stretch of claim that one gets a character in a royal story, whereas One is limited to little strikers of characters even when filmed. For as long as King writes, Hollywood tries to shoot everything that comes out of his word processor, without any consideration whether they should. I do not blame the filmmakers for trying, but it takes an incredible amount of talent and nicknames pulling on the floating Stephen King adaptation that works. The work is analogue turning lead gold, or some luxurious Zen mastery. Oh well, better luck next time.
