I saw this movie a few days ago ... what was hell? <br /> I like movies with Brian O'Halloran, they are funny and enjoyable. When I saw a name in this title and genre I thought so much, this one might really be good ... there are some parody for slashers or another Gore movies ... but .. then i read a preview and thinking right it might be good anyway ... but it was not ... <br /> <br /> My opinion: if such movies look bit like documentary, and little in comedy try Moore's movies or foreign automobiles, they're really about something. This one was empty. <br /> and put a comedy in title ... no comments ... really bad jokes
