I enjoyed this movie most of the time, but I kept getting to feel that I watched a movie. I honestly think someone wrote a pg script and then while filming, decided to add in some blood, nudity and language. it was a big down. There's the belief that magic kids exist in movies like "babe" (the pig) or "angel in the field" that defeats the evil teeth. Parents end up believing their daughter about her ability to see the ghost and utilizing this supernaturally skilled defeat of the tooth. when I bought this film, I thought it would be a b-movie response in the dark to fall; somehow manage to make a better movie with 1/4 of the money, but they do not. they made a movie worse and will probably lose the same proportion of money lost on dark falls.
