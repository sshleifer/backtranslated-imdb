When anti-Bushes jokes get really easy to do, a show like this was best to make sure it has something extra. When that extra thing is the child's version of political figure making jokes about the future they have not yet, it's just plain nonsense. Dick Cheney and George Bush are doing well but Dick Cheney Mutters mainly. There is also Condoleeza Rice that has a break on Bush for some reason and Donald Rumsfeld that does not really look like Donald Rumsfeld at all. Democratic characters rarely give their names for it is a mystery as to who might be who is apart from Barack Obama and Hilary Clinton. The episodes have coherent history but that's not nearly enough to keep this from sinking.
