I bought this movie for $ 5 in a used CD store, and I am sorry. I will start by saying I'm a big fan of cheese arrow cops. They provide a horribly sad playable entertainment. This film entertained for the first half hour, because it was so bad it could be fun in a style style MST3K easily. Then he was boring. <br /> <br /> The act is the frightening part of the movie. While bigger act is not to be expected, this was sad sad and, honestly, given all of the entertainment that had to be. This is the more side of the movie. Where the movie really falters in fun is the writing, lighting, and correction. <br /> <br /> This movie gives way too much "What is $ @ # is going on?" moment. There are many moments, such as the mother who are unusual adapted to dinner, and then there is absolutely no consequence of the movie. Along the lines of dinner, someone in charge decided it was fun to watch people eating refined for five minutes straight without dialogue every time a meal served. During the meals and inappropriate moments, the scene is cut off from outside darkness. Then cut back in and talk about outer darkness, one of the funniest parts of the film is the climate, where apparently it is not night unless it's raining. And speaking of darkness, a big problem with the movie is that it's wrong to neglect you can not see what's happening about half the time, which is more of a frustration than anything. In one of the climaksa scenes, you can not even say what you are supposed to see this is so shocking. <br /> <br /> When it comes to climate scenes, Unhinged has one of the worst. I saw people saying "Wow, that amazed me, and that's good." I can say that the great reveal was to surprise me, because I did not see it coming. The reason I did not see it is because it made absolutely no sense. I will not ruin it for you, but I'll tell you that my friends and I spent a good twenty minutes later in various parts of the film to find anything that would reassure that at all, and all we found were the most They say it is not possible. <br /> At all, this movie is actually best when you look at it with the comments tracks that make fun of it. I like the horror movie movie, but that was too much.
