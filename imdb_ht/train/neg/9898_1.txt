The version of "Moby Dick" insults the audience by claiming it based on the Melville novel - even going so far to show a first sentence chapter rather than the famous "Call Me Ishmael". In addition, athens act, even from John Barrymore, this is perhaps the greatest example of how far Hollywood (especially early Hollywood) would go to review and change a famous novel just beef up his luck in office in boxes. All the lovely woman, poetic tongue was absolutely eliminated, and Ahab had switched from a brooding, blasfemous, obsessive crazy to a superbly hero, misunderstanding that only wants to kill Moby Dick after her fianc√© (!) turns away from him after seeing his wooden leg. For this added the wrong standard fee that wants the fiance for himself, with a different end!
