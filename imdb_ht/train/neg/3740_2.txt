Straight away, this movie was ridiculous. Not that he did not have rachites aspect? For example, the best thing about this movie was the beautiful background scenery. Anyone who does not live on the east coast should know that the South does not have beautiful mountains like those found in the West. I knew it was Utah right off the bat, but perhaps Dalton could not suppress his English accent, so excused him by saying this was a southern city. Subverting his accent in a South was easier. Make sure the movie has twists drawn, but its deep sense of place was something I could not get past. It's not like Utah no laboratory meth ... So why the writers thought it was necessary to pretend he was in the South is beyond me. <br /> Another thing of action pictures still patience me. Why are the "cocking" always sound effects when the character pulls out an automatic menu? It seems all the other sound effects in this film was a "chuk-miser" meaning a 9mm packed and ready to fire. Of course, weapons have already had room judges for this was needed. <br /> <br /> Finally, the pyrotechnics have been on the top. But hey, this movie was aimed at a certain market segment I suppose ... It's too bad. Each of the actors can act, but this movie was lame.
