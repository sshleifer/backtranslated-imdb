As a Mystery Science Theater 3000 fan, I can withstand any motion picture that can be foisted on me, but there is absolutely no reason for that. <br /> Rated "Super Action" in the Blockbuster video section and provided I was supposed to be the only methods that Movie Maker (HA!) Robert Napton could use to get at least 4.50 to one unsuspecting person. <br /> <br /> Shame on you Robert Napton! Shame on you to exploit these poor Mexican actors who you probably promised hope to make it great in American movies. You're a shame! <br /> There is not a moment in this movie that keeps the slightest in action. Did you use Snot on these people? Oh, look, they're having a rave in a field! Like all 6 of them. And is not this a Asian guy in the background? Why is it still daylight? Why did it take 1/2 in the movie to show anything .. and more importantly why we look other 1/2?
