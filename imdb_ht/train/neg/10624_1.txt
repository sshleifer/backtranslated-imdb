In an otherwise good review, loleralacartelort7890 says "The truth is that Americans use an aluminum-anti-radiation-alloy secrete .. It is not well known. And the precise specifications are a secret .. And why Is it a secret: Well, why should they reveal it back then? If they are in a space race with the Russians, then it would be very mute to reveal that they had new technologies that would be protected radiation crew. "This is completely incorrect. There (and) there was no "secret" of radiation protection in Apollo. The design and construction of Apollo's modules have long been publicly available. It uses a lightweight "honey" in aluminum and stainless steel. All the exterior surfaces (except course windows) are covered with a heat shield made of a phenolic resin, thicker on the bottom that faces front re-entry. These materials are actually * the best * of the type of radiation we have in space (charging particles) than lead, which is best suited to suspending ionized photons such as X-ray and gamma rays. is a problem defined for long-term * space flights because of the risk of large solar flashlights. But it simply was not a serious threat to the Apollo astronauts. The Command Module gave them very good protection during the short (1/2 hour or so) passage of the Van Allen Belts. They all brought the doses to know exactly how many radiation each received: no more than 1.5 rpm, and usually much less. Of the 24 men flying to the moon (12 of them landed), 18 are still alive. Only two were killed in cancer: Alan Shepard (leukemia) and Jack Swigert (bone cancer). The rest was killed in heart attack, pancreatitis (Roosa), and a motorcycle crash (Conrad). These are actually very good statistics for a group of people now in the late 70s (Shepard would be 86).
