On the island of Fiji, the greedy and dishonest owner of the Valalola Resort Primal Park invites investors and invites for a partial opening of its composed of hotels and zoom aims to find partners for his discovery. When a bunch of college thief collects a virus in the security system to participate in a scavenger hunt, the greatest attractions in the zoo ?? Sabretoothes from the prehistoric age developed in DNA found in fossils ?? escape, kill the hosts and guards for fun. <br /> <br /> Incredibly lame and cheap "Attack of the Sabretooth" is one of the worst movies I've just seen. The characters are terrible and not funny or beautiful and the story is a terrible Jurassic Park rip-off and a bad collection of clich√©s. Basically all the lines and situations are poor and stupid, but the winner is when the guard explains that sabretooth they are bullying and love for fun. My vote is three. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "You attack the Sabrette" ("The Sabretooth Attack")
