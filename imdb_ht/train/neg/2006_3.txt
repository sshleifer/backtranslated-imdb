It would help you to know why it took time for a movie as a movie ready "as" Next Door House "to adapt to film or television. The book was copyrighted in 1978. One of the reasons might be the problem of designing ' The house 'of this film forever is really so ugly that I can not imagine anyone who buys it. In fact it's so ugly that someone would probably come and destroy him as soon as he was built. <br /> I'm not crazy about horror genre books, but this one was hard to put down when I came across it about ten years ago. The main characters are not the types of people to look for okultan anything in life, and this is one of the strengths of the book. They would not conclude that the architect had some kind of evil spirits (or the individual devil) without witnessing and analyzing the events described well in the book. However, it is an downbeat book for the most part, and I do not think that calls to people who run all life. Maybe someone will come up with another version of the book at years to come. A better home .. best music .. a better scenario with darker lighting ... would certainly help.
