Basically, take the concept of every Asian terror horror film and break it into one and you get this movie. The story goes like this: a bunch of college kids get mails voices from their own phones that predict their deaths. There are some s *** going on with ghosts, which if you've seen any Asian fantasy film, is not afraid now. This movie was quite troubling because it was very clear. It's even the bull, different films. <br /> <br /> The act was very good. Unfortunately the actors put in a very ring-ringing situation, so there is nothing we have not seen in the past. Two lead acts have made a solid job. As far as gore, there is not much going on. We found a cool sequence including a bra scarf off a head (I do not know how to explain it), but it was cut off so you did not see anything except the final result. You see some blood at times, including brackish arms and a zombie (which seemed really cool I could add), but this movie is not too bloody. <br /> <br /> The hearts of the movie are few and spread out, and it's really not that scary. You will get some creepy images at times, but it's not enough for me to consider scary. It's nothing different from Ringu, Ju-On, or Dark Water, and none of those who are afraid of me either. This is really the fall of this (and most cinema horror movies) is that if it does not save the crises then it's just not that good. As far as directed, Takashi Miike has always done a very good job. He seemed a little tamed in this movie compared to his past movie, but still shows a lot of style messed up it's famous for. A lot of images were a lot like Miike (including a scene with a bunch of dead fetish jars), and the last 15 - 20 minutes seemed far more Miike then the rest of the movie. Still, the film is flawed by its unoriginality. <br /> I would recommend this only to those who have great on Asian horror movies (even if you are, I can recommend better) or great Miike fans. Warning to those who want to enter Miike, this is NOT his best work. <br /> I give it a 4 because it's just mediocre. Perhaps if this was published 4 or 5 years ago it could be a higher rating. <br /> <br /> Also, I would like b **** on Asian real horror movies. How come if it's an Asian horror movie automatically supposed to be good about here (US)? A lot of these movies are the equivalent of Japan in what's called Urban Legends, and I know what you did last summer were over here in the 90's. If you saw one you saw them all. And a lot of these movies count way too much about crises and imagery that if it does not save the crises they set out to do then they're just not that good, and nothing could change that. More Asian horror films need more like auditions and a story of two sisters, two movies that if they do not scare or scare you, at least they have great stories, acting, direction, movies, and more at their backs up. Two movies are not just great movie horrors, but big movies in general. More Asian horror movies need such as instead of the clicker, "A ghost just wanted to be found for it around the cell phone / video / tapes / home / electric appliances / tap water / google search engine / vibrator / groceries / etc ..
