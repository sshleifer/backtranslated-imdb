Some films are so bad that they're good. This is clearly not one of them. Based on a true story, this movie was about as true in the story as Pinocchio's chance to become a real boy. The act was terrible, the direction was poor, and he traveled too fast. It was as if the director just wanted to get it over and do and go home. <br /> There was also Melissa Joan Hart never hit me as a talented actress, but then every movie he did was pretty low-budget anyway. Like most of its other films, it lets down its character by hamming them up too much, speaking too fast that if speed up its words will make it more dramatic. He really carries out the sense of having a crew in front of him and talking with a camera, when he should engage the viewer of his character. It is very attractive to allow the whole movie, and any leg that he can have left standing on is also ruined. <br /> <br /> Probably just good about the movie is when it was nailed to the end. But even that was not enough enough to prevent my laughing for such a movie bad. <br /> <br /> Look at it if your taste in the movie is blander than a cracked toast.
