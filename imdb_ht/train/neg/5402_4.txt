This film is so incredible; - The whole site is bunkum; The fact that a serial killer (vampire or otherwise) could fly in untraced and kill as many people as the movie implies is ridiculous. The vampire himself would not look out of place in a movie Bela Lugosi. Most of the acting so wooden actors should be treated for dry rot. I waited for the day when someone made a decent movie from a Steven King novel (and exceptions, perhaps, by myself). This film suffers from what most movies Stephen King does - the lack of funds used for "special" effects, poor actors, appalling characters and dialogues. This movie is cheap, tacky and fails of all that she tries to do.
