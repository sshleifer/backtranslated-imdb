Can be described as horrible. It's bad to start with and then gets even more bad. When you start you really have to look it in because it's impossible to believe it can get worse - but do not be afraid because it does. Another script is wrong written for a donkey director for non-talent poster movie star generations. It's hard to decide if the script is worse than the act or if the director is worse than both. As for the hero - well he bumps up everyone including a scene where he beat the livinglights alive from the hard by swinging open the wardrobe door and crush it against the window with it. And in another scene he was thrown into a window with 20ft crash on concrete - not even flashing - then got up immediately and gets stuck in the villains. This is a really ridiculous movie. Lucky it only cost me $ 1 hire.
