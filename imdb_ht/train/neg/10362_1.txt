Disney? What happened? I really wish the movie was put in the 60, as the book was. And I really could deal with the special cheap effects in order to save the budget for a more accurate adaptation ..... I'm glad that, perhaps, one can influence reading the books. But, Man has red eyes replaced as it? And what went up with the volcanic change? Where was the book? Peter Jackson! Save Us !!!! A long time ago (1978) I heard that there was a European version of this movie. I'm sure I might have it id. I can only imagine it might be closer to the real story than this poor hustle. This movie needs X'd.
