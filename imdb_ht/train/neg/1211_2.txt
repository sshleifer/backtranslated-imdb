Only the quality of this film has the original original scene. Other than that movie is a great DUD. We have the Kim Basinger, the housewife beleaguered slowly flow into the local mall for the first 30 min. in the movie, which adds nothing. Then the movie picks up a bit as it has a confrontation with 4 punks that took 2 parking spaces on this busy bus. They started chasing him after the local security officers tried to help him. From this movie gets worse, way worse. I know only her film and you had to go with the sink but she's been on a 5th minus headstart and she can not hide or find someone to help her. Instead, he drives in half a building on the divisions near a forest. In fashionable fashion she does everything she can to allow her followers to easily follow her. But now it's turned into one tough mof. You get the point. Not in any circumstance buying or renting this movie does not matter how much you like this type. It's so logical that you'll be questioning each stage. It is embarrassing for Basinger and Craig Sheffer and the rest of the cast, as well as consumers.
