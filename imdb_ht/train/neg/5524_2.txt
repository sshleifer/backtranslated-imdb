I neglected this film for many reasons. In the first ten minutes of the film, I grew up very disappointed and came to the conclusion that if this movie was going to salvage itself, for me at least, that he would have to pull himself out of the hole the enormous he was digging. Unfortunately, that did not happen. The two draws in the movie so I saw Jane Fonda and Felicity Huffman. I do not know enough about Lindsey Lohan's work that was interested in what she would bring to the movie. And I just felt ashamed of and for all three of them though there were "moments" in each of their performances. I imagine that for each of them finding "moments" they were a very difficult task to give the fact that there was a surprising lack of character development and unmatched dynamics. Although the plot is an interesting one, the film on the whole is so badly written, directing and editing that anyone's performance as an actor would suffer and be attached by it. The disrespectful way in which she faced sexual abuse and hereditary insult and insult to the small-city America, I think, was the main reason why this film failed to hit it in branding. As a review noted and I would agree, the movie is almost impossible in the market to end it's form. I suspect that, or at least hope (for the actor to do all the way) there are some real gems on the chairs room off. Sad to us, but if this is true then the actors can take consciousness and feel a bit good about their talent lending and time like a flop. Oh yeah and something else ... I wanted for once I could go see an American movie that included the unfortunate but wonderful bucolic surroundings as the one in this movie where the main characters were not absentmindedly and / or despair glittering countryside with pop box, CD crush, and other garbage!
