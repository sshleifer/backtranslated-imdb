This was a watershed event in his movie watching life. I went to see it in the theater when it came out. I was completely surprised at just how bad it was. Movies like this make you wonder who puts the money up and belongs to those who favors - a very, very great favor. Special effects are absolutely the first grade level, as in any first class could be done. Rubber sticks game on strings with no attempts to hide the strings, arrows that appear to be drawn on the movie and watch to be shaped in an arrow you would find on a street sign, with a ridiculous story line. Ed Wood made heads compared to "Conquest". Each film student should see this thing just so they will know the very definition of a bad movie.
