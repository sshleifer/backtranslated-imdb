All naked bodies of Ursula Andress are one of the things that make you believe in God. Two other women (especially those who play the maid) have big bodies too. Then why is the highest grade that I can provide a quality film with the number of nude only 3 out of 10? Because to get to Ursula's incredible body, we have to sit in a movie that is otherwise unfunny and boring (keep in mind that I watch the full version 101 minutes, by 78 minutes to the one American who probably cut out a many of the material is invalid). In typical Italian-comedian tradition, most of the characters are exaggerated caricatures (the freak army, the "Latin lover", the constant drink, the naive maid) is not funny, simply overacted. Final word: look at this, but keep your finger on the fast forward-forward button, you will need it. (*)
