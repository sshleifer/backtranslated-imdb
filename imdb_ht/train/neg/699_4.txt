Probably one of the most briest movies ever, seriously acting badly written. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Play by Woody Roll, or it may be one of the five characters. <br /> <br /> Accepting that bad is not great either apart from Daphne Zungia who died too fast and should be the main heroine, and the rest quite well as well as Laura Lapinski's main heroine sometimes has charm read, and you feel sorry for it to the end. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />! As a girl gets herself running on a car, one girl gets boiling alive and another gets alive. <br /> OVERALL Not really a big slasher cow ld was a lot better
