Yikes, it was definitely one of those sleepless nights where I surfed the channels and was bumped into this stinker in a movie. For some of the names of the cast, I would expect a better movie. I'm almost embarrassed to see the Oscar Winner F. Murray Abraham was reduced to such a terrible part. I hope the money was worth it. And students, talking about fences as they talk about surviving in a war or in a terrible disaster. I mean, I've arranged, it's a fun sport, but I've never been intense. The only reason I'm watching this movie was all because the remote was dropped under the couch and I was too lazy to get it back.
