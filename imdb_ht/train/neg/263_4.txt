After a day of work, I sit beside them to relax and turn on the movie channels. The film came on the guide and remembered so interestingly that I tuned in just before it started. The first 30 minutes were enough to make me interested, but the lack of ability to act on Jamie Foxx and the plot movement made me want to get up and find food during the movie. If there is any credit that must be given to act in this movie he should go to David Morse who at least try to make the movie interesting. All of you, do not plan on impressing your friends by picking up this one as a tenant for a movie night.
