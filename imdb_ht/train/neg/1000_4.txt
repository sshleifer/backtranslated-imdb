The plot for descent, if it actually can be called a conspiracy, has two noteworthy events. A near the start - one at the end. Together these events make up perhaps 5% of the total movie time. All (and I mean _everything_) in between is basically the director's effort to fill in the minutes. I love disturbing movies, I like movie movies and I do not get troubled by fearless scenes - but if you expect me to sit in 60 minutes of scene / black (literally) scenes that do not have your storyline there is something else to come up. Rosario Dawson, one of my favorite actors is completely wasted here. And no, it does not get naked, not even in the NC-17 version, which I saw. <br /> <br /> If you have a couple of hours tossed and want to look "down", take a nap instead - you'll probably be more exciting dreams.
