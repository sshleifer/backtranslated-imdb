It seems obvious in this adaptation that he did not. Not only did he leave the plot behind, he made up his own! The things that he chose to leave in them, so ridiculous incredible that I was happy he chose to leave out some of the most important parts of the novel. The plot was neighbors, consistent and negligence to say the least. I do not mean anything-Dynamic about the actors, but they can not act! Dickens is tough, of course, but this is pathetic! Micawber was nothing more than a Kramer in the nineteenth century, and the less said on Betsy Trotwood the best! If you want to see the real Copperfield, look nice 1999 adaptation of BBC. As for the writer of scenario, I think he read the Cliff score!
