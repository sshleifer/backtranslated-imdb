This had to be one of those film films where the trailer is 50 times better than the movie itself. I first saw the trailer in 1991, he looked great. Since then I've always wanted to see it , but can never find it ... .. today, yes, 14 years later. <br /> <br /> allow just say I was so disappointed with it, OK I knew it would not be an Oscar winner but still hoped it would be a fun no brain movie in the bloody mold . Unfortunately it was not, it's Pooh <br /> what with the American rock and roll music and the act was so bad he was scared. <br /> <br /> The scene of fighting was garbage and look fake. <br /> <br /> This DVD only costs me £ 5 and I believe I was overloaded by £ 7 <br /> Now I'm sad as I know that I will never get this hour and a half back.
