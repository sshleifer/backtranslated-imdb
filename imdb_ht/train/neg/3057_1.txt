While the "Santa Claus Conquers Martians" is usually quoted as one of the worst movies ever made, the Mexican film that was born from 1959 is so bad it does "SCCM" look like "It's a Life beautiful. " You must ask what the people who made this movie thought; Maybe it was meant to be a third-world allegory of capitalist greed and obvious conspiracy. Nah. . . They just were not very good. The same production company made an even more disturbing version of "Little Red Riding Hood" in which the wolf's mania and our heroine have unbearable hints at pedophiles. (Perhaps this was inspiration for "highways".) Back to "Santa Claus": instead of the North Pole, Jolly Old Saint Nicholas lives in a satellite in geographical geography (shades of "MST3K"); instead of its game sprite made by children selected from around the world; and had specific sophisticated equipment to check just that the naughty and beautiful kids. The result is such an excellent Orwellian space sweat shop. It's enough to turn you off Christmas forever. These films and other less expensive Mexican children were armed in English and were widely distributed in the United States in the early 1960s; not surprising the sixties became such a turbulent period in the American history. Baby boomers are forced to hold these "family" films as kids would all too eager to turn revolutionary.
