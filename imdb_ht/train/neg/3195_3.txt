The front right qualifications: I actually think Joe Don Baker can be good or even big with the right material and the right director ("Fear Fear" noticed, a small part of "Goldeneye", "Tall Walk"). And I liked Baker in "Mitchell", because he plays an anti-hero who was supposed to be unlikeable. Yes, MST3K's protection was hilarious, but they took a lot of cheap shots at Baker - that it does not deserve - to keep things alive and fun - it was appropriate at the level and tone of the movie, and it was part the best of the movie. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />. And the main reason is that Baker's character, as written, is a fool. The film has this consideration because Baker defines the old style frontier march, challenging his opponent in old style mano-a-mano quick-drawn competition. And because it is so hard with macho, it always wins, even when it's hurt, hurt, over, etc. This is a consideration and a lot of potential (he worked for Gary Cooper), even though he condemned the film "B" movie. But Baker is so frightfully stupid and obsessed that he needs three challenges to the bad guy's bad guy in a confrontation in a public, market and civilian all over the place. He simply made the shadow of the bad guy's headquarters headquarters (which was why he followed them in the first place) and would never notice. Or he could have gotten the drop on them and forced them to surrender, and gotten one of the henchmen to take him to the headquarters of headquarters. But no, she's got a hot dog pig and a sling blocker, and so she gets a kid taken as a hostage in the shootout shootout! <br /> <br /> This is a guy we are supposed to admire? The whole movie is basically like this. Most of the supporting actors are somewhere between OK (henchmen) of the wonderful good (the evil guy and his father are two well-known European actors - they just go to the motions, but they are advantages and even hamming it up are decent). But through it all, Baker's character pulls funny, unproductive demonstrations and mistakes that find at least two innocent people killed, plus a couple of bad guys who might have been taken alive without the use of deadly force. On the positive side, since 90% of the film is placed on Malta or in the Mediterranean, you get to see many beautiful scenery and lots of beautiful and exotic looking extras. And really, Baker himself can be on the heavy side and slightly dyspeptic, but it is not wrong ... certainly not the ointment liners this crucial film (including Mike and the Bots in hilarious coverage) seems to think .. In short, this movie is good for video video, but the viewer should not pay any attention to it.
