The film is about Sir Christopher Strong (MP - Member of the Parliament - played by Colin Clive) and his artifacts with the Amelia Earhart character-like character played by Katherine Hepburn. Just until they met, he was a very devoted husband but when he met the odd but fascinating Hepburn, he "could not help himself" and fell in love. You can say, because they set in space a lot and talk ENDLESSLY about how painful unrequited love they are. Frankly, this is a very strong movie date and practically impossible to watch. Part of the problem is that in the Pre-Code days, glamourizing adult films are very common. Plus, even if you accept this topic morally suspicious, the pronouncement of the pronouncement of the dialogue makes it sound like a novel 19th century novel ... and a really bad at that. Sticky and hard to love characters (after all, Clive's wife is a lovely lady and there was no wrong) to make this one a great deal of time. Regarding the only interesting aspect of this movie, Hepburn's costume is worn in an early stage where she is dressed in a glass suit! You had to see it to believe it - and it looks like one of the Bugaloos (a dark but tight reference).
