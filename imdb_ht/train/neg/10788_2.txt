And I mean ultra light. This movie features four giant stars, about three and a half jokes and nothing beyond that. <br /> <br /> There really is not too much to say about this stinker, other than that although it has a couple of really good bits, most of it is not very funny. Nor does it work at all as a romance. How about as a romantic comedy? Not about your life. Most of the dialogue is way too flat to be sophisticated, much less fun. <br /> <br /> What's really ashame is the quote is not bad at all. This film could be so much more, especially with all the recent focus on some of the bogus ways in which films are encouraged, filled with art critics from critics. The movie discovers the un-mined territory of junket in press - these are all paid expenses for journalists who are almost always writing nice comments. But instead of exploring what should be a mother of jokes, she devotes all about three minutes to this territory and moves on in pursuit of Romanesque romance. Even with Catherine Zeta-Jones' character - the whinny, self-star movie center. Zeta-Jones did a good job with what he gave, but he gave virtually nothing. It's all homogeneous junk that looks very much pale in comparison with some of the things we've heard about stars over the years. <br /> <br /> In the end, it's hard to understand what made Zeta-Jones, Julia Roberts, John Cusack and Billy Crystal signs aboard this ship ending, which sinks as a relay of the "love boat. " In fact, as the old joke goes, they should forget the script and filmed the deal. It would probably make a better story. So go ahead and tell us, filmmaker, what do you have on the stars that got them appear in this?
