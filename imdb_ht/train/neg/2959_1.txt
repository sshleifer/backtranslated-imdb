No matter what anyone tells you, there is only a fact in the word "possession" of movie circles - like "who owns you in this movie green?" Religion has nothing to do with it, but common sense does. That is, if your head is clear and you are in the right mind to make a trial. At many levels I tried to streamline where this movie could entertain .... or even the average consumer interest. The Star? The story? The unique idea? A buddy movie that kids would like with a dinosaur and a black woman? On my goodness! I'm sure then that was an "idea", it sounded good. But somewhere during development courses ... someone should have known where the idea could not translate into a piece of any entertainment would want to look or pay for ... unless they were deeply influenced by influence of alcohol or drugs and to see something the rest of us could not see. <br /> <br /> Regardless, this is a complete mess. Mass, chaos - sin and a mess. <br /> <br /> Who cares about the draw (draw?) and al. Who got a check, but I would be embarrassed to take it. I'm sure he has shot his agent / manager / publicist about moving this career. Obviously, he went on doing more bad movies. And more bad movies. Tris.
