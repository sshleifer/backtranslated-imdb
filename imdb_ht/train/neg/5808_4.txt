Returning to Alec Baldwin and Kim Basinger was a mercurial, warm-tempered, high-ranking Hollywood couple filmed this (almost) scene-to-scene remake of the 1972 Steve McQueen-Ali MacGraw action-thriller on a Twosome save. He almost worked the first time because McQueen was like a vital presence on the screen - even silent and weary stones, you could sense his clock ticking, his cagey magnetism. Baldwin is not in Steve McQueen's league, but has his charm and is probably a more versatile actor - if so, this is not a showcase for his attributes. Basinger does well and certainly looks good, but James Woods is artificially collective in a comic movie-magnet. A sub-draw involving another couple hostage by former Baldwin partner was unbearable in the movie '72 and plays even worse here. As for the action scenes, they are very old hat, causing one of wonder: why even notice the original? ** from ****
