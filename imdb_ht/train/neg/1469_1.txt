As she watches a neighboring summer home theater, "Indian Summer" is a curse that spells out. The eight alumni comrades barely present, when invisibly borrowed to start boring for the characters we do not know anything about. Fine actors, Alan Arkin, and Bill Paxton are totally wasted in this film. A campaign observation that "everything seems to be much smaller than I remember it" repeats at least ten times, enough to make you bitter. The anticipated pranks are neither comical nor original, unless you think that short leaf is a real "crying". This film was a great disappointment to consider the talented enough to involve. "The American Summer" did not make my homesick, just sick. - MERK
