After reading several good reviews as well as hearing about it by word of mouth I decided to rent Come Undone. I must say I was rather disappointed. The story was hard to follow because the movie is set as a backlash between the present and the recent ones that are very poorly executed. Characters, despite the best actors' efforts are flat and refreshing. The sex is with the most explicit nudity than they need. I never saw a movie where they seemed so unnecessary in the scheme. The ultimate anti-climatic ending and leaving many unanswered questions to a story line that did not explain well to begin with. In my opinion, a waste of time.
