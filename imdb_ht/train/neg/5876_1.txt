I compared two versions of Hamlet for my Shakespeare class and unfortunately I chose this version. Everything from the acting (the actors deliver most of the lines directly to the camera) in the camera shots (all means or close up shots ... there are no shots of scenery and so many small backs of the shots) was absolutely terrible. I watched this on my spring break and it's pretty safe to say that I feel that I've gypped out of my 114-minute vacation. Not recommended by any stretch of the imagination.
