And I thought the Beach was bad, and the difference that this film has one of the greatest actors of our time, Nicolas Cage. Do not blame it for the terrible script, if anyone can make any sense of what the hell was point in that movie, give yourself a pat on the back. It's a cross between the Village and a crappier script. It starts on how to catch your eyes, and then as it goes further into the plot, it just makes no sense, and does not get me started on the finish !!!! What was that? The only thing that makes this film exist is Nicolas Cage normal humor, and his ability to be funny in the strange situations. If you go to a blockbuster and this is the only movie to watch, save yourself five bucks and just go home and turn some things on fire and when some people ask you why, just say the stupid stuff that comes in mind, and there you go!
