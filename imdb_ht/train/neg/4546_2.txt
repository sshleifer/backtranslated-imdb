I just saw this movie and did not read the book. The good thing about the movie is that in some parts it gets you think for a while on the subject of spiritual, evolution, sincronicity and your part of the world. <br /> However, the movie immersion easily breaks and has very little rapidity between the viewer and the characters. It is very clear that the book looses lots of this movie version. The events that were supposed to show sincronicity taking place are almost inexplicable. A lot of reasons to do for the viewer to see that the scene indicates a coincidence, and even more imagine that it has something to do with a bigger goal. <br /> <br /> The Enlightenment Scenes are visually impoverished and do not create the best feeling that it was supposed to do. Do you remember the Enlightenment and Keanu Reeves (in Little Buddha)? Well, this is nothing like that. <br /> <br /> Most scenes are wrong executed. There are so many scenes that really do not develop the story and also do not help in creating an atmosphere. The best actors in this film, Hector Elizondo, Joaquim de Almeida and Jürgen Prochnow can not save her. The first 2 seems to have gotten more scene than the characters should be in an attempt to save the movie, and because they pay more, but that does not work. Most of the scenes are not really needed and do not help the story at all. <br /> <br /> Jürgen does good at her scene and sells as an evil guy (as always), but the script does not help him at all. The scene where he first tried to persuade John (Matthew to stay) to join him is just bad script. The execution of the scene when he died of an explosion is absurd evil bad executed. The flashbacks in the movie can not even comment. In general, this movie is a big kid in time, read the book! I have not read it, but it is probably once a billion dollars better than this, it has to be. <br /> It's so bad that I had my first comment on IMDb.
