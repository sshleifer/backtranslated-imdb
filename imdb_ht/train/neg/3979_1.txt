OK, this was 2 to be one of the worst 4 worries of a movie that I've ever had to watch. Like all other twin movies and possible exceptions for New York's minutes, this film had no history, plotting holes, disgusting kicks and bad same same sounds !!!!!!!!! in case you have not guessed yet i hate hate mary kate and ashley !!!!!! The only reason I watched this was because I was really bored and nothing else was over. I wonder if the twins will ever stop making the same stereotyped movies where they have an unbelievably stupid adventure in an exotic place and save the day while getting the help of two cute guys who drool on them immediately. The youngest they might have been a guy 4 1 in them or they have both fallen 4 guys. The plot of this story was so imbiby and just plain mute. even a small child can see the flaws in it.Maybe they should divide and start making films individually or maybe film and a different kind of story. Anyone who liked this movie had no offense-either really stupid, really artificial or did not see any movie really good. or perhaps they are really smart and just have bad movies. either way I would not recommend this movie to my worst enemy for a good movie experience .. The only thing it is good 4 is some rub dividing laughs in the pathetic attempts to be cool. if you look for it's hilarious laugh. Basically I give it 0 or less.
