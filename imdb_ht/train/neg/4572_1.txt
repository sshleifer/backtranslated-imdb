This film often extras mechanical proportions to justify nonsense ideas, covered by such statements as "we all create our own reality". <br /> <br /> Sorry, as, reality is true for all of us, not just the cretula. <br /> <br /> The idea that "anything possible" does not keep water on the test closer: if possible, contrary things are possible and thus nothing is possible. This leads to postmodernist nonsense, which is nothing less than an attempt to degrade truths so that all ideas, well-founded and stupid, are equal. <br /> For quote Sci-Fi writer Philip K. Dick Who puts it well, "Reality is that, when you stop believing in it, do not go."
