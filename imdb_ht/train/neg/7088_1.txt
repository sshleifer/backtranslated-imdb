I was subjected to this atrocity by my wife, trying to turn it in after 10 minutes, but was forced into the whole thing. This must, but down, the most frustrating fury of a movie ever ... <br /> <br /> There were great script moments, such as: Sammy - "If it gets over right here, it gets a bonus "Madam -" A good one? "Sammy -" No, a bonus "<br /> <br /> For summary: terrible script, terrible acting and incredibly logic.
