Hines and Goforth, the perpetrators of these crimes, start on the footsteps of the first step, not accepting that Wells wrote Gothic horror and that all in his line meant to be taken seriously. That's simply not true. Wells was a lot of legacy in the Enlightenment, and his main concern was that self-satisfaction Victorian could leave the British preparing for the world the new technology can produce - both the good and the bad. Horrific consequences - the protagonist is described as a wimpy screamer (I was reminded of Fay Wray in the original King Kong), rather than a person struggling to live out the ironies in an incredible catastrophe; and dialogue ranges of 'Victorianisms' expressions seriously that Welles clearly meant to be the language of a blow. <br /> All this looks suspiciously like Ed Wood and an enormous budget garbage on CGI effects - which by way of so badly accomplished, the design workshop Warner Bros. in the 1940s could do a better job. (Guts in blood raze look like red bolts, I hope to drift away any minute.) Think the yellow submarine is done by the old EC comic. <br /> <br /> Worse still the loss of terms, which relegates the movie to any reason. Although the musicians of this film return the story of its Victorian era, they completely miss the miserable story of Wells' story predicted many of the horrors of the First World War - a fact not unnoticed by Wells himself, who, After the war, replay the theme in the form of things to come. <br /> <br /> Without any theme, all we have here is a lot of people running around getting the balloon dried in the air, when they're not trying out for a high school production at regretted a drunken student in Macbeth. <br /> <br /> Really, this is the worst, most stupid piece of drivel I've suffered since a friend told me to see Eastern European cartoon "Fantastic Planet" thirty years ago . This movie was so pretentiously dull, my friend and I and two aliens gave her ridiculousness on halfway through, she sat near the playing card screen, using the movie as light by which to see the cards - Its only utility, as far as any of us could say. <br /> But I already have electric lighting in my apartment, so I did not need this set-down in Wells for anything. <br /> Do not avoid this movie - steal every copy you can (do not pay a cents) and burn each and every one of them. God of wisdom He created us just for this purpose.
