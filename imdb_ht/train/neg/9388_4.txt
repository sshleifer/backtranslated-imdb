Former safety protector that protects the safety of the eye is a job that is likely to return to his or her previous profession. His placement: that a mysterious French woman recently arrived in California ... and apparently wanted no cost-and-tie racketeers. Successful attempts to update genre of genre film, without enough keenness or understanding (or including plot dynamics) in the scenario. Director and co-surgeon Paul Magwood (who later claimed the photo had been modified without its involvement) did not give the impression of having great consideration for the Chandler's 40s films made out; Her nostalgia is suitable rumpled, but also bitter-tinged and somewhat indifferent. The touch is curiosity, low-praise, and Warren Oates is well driven as this' 70s variant on the 'dick' private archetype, but the movie has no snap. Nice to see Leslie Caron and Gloria Grahame in the cast - though neither do so much, and the warm-and-cold caron Caron's character is exasperating at all. Cinema delivery by Alan Stensvold, nice place to shoot, but it fails to come to any kind of a boil. * 1/2 from ****
