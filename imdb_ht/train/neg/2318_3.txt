Kid was found as a baby in the trash and raised in a martial arts academy to have a talent for basket down. With the help of the man who found him he came to college and is riding in the championship as he searched for his real parents. Infinitely better in comedy action pieces is a real mess as a whole. It seems to be striving for a hip basketball version of Shaolin Soccer, but the comedy is injection spread, its focus wanders more than one Chihuahua and ADD about quadruple expressions. I continued to ask, "What I'm watching". I look at it beginning to finish and I still do not know what the hell has happened. It's a shame since some big action scenes, some funny jokes and occasional moments, but nothing, none of it ever comes together, I would take a pass.
