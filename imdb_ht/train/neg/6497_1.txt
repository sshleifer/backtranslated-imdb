I actually hoped very high to go to this movie, so I took what was given with a single tablet and hoping for the best. About 1/3 of the way in the movie I simply gave up, quite simply the movie is a mish-mash of things happening for any apparent purpose and it's all disconnected. I love movies that make you think, but this movie was just a bunch of ideas to throw away and never really connected. <br /> Do not think it's David Lynch-enrolling as some would have you believe, it's nowhere near other domain than some trippy visuals. He says it's artsy disguising the fact there is no apparent plot or story is just one way or justifying why you waste the 1.5 hours of the movie. The act was good, but this can not save the lack of history. I agree with the comment one already posted ... "It's like being in the head of some of the people ... while they're on drugs," in other words there is nothing to make sense.
