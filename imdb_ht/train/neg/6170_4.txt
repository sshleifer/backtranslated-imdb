This movie starts out very slowly, but when the action finally begins, it's a little to follow. I could not understand why some of the events took place, and a lot of events happened before they explained, making them sort of confusing. The only thing she really went for is the massive amount of blood / gore it has, although most times the special effects are missing. Without seeming Kool-aid. Skin tear sounds like someone is leaving on a pile of sticks. Again, the story has a sort of amateur feel, as the writer did not take a long time to perfect it. I feel like it might be a better movie if the effects are made better and more time taken on the script. I honestly wished I did not watch it, not because of the gor, but because I feel that I wasted 90 minutes in my life. If you love very gory movies, this is for you, if not, stay away.
