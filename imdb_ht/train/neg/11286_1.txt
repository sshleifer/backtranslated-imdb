Where do you start with such a bad movie like this? <br /> <br /> Do you mention the unbelievable hero throw? Acting on-the-top? The dreadful script? <br /> <br /> No You just say that anyone who pays money to see a movie as poor as this needs to look at. I know I do. I respect those poor guys who have seen it with little or no words in advance from mags like Empire (usually a bad sign if a preview copy is not available in the film type mag). However, movies really should start thinking about repayment if the customer is not happy with the finished product. <br /> I went to three days after she opened with two other companions. Only others in the movie were one block on his own. <br /> And that was about cheap night. Either the announcement campaign has failed disguises or words have spread to most of the country in just what a stinker this is. <br /> Not since the days of the Avengers (1998) I felt I had changed so short since watching a movie. If a spouse comes up with this video in a few months, make sure she pays your electricity bill while watching her. Tara Fitzgerald deserves a premium for not split up - or walks in the series; Keith Allen retains some dignity among the cinemas carnage; Barry Foster should have been arrested on the performance range, Rhys Hardy has done his career not favored after the success of Notting Hill and only Dani Behr is half chic as a busty secretary. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Mind your mind, considering being used to be in the Word, expecting any viewers of ability to act it has to be very low to start with. <br /> <br /> The output values ​​are not bad to consider the budget obviously limited but this script is atrophy. If you want to hear a bunch of unlikeable characters say "Fak!" For a couple of hours then this would be right up your street. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, bargepoles are required. <br /> <br />
