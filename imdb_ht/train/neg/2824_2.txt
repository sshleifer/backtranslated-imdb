I'm a big fan club, and the car was the best star in this movie. <br /> <br /> Ha√Øm, now drying up drug addicting childhood stars in the 80 is bland as per usual, and commenting on back up from minor characters / actors would be pointless; Needless to say, they were all very average. It's a cool film as a journey down the memory line in the 80's - with some strange clothes, some good shots in the Colorado series and a very harmless albeit minded conscious mind. <br /> <br /> All in all, your waste time will look this unless you like movies 80, Corey Haim, or like myself, like the old school Porsches (this particular looks great) because life is too short to watch crazy movies.
