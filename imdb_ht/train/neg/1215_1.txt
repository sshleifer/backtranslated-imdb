I do not often give one star review, but the computer will not let me do negative numbers. The openings themselves tell us we are in deep water already. Although this is a movie film film, there are 17 producers credited. No No <br /> <br /> At the beginning of the abusive story Kenneth comes home to his family in a gated community extended. The house is a pigsty. His wife, Della (Kim Basinger) left the children running all day long. <br /> OK. We are already in deep water. Ms. Basinger was 55 years old when the film came out. And is his child or grandson? It's Christmas Eve. Della drives in the mall, a long scene that could be cut. For the bludgeon home idea of ​​eteeeevil male rampant aggression in the universe he drives past football players into full uniform play of pouring rain on Christmas Eve. Make sure. For a bonus he sees a vehicle with a deer kills and ties it. <br /> We get some current suspension of the drive scenes, though. It's raining and traffic is bad. First we see Della trying to drive and smoke at the same time. Then Della tries to drive and talk on her cell phone at the same time, at a turning point completely around to check the locked seat back into the charger for the phone. <br /> It wanders the mall, seeing an old friend from college, trying to buy things, but his credit card was denied-gosh, maybe her husband is grumpy because it will break, but that's too complicated for the script to follow. He runs most of the most comical gang of the story of films. A white boy (Lukas Hass watched his career down the bathroom), one Black, one Asian, and a Spanish. Imagine a company that got up and people go to the bad and you'll have the idea. Although they have a weapon he gives them attitudes. A cop shopping center comes to investigate the ruckus and shoot it to the top, firing more than once. Many parking lots like people can, people everywhere, and have no notice. <br /> <br /> Della saved in his car and instead choose a police station or well-lit zone safely, it drives to a construction site, where he kills all four males one at a time and simply tools they (literally) at hand. <br /> <br /> It's the worst house. The skin of the skin goes out in the rain. Check out the kids, go down, and when her husband petulantly asks what he got into the mall to show him the gun and shoots him in the row of empty points. <br /> <br /> Experience with Punk cards was supposed to result in personal autonomy for Della. Instead, we know that her children will probably spend Christmas in Foster care or a group house, because the State will collect them while answering to killing one charge. The four points can be classified as homicide justifiable in self defense. Mary, different stories. <br /> I'm so happy I've seen this on cable. If I would see it in a theater (did he get any release?) I would have been angry. As is, I'm just sad seeing talent like Ms. Basinger and Mr. Haas wasting themselves on garbage like this. <br /> One very good thing, though. This was written and directed by Susan Montford. Ms. Montford has not gotten another record or credit since she passed this. There is justice in the world.
