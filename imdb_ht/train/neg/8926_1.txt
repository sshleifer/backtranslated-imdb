I saw "Myra Breckinridge" when she first came from 1970. I was a 20-year-old health at the time, who liked movies and really liked Raquel Welsh. On top of that, I read the novel Gore Vidal it was based on and thought it was very funny. I saw the movie in a local drive and on the half way I was sorely tempted to turn the engine into my car so maybe I would die of poisoning poisoning and do not have to see the rest of this ship into a movie. It was not "smart" or "trendy", it was gross and sloppy. All actors were tone deaf and the director did not have the slightest idea what he did. The casting of Mae West was one of the worst choices casting in film history. As a review here said, her role had nothing to do with the movie or book. Her character in the sexual book is beaten up by the young stud, who would never do for Ms. West's legend. Oh no, the scheme changed to sexually beat him up, very credible from a 77-year-old woman who looks every day at her age. I could go on, but why? It was a terrible movie. <br /> <br /> Bluto
