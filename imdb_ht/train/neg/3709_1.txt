First, I would like to say that I'm a fan of Chris Rock. I love her other films, but this film is just like my resume. The biggest crap bag ever. At the beginning, Chris Rock plays an aspiring comedy that finds great fear in a building called the Apollo. On his way home from a gig, while riding his BIKE he sees this woman he loves and hits by a truck. Shortly afterwards, she chose the body of an old, white, and selfish millionaire. Then she dressed as the music band Outkast while trying to replay the scene from the original where she came out as a jockey. Secondly, she goes back to the Apollo, and tries to try the comedian to be in his body before beginning to disseminate the white population and trying to be black. Do you get my drift? This movie is terrible it tries too hard to be as original and in the process out looking like a bag of crap. Just take my advice, do not even watch this movie.
