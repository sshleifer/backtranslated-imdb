I must not waste time writing much more about how every aspect of this film is indescribably bad. This has been done in great detail, many times. The 'plot' started out as a very uninspiring wide-boy / Gangster-by-number rooster and very quickly descended into a stairwell staircase. Anyone who pretends to be able to see some hidden heads inside this horrible mess is just kidding themselves. It is now 7 or 8 years since I watched it for 1 week and ran in the movie before he pulled, yet he stuck in my head for being the most awesome movie I've ever seen. I only make these comments, and indeed the only reason I went to see the movie is because of the entertaining fact that my brother Eddie appears in her as the second 'heavy' of the pub scene. It was his hand that prompted an zipy alumni toward Rhys Ifan's face at the bar of 'Russia' (he was actually filmed at the former Butlins holiday camp at Barry Island). The brother has absolutely no experience of anything - he has recently put together a spending agency 'and this was his first part. When you saw the movie, it appeared that nobody in it asked for any acting experience too. <br /> I remember there were about 8 people in the whole movie - and this was just a couple of days after it was released. I never heard of another film that was so popular and disappeared so fast - and rightly so. In case you thought of renting this movie on DVD, I would advise you instead to put coins from your book in a fire until they are red-hot, then jam them in your eye support. This will probably be a lot less painful than watching the movie.
