I've seen a lot of movies and rarely I'd ever miss a movie "1", but this movie was beyond terrible. <br /> <br /> The act was terrible, the plot was ridiculous, the effects were unrealistic and the characters were annoying. Usually when I watch scary movies I think it's DUMB when the characters hear a noise in home / forest / school / etc and then call out "hello is anyone there?" - but at least they're credible when doing it .. This movie could not even get that right. <br /> <br /> This is a movie that will make other B-terror movies like Venom and the Fog look like award winning academies. <br /> I always have an open mind while watching movies and I can only say that this film was a complete waste of time and I wrote this comment so that anyone else in the mind watching this movie are thinking again. IT'S AWFUL!
