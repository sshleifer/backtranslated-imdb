I literally dropped to sleep 3 times watching this movie. Granted, it's Shakespeare and that takes a certain attitude to be interested or not. But this film exceeds any barriers to long and non-soliloquies that can prevent many from just taking care of a Shakespeare-based story. <br /> <br /> The biggest roadblock in this production is the complete flatness of the characters. Often while interacting the character, it's almost difficult to distinguish from the lines in. Granted, I believe that this film is armed in English. Certainly they could get voice actors who could have added a bit more drama to the classical, literary lines. <br /> It would be difficult to evaluate this movie bigger than 1, although perhaps this is based on prejudice at least age and what would look like a very low budget. Still, it's absolutely painful and boring. If you insist on Hamlet, make yourself a favor and read the book again. 1/10
