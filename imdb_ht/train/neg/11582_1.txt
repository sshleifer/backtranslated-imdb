I'm glad to see most others here do not think so much of this movie, either. It has some great names in the cast, but that's it. There is nothing else to recommend, save ogling a few beautiful women that you can do in a thousand films. <br /> <br /> The story involves anything but incredible, self-centered, chain-smoking, "hip" characters that criticize national film all seem to love .... and most of the public can not stand. <br /> <br /> The accents Oklahoma are so fake are ridiculous, the South racist stereotypes are right from Liberal Hollywood 101 and the story is depressing.
