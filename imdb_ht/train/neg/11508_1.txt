Whatever owned Guy Ritchie noticed Wertmuller's film is incomprehensible. This new movie is a mess. There was another person in the audience when I saw her, and she left for an hour in her. (I hope he has requested a refund.) The only reason I was to stay up was because I never walked out of a movie. But I sat in this piece of flabbergasted junk that Madonna and Ritchie might actually think of being a good movie. The dialogue is ridiculous, the act is atrocious and the only beautiful thing in this film is the landscape. Ritchie took Lina's film and returned to another "Blue Lagoon." <br /> This is a movie that you would not even waste late night late on Cinemax. Time is too precious to be wasted on crap like this.
