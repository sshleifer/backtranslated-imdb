This film is not as horrible as most sci-fi movies. I used to view gray CGI blobs and their special amateur effects like closed-blooded fake closets that make it very obvious that the blood is strawberry syrup or some variations of other syrups. However, I thought I had seen all possible that the Sci-Fi Channel could hit. Then I saw this movie. <br /> Imagine a hand inside a sock with wax and syrup? Those are the main aliens vampires in this movie. You can clearly see the fingers inside the tire socks singer. A hand that speaks out of the bravery of the victims, and the Vampire who is in the Vampire Hunter team can talk to these Sock couples in Transylvanian. How do foreign vampires learn Transylvanian? And not Transylvania in Romania? So should not they speak Romanian? Why would some small town have their own language? If you can stop gossip reflexes and get past the rubber socks to talk with the fingers clearly moving inside the heads of the aliens; Then you have to deal with other alien vampires. There are the "Leatherfaces" who like to put their faces in the victims. Then there are just plain ugly ones that all seem to have a lot of facial features. Then there are the annoying girls and the boyfriends who are deceiving people and sneaking into space colonies that they can sabotage their defense systems so that Space Vampires can be attacked. <br /> <br /> Finally, if you think all the above is funny and worth a laugh, you have to deal with the third rate cast in rejected TV networks that make up this team of hero stereotyping heroes who are still fighting among themselves. Why almost every sci-fi movie channel has to use lead characters that are annoying, abrasive, bit, or just totally sympathetic? I found myself expecting the tires that will speak tires.
