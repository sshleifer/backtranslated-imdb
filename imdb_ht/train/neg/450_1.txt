This show is painful to watch ... <br /> <br /> It is obvious that the creators had no sign of what to do with this show, from ever-changing "work, boyfriends, and throw. It looks like they wanted to throw Amanda Bynes into something ... but there was no idea what, and came up with this crazy show. He was cast as a teenager, surrounded by twenty and thirty somethings, and placed it in mostly growns in repeatedly failing attempts at comedy. Soon, they realize that he needs a "clique" and throw people in their late 20s to try as a teenager. How to show this 4-year survival is beyond me. Somehow, ABC now decides that it is a "family" show, and cast it to his afternoon programming on ABC Family.
