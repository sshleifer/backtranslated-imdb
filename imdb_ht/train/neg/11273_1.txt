How can you pick up this respectable cast of young British actors and come up with these piles of a manure manure? Terrible script, camera annoyingly agitated, awfully edited, gruesomely seriously acted. Only Rhys Urgently trying to fulfill his role and life. Another painful idea that "different" sometimes equals "drak". Why did people fail to read the scripts in advance? Make yourself a favor: spare yourself and do something else - like hitting a mallet on your knees. It's less painful and more fun than this movie!
