This movie does not even deserve one. This was a waste of time writing. It was a waste of film and money. It was not offensive but everything was provocative and disgusting. My spoof is one that I think should be not everyone. There are full nudity ahead with lousy language. But not only that, no line scheme, the actors are terrible, the horrible accents, the actors are little time and I was the same expedition to watch this movie! <br /> <br /> The only reason I rented was for Brian van Holt (who got only a fifteen second party, by the way). I think this could be a mistake on the directors and editor editions but repeating the same segments two or three times, adding only a new phrase. A film similar to this is Eraser Head, perhaps the most disturbing film of existence. There is no drawn line, and it's not funny. Although it is not trying to be funny. DO NOT WATCH I DO.
