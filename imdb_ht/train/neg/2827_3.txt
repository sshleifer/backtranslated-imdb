The history of the beginning is interesting: the slavery (end) of the 20th century from western Africa and the Middle East. The problem with it is that it intentionally castigates Richard Fleisher's favorite enemies: Arabic and German. To believe that the highly Arab-looking people would be free to roam around and easily catch Black in West Africa is as credible as Whites hunting for slaves of "Roots". Obviously both trades are being run by locals and involves (d) more sophisticated networks. While Arab countries are complicit in today's slave trade and sex, Israel is one of the worst violators according to Amnesty International. So why only point out Arab and then choose a German as the only European buyer? It is obviously bias and hate those people by a Jewish director. The act is higher than average, especially by Peter Ustinov (Suleiman) and Kabir Bedi (Malik). Michael Caine (Dr. Linderby) is still good.
