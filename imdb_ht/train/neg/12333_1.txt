Un-bleeping-credible! Meg Ryan does not even look at his usual habitable self in that, which normally makes me forgive his ticket schtick. Hard to believe he was the producer on this dog. Plus Kevin Kline: What kind of suicide trip has its career? Whoosh ... Banzai !!! Finally this led by the guy who made Big Chill? Must be a replay of Jonestown - Hollywood style. Wooofff!
