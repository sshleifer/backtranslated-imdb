Arg. The muddle dinosaurs are back to take another bite out of our sanity in this all-terrible third movie. This time, the European terrorist (Irish I'd say) hi-jack a host of convoys supposed to transport uranium. They pulled into a shipyard, opened the truck and discovered our old friends carnosaurs. Pandemonium comes to visit then when the dinosaurs tire the terrorists, cops and some navy. The whole movie seems to be (yet) largely inspired by strangers (like Carnosaur 2) and the pathetic navy goes through the "SHORTY" claustrophobia? gun to the ready. This third opus is probably the sister and ungoriest movie of the many, and only one blood donation when a tiny dino's tires are torn apart. Dinos are stiff, animal muddle as usual and the T-Rex sounds like an elephant that has waves when it roars (it also appears to be no eye). One of the goofiest scenes in the movie is when the comrades arrive to the scene: they enter the building where the aircraft truck holds and hears some strange noise from another truck. On her opening, surprise! The Reptile Grip Gang bursts and devours them. Why did the dinos are locked in the second truck after they escaped from the first? How was the lock locked as the door door can only be locked out of the outside? What was the point of filming this stage ???? Oh bother, who cares? Both thumbs down for Iguanas tires are more than sized.
