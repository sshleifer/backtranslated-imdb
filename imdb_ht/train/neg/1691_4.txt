This film is really nothing besides a strangely beautiful set of sequential tension sequences and an inevitable "gotcha!" at the end of each. Really, there is no character development and no real plot speaks of. There are only the most skeletons of motivation for the characters to do anything while they are trudging forward to the inevitable dooms. It's all just an excuse to show a creepy ghost kid (which seems to have gotten some of the family cats mixed up in his ectoplasm) and his ghost mom (with long black hair hanging in his face type like "ring the ") takes down a whole set of off-out boxes, two-dimensional excuses for human characters. <br /> This English-language version of the "Grudge" is the equivalent of cinema junk food; Meet the moment, but not really what you have to stay on. <br /> <br /> Do not recommend.
