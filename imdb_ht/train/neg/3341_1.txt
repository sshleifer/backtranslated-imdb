I just rented this movie to see Dolph Lundgren, whom I have not seen in any movie since Rocky IV. Unfortunately this movie was a big disappointment. The acting of all parties was bad except for Mr. Lundgren, who was okay. Kata Dob√≥ was a nice looking look in spite of his ridiculous outfit and make-up. The plot is not at all smart, it's something that has repeatedly been millions of times in different movies. The crooks were stereotyped, and the character Lundgren did not have any depth of it. I did not really expect a movie master, but unfortunately this is not even decent action. Each turn of the plot is very predictable and the incredible amount of reality-top-tops and comic-books like characters began to annoy me very soon. <br /> I would recommend this young girl to want some funny-like action, but only if nothing else is available. <br /> <br /> 1/10. (I guess the average average vote of 7.0 and 6 votes were influenced by someone involved in doing this movie)
