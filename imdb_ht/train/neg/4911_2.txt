First To Die 2003 <br /> I'll admit my mistake first: I did not realize this was a made for TV movie. I was "thrown" to the "R" certification. The draw is strong, but the movie is about 40 minutes too long. Direction and continuity were excellent. For the most part the cast was exceptional and did a great job with the characters. The side down to the film is that it definitely falls into the genre of "chick flick". Although there are some violent scenes, none of the violence should be called for a "R" rating. There is no stripping or free sex scene. Actually, no sex scenes. Ona Grayer (which is absolutely beautiful), Kristina Copeland, Sonya Salomaa, and Glynis Davies were all invited to the SG-1 series, but this movie has not done anything for their careers since they all served as low levels of supporting actresses . Robert Patrick was fantastic, as it usually is with Mitch Pileggi made me think of a modern day Lee Marvin. Megan Gallagher's talented talent that I became respected as an actor during the Millennium series, was given nothing difficult to show her range of abilities. The greatest decision with regard to the cast was Tracy Pollan. Aside from being a lower average actress and not particularly attractive, his voice is absolutely annoying. I found myself denying the TV during his dialogue. I would recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys TV type ever TV. I would not recommend paying any money to view this movie however. Considering I did not find anything that would cause censorship, this is a worthy movie for only watching TV, since nothing will be cut out. As a television movie I would miss this as a 5th August 10th. As a feature film with an "R" certification and like strong cast, I missed it as a 2 out of ten.
