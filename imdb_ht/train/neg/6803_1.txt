When I came to IMDb board, I always fed up when I saw a "bad movie ever" post.After watching this movie * *, I think I'll soon be creating my own post !! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < That glass T is a cool crap, even a beautiful actor (sometimes I insist, "sometimes") but Steven Seagal's like his policeman playing is ... beyond the words. All the rest cast ... well I do not know where these actors were hired but jeez !! I bet my dog ​​would be a better actor than they !! The draw: Hijacking.Original is not it ?? The action sections: The first shot in the movie is an explosion. I told myself, well, cool !! At least there will be some beautiful pyrotechnics .. .I died badly. The rest of the film is mostly filled with stocks to rent stocks taken in the air force. <br /> <br /> The hilarious dialogues, the music is crap The end is happy (I mean I was happy at the end because the movie was over) <br /> <br /> My cousin who watched the movie was happy (i 22, it is 42 .. well) was on the way to taking the movie and burning it.Maybe next time I'll watch it ... (who said never ???)
