... this verson does not blame Bard seriously. It is still a terrible minimalist production, the Dutch Dutch Hamlet inexplicably armed by a Spanish (whether it's Ricardo Montalban or not subject to debate), and Maximilian Schell overacts like never before. Most of the dialogue makes it unscathed, and the fact that the MST3K version feels obligated to point out repeatedly that the long talk * duh * does not hit me as incredibly funny. Especially it's just bad acting, though.
