I'm a big fan of Randolph Scott, but this movie is a dude. The whole thing has a canned, fake, sounds feel, and really awesome rear-screen projection. He had a good idea idea that the senarist had successfully buried him in a sneaky script, making it impossible for the audience to be immersed in the action and really caring about any of the characters. The principal is pedestrian, and only accentuates how bad the script is instead of helping to improve it. I've seen many of the enjoyable "sonstage production" quite well before, but this is not one of them. All he does is make you appreciate Scott / Boetticher's movies more and more. Randolph Scott is cracked, trim, and shining that million smiles at all. It's still a pleasure ... even at worst of its films. In addition Scott, the other main reason I wanted to see this movie was due to how much I enjoyed Ms. Wymore in Errol Flynn's film, "Rocky Mountian". The "People Behind the Gun", it's just as nice, and you can say it's a good actress, but was forced to tell some very dumb lines, and the blockage he gave to the director was really terrible. I've only seen Phil Carey in "Pacific Surgery," and she plays the exact same character here ... a pain-in-butt arguing you want to beat in unconsciousness. I guess it proves that he's a good actor ... he's made me hate her. Some tendencies of humorous relief that only divert the film, in my opinion. Although there are many striking elements, I must say that I find myself really enjoying the singing songs singing in the music numbers ... but that's not why we're going to see Randolph Scott's movies, right? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />!
