An awesome book about a fox and his family that does fox do. being stolen from farms and killing animals. until a third of the farmers decided to have had enough of this fox and try in various ways to have the problem "settle". They are of course "out foxed" at every turn and while the trio is camping in the family fox's hole to make attacks against three farmers. <br /> <br /> The "movie" version, and I use very film themes, is more of a terrible god of American movie heist movies especially movies. They even have George Clooney as Mr Fox for adding to the insult and managed to miss the point of the story quite well. So the kudos .They will make a lot of money and destroy another classic book Roald Dahl kids.
