This film was back-to-back and re-made in 1992 by the famous Conan Doyle 'World lost'. And it shows. The movie begins to be adequate enough, with a merciless organization exploiting the lost world and Challenger and returning to defend the prehistoric tray, but then things go down. Everyone is trapped on the tray and we are left with a blemish, boring, rehash in the first movie. The dinosaurs (who they never saw) are just mockable. Are we hoping to take this cuddly game to assume a ankylosaur badly? And the tyrannosaur looks like the root of the place. <br /> Do yourself a favor and get caught in the 1925 silent version of the lost world. Incredibly in this age of CGI and other advanced effects, the twenty version is the best and will be so far until someone finally decides to make a decent re-do.
