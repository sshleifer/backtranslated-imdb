Movie sensitive films and charisma Mercurio completely wasted. Published for a minute on a Thursday at maybe one local cinema and avoided by the entire population of Sydney except me and four others back in BEYOND is a seemingly unlikely project created by a producer looking for a fee. Local actors such as John Polson and Terry Serio deserve better (well Polson has been morphed to a smart lame director like SWIMFAN and hide and seek) and Terry Serio seems never to find a guernsey apart from thug roles. But Paul Mercurio should become one of Australia's largest exporters on screen. Roles like this are great disappointment and films as this is just a waste of talent and time.
