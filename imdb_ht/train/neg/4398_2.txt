Tim Robbins and John Cusack are two actors I have appreciated in all their careers, and that was the only reason to choose to watch this movie. Well, all I can say is I totally regret it! These two great actors outraged themselves all the way through not making a number of irrelevant, inimaginative and extreme kitches (not this is bad on their own) designs that are supposed to make people laugh, but fail to do so. The only reason I can think is that the director was their friend and they decided to support his movie by starting in it-I can not think of anything else because this movie is SO SOON! Fortunately Tim Robbins and John Cusack have never been ashamed of me since. I would recommend you to avoid this movie, unless you want your opinion about the two spoiled actors.
