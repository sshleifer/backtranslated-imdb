I should explain why I gave this ... "Art of Art" 1 star rating from possible 10. Simply because it's hard or the next impossible rate to miss it fairly. Probably it would be even if I gave it 10/10 - explanation anyway would follow. <br /> I'm not fond of these free Gore movies like HOSTEL or so - I think this disgusting and pretty terrible (in all possible contexts of meaning), but as I found out after watching this movie - There is a genre called "historical drama" - and probably it might be the case at 10/10 as it has a lot of it and Tarantino would have been more than happy with it (and made Kill Bill 3 to divert even more blood on the screen above here to show that it is possible). but the thing about the "historical drama" genre is that it is a sub-category of the "trash movies" where John Romero is the undead-gory-emperor-of-the-brave and it automatically can not be rated as your default movie - like These are movies that are made bad about goals and you can not really tell if this funny joke was meant to be so, or it was simply bad. it's for those who love to enjoy evil acting, bad scenplay and evil all else. And by some turn of faith - I am one of them too. There are days when I have an encouraging to see a really bad movie and look up for some garbage and here you go - the day is saved! but that's definitely an opinion in me and does not match anions' other stuff. <br /> <br /> What I mean is that if you want to watch some horrible films - then Casellova Fellini is definitely the choice but listen to my advice and not rate it does not mean default .
