While others can test that by looking at other works by Bilal, someone will better appreciate this movie, failing in one bigger way. It does not stand on its own. The plot is a mishmash that is confusing symbolism and substance. Here's an idea starting with a definite story. Then craft simplicity around it. We start with two different narratives, this girl who somehow turns people, a "god" who is for some reason being judged but getting one last cast on Earth, and this mysterious John seems to develop some sort of "resort" just beyond the boundaries of the city. Why? None of these questions are answered. But we care, no. There is no development we want to empathize with any character in the story, the nearest we get Jill and even then the development is the best place. Unfortunately the movie gets caught in the visually impressive (which it is,), but at the expense of motivation development. I would like to see this rewritten by someone who could distance themselves from the material a bit and do not have to feel that all the images must be in the picture.
