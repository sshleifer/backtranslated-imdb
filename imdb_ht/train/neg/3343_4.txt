Interesting story about a soldier in a war that is missing out on saving the life of a young girl from the enemy and is haunted by this event, though he saved many other prisoners. The film shines a head and this soldier is now a teacher in a high school that is managed primarily by patrol patrol halls, toilets and even classrooms. In other words, the High School is a prisoner and most of the children pay attention to the many teachers or principals. Dolph Lundgren, (Sam Decker) plays the soldier / school teacher and he decides to leave teaching and go to another field. However, the principal asked her to have a Detention Class as her last homework as a teacher. It is at this point in the movie when all hell breaks loose and the story becomes a complete bomber. Try to enjoy it, if you decide to see it!
