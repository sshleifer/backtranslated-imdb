Bela Lugosi is great as usual, but the film is nothing compared to Dracula. It is probably the only one who has played a perfect part of this movie but not even a legend like Lugosi could save the wickedness of this movie idea and unlike most old movie unspenseful movie horrors by setting mood is very well. Even in the worst of any bela's cinema is only mediocre though.
