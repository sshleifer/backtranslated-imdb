Television makes the society influence ... just watch the wave of popularity in cappucino shops after this little bit of debut job. In addition, real people who look good as these people have no problem. <br /> Moreover, anyone really believes that these people can afford to live in a beautiful Manhattan Loft considering what to do for a living? NBC just loves insulting the viewer's intelligence, though they're just around the Gump level. I know someone who makes $ 100,000 a year as a web designer and lives in a small one-bedroom apartment in Manhattan that costs $ 2200 a month to rent. <br /> I would like to see a show called Friend, where she's six people nobody in dead-end work, living in a neighborhood where mermaids are still mourning and getting mugged every week ... and then the owner jacks up the rent. Now that I would look.
