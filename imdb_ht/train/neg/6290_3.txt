Rapap: Ron is about to marry Mel. They are deeply loved and sure to be perfect for each other even though they met just a few months ago. Todd, Ron's brother in law must be not so happy. She is afraid the wedding is a threat to her racing work in the family business and she decides to arrange Ron's Bachelor's party. But her real plan is to put Ron into a compromised situation, finding evidence and breaking Ron and Mel up. <br /> <br /> Comments: Suppose an end to a classic comedy but it's not funny at all. It is mostly a pubertal show and a juvenile excuse to show scandal scandal wife. Actually, in a way, it is almost impressive there are so many you can put in, because they are everywhere. Unfortunately this is also one of the signs of a movie that can not support itself. It simply is not good enough. It has three redefined points though, or actually three actors who are worth a bit better than that. It is lead actor Josh Cooke who actually manages to give an impression of some common sense. Sarah Foster knows that there is more talent than making movies like this, and Emanuelle Vaugier seems to have a lot more talent than this movie. <br /> <br /> What suspicious absence is good jokes. Actually, bad jokes are rather rare. It's just not funny. <br /> <br /> 3/10
