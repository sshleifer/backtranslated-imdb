Made a year before ILSA, SHE-WOLF in the SS, BLACKSNAKE could easily be called SUSAN, SHE-WOLF in the tournament and it probably inspired the producers behind the Nazis sexys spells to go ahead with their infamous movie because The identical stories: a gorgeous, horny, tight (but stupid) blonde woman degrades and kills many people under his control, who hated him, and wants to die it. Sound familiar? Director Russ Meyer and David Friedman, the producer behind the ILSA cops, are good friends and have started their career together. So, obviously, there is a connection there. Looking at BLACKSNAKE, I can not help but think that Russ Meyer wanted to move and do something other than the typical epic woman she was thick because XXX movies were all the rage in the mid 1970s, and Russ Meyer movie, even if full of stripping and kinkiness and violence, never even close to real porn. Her film began to look positively weird next to DEEP THROAT and other hard-core blockbusters. Meyer knew he was not able to compete with these films and BLACKSNAKE is the result of the end of such a candidate in his career. It obviously wanted to branch from different territories unknown. But BLACKSNAKE is bombarded by B.O. and Meyer quickly returned to VIXEN movie types, though they were still not pornographic, were more definitely over-the-top than any of his previous films. <br /> It's no wonder BLACKSNAKE was a BO failure. It's just awful. Raw-o-rama. Jaw-dropping bad. It's a casual career to take on slavery, if you can imagine that. The end result is jarring. One minute, we are in typical Meyer territory: exuberant, playful and funny, and then the next minute, super mediating seriousness on slavery and violence. Huh? It just does not work. Aspects of slavery / racism are wobblingly mishandled with this movie veers in the true explicit category. But BLACKSNAKE is not like sleazy as ILSA SHE WOLF in the SS and these types of films, so I imagine fans of the latter were disappointed by it, which would explain the lack of almost the interest of this movie from OS fan exploitation or Russ Meyer fan. Meyer blames the BLACKSNAKE failure because, and I quote, "It did not have enough breasts in it." Well, I'm sorry Russ, but the movie is just bad, nursing or no breasts. But it's right though on the low breast quota. Except for Anouska and the maid, the movie cast is male. Meyer replaces his usual appetite to baby buxom and mobs of hunks and massive peaks, in the form of anonymous black actor playing slaves and great David (Darth Vader) Prowse. But with the right hand Anouska's hand around, who described as an innocent but clever gay person who enjoys the power of having more than the guys, one can only ask what Meyer was really trying to create here . <br /> <br /> BLACKSNAKE stars David Warbeck, who lusted after by Anouska with his right hand man. Poor David. It seems totally befuddled by the whole experience. It seemed to have fun making the movie, but you can clearly see that, at times, she has no idea what's going on. Then there's Anouska Hempel. It is a beautiful woman ... for the 1970s, by the 1870s. With its makeup and hair, it looks like a typical 1970s Brit pin-up babe than a turn of dominatrix century. And her wardrobe is hilarious. At one time, it actually unzipped her leather boots! I did not know they had zip in those days. But the character he plays is, by itself, really degraded (no pun intended). It has nothing but a chiffon of the object of lust and reproach of everyone (and that woman) on the island. For example, one night, when David and Anouska getting it on, bitter slave drivers go to the hall, striking David unconscious and trying to break it, groping his vibrant. The next day, the slave driver still works for Anouska and the two acts as if nothing happened. It's totally funny. Under any circumstances, his character was a real person, so he would have poured the lurid slave driver and kicked his butt on the island. Or even kill him. But the fact that the woman kept him on his planting after he tried to violate it is to extinguish the story flimsy and curl the characters of the max. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />! Watch out for the variety of collision tracks. I just could not help but watch the movie for the unspoken aspects of it all (the excellent movie theater makes it easier to watch). So that's an exploitation film, I guess he's succeeding in doing what he's supposed to do. But BLACKSNAKE is mostly for Russ Meyer completists.
