The original is a relaxing look, with some really memorable animated sequences. Unfortunately, the end, while not the worst of the end DTV completely misses the brightness. <br /> <br /> The biggest tantrum is a lack of a story. Like Belle's magic world, the characters are told in a series of vignettes. Magic world, while much better, still manages to make a mess in the story. Among the stickers, we see the mice at work, and I personally think the antics of Jaq and Gus are the earnest earnings of this movie. <br /> <br /> The first vignette is the best, about Cinderella getting used to being in being a princess. This is the best, because the mouse was in the funniest here. The worst of the vines, when Jaq becomes a person, is beautiful at times, but there is a lack of imagination. The last sticker, when Anastasia falls in love, was also nice. The problem was, I could not imagine Anastasia was friendly and Cinderella, as I consider it meaner from the stepisters. This was also marine by a rather ridiculous subplot on Lucifer fell in love with PomPom. The occasional music was very pleasant to listen, but I hated their songs, they were really inspired, and nothing like the beautiful Tchaikovsky melody inspired in the original. <br /> <br /> The characters were the biggest developments here. Cinderella while still caring, lost her sincerity, and a lot of her charms from the original, though she put some pretty clothes. The Duke had some really funny moment but they were not enough to save the movie, as well as Prudence and the King. As I mentioned, the mice were salaries stamped in the movie, as they alone contributed to insisting the movie. I also said the animation is colorful and the average above, and the acting voice was surprisingly good. <br /> <br /> All in all, a beautiful, unmistakable ending, was dirty by the songs and a lack of a story. 4/10 for the mouse, the voice to act, the animation and some beautiful dresses.
