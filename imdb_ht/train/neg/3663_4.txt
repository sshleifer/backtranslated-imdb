Spanish icon horror Paul Naschy star in this, one of his weaker films his films ... but brings with me for a moment. Most people are familiar with it under the most common TV titles, the Fire Man WOLF, and has a lot of video versions of his home over the years. If you want to be serious about giving it a shot just though, the most workable edition I've seen in it goes to the title THE WOLF MAN'S NEEDS SLEEPS, and it's an unprecedented version with European fingers that restore a couple of disturbing scenes and original nude vaccines are missing from FURY printing. It is also letterboxed. <br /> <br /> Naschy plays Waldemar Daninsky, returning home from a trip to Tibet only to find out that she had contracted a werewolf curse and that his wife had an affair. She takes care of her and her lover while in animal form, but then becomes a guinea pig for a sexy women doctor and her female assistant. Apparently, the doctor tries to "tame" the werewolf, and there is a very gay scene sado-masochist love between her and Daninsky her hairy body with her gloves, at least in the original version. Finally, we get two werewolves for the price of one as a heavy-handed Daninsky! <br /> <br /> The biggest problem with the movie is that the director (according to the Naschy's claim) was often drunk, and the results are true rather incoherent. When viewing WOLF's copies of SLEEPS, it is not very difficult to figure out what's happening, even if the correction remains at-risk in the spots. The worst of all is the occasional non-matching footage of Naschy's werewolf rattle swiped straight from another movie before (La marc del hombre lobo, aka "TERROR BLOODY FRANKENSTEIN") and mixed in this one without any sensible reason! Clothing in the wild beast changes to black and white shirt back again, as does his attitude; Sometime the wild beast is walking around littoral in a hypnotic vision from FURY, its next is rude and runs around violence from BLOODY TERROR. Really scary.
