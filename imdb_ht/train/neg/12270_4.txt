This Kiyoshi Kurosawa movie ghost is very sticky, and she has at least a scary flying that keeps me off guard. But everyone, the film is incredibly stupid, and a detective trying to track down a serious suspicious assassin, only to find out that he could commit one of the crimes. Then he finds himself haunted by a gorgeous Asian ghost, and he has no idea why (and neither sees the viewer). As the other murders commit, it becomes even more confused as the killers are easy to find, and this ghost still kneels to him for some reason. Not only is the plot completely stupid, the lady ghost is more funny than anything, especially when it suddenly flies across the city, like Wonder Woman. And the finish makes little sense, in fact, the movie all makes little sense, and I can not recommend it at all. If he does not think so serious, I would think he was supposed to be a black comedy. Outside of "Future Bright" this is the worst movie directed by Kiyoshi Kurosawa I've seen again.
