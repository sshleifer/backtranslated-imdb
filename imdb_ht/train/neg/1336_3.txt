This film was definitely not one of the best films of Mari-Kate and Ashley. I really did not like it, and I was kind of unlucky in this movie. For some reason, it seemed like it was a movie that they put together really fast. In some parts, it was so boring that I was fast forward. He did not have any bloopers or any interesting parts like the other films.
