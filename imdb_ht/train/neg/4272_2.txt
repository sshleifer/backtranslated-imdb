These types of movies where a psycho of a variety or another tries to damage the reputation of (and eventually eliminate altogether) some naive people in order to take over their lives. Fatal Attractions, Pacific Heights, but the Cradle Rocks, Single White Women, and a thousand make-for-TV movies are some examples of this. But while a few, especially Fatal Attractions and Habits Heights could offer at least some very paranoid, suspenseful characters or a few torsion characters, illegal entry plays everything by the book. Is not it for staring stars (Kurt Russel, Ray Liota, and Madeline Stowe), this movie would flow mediocrity faster than a Danielle Steele Mineseries. Russel plays Michael Carr, an incessantly naive guy who calls on the help of a pair of officers when someone breaks home and tries to attack his wife (Madeline Stowe). Unfortunately, he slowly ventilates his anger about feeling so discouraged in the situation of the wrong pot (Ray Liotta), a typically psychic mechanical with no limit to his power. At first and Carr (probably only pretend to do so), the captain befriends the couple. But soon enough, the cops want Carr out of the way so, destroying the life of Mr. almost any way he can (which is very easy when you are a cop, and when you're the cop who has installed the security guys system in his home) in order to take over and presumably, to find his wife. It seems less finished-oriented, and more like the cop just wants to prove its power. The woman is more like a trophy, in other words, than an end. And the story plays out entirely by the book, you can probably predict each incident before it happens on the screen if you've seen enough in those movies. From the moment of our "shocking" mainstream, naive characters realize he is a victim of credit card fraud (perpetration by the psychopathian cruelty) in the final-to-he's-not-really-dead final.
