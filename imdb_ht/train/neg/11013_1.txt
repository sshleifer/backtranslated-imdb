I'm in bad movies but that's nothing for her. Despite the above morons, it's NOT funny. I know comedy and underground cinema but this is so boring that the director / writer should be banned in either direction, but accessing local cable ever again! For movies and comedy is to despise this movie. I can never find out about how unfunny and boring this job was. If you like this movie you are a pothead as moderate nothing here. ZEWO! If you need to compare underground movies, watch "Kentucky Fried Movie" or John Waters early. The movie begins by defining satire and I challenge anyone to show me the satir. The Rule for Comedy is so ... If it's FUNNY you can say or do anything but if it's not funny you're saturated, you're not noble, you're simply pathetic and this movie is simply not funny. ZEWO!
