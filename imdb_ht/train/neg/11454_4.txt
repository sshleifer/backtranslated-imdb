So I had low expectations for this movie to start with, but it failed to meet the same ones. while there were some funny parts, even one or two loudspeakers, this film was very short in what I would call good. The funniest jokes are unexpected and very quickly, let's sit there, "WTF just happen?" In addition, there was a few jokes that just dragged on and over and over. The part where he dropped down the mountain gave me. Also, the correction was really missing. There was some poor scene transition, but this seems to be the style of nowadays. She made me laugh, but I would not look it again, and I am very happy to wait for her to rent. Give it a chance, you might enjoy it, but do not think that you are in for anything on the lines of the 40 year old girl, or Superbad.
