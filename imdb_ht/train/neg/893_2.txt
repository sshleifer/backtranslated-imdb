When I bought this DVD I though: "It seems to be a pretty light comedy about love and relationships made up of Portuguese standards ?? let's give it a chance?" I was totally lost! What a disappointing movie! First, it's not a comedy; It's a cheap drama that can be so melodramatic that it's even worse than many Portuguese soap operas! Second, the plot is so boring, and nowhere to come ?? It has no structure, it just leaks, like the wind, in one or another direction ?? The output is also bad! The sound mix is ​​horrible, because sometimes the voices are disconnected. Did he remind me of some old Portuguese movies from the 80's? The acting was better too ?? Well, to sum up, it's not with movies like this one that Portuguese movies will improve! In fact, it was one of the worst Portuguese films I've seen in recent years! Bad argument, bad act, bad production ?? I had no high hopes for this movie, but it was worse than I had ever imagined! Just forget about it!
