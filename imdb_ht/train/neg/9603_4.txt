Falling in love with someone kind, her life appears to take a turn for the better when she was raped and her lover was killed by a band of thugs.Trumatized again by the latest events, the woman returning to her violent ways and seeking revenge on the thugs, "according to the resin DVD sleeve. <br /> <br /> Rino Di Silvestro at "La lupa mannara" starts with all the airs, writhing, dancing moaning by beautiful blonde Annik Borel, who (like Daniella Neseri) Mistakes believe she is a werewolf. The hottest part is when the camera captures fire background between her legs. Opening "flashback" reveals its main ancestor (probably) a flywheel creature. Ms. Borel is, unfortunately, not a werewolf; It is simply a very strong dig. As a movie, "werewolf" (in English) would be best if Borel's character really was a female werewolf; and her sexual victim has a great bit of characterization. But as far as 1970s skin and blood flicks go, this one is hard to beat. Bouncy Borel is either naked or sexually clad in the movie, which features a fair amount of gay gratuitous. Dazzling Dagmar Lassander (like Elena) and hunky Howard Ross (as Luca) are good supporting players.
