Being a movie maker, and having a humorous humorous sense of humor, I thought I was in a treat when I took home the "Bad Mine ..." (not that covered DVD provides anything far, rather than choosing for the quote limits from director of microbiologist Chris Morris, "a short film including scenes"). I should have known better, and avoid this aspid piece (and often offensive) in twoddle. The scene of the church is reluctant to look (especially since we are all too familiar with Morris's deficit attitude towards pedophile from his glamorous television series, Eye Brass) and serves no purpose other than shock. How does this movie mark a comedy I never understood. <br /> <br /> The runner's comment sounds like a novel idea in principle (having a runner myself, it's often an interesting and uninhibited perspective on the movie process) however this is sadly not the case here. Instead, we are treated to some public school students ranting about dogs on film, before concluding that there is no really big movie starter. This is all very interesting, but not worth a single frame of seluloid. <br /> <br /> To say that this movie goes nowhere would be an understatement. It relies too heavily on its intensifying style, at the expense of plot, character and dialogue, leaving the unpassured and unfulfilled viewer visual. Its over-simplified message - that people should take responsibility for his actions - is both unusual and illustrative and unusual. The film has its moments of pseudo-Kafkaesque surealism, but ultimately, it fails to persuade, entertain, illuminate and just end up being irritating. If you want to see a really great piece of short films, I recommend "Franz Kafka in It's a wonderful life" by Peter Capaldi.
