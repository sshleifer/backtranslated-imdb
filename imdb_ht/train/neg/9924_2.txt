"Dutch Schultz", AKA Arthur Fleggenheimer, was a real person and lives rather embarrassingly well documented. The film that pretends to describe his life should have been using a fictional character, because the events overdramatized are too strong a departure from reality and chronology. Not only that, it ignores some interesting details that other versions have included the public relations fiasco in northern N.Yo and its religious conversion. It is true that it was executed by Luciano, Lansky, et. al. but that's as far as it goes. Scenes of exploding plates representing Luciano carry out the execution of Bo Weinberg in his own home, helping his mother to be redirected. Also, there is the scene in which Dutch approaches her own mother to pay the protection of Legs Diamond. It just does not work. The character of Ms. Fleggenheimer does not work either. This movie does not need a Jewish doting mother for humorous relief. The diamond representation of Diamond Legs was funny enough. I'm sure the man turns to his cell. And, by the way, Dutch did in fact personally murder, but it was not rambo or 007. The scene in which he was wet for the beverage is absurd. I do not know. Perhaps it was supposed to be a comedy and I just did not find it.
