I saw this movie with the other. Trinity is my name and I find that this one is worse then the first one. I have no idea why they did another film it was stupid and freaky sorceress to say that I have all of them. I sat in them many times and still drives me to turn it in 5 minutes to the movie. I like Terence Hill movies and I like Bud Spencer but this movie just drove me to the wall. If he has a different story line or at least more of a plot and more comedy he might have been funner and worth the 5 dollars I've spent buying all the movies. But you make mistakes so I might save your money and you do not movie or any of those who go with it to trust me on this one.
