A call-girl witnessed a murder and became the next sibot's target. Director Brian De Palma is really on a screaming scroll here: his camera swoops around the corner of a museum (after lingering a long time on a painting in a mark), splitting up into cracked screens for artistic purposes, practically giving away his scheme with a sequel (again in the cracked screen) where both characters are watching a television broadcast transsexual, with its first (final) stage during a rain storm storm. "Dressing to Kill" is tedious, primarily because he asks us to swallow and gives back nothing considerable. Much of the act (with the exception of young Keith Gordon) is the mediocre and (second) final is a rip-off of De Palma's own "Carrie" - not to mention "Psycho". The explanation of the dirty works plays like a parody of Hitchcock, not a homage. Stylish in a cold cold way, the end results are distinctly half-cooked. ** from ****
