Seriously, I do not even know where to start. It's like someone who gave a baseline dollar budget to a third-grade author and said 'made me a movie about the secret service'. The correction is ridiculous, the cinematography was the best random, each syllable in dialogue was completely delayed with the direct ... well there was even a director there? Everything was just for freeware and disable and freeware ... and random .... and lame. <br /> Here is a SPOILER for you; This movie is dumbest stuff you'll ever see. <br /> However, if you liked this piece, you'll also enjoy; Deterrance, black blue, and part of the front lobotomy.
