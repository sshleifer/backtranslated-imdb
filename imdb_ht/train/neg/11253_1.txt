Visually interesting but falling flat in the originality department. This tedious excercise of techniques puts thin after the opening battle. Jude law has charisma of roasting tuna, but in its defense it has some of the worst dialogue I've ever seen on the big screen. In fact, the script is so poor that it keeps you out of the movie, and I've been thinking about work, bills, dogs, etc. There are many moments called bluescreen. Paltrow is as wooden as found. This could be saved by Dynamics Dynamic Dynamic Film or Top Camp. My only complaint about the technique is that Black & White film (sorry, computer) would help because it looks like Turner is color black and white. Just a big tear of dull clich√©. I would rather break my femdom than sit in this endurance test again.
