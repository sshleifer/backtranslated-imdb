This movie begins with a certain number of promises; but, in my view, begins to lose it when the protagonist kidnaps the good Samaritan who comes to his aid when his car breaks down. That alien that well wants to start fixing his car while it is far from making a phone call is plausible enough, but that it is one of the few people in the country who can help him put his family life back On track is the kind of coincidence that the writers have warned against using in their stories. <br /> I found this movie the best average. Art Directions could be best, as they could cinematograph. The act was good, and so Eva van der Gucht's song.
