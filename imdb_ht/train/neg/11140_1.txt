I thought I was going to watch an awesome movie .. and ended up laughing all the way across the movie. At the stage where the person transformed into a werewolf I thought they were kidding. Computer games today have ten times better animations. Low budget, is a proper comment. I would recommend Wolf (1994) to Jack Nicholson for a good drum movie. It has great special effects as they should (human transformed with werewolf). Unless you want to have good laugh I would not recommend you to watch this movie. This movie is a joke.
