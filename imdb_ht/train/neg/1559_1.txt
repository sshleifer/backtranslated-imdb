This can be very good is the worst movie I'll see if I live to be 100. I think a group of first-class students might have come up with the best line drawn as a class project than that. I dumber for being looked at, and God has mercy on souls who have paid to produce this movie. <br /> After I finally turned it, I actually was promoted to vomit. /> <br /> No one had a clue about photography when did this. No one has a sign of acting. No one had a clue about just about anything. <br /> I can not believe F / X shows this crap on occasion. Only once I saw it was one of the Starz! channels - not even the main one. And it was about in about 3 a.m. in that.
