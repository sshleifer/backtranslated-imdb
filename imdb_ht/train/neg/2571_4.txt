With Goldie Hawn and Peter Sellers in a movie you figure this one will not go wrong. But what can I say? This was a bad effect. The film is about Peter Sellers as an older man who suddenly finds himself in a genuine and unheard-of-gene genre not to mention hippie attracted by Goldie Hawn. The movie is extremely desperate and I did not understand anything about it. Peter Sellers and Goldie Hawn are very funny people but this movie does not prove it. <br /> <br /> That song on Cinderella's arabella is pretty cool, but that's it. I only recommend this movie to those who like to watch an extreme gift movie, this is almost the definition of one. I guess this movie much more than anything else is a sign of the times, in terms of its definitive experimentation and all around unconventionality, the problem is the quality of the shooting and writing, not to mention the direction is just to go out. Peter Sellers in particular is very hit and miss, he will go to Dr. Strangelove and be there throughout his career, in movie scenes like this and the magic Christian, who was very similar with this one in context and style, but this movie has a few funny moments. This one is meaningless, and I'm sad that somebody as big as Peter Sellers was in this movie. Do not recommend anyone.
