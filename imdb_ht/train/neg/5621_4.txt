I'm an incorrigible and agnostic skeptic and has so hoped to enjoy this movie. After watching it, however, I honestly believe I could make a better documentary myself. Its arguments seem to have only four eyebrows (although they were listed in the IMDb credits I did not see Richard Dawkins anywhere), it's edited along crudely with amateur ridiculous compassion, and does not even try the slightest attempt appear fairly. The narration is pervaded at all with a sneering, almost adolescent anti-Christian sentiment, damaging any possibility that the movie might actually change someone's mind as opposed to just preaching the chorus (I). Even though there are some interesting discussions about the historicity of Jesus, the movie hit an unbearable tear when it begins to stay heavy on the Christian school that the director goes to a child, an institution that apparently scarred her psychologically as it obsesses her to this day. Though TGWWT obviously had a low budget, there was still an opportunity here to make a smart smile on the roots of Christianity. There is certainly a hunger in the discretion-minded religious documentary on the market, and this film could help fill the cancellation. Instead, the director chose to insult our intelligence with this piece of waste, which in the end appears to be some sort of exercise therapeutic for him. It's too bad that Christian has elevated her traumatic, but she does not need to issue an audience of coping mechanism.
