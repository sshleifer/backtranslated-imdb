After just finishing the book on the same day I watched the movie, I knew what was supposed to happen. I had great hope in the movie, because of the rating. The only reason I gave this movie a 2 out of 10 stars is that it was okay to try a movie. I have a main point point for not just this movie. <br /> <br /> ********** SPOILERS ********** <br /> 1. Distribution. Jack Nicholson barely adapted to Jack Torrence's character. Also, I would never take Shelly Duvall for Wendy. I Wendy's photos are very different. I can see why Jack Nicholson was chosen though, grin, the pointy eyebrows, but he does not really think 'wrong'. It should look normal, and it turns out bad. Also, they make one of the worst movie films. Danny was well, he needed more lives though. He acted as a drug dealer. <br /> 2. Simply. They cut out lots of things in the book, and added things. Some of the things that were in the book that I was looking forward to in the movie were either deleted, changed, or handled wrongly. Some of the things that were in the book that I was looking forward to seeing (the hedgehog animals, the roquet racquet, the elevator) was not in the movie, and it was 2 and half hours! I was very irritated. <br /> <br /> 3. Finish. The finish was completely changed, Halorann died, Jack was frozen to death, Wendy never hurt ... The Duty did not blow. The finish was so cool in the book, and the movie messed it up so horribly, I was applauded. Hallorann was never supposed to die, but Jack killed him with an ax. If they wanted to kill him, at least Jack had used a Roque Mayet. You never even saw a mallet roque during the whole movie. There are other things that I do not like about the movie, but there are things that are all right. The candles angels were cool, the blood coming out of the elevator (did not reach the book) was cool, but maybe I was too irritated that the movie did not go with the book, to try fear all. I recommend reading the book before you see this movie. I applaud Stephen King to actually agree to sign a contract for Stanley Kubrik again. I would never have done that, I would have taken all the rights I could get to call it all the day. I can not wait to see the version 6 hours, at least it has the hedge animals. <br /> Rating: 2/10
