This obvious pilot for a series of television productions features young Canadian actress Shiri Appleby as an amniak and some incredible powers that must be set to use when a man-turned-flying demon crap over the world. The CGI is par for a TV show, and Appleby is OK as an amnyak but hard to swallow as a superheroine. Famous TV faces Richard Burgi is set to ride the ride as Appleby's counselor, but it can not do anything elevated to this drak higher than the mediocre level. We see way too much of the cartoon demon flying from the start, a bad sign. Also, the scenes where Burgi is Appleby training for fighting is actually ridiculous. They are a bad copy of similar scenes in several other movies, most notably REMO WILLIAMS.
