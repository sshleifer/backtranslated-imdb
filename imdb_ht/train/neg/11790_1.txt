Deep SH .. is more like it! The elbows are just drawn to the movie. Thinking "Mr Limpet's Incredible" meets "Leviathan". Very tacky. <br /> No character or relationship development. So, called "romantic" scenes are very corny and predictable. An interesting idea, but a well written script and LOUSY special effects make this a definite must-miss!
