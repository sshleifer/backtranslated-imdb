This is an atrocious film. Two young women desire to seduce and torture a man of medium age. There is not much to give away in considering a plot or a "spoiler". I would only comment that the finish is almost the most prevalent part of the flick. Many of the film involves Locke and Camp cackling obnoxiously, all while grinning psychotics in the camera. Add to this a band that repeats again and again, including a vaudevillian song about "old dad's love" that suggests an insurvable quality of the viewer never really seen. The music is annoying at first, then ends up the viewer's subject to a torture that gets worse than what's displayed on the screen. The term here is in young run amoces, understand as a reaction to the '60s, but with little imagination or style. Avoid it!
