I've seen this recently with my wife and discovered it better than Caine believes, although not much cop. Britain's largest actor ever screen does not seem too interested in this role, which is a pity as he might have elevated it with more conviction in his play. Rex Harrison looks even less aggressive, possibly dangerous, as his character is very badly written. William Holden is better, but his screen time is over and again, his character is not well scripted. <br /> <br /> Beverly Johnson is as beautiful as a woman I've ever seen, but given little to do, the movie might have been a great deal by concentrating more on her story. The Ustinov flight shows, but basically does not play a funny character well out of maintaining the tone of the movie. The music is poor and Omar Sharif does one of its many free (his career was based on this for decades now). Richard Fleischer must have been blamed for not directing this most effectively, he was an unpredictable movie director, and this is one of his most movies.
