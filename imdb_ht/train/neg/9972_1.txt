Child problem is one of the worst movies I've seen in the last decade! This is a bad movie about a wild boy adopted by two parents, but it gets into trouble later. That Junior can drive Grandpa's car. It can frighten a bear. It can put a room on fire! It's a bad movie as much as BATTLEFIELD EARTH. An end is a fate even worse. Rent CHRICH RUN rather. <br /> * 1/2 from **** I give it.
