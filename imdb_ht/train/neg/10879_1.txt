Lame, Lame, and Lame. A 90-minute defender-that's 89 minutes too long. A ripe environment with atmosphere and possibility (a abandoned convent) is wasted by a stinker in a script filled with clunky, unconscious dialogue that tension oh-so-hard to be hip. Especially it's just nasty, and the attempts at horror gonzo fell flat (a sample of this movie dialogue: after demonstrating his gun, fast dolly shot into a niche in barbeau's vigilant features: `any question? 'Hyuck hyuk hyuck). Bad acting, idiotic, omofob jokes and judging from the animal effects, it seems that the director will look 'wrong way' too many times. <br /> I must be my friend of great time renting this turkey and suggests Nine Minor wasted they will never get back. What a turdock.
