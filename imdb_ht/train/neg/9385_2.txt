The "Trivia" page on the IMDb claim filmmakers protested because this movie was re-cut by the studio "Simplified Scheme". If so, this effort was a total failure, as this is one of the most incoherent narratives I've ever seen in a movie - I'd hate to see it before the scheme was "simplified." <br /> <It's sad to see Warren and this little character goes on that even he can not do anything with the inept material. It's interesting to see Caron in '70 fashion instead of globeing her Hollywood-era glamor and character, but she's sad to see her wander around in this make-a-favor-to-her-producer-dreck husband. It would actually later hook up with and marry the director, rather - who, you'll remember, never led anything yet, but made prohibited 1st or 2nd A.D TV work from here on out. This must tell you enough right there. <br /> I call this "interesting" because I have an automated fondness for American films in this period, and this role adds perspective to Oates' otherwise fantastic 1971 production (Two - Lane Blacktop, but hiring). But the "1940s detective as fish-out-of-water in 1970 L.A." term, which is the only thing the movie really said, is sold in ways too heavy-handed a way. A similar term should be well occupied two years later on Long Altman's Goodbye. And as far as Oates plays a hard-bitten guy on a misconduct, three years on, he would give his definitive performance to bring my head Alfredo Garcia. If you have not seen these, do not waste your time with this!
