R Balki tries to tell you a story that was earlier told by Ram Gopal Verma in Nishabd in a sensual way. This time it mixes with mature humor. Amitabh Bachchan is a chef and owns an Indian cuisine in London. It is very dominating and arrogant and respects its work just like any other job. According to him, cooking is an art. Still can not do Hyderabadi Biryani well. <br /> Include Tabu that sent her Hyderabadi Biryani proper held by it and soon begin meeting up and finally fell in love with each other? Amitabh is 65 and Tabu is 35 ??. No probs! But one Hitch! Father Tabou Paresh Rawal !! Couples decided to meet the father for their wedding approval. But Amitabh realized that Tabu's father was younger. And the hassle starts? The wise performances of all three actors are brilliant. The script of the movie is very tight and interesting. The dialogues in the film are catchy. But somewhere you feel that your stomach is not quite complete. The comedy sometimes does not quite understand. The movie tries to go too long in some parts. <br /> <br /> Music has nothing much to sing about except track title. The camera-work is good. Director of R Balki could provide better in this script. But in the second half he even looks confused. "Satyagrah" scene of the father looks disappointing. But the lines are spoken by Amitabh Bachchan during these scenes are applauded. <br /> <br /> On the whole, Cheeni Kum needs more sugar!
