I read the reviews before I watch this movie, and I do not believe them. I love movies and I expect this one to be average. It was not. This movie makes Camps Without 1 and 2 look great. The movie has bad acting, poor sound, poor confusion scenarios, bad-makeup and he bored me so much I turn it off. even the stripping stripping! Did they even have a budget for this movie? I do not think they did. You can say if you will like this movie or not in the first 5 minutes. if you want a good gary movie cheese go look toxic to avenge 4 or even without camp. Avoid this waste - I watch it on TV and felt riped off, so do not spend anything on it. The best part is probably the end.
