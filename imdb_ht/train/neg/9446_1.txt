An absolutely atrocious adaptation of the wonderful children's books. Rude and infectious immigrants, some scary parties, and a sick side story about the mate's boyfriend wants to send the boy to military school to get him out of this way to make this totally inappropriate for the kids who will be more likely wants to see it because of books (3-8) years. Do not waste your money, your time, or your good judgment.
