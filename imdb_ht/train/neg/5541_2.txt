Since all of the universe-cinema universe has made friends with a guy named George A. Romero, the word "zombie" automatically becomes associated with images shaking without soaking and non-stop sequence. It's safe to say that it's "night of the living dead" formed the movie movie as we know it right now. But in the first few years of cinema, the quoted reanimated corpse simply used the slow, worst-less psychological action. Jacques Tourner in "I walked with a zombie" is a perfect example and thus is "White Zombie", starting Bela Lugosi. This "riot of the zombies" could be another example but unfortunately it's a chore on the whole line and easy one of the most tedious movies I've ever seen. Dreadful acting, a very badly written cinema and a complete lack of atmosphere and tension! The film only lasts 65 minutes and again the first half hour is entirely wasted on stupid stupid love-story and unexciting monologue. The setting in the Cambodian legendary city of Angkor surely could have resulted in a more compelling story, but all of us ever seen are interior shots. The lead actress (Dorothy Stone, blonde books and curly hair with an ugly nose) irritated me enormously and I kept hoping a raven awakening would suddenly appear out of nowhere to devour her. Nothing more. If you manage to struggle yourself in 60 minutes soporific, you will be rewarded with a fairly decent final. Still, this is far too small to give this movie a positive rating, let alone a recommendation. Avoid! This is the kind of movie you should only see in case you already see everything else.
