Listening to the story of the director confirmed that I was also suspect watching the movie: this is a movie made by a guy who wants to play in making a movie. The plot is the kind of stuff that deluded adolescent churn when they are going through that "I could write a book / scenario / premium sitecom" phase. There's a germ of an interesting idea to bury it in (probably because it's an end to someone else's movie), but it's totally buried under a script, otherwise executed and unprofessionally un-thought-out. /> The lines are terrifying, and their performance is un-engaging, though, I'm inclined to blame the director. It does not seem to have been consulting the actors at all on what is needed, rather plonked the script at hand, pointing the camera to them, saying they get over with it. Who knows, with a little coach, these actors could free themselves better (say what you like about musicians in movies, Jon Bon Jovi was excellent in sorting your boat and more than acceptable to the leading Man). /> As it stands, the cast does not have any chemistry too. A great opportunity to use the classical and parallel paraphernalia was spent when, in order to infect Bon Jovi's character and blood vampires from his fellow co-hunter, they gave him a transfusion. It should bite him. Mind you, there should be waves interested in each other throughout the rest of the movie too. Only the real moment of sexual tension, between the two women driving, is not the director admitted admission accident. It originally intended to use silent sequences as an excuse for more useless conspiracy - so I suppose the finished product could burn up worse. But not much. <br /> <br /> Frankly, as movies go, this is seriously scheme, funny and forgettable. Even as trashy movies go it's not sexy enough or gory enough to be fun. It could be a fun little blood, but the director left with more of a comedy, for every reason.
