Who actually created this piece of crap is the worst movie I've ever seen in my life it's like a waste of time and money. I hate him how to create low budget windows featuring actor D-Lister and a storyline similar to the 1st one. <br /> I found this movie in the negative bin bin sitting next to Wild Things 2 and Death to the Supermodels for $ 2.99 what a fool I should actually think this might be good instead of looking at Disgust as poor stereotype acts off the scenario with script from the 1st one. <br /> Anyone who thought that this straight-to-video output was actually even a half decent movie you must be on crackd or something because I think so pretty much most of the people who saw this movie think of a crazy charge ... !!!!
