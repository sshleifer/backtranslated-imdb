The European Vacation (European European Vacation) is the weakest of the vacation movie (the first and the third one the most superior in the movies). While Chevy Chase and Beverly D'Angelo return as Clark and Ellen Griswold (and new actors in the roles of Russ and Audrey Griswold), this time gives a weaker script and very bad dialogue. This causes the rhythm to suffer, and jokes are not very funny at all. To be more specific, what really causes this movie to suffer is the fact that the jokes are just stuck together in a script-script script), rather than serving a central scheme as other 3 films for vacation there. Oh, they can not have them all. 4 out of 10.
