The final period of Nelson Eddy and Jeanette MacDonald is basically a complete misfire. The script is weak and has been featured seriously. The movie just has no life at it.Eddy and MacDonald would be best just to make a movie concert for the endless endeavors .There is nothing wrong with the songs, just all the others in this turkey thats overcooked.
