I have to be completely honest in saying first that I fell asleep somewhere in the middle, so I can not give a full opinion on the movie until I see it in full. Basically, a group of thieves, including Sid Carter (South James) and Ernie Bragg (Bernard Bresslaw), plan to make a fortune steal a shipment of contraceptive grains from Finisham maternity hospital. This is where Mr. Matter (Hattie Jacques) characters work, along with Sir Bernard Koupe (Kenneth Williams), Dr. Charles Goodtrey, Dr. Prodd (Terry Scott) and Susan Ball (Barbara Windsor) nurse. Patients and visitors are also around, including Mrs. Tidey's wife (Joan Sims) and her nervous father-husband Mr Tidey (Kenneth Connor). Also begins Bill Maynard as Freddy and Wendy Richard EastEnders as Miss Willing. This plan by the way is not working out of the way, because all the staff is getting along the way. This pretty much all can be said about the movie until I see it again in full. Agree!
