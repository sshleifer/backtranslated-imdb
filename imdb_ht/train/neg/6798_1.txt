This is the worst movie I've ever seen. All involved should be embarrassed. Everyone. Glas-T is debilitating, the dialogue is absolutely awful, and hokie does not begin to describe their performance by every single actor in this movie. The plot stolen heavy from Executive decisions, but compared to Air Mania, Executive Decision is Academy Award material. I've never been so shamed when watching a movie. Rage when it should be burned with its ash closed in a vault never see the light of day again. Anyone who saw it should take a shower and wash stink in horrible movie off of them. The best part of this movie is probably from the end, when the credit rolls. This was the easiest movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Ice-T should stick to Law and Order, and others in this movie should retire early or commit suicide. Either way, they should never try to be in a movie again.
