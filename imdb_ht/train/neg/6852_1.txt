This film is really incredible. I've seen many good movies, especially a lot of 'Full Moon'-Pictures, but' Dollman 'is really hard. So many come together: the tuneful story, the actors are still in the parody edge with special effects! How long have I been talking about? It's a really bad movie, but also one of those funnels. If you are a fan of bad movies about laughing, you have to see it. And do not miss 'Dollman vs Dione Game'. It really funnier and gets worse.
