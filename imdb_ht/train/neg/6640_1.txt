I find it rather useless to comment on this "movie" for the simplest reason that it has nothing to comment on. It looks like a rotten egg that has nothing good to show in the world extract for the fact that it is rotten as the other endless eggs were before it. But since a comment is required for these insignificant insignia ... <br /> <br /> Filts are definitely the proper word to describe this movie in the same way as any other "movie" Romanian directed by Lucian Pintilie stressed the so-called "Romanian reality" after the communist era (1990 for the present day). Under no circumstances recommends people outside Romania as the others (who recently found amateur cameras, lack of draw, lack of directing elements / actors, noise etc. as they were trendy and even art-like): watch & enjoy this "Movie" (as I know you will), but doing other intentional IMDb members a favor, does not write an online review for it will move, irritate and at the end of their time trash. <br /> <br /> On the other hand this movie (among others) has some value whatsoever, a single education to read the example for: "How To Make A Movie."
