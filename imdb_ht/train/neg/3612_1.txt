Souls can be killed by college students, can new teachers stop the craze? <br /> Believe me, you will not take care. <br /> With a title like Splatter University, one would immediately pick up that this movie just is not high art. But worse than that Splatter University does not even qualify for fun trash. Splatter U is so poorly did - the story is stupid, the characters are thrown-away, and the movie all misses any sense of imagination. Needless to say, there is no suspense or atmosphere or crisis. This drivel is not even brave enough to throw off any nidite (for the cheapest thrill at all). So, all around this sophisticated slasher flawed offers nothing in the way of entertainment (not even laughing cheap) and just becomes a complete makeup. Bottom of the barrels - even dead hard slasher fans will want to think twice before watching, let alone pay money for this flick of films. <br /> <br /> BomB from ****
