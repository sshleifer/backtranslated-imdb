In my classroom we just finished the book, Hatchet, and this movie is nothing like the book. (1) Brian never eats glass in the book. (2) He did not know the name of the pilot. (3) Her mother was cheating on her father in a wagon parking lot in the woods where one could see. (4) The mother's mother is cheating and no black hair, she's blonde. <br /> Now, for the unrealistic parts of the movie: (1) A thirteen years old can not knock her in a window of one punch. <br /> And for the act, the kid who played Brian was a horrible actor. But I believe that the landscape was impressive, though I'm very skeptical to the same director to read the book. <br /> <br /> This movie is good if you do not read the Hatchet book, by Gary Paulsen, but if you have, then start a complaint letter to the principal.
