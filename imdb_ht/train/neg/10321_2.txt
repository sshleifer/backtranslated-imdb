This show is terrible, jokes are all awful and just get worse and worse. I'm one of those who had never been a big fan of Fuel Corner but at least I liked it at first until it got into a rut around the quarter, all the jokes were playing out and the characters had nothing to do . Well at least Fuel Corner was good at first, Little Mosque on the prairie is typically terrible incredible CBC comedy that had nothing to go for it in Episode 1. Who watched this show anyway, I am honest Is it old man or maybe just those who actually live on the meadows? Perhaps the jokes are for them and the job? I do not know one who likes to show this and can not stand it myself, the jokes are totally predictable and the characters are even less developed than in the Fuel Corner. Hopefully it will not last longer because all the success of this show seemed to be based entirely on the quotes in this show that Muslims are different and may / should have led to a great show.
