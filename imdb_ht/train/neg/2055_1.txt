There is absolutely NO reason to waste your time with this "movie". The original said it all and still keeps up. Either read the book or do some research on the story, and you will realize that this is funny. Eric Roberts as Perry Smith? His sister could do a better job! Having Holcomb & Edgerton, KS where the story takes place, along with where they looked NON like Kansas. The original is riveting, from where filming is used to current participants, weapons and victim items. Unforgettable performance by Scott Wilson and Robert Blake. Soundtrack by Quincy Jones and Cinematography by Conrad Hall ... The original is available on DVD in Widescreen now. Let this turkey die a quick death.
