They played this on Marilyn July 4 Twilight Zone with this, but down, Worst Twilight Zone episode I've ever seen. It's completely out of sync with the rest of the series in its tone. Though Twilight Zone is a very unmatched series and many episodes end up being much more predictable, this one has been completely out of place. Compare this to legendary episodes such as "A Stop at Willoughby" or "Midnight Sun", and you realize there is no comparison. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />! Even though he seems to be giving him some effort, he needs to have the money ... there is no further explanation.
