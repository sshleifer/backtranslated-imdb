My kids watch the show every day that's over. It's a great program for younger children. However, they need to stop re-running shows and make some more current shows and get rid of Rooney's and Deedee's YELLOW TEETH. Moe is the only dice boot with dull white pearle teeth and the kids notice things and ask if the 2 does not brush their teeth? Show it ever to make its way to the United States and if so where we can find its schedule. And another thing if we could add. MOE you need to stop very much. Sometimes when you pop up from where you are scared of children younger and so and pulling in the rope? What does it mean? other then getting wet all the time. They need to add more things to show instead of being even the same. Kids are interested in this way.
