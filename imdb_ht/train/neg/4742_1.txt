Wow. This was probably the worst DCOM ever. I watched the first half hour and I laughed. Brenda Song plays Wendy, the famous girl with companion of hot jokes and gluing up friends who are determined to be staying home. He should save the world as a warrior, and Shin comes to his aid to help him with his martial arts. Shin teaches the skills of a snake, tiger, etc. and he learned certain techniques to save the world. <br /> <br /> This movie is great for kids who want to learn about martial arts and Chinese culture but the action and filing were awful. <br /> <br /> Brenda Song is a comedy actress and I can not see her play a serious role. She laughed loudly to laughing at Shin. Shin could not act at all, and everything was totally incredible. <br /> I watched this movie and tried to think of something similar, and things I came up with were the Rangers. This movie is so fake and the cascades were so powerful Ranger-enquiring that it was just coral and stupid. The characters were not possible and I just could not stand to watch it. Disney really needs to take time to make some decent movies. High School Musical is the only movie that deserves to be on Disney Channel, along with other movies such as Pirate Jumping, Color in Friendship, Going Face, Reading It and Weep, & Stuck in the suburbs. You love action-adventure and jokes, you will love this movie.
