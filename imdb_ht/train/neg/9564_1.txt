Some people seem to think this was the worst movie ever seen, and I understand where they're coming out, but I really saw worse. That being said, the films that I can remember (meaning those I have not been blocked out) have been worse than this, so much that they physically pained any sense that was involved with watching the movie. These films are worse than War 2 games are those that make you want to sharpen your eyes, or sew sharp objects in your ears to keep yourself in having another soul piece worn away by you by the awfulness. > <br /> War Games: The Dead Code is not bad, but it comes pretty close. Yes I was a fan of the original, but no I did not expect miracles from this one. Let's face it original was not really great in a movie in the first place, it was basically just a 80-year-old Canadian Romance cops and some geek-calls in it. <br /> That's all I was hoping for, something bad, but that might have jumping in my geek string. Is this too much to ask? Is it really not possible to do better than the original War Games, even for a straightforward video release? Well apparently it was too much to ask for. Stay away from this movie. At first it's just bad, like "Oh yeah, this is bad, but I'm kind of enjoying it, maybe the end will be good as in the original." Then it just gets worse and worse, and in the end, trust me, you will wish you did not see this movie.
