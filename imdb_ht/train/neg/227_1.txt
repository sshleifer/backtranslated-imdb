Did this mean a comedy or a dramatic drama? This movie begins with a light-hearted interlude between three women. Fine. It moves into a conflict between women when one of them meets a man. Fine. There are some antiques between them. Fine. But when the scheme dawns and finally gets black I started wondering if I was interpreting the first part of the movie. It continues in this vein for a while until, in the end, it tries to return to the original light-heartter. But now it's not too late. It's hard to see why these women would always talk to each other and the final is compelling. Surely a lesson (for British filmmakers anyway) in how not to film. Difficult to see how the producers ever persuade themselves this movie would work. And the box office proved to be a real flop, because I had never heard of this movie until this weekend (four years after its release).
