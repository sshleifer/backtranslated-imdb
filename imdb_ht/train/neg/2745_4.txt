Squeamish 11-year-old Luke Benward (as Billy "Forrester Boy") moves to a new town. In his new school, the young boys chose Benward. They put glass in his thermos. When he reflexes gage under control, Benward launches a worm on the freckle-facing bullying Hicks Adam (like Joe Guire). Benward bets he can eat 10 glasses in one day - without regrets! <br /> <br /> Tall, teeny Hallie Kate Eisenberg (as Erika "Erk" Tansy) uses her archery skills to help Benward. Director and former SCTV writer Bob Dolman promises, "No glasses were wounded in making this movie." In a related note, SCTV star Andrea Martin has a funny scene. "How to Eat Fried Fried" is wounds based on Thomas Rockwell's famous novel. The first adolescent child grunt-outs should enjoy the movie. <br /> <br /> **** How to Eat Fried Fried (8/25/06) Bob Dolman ~ Luke Benward, Adam Hicks, Hallie Kate Eisenberg, Alexander Gould
