"Sleepwalkers" is the first movie that Stephen King wrote a script for. Given this, with the excellent Santo & Johnny Song being used as theme in the movie, you should expect an odd, and finally complete look experience. Unfortunately, this is not what you should get. The thing is, they could probably have made it a good movie. The beginning is intriguing and it's the small town of spooky atmosphere. But something strange is about 20 minutes in the movie. The movie turns funny so there is no apparent reason! From the moment on the entire atmosphere of "Sleepwalkers" is ruined.For those of you who have seen it, who can forget old good Johnny screaming out "CABOB COP!" after jabbing the pencil in one cop's ear?!? But do not get me wrong, the humor does not have any quality redeemiing. I just rent it again to see if my boot was wrong the first time around, given how the original plot sounded, but I was fine. Man, what a waste. I can not believe that these rights have been sung to Santo & Johnny. I gave this a 2.
