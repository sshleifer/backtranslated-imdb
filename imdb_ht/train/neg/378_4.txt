... but the keyword here is "usually." I knew they worshiped movies all their thoughts are mute. But in the world of B-rated movies, this one is Z-rated. Absolutely ridiculous. The thing I respect most of my favorite B-rated movies is that they do not take themselves too seriously. Musicians in movies like this sort-to treat the movie lightly, though it's a heavy topic. I found the impression, however, the producers of this film have taken themselves seriously, as they have put together a 10-star classic, complete with poor attempts at sharp lines and dumb camera shots. But despite all of this, I still give it 4 out of 10 stars, as I'm partial towards movies like this. If you're a B-rated fan, however, I'd try too hard to get this one.
