The public film appeals due to Ben Stiller's charisma and notoriety in J. Aniston. It seems that we have here a recipe for a successful title, but nothing is successful in this movie. <br /> <br /> Polly beautifully played by Aniston, no doubt. This is the kind of character that suits it perfectly. <br /> <br /> Bem Stiller is even the nasty guy like in "Meet Parents", but in this comic scenic movie are some compared with the title mentioned above. very poor and nothing special at all. With this well-paid actor these things might get a lot better - but these can be done when there's such a poor story and script. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10.
