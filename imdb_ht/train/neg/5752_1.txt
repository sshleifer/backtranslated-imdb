I do not always comment, but there are things that need to be said. Where to start ... <br /> <br /> The act, on Jeremy London's part was awful! I did not think it would be so bad. The plot was good, it was well directed, with a good solid performance from the lead actor. Unfortunately, this is one of those movies you read about and think it has great potential to be fun, but get disappointed from the start. <br /> Well, at least I got good laughs. I would not waste my time if I were you.
