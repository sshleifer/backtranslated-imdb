This is said to be a personal film for Peter Bogdonavitch. He based it on his life, but things change around fit the characters, who is detective. These detective dates are beautiful and have no problem. Sounds more like a millionaire playboy cinema than a detective, not it? This entire film was written by Peter, and it shows how to earn from real people. You should write down what you know, and he did so, indeed. Then leave the audience bored and confused, and jealous, for that matter. This is a curio for those who want to see Dorothy Stratten, who was killed right after filming. But Patti Hanson, who would, in real life, married Keith Richards, was also a model, like Stratten, but is a lot better and has a more adequate part. In fact, the part of Stratten seemed forced; added. It does not have much to do with the story, which is very complicated to begin with. All in all, every character in this movie is a very few people can relate to, unless you are millionaire from Manhattan and beautiful supermodels in your beckon call. For the rest of us, it's a chattering irrelevant chatter. This happens when you do not come from touching. You enjoy your few friends and jokes inside, and do the rest.
