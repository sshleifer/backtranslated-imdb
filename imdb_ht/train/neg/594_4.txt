I just rented creep and did not at all impress. I did not feel anything in this film. I felt sick because the gorter alone was shocking. <br /> I walked out of my living room several times in despair that something would happen with this movie. Have you not seen it all before? I did not like any of the characters Barrels guy in the cage sewer. I felt bad for her. But then again I could not think as to why he was still alive and not murdered by the Creep? So many questions need to be answered. Someone mentioned references to Silent Hill's PS2 game and I can see the wave of similarity. <br /> Not a bad movie, it's not a good one. judge for yourself.
