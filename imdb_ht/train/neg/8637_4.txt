More in a mystery movie and some hunger horror elements are thrown in; mediocre in general. <br /> It starts with a woman who has a nightmare in which her sex partner comes from bed, goes to the room of her weeping child and kills her. He wakes up. Then the man dies in a hospital, spit blood. Her daughter then came, and managed to contact her in her dream (I think), and she wants to find who killed her before her body entirely decomposed into her grave. mystery about who made it, or even how; Most viewers will figure out long before it reveals. I'm not sure how it was killed would really work. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the horror elements get in to: a gory autopsy, the recurring dream of the man killed the boy, a nightmare in which a patch of eggs turns into the eyes that are then , cuts, and several shots from the man to decompose both of the nightmares and actually in his grave. <br /> I was a little surprised to see a dedication to the end by Fulci for Clive Barker! Interesting.
