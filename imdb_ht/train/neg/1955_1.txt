This movie is so stupid it simply goes to the edge and becomes ridiculous. I wanted to look "dark down" actually and thought that this was the movie. Boy, what a mistake! I quickly send as much as I could and still I could not get rid of the boring moments. I'm just envious of people who have paid to play in or work on this movie. They actually donated money to this crap. Is not that amazing? I mean in this movie a man came to death and cut into a stick mill in small pieces of blood and a few minutes later the mother and the kid spoke calmly to the table as nothing happened and drank coffee. Please! Come! Who gives money for movies like crazy? Oh, and the "teeth-feather" were lame. Not afraid of all and it was obvious that it is a bold stuntman wearing a seriously done make-up.
