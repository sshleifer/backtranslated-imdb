As others have noticed, this criminal film is correct in painting it in the artist's life and I for one was very harassed and offended ... by its transformation into her rape in a tragic love affair, not by implication of her grapple was responsible for her talented awakening, by her complete respect for her work, by the way she turned her into an unknown object, over and over, you get the idea. Also, I find it disturbing that people who are not familiar with Gentileschi will see this film and walk away with that kind of impression in it.
