This is the worst ripple of Home Movies alone that I've ever seen! Watch Part 1 and two, but do not let anyone say that's better than the first two! I mean, really, you do not make a movie, then make an end with the same characters and actors, and then make another end with DIFFERENT characters and actors! I mean, it would be good if this does not have a "Home Own" movie, but made it a Home Movie by itself. Culkin is too old now, so you're supposed to stop Sense! Good, this movie makes me SIK! Buy part 1 and 2.
