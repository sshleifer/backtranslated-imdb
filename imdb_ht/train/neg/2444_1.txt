Two houses, one street, a telephone booth, a car, a girl next door, a boy next door with a zombie. This list of ingredients should be sufficient for a huge horror movie. All you need is some light blue, ambient music and ... do. Not in the hands of Dutch director Rouveroy van though! I love organizing "bad movie evening" from time to time. The concept is really simple: get some booze, find some movie-loving friends, and immerse yourself in the worst movie can be offered. For such an evening the peace of mind is one of the best. Ri guaranteed! The rare thing is, Van Rouveroy always defends his movie as if it was a great success. To be a witness this you will have to listen to the DVD's commentary. Again: unbelievers and laughs guarantee!
