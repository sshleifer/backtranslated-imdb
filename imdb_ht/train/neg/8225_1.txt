DO NOT have to expose this to a movie. I was wasting time with money on this and I'm very p ** sed off on it. The act is comparable to playing high school. The script is shocking. There is no draw. Twenty minutes from the end (which I believe I should be rewarded for) I had a headache of all the screaming, shouting and plain the five girls do. <br /> <br /> The majority of violence is (rare for a movie nowadays) suggests rather than graphically displaying but I found the characters so damned that I wanted to see them, and indeed every single person involved in making this piece s ** t, dead in the most terrible way possible. I spend more than ten minutes in my life saving you from a very poor one at you. Do not do that.
