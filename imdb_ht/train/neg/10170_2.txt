The championship game is only a couple of days away, but things in New Orleans are not as they should. From players with marital issues in excess of gambling problem drug in an assassin on the loose, life is getting in the way of what should be a memorable, wonderful time. Can things be put back in order with a killer stop before the great game is ruined? <br /> <br /> Despite what you might think when you first read about Superdome, this is not a soccer movie. In fact, football is nothing more than a trained device and a subsequent thought. Instead, Superdome is another of these soap opera-ich 70s made-to-TV movies populated with Hollywood having animals and those who will never be. Sleep is dropping his way into the thing that no one really is looking good. The best (or worst) example is Van Johnson in a very tiny role that generally loses as to why it's. The plot is dull, refreshing, and incredible. Donna Mills as a "man" hit? Yeah, right! It's as credible as the artifacts he has with liquor to soak David Jansen. The film also misses any speed. Try to find all four or five story lines in the movie whats that Superdome shed can have. With no drama or suspense in sight, Superdome ends up being a very poor example of a 70s-made movie-for-TV movie. Lone emphasized that I was the voice-over work from the end of Charlie Jones - a sportsbook I missed listening. The easy way to exercise the intrigue and subtype of the atmosphere in New Orleans is the pure cheese of its finest. Like most other people who saw Superdome, I also did that courtesy of Mystery Science Theater 3000. It may be one of KTMA's public access episodes, but it is one of the best examples of the early shows to start. So even if I was only rated Superdome a 2/10, I'll give this episode a generous 3/5 on my MST3K rating scale.
