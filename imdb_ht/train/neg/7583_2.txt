David's worst movie. Even 'In which we serve' was'nt as bad as this. Usually a movie that has a really good reputation as this one, there are at least some types of levies, which makes one understand why it might be considered a classic. But after watching this I just could not find why this piece of crap was loved very much back in 1945! I neglected the act, stiff over British handles, stories, script (which can be very witty at times, but totally unfunny) and bands. The elvira character is meant to be enticing and attractive, but it was in reality ugly reality and had a weird and annoying voice. Just another movie that convinced me is not trusting a movie reputation. Another very tricky "British british".
