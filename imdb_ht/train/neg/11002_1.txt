Hawked as the FAMILY INFORMATION, GUARANTEE TO OFFER ALL - GIVE WHAT? He worked, and I was offended by bribe out of this rent. Two friends and I were bored and decided to see if all the bull on the movie that we saw on television was true. Cursed Comedy Central and all other networks that push this garbage on us! It was by far the worst movie I've seen since Hollow Man. I generally avoid the people crazy, but sucked into this one. We have since beat the sting that suggests we rent it, and its privileges picking up being fired. There is nothing remotely funny about this movie ... even the "adventures of dickman" scenes were sophomoric at best .. Color me p *** ed. Thought maybe the production value was crap for some important reasons ... no..it just aspired. NEVER WATCH SA! for any reason. Not even with the abundant amount of illegal substance this movie would be funny. This says ALOT. Please, to love all that is holy, if you care for your sanity-never seen this movie. It's lots of things-stupid, pointless, and worthless to name a few. But the main thing he was aiming for: offensive-humorous he failed miserably. Crash and burn ....
