I do not know what other guys thought. The fact that this film itself has made it no less terrible. You can be as big as a believer as you want ... the majority of this movie is the idea of ​​a drivel. I feel I was insulted by watching the first 40 minutes of it. And alone there was no feat. Not only is the terrible act, but the plot is never even close to developing. There are countless holes in the story, to the point where you can hardly even call it a story again. I never read the book, so I can not criticize this, but this is the first review that I wrote here and its purpose is only to save all your viewers out an hour and a half of life you. I can not remember last time I could not even end up watching a movie. This one really takes the cake.
