"Cavemen" exceeded my expectations, and not in a great way. It was even worse than I thought it would be. Basically, here's the show: Cavemen are an alternate race, they face prejudice, etc. As well maybe the stupid idea ever created; almost being served in prison for the writers. A show featured cavemen went to a club, trying to pick up girls, and then nothing else happened. It was reminiscent of costing a 22 minute Andy Rooney dialogue, followed by death by stack knives across midget cannibals. For those who have not seen this show, here's an example of the dialogue: "You are sure to be okay and going out with a caveman." "Yeah, that's good. I've had such a 10 - mile!" Hilarious ... Maybe better writing I've ever witnessed. <br /> 22 minutes of cavemen and terrible makeup, tackling social difficulties ... Sounds like an entertaining night. I also love how bad the past ideas is that they're resorting to a sitcom from car insurance claims. I wonder if they're going to make Gecko next, so I can have a new title to show the worst I've ever seen. I would even say that this is worse than "Viva Laughlin." At least "Viva Laughlin" was torn off from something that was a bit inspiring. <br /> <br /> Show as this makes me hoping to have a comet up a place targeted for Earth. Disappointfully honestly ...)
