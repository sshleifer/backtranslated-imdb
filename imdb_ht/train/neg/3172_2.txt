This shoddily-made film, unoriginal melts. I love romantic comedy sometimes. A good look is like eating ice cream for dinner. It's not something you'll do all the time, but the experience is so fun that you can ignore how wise you are. This movie makes me think about how stupid I was to continue to stay seated forever to run it. Everything about it burst on the cheap. It actually seems to overexposed the film at certain points it is so outdoors. It has many CGI cheeses and blame sets, too. <br /> <br /> Writing was clunky. I know that you can usually expect some draws drawn into a vicious comedian, but you usually do not really care because you are laughing. This movie is so unfunny that you actually sit there and amazed about the easy range of coincidences and completely incredible behavior involved. The events were put in the movie just to move the characters from the next scene or to give exhibitions. Sure, this is how all movies work, but you should not notice that it happens. Inelegant. That's the theme I should use. There was almost no one in the movie who was really likable. I did not care that ended with that person, as long as they were all living hell away from me, and I did not have to listen to talk about it again. Why would the character really only cool in the movie, the character of Paul Rudd, wanting to have nothing to do with complicated bitchy, condescension, freak control played by Eva Longoria? Also, almost all of the characters involved are still taking the sleaziest solution in any situation. A right man pretend to be gay for five years just to hang out (and bath with) and a woman she is attractive to? The best feel-good moments could come and sneaked on a happy end for the same schmoe where she gets along with Rudd's equally bitterly lying, sly kleptomaniac? Lake Bell and Eva Longoria are very attractive, women are appealing. Perhaps they will find something better to look at down the road.
