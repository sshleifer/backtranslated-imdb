I do not even want to call this movie a movie - it's a movie that should not have any awards. The act was terrible as was the funny storyline. This is exactly the movie type how many people think of a NRI audience, but in fact hit abroad for its misfortune and the overwhelming sense of "trying" throughout the film. <br /> I find it strange that many actors are convinient and English has such a tight time to do that in the front of the camera. I'm sure many readers know what I'm talking about - all those English phrases are drawn to a movie, in Hindi and in regional movies for cool points. There are some Indian films in which the English looks completely genuine - Being Cyrus was a recent one. Although not a big movie, it was a good movie and the language did not seem to "put on". <br /> I feel ashamed that P3 gave the NFA in 2005. The only semi-enjoyable parties in this garbage were Konkana with a bit of catchy catchy Hatian. Other than that, do not even waste your time with this movie.
