If only to avoid doing this kind of movie in the future. This movie is interesting as an experience, but says no cogent story. One can feel virtuous to sit in it because it touches on many issues IMPORTANT but does it without any discernable motive. The viewer comes away with new perspectives (unless one comes with one while the one's mind wanders, as it will consistently do during this pointless movie). One can be better than the one time set out a window in a growing tree. <br /> <br />
