A little, simplistic, and short, GUN crazy (volume 1: a woman at hand now) goes nowhere. <br /> This short (just sixty minutes) story is not so much inspired by classic Western Spaghetti as it is a rip-off of Sam Raimi at the speed and the death (admitting it was to adopt the Western Spaghetti) bring in a contemporary setting. In QUICK & DEAD, Sharon Stone's character seeks revenge against the dastardly sheriff (played by Gene Hackman) who, when he was a hedgehog, put the fate of his father (a short kiss by Gary Sinise) ; he accidentally shot him at the top. In GUN CRAZY, Saki (played by Ryoko Yonekura's agile) is seeking revenge against Tojo's (played with minimal appeal by Shingo Tsurumi), who, when he was a hedgehog, put the fate of his father but it; He left his feet slipping into the clutch, and he liked father ole drawn and cantoneed by a semi truck. The only significant difference, despite the setting, is the fact that Tojo sadistically inflation Saki and ?? Well, I will not spoil that for you in case you decide to watch it. <br /> <br /> In short, Saki ?? An imitation speaks of 'man of Clint Eastwood man whose name' ?? rides in the city ?? Basically, there is an auto shop with a tavern along with a U.S. military base, so I guess that's enough for a town ?? rotten by Tojo, crimelord premises with a high ridiculous price on his head for reasons never explained or explored. Confessing himself as a bounty hunter, Saki takes over the area's gun in choreographing shootouts much more than a similarity than in the works of Johnny Pou and John Woo. Of course, at the end of the movie Saki has endured the fair amount of torture in the hands of the bad guys, but he got up on the occasion ?? on her knees, in an attempt to mock at a supposed supposed ?? and conquer all his enemies with a rocket launcher. <br /> <br /> Do not ask where it gets rocket launchers. Just watch it for yourself. Try not to laugh. <br /> <br /> The image quality is average for release the DVD. There is a good quality in several sequences, but all in all, this is not a bad transfer. The sound quality leaves a bit the imagination at times, but, again, it is not a bad transfer. <br /> Rather, it's a bad movie.
