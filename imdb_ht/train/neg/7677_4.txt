I stopped watching this episode because I thought Ana-Lucia and Libby's death was needed and really depressing. Then I found that they kept Libby around just to die in the next episode! Gah! I can not handle it. <br /> I liked this show for the first quarter, but it was definitely declining in the second quarter, I found Jack and Locke's little religious fraud to be annoying. The Deaths of Rodriguez & Watros' character was the last straw! <br /> I give this episode a 4/10, for being the end of my look in this great ancient series created by alloy legend J.J. Abram. I hope his series in the future will improve on this one.
