Most movies I can sit through easily, though I'm not particularly fond of the movie. I am the kind of person who recognizes big movie even though I do not like the genre. This is the first movie I could not stand to watch. Cat in the Hat is the worst movie I've ever seen - and I've seen a lot of movies. The act is okay (Myers is good as the cat, it's just that it's really annoying). The funny singing cats songs were boring and monotonous, even for children at the audience. The plot flies over and over, and viewers must suffer from poor dialogue. "Infected" parent remarks are disgusting, not funny (I note some awful comments on a field that has been compared with, well, a kind of person called a "ho"). Though the film is really short, it seemed to pass forever. Do not waste your time. I know kids who hate this film. If the kids can not stand it, I do not know how any adult can. I would like to smoke more on this movie but I do not even feel like wasting the time writing this review about it. I had it! So, in summary, do not spend 90 minutes in your life watching this! Watch a good movie! <br /> <br /> 1/10 stars - the lowest review I've ever provided to a movie.
