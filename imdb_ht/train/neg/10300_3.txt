I'm a fan of artistic movies, but sorry to relate this movie to be pretentiously drivel. Agonizingly slow to develop a non-existent plot based on a promising award, the experience is, we'll say, trying. Even after bad movies I feel that I have learned something, or enjoyed some aspects, but there was nothing to appreciate. Mostly it was not worthwhile, but the movie started and ended up. The act was OK, though the characters were utterly boring. For the protagonist to aim at an intrepid goal, it is terribly empty. Pity. I usually enjoy movies that are formulated, but lack of formula should not be confused with zero content.
