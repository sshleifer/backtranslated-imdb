I was interested in the subject, and only fans of the Drew Barrymore dancing to David Letterman's office will find anything remotely interesting in it. OK, it shows some breasts (or maybe a double body done). The scheme reduced in bits and the act is terrible. No lead has any materials to work and, as the direction of the film leads nowhere. Do not waste your time. Watch Donnie Darko instead if you want a Creepy Drew Barrymore movie, and if you want to see another, skip this and see Darko again. The treatment of the legendary Doppelganger is also absolutely criminal. Look at Charles Williams' novel "Down to Hell" for something worth considering instead. This is just an excuse to make a movie B to go straight to video and suck some life from those in blockbuster. What do any of these people think that acting here was cheering? Give me a break.
