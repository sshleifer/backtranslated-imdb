Why do I always do this for myself? I mean, really, it's right there in the title - "The Incredible Man Fusion". What else would I expect? I must admit, I'm a piston for just about anything I'm coming across the HD HD channel, but only the redesign feature of this picture should be that truly grotesque makeup works by Rick Baker's legendary. As for creepy, I'll give the nod to horny old couple geezer sucking on lemons just before light out. Now they were really scared. Something I never could figure out in horror flickers was why a monster's victim would not simply just run away when faced with virtual venues. Like the chick in the cabin. You know, there was a completely visible door right there in the kitchen that he could run right out at any time. Incredible Steve-O could not pull more than an animated walk, so why not just blow it right by him? I do not know, maybe I miss something. <br /> <br /> This flicker has some of the feeling of a 'story from the crypt episode' but 'Tales' usually had a cool twist or grotze that often times you did not see coming . This was a picture that you could not properly find a handle on coming OR going. For example, in an early stage, you can clearly make out that the eyeball Man Fusion dropped out of his head, so how did he manage to get around for the rest of the story? I guess we should not ask. At eighty four minutes, this photo was about an hour and a half too long. When it was all over, I was ready to take General Perry on his earlier suggestion - "I could really use a drink now".
