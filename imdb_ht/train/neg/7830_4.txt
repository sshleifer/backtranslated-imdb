So far Nightmares and Dreamscapes were irregular and irritating. The first segment, directed by Brian Henson, can offer little in the way of telling groundbreaking stories or real crises, but at least it has been well-directed, thrilling, and visually interesting, and solidly acting by William Hurt and very impressive special effects for a mini-set. <br /> However, the second story of the series was just obnoxious, and not in the right way. The simply is bad, requiring funds, impossible to act inogilably in order to move the plot, and whose ramble characters are endlessly for the purposes of clunky, the necessary display. The act is overdone and convinient, and I felt far more sympathy for a cold-blooded assassin in the first story than for the newlywed couple in the second. The director uses a million tricks to try to make the narrative spooky, but with acting and writing, the end result seems like a film-year film school project, with camera moving for their own sake, and little by the way in draw or tension. <br /> If the rest of the series continues like this, I will seriously let down. I look at the advancement of William H. Macy's installation, and hope he becomes a decent director and senarist for his segment. So far the quality is far consistent for predicting either way.
