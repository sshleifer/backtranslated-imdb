Oh my dear, Oh dear. I started looking at this does not know what to expect. I could not believe what I saw. There were times when I thought it was a comedy. I liked how the government's plans to capture terrorist leaders are when the one drop, one who is unarmed, and expect him to capture it and escape with a rocket package. If only it was really that easy. I finally found a movie that was worse than "Plan 9 From Exterior Space".
