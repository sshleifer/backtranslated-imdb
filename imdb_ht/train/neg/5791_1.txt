As a native movie teacher, I can honestly say that this is perhaps one of the worst films and native content that I've ever seen. I'd rather find a root channel than to see this movie again. The use of stereotypes, legitimate attempts to use portions of traditional coyote history and poor camera work have only been worsened by the uncreative storyline globe and malicious script. The writers and directors have appeared to be part of the worst part of a colonized approach to show their native and community. If this person is native, they need to go home and apologize to everyone they know for being an apple and for the racial and poor racial sense of humor that they have developed. If this person is not native, they need to seriously re-examine white privileges and ask themselves if they show racism unreasonably, without intentional or if they intentionally are ignorant. My only hope is that the authentic actors in this movie had a good time and at least paid for their efforts. If you want to see good native movies then check out: Christmas in the Clouds, Dancing Me Out, River Medicine, PowWow Highways, Smoke Signs ... to name just a few.
