This show has nice good stories, but bad dialogue. The main character was especially annoying. It is quite obvious why this show was canceled, although, like most UPN shows, I never knew it existed until it was in re-run union. <br /> <br /> Most of it's plots seemed to be copied from other shows and movies, leading me to think the producers did not have an original idea of ​​themselves. <br /> I have not commented enough. You had at least ten lines of text. The special effect was not bad for a 2001 show. <br /> <br /> The Gnome was a beautiful character.
