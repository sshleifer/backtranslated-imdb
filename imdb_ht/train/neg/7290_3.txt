What a long, drawn-out, freaky movie. I'm sure this historically this movie is delightful, but as entertainment goes it just does not make the class. Ralph Fiennes was in some fantastic movies, English Language Learners, Schindler's List, but this one was like a kite-down. It does not seem to be going anywhere, his character at the beginning was so deep and angry it amazes me that his "sister" would have been interested in all. Do not bother paying rent this movie, buy yourself a copy of the English Patient instead.
