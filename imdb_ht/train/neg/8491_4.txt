Despite some original occasional touches, such as the "virtual sets" that provide the background for the Victorian interiors featuring Ada Lovelace and her circle, this movie falls short and finally disappears. Newcomer Francesca Faridany looks talent, but is wasted as Emmy, a non-film-driven character is reduced to nothing more than a monitor watching Lady Ada tells an autobiography. Conceiving Ada takes a while when Lady Ada (Tilda Swinton) appears; The pair of pictures on his face expression, styling, even making it appear to be translucent or invisible moments, leads to dramatic scenes of "virtual" rendering of it. <br /> <br /> A straight biopic of Ada Lovelace would have been worthwhile, but this movie unfortunately has a shock in both Lady Ada's life, and that of a modern-day computer scientist (and it's widely-drawn, doltish companion).
