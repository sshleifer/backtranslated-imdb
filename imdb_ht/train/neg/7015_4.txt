"54" is a film based on the "Studio 54" infamous in the 1970s - the hangout for social elites and club parties. In the movie, Ryan Phillippe is the main character, based on a current employee of Studio from 1977 - 1982. <br /> <br /> The movie problem is that it's all glittering with style and no substance. It tries to make a really disgusting satire and probe like "Boogie Nights" but finally comes across as an inferior wannabe. Mike Myers gives the job thanks to playing cocaine-snorting club owner Steve Rubell. It's just a little funny role and if this was my best attempt at sliding in drama like Lemmon and other comedian actors in their time, it's a total failure. <br /> <br /> "54" could be insightful and interesting, but instead it's just another mute dumb girl who is not entertaining or even remotely engaged. Look at your own dangers.
