The film was made in 1942 and World War 11 around, the film industry decided to capitalize on the fact that the spies were around. The film is fun to watch due to the fabulous dance at Eleanor Powell. Miss Powell's last name was certainly a big one in every sense of the word. It is again fun with a very young looking Red Skelton here. Two of them also starred in "I Dood It." Moroni Olsen, who 3 years later, was superb as the police officer of "Mildred Pierce" again appeared as an officer asking Powell to deliver an article. The problem is that Olsen and his rogue are really Japanese spies. Bert Lahr is her usual brighter here and she gets enough support from Virginia O'Brien.
