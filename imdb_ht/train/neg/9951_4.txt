Johnny and Jeremy are vampires of sorts. Less defensive, of course. They are dark, bitter animals and nothing better than to spread their own misery. Through the charms (ie a sharp tongue and a fat wallet, respectively) they seduce desperate souls, who are continuing in torment and victim. This is more or less the basis of this black comedy, as I understand it. <br /> It's not a mixture of black humor that I can easily subscribe to, in part because it bothers me to imagine the rooting audience for slaughter, the main character. I enjoyed, however, the sound and the melody of the rapid-fire (and supposedly very witty) remarks. I was very impressed by the great cast iron, particularly David Thelis; Only the character of Jeremy seemed too dimensional. The photography and music, both dramatic and somber, work very well together. <br /> <br /> What really turned me about "naked" (and the main reason I never recommended it to anyone) is the way it repeatedly seems to introduce misogyny as a valid way to prevent one bitterness. In other words, in a world that sucks so badly, what is the difference it does if one involves some pain on the girl, right? To suggest (as some have on this website) that Johnny is not so embarrassed by someone because it's not as rough about girls like Jeremy, looks completely absurd to me. They're both horrible, nasty people. And they're particularly keen on wounded women every single time they get a chance. One could argue that Johnny eventually gets what he deserves, as if his bad kama suddenly knocks back and bit it into the ass. But still, her sadistic behavior with Jeremy is treated to a certain degree as a laughing matter. And I would be wrong, but I guess that most people who absolutely love this movie also find that the movie aspect of dangerous films.
