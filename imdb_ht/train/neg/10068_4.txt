A sympathetic cowboy the combat of a nearby Indian tribe was accused of rape and murder of the prince's daughter, leading to much hatred and violence. <br /> This feature crackpot nudie is fun to look at, though quite impossible to defend on any artistic level. The costumes are terrible and the fact that all the Indians are obviously white, making this look more like a cartoon action than the serious production that it's pressured to press it to be. <br /> <br /> In short, the luxurious nudity (the real reasons for watching this) are good. Everything else is not. There are definitely better examples of both genres. <br /> <br /> More interesting is that the Ramrodder was filmed in the quiet Queen Spahn movie and features not one, but two members of the Manson family, Catherine Share and Bobby Beausoleil, who were probably already in the case of murder at the time this hits the soda-attached screens in the Pussycat Theater!
