This is terrible God. The story was all over the place and more often than not I was confused because of terrible corruption. I do not feel any sympathy for anyone because the characters have not developed enough. There were many non-supreme non-dimensional. Cheese, cheese stereotypes and subplots that have gone nowhere. The stripper chick was just a distraction, though he was decent looking. I do not know what was tried to be, but how shock I was when they showed this garbage on Sundance? I almost cancel my subscription. You would think of a channel like that would show more movie quality. There are many, many best gay and lesbian movie themes out there. "Closet of Celluloid" is an excellent documentary. I enjoy the "Wigstock: Movie". I'm sure others have slipped my mind at this time, but what I'm trying to say is that this just was not worth it. If you keep it on TV, ok, but otherwise do not bother. <br /> There were perhaps three or four shots that seemed really nice (sad I can count them on one hand), otherwise the cinematography was very neatly too. The lighting went to a lot of places. I think some of the effects are used to try and add to something that just has practically nothing to go for it. <br /> I can not refuse Johnny Rebel is very hot (without the blond hair course). Too bad he did nothing for me. Wood and real porn, friends. <br /> <br /> 3/10.
