American Pie goes a long distance from the first. At first I believe the actors do not have a sign of what to do and instead it's just a remake of a college go dark. History sets out as two new year college guys (featuring young helicopters) outing their dreams of going to college just to experience late night parties, sex and cocktail. The plot is stupid and comes off the road away from the original pie. In fact they did not once again present an apple pie somewhere in the movie. <br /> <br /> Luck I work in a video store and can rent for free. But please note it's a waste of time unless you enjoy sexually explicit sex movies with absolute nausea and crazy drink. I'm a teenager myself and I believe even Evan who might have been a better choice instead.
