The action of this movie beat Sunny bhai in Gadar. Akshay Kumar owned the producers of Leonidus in the 300, Neo Matrix along with Spiderman and Superman. It is hilarious. Except for the typical Akshay Kumar and Anil Kapoor comedy I can not see anything positive in this film. The story looks like the writer told his 10yr old son to write. The movie is so real that Anil Kapoors long range shooting with a shotgun is the least most mistaken by the director. Except for Tashan directors to make this movie no other Tashan. I'm sorry to waste my money on this movie and I would not recommend it to anybody. 1/10 is the smallest I can give on IMDb or I would give it a zero.
