This film has some great visual noirish / neorealist, and tells a story that's starred in Hollywood's sugar-coating, which was only possible because it was essentially an independent film film. But some of the scenes go on for too much too long (the wedding, especially), and I have found the dialogue to act and unrealistic for the most fit for the step to the silver screen. was mostly distracted, and it seemed to get worse as the movie went on. Most of the characters were either Italian-American or Italian immigrants living in New York in the twenties and thirty, but the dialogues sounded as they practiced lines for Shakespeare's play while mixing cement and brick laying. At the end I was laughing, and not because the filmmakers wanted me. I guess the stilted poem can defend by saying that the characters would have spoken Italian, and the dialogue is a literal translation of how they would really talk. But it absolutely did not work for me. <br /> Another line of dialogue made me laugh for a different reason: the son of the main character, born and raised in New York in the 1920s, suddenly picks up a beautiful British accent lilting. I only guess this was something to do with the fact that the movie was made in England. <br /> I give this movie an 'A' for effort and intent, but a considerably lower cost for execution.
