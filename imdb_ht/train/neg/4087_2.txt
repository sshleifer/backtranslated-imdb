I usually talk a bit about the plot in the first part of my review, but in this movie there's really not much talk about. Just a mish-mash of other Swords best sword & spice groceries. The lack of cohesiveness runs rampant as a banality. Even the main villaness refuses to wear other clothes then a hipster is very boring as it pretty much has a chest of a young boy. Gently entertaining at it's incompetence in the best and severe retarded of it's worst. Lucio Fulci was scratching the bottom of the barrel here and it shows. <br /> <br /> My Class: D- <br /> <br /> Extras DVD: Poster & Gallery Styles; Lucio Fulci Bio; and the US & International Theater Trailers <br /> <br /> Candy eyes: Sabrina Siani is topless at all (some may consider appealing, I did not); The various topless supplements as well
