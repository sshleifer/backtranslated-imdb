My kid makes better videos than that! I feel torn off at the $ 4.00 spent leasing this thing! There is no date on the video case, apparently designed by Wellspring; and, what's even worse, there is no production date for the original movie listed anywhere in the movie! The only date given is 2002, leading a tenant who is unlikely to believe he will receive a recent film. This movie was so bad in being outdated and irrelevant for any period of time, but precisely when it was done, I wondered that anyone would take the time and expense of his walk as a video. It might be interest for students to study counter-culture in the 1960s, anti-war, anti-establishment, melody, turn-on and dripping culture; but when you read in the video case, there is no hint that is what you are getting. If you make mistakes in renting it though, it is probably best seen while on drugs, so that your idea will best match the wavelength of the minds of the directors, Fassbinder and Fengler. Whatever your state of mind while watching it, I can tell you that it does not get any better after the first scene; So know that, I'm sure you will soon sleep long before the end.
