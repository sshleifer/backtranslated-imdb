Until this time new I was a great 'Little Mosque' fan. However, the new season was absolutely RUINED it. The new Christian vicar has destroyed the entire intent of the show. It was always about living together to overcome prejudice. The new crushed vicar is cited and shows Christians in a very bad light. <br /> I am neither Christian nor Muslim but loved to watch the show and see the camaraderie between Amar and the Reverend. There is no more. <br /> Just cancel it and be done with it. It is not worth any more. <br /> <br /> It might still save, but a lot of changes would need to be done. <br /> <br /> Bring back the old format.
