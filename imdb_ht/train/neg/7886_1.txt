I have nothing against religious cinema. Religious people need something to look on a Saturday night, I guess. But what really ticks me off is when the writing-up on the DVD box does not indicate this fact to the potential viewer. Passing through religious propaganda as entertainment is NOT fresh, bro. <br /> And even though I was a religious person, I should agree with most of the other posters here, this movie was a mess. Poze directed, wrongly, poorly edited, and the attempt at a band was hilarious. The fake accents were terrible, the characters were mostly esteemed, and the continuity came from the window. The only reason we sit in this littery waste time was that it was too late to watch another movie instead. They should just go to bed. <br /> <br /> Absolutely no kind of redefining this movie, unless you are the kind of religion that will immediately endorse anything that will preach your beliefs to the unbelievers, even though it's a pile of garbage. If not, avoid this at all costs. Do not be deceived by the writing box.
