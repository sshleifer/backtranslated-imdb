Another FINE effort by one of the most influential movies. His knowledge of the racist topic is STAGGERING, and IMPRESSES me over more than one level. The acquisition that Lee is really just a little racist, a poisonous dwarf that opportunistically exploits the Hollywood's Affirmative Action System to make movies of inferior quality is Nonsense pronounced, only propaganda right wing. The very core that Lee would resort to the current climate change in political equality in America in order to produce hate-filled anti-white cinemas is simply FALSE and RADIO. Some of Lee's opponents even go so far away As suggests that GOTB is glorified African-American, while putting down other races: obviously, another FALSEHOOD is distributed by people who are against peaceful culture between different races in America and elsewhere. The film is a long dialogue early in between the Black Republican people and others on the bus. The opinions presented by this man are simply WRONG - all across the board. 100% UNTRUE.

If someone disagrees with your political views, you simply apply violence and throw it to the bus. I thought the movie said "get on the bus" ...? Apparently, Mr.Lee is for segregation buses after all, meaning no different than those kun kkk before it: the bus is only for those blacks in line with the Democratic Party's line of thought. So much to "free the slaves ..." <br /> <br /> The end of the credits: "This movie was entirely funded by black people." And distributed and marketed by a great Hollywood studio run by Jewish and white people who Farrakhan desperate ...
