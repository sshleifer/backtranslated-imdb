I am so confused. What's the world's movie about? What was the killer motivation? It seemed quite mad, but I still have to figure out why. Nothing in this movie has made sense. It has zero depth. Or less than zero depth. Which I guess would make it a mountain. Or a pile. In crap. The act was terrible. When I was digging for some of the actors in this movie, they were in very few things that I had heard of, and came as absolutely no surprise. I can not decide if they feel sorry to be embarrassed to be in this bad movie, or they feel they should never offer another job to act. Start. . . NOW! (References Seinfeld.) Really, though, do not waste your time with that. There are little substance that nothing has just done to make fun. This was undoubtedly one of the worst slasher flicks - NO, one of the worst cops in any KIND, that I had never had to worry, and I saw quite a few.
