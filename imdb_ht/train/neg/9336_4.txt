Maliciously-made "blaxploitation" crime-drama targets outright in the black urban market in the early 1970s. Pam Grier star in the title role, that of a nurse who becomes a one-woman vigil after ill-drugs-making Coffy's sister a junkie. Violent nonsense plods along doggedly, with energy and cats' arts; Only the Grass stitched grille gives narrative a jolt (it's not much of an actress here, but it connects with the audience in a principal way). Not much different from what Charles Bronson did at the moment, the movie was marketed and released as crab exploits again still managed to find a minded interior-city audience. Today, however, it's merely a score of '70s film film, and missing the wide-range appeal of other movies in this genre. * 1/2 from ****
