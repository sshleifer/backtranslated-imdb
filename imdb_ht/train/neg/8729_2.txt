This is a thriller with a good concept, good acting, good photography and good intentions around, but which is confused and discouraging in execution. <br /> <br /> Garcia star like John Berlin, a LA law detective who moved to a small California town at a friend of his friends on the force. He soon gets involved in the investigation into a insolent murder that leads to his theory about the existence of a serial killer that no one else believes in. The victim's victim known to be blind, leading to a romance and a blind girl - believe to be a witness - in a nearby school for the blind. Although an intriguing storytelling had too many proportions and draws holes in this film where I found myself asking, 'how hell did we wind up here? 'or' how did we get this out? ' I found it confusing and disoriented, despite good acting, etc. John Malkovich has a small part toward the end as a F.B.I. investigators from finding Berlin. <br /> <br /> Do not recommend.
