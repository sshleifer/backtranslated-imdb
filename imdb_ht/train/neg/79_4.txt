The original book of this was set in the 1950s but will not make for the TV series because most people look for the 1930s style. Ironically, the tubular tube near the end of a 1950s train was painted to look like a 1930s train so the underground can also play in this game. Hanging the storyline on a draw on the Jarrow March was weak but the 50s version had students who started thinking about the world around them so I supposed they thought they thought about the poverty of the hogs are the same thing. The thing about Japp that has to be provided for itself was too weak but was putting something to fill the time. This would make a half hour half hour or could have filmed the book and made it a better long show. It is obvious this episode is a victim of content style.
