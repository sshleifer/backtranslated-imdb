This movie is bad news and I'm really surprised at the level of great name talent that would ever agree and looks like a piece of junk like this. I imagined there were a few instamine agents sprawled across Hollywood Blvd. as a result of this exclamation. What really gets you is that it could be good. The star's director's appeal and the subject had enough interesting fillings and ticket sales, but this is a flop. The multiple story lines all go from bad to unusual by the end of photos, and you end up feeling like a mouse in a maze looking for a piece of cheese that turns out to be rotten. What Spike is able to achieve is to revenge against any Italian who may be beaten up when he was a kid or insulted him, as the movie does well a number of obsolete perrpetuating and probably offensive Italian stereotypes. Like any Spike Lee movie some have really thought to induce and magic camerawork. He makes the gift of grabbing your psyche and transporting you into his vision if only for a few memorable performers. But the question remains ... you can endure the other 2 hours of scratch and clock clock as you ask and wait for the finish that has to be somewhere.
