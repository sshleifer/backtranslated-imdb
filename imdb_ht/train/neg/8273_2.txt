A lot of promises and nothing more. An all-star cast is certainly not standard HK, but oh oh people are one that's a stinker. No history? This is okay, the action will make up for it as most HK action flicks. What? The action is terrible, blow, and rarity? The last Dragon Dynasty up to this point is not with great superb and generally considered classic in Asian movies. This is a drying. They managed to control a couple of actors from hellish affairs, but they can not bring life into a disjointed script. There are scenes of dialogue where two or three lines are spoken with a cut in between and there is no continuity of what the characters are saying. You almost feel like they're each giving a monologue running and just ignoring the other characters. Michael Biehn was born in wood, really? Sammo Hung uses a double stunt? There is no way. Yes way. Stay away.
