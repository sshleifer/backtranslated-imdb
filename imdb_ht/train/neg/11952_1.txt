His first film after John Belushi's longtime death, Aykroyd shows a lot of fatigue trying to draw on a character that would have a snap for Belushi. <br /> Instead, "Detroit Doctor" gives us Bookish teacher Aykroyd masquerading as a weird, violent pimp Ward of a rival known only as the mother. That's bad enough, but it also has classes taught, a school dinner organized, four lady in the evening to protect and dinner a pimp (or something like that) to attend. No wonder Aykroyd looks stupefied most of the time. Why should the viewer be alone? <br /> It was on this movie that Aykroyd met future wife Donna Dixon. At least some good came out of this mess chaotic. <br /> One and a half stars. You want good Aykroyd, see "The Blues Brothers". You want to go wrong, see "Doctor of Detroit".
