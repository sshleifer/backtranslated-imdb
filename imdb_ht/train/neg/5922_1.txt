My mom holds a tape in this movie as a general threat to anyone who loves film that annoys her. Everything about it feels. <br /> As so it is a true classic. <br /> <br /> Who gave it 10/10? Have you been inadvertently watching a good movie and accidentally voted for this one? <br /> <br /> Everyone involved in the movie making processes should be forced to look at least a small section of this movie. It should be an indelible task on the minds of all that keeps sacred films and be revered as the tide of the cinematic turmoil.
