This movie is another on my list of movies not to bother with. Seeing her 40 years ago as a teenager, stayed late, she was very annoyed to find that she was about 95% of romance, 4% of everything, 1% of her stories. That's what I call a movie bait and change, one with an interesting title, the actual movie is a scam. This is a topic that deserves a good cinematic treatment, this movie is almost a joke to those who served. The real members of Lafayette Escadrille were not on the run out of the law nor were the products of abusive homes, they were in fact idealist who wanted to do something to help France. And I suspect many of them came from a more background higher than the Tab Hunter character. Flying school is not for the smartest ones and knows it all, someone like the one described here would not have been two days ago, it would either be the stockade or the infantry. Discipline of the French Army was often rather fierce. In short, another Hollywierd version of a historic episode that deserves proper treatment.
