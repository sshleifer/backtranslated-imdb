Clint Eastwood is Bronco Billy, leader of a Wild West Troop, one of six regular misfits that has a touristic show that has difficulty breaking down. The seventh member of the bunch is a woman, Billy's assistant, but these women never last long, and the position is chronically open. Join Antoinette Lilly (Sandra Locke's Eastwood girlfriend at the time). It looks like Miss Lilly, as Doc (Scatman Crothers) calls it, is a heir-be he who will only receive his father's real estate since he's married when he turns 30, so on the eve of birthdays he gets into the cartoonish Geoffrey Lewis. <br /> So what's this movie scheme? It's hard to say. There's the romantic tension between Billy and Miss Lilly, but the problem is that for the first half of the movie it's so haughtily insupid and detestable that when it suddenly gets 'one of the holes' half of the movie, it's not just incredible but The past audience cares about it. There is chronic depth behind the Wild West show, but this topic does not touch enough enough to really be stereotyped in the film. Miss Lilly's situation has been blocked in rural westerns, cut off from the gases that fuel his life spoiled by luxury (it was mistaken to believe that he was killed by his family and the press). But are we really supposed to believe he could not return to New York and fortune expecting him to give him a little effort? <br /> No, this movie point out that Billy is the leader of a family, a lovable bunch of losers hanging together in thick and thin. This is a hot, movie movie? or at least try to be. <br /> <br /> Along the way, Clint shows us his skills with a gun, even foiling a bank robbery in a shoot that is grotesquely out of place in a relatively non-violent movie. One of the gangs was arrested on an old draft brokering charge; Billy bribes sheriff premises. Temple show is burning down; An orphanage makes them a new one. But many inconveniences do not make a conspiracy. <br /> <br /> Compounding the problem is to act, or lack thereof. Aside from Cratmans Scatman, cast in support is quite amateur. Eastwood is not on top of his game either, though it seems best simply by virtue of being surrounded by such a bumpy substandard. <br /> <br /> And for all this, the movie slips on for 116 minutes. To what extent? Good Questions ?? <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10
