Disney goes to the one quite too many times as anybody who saw the original LITTLE MERMAID will feel flagrantly torn off. Celebrate the birth of their daughter Melody, Ariel and Eric plan on introducing it to King Triton. The celebration is quickly crashed by the Ursula sister, Morgana who plans to use Melody as a defense tool to find the King's Trident. Stop the attack, Ariel and Eric build a wall around the sea while tunes grow up wondering why it can not go there. <br /> <br /> Angry and terrible is what describes this direct to the end of Windows. LITTLE MERMAID 2 gives you the feeling that everything you watched seemed to have come up to Disney's other movies. I guess Disney can only plagiarize himself! Do not tell me that the penguin and walrus do not remind you of another duo from the LYON king! <br /> <br /> Other disappointing moments include the rematch between Sebastien and Louie, the royal chef. They are terribly down playing it! The bigger point between Morgana and everyone seemed to have another deception. <br /> I will not give anything away, but in 75 minutes, everything seemed incredibly cramped and too busy. An embarrassment at Disney, LITTLE MERMAID 2 is best left to rent and laugh at. Then you can prepare for the rest of the Disney sequel to drown you in later on.
