Be warned: Neither Zeta-Jones nor McGregor play the main part as the poster would have you believe. Roles are in fact minor. The movie is driven seriously by dramatically exaggerated and realistic drama, and neither they really engaged. Especially I find it impossible to lure many sympathies for the main protagonist, not to mention his greedy friends, and gender-induced fianc√©. The plot drags terribly, and I turn this one off after 2/3 - strangely for me, as I like to finish what I start. The good act and nice surroundings take it from 1 to 2 stars. <br /> <br /> 2/10
