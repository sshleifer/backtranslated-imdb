What's with Indonesia music movies? I never saw Indonesia movie music like that made in Bollywood. They lack the spirit of the story and just a bunch of 'so-called' poetic lines. <br /> This story about love of two children is separated and then encountered again after a few years of change no special remarks. It's a simple story scheme (but it's quite focused though) and 'meant to be' stories story music here and there. <br /> <br /> Confusion character that should be saved by acting brighter overlooked. The main actress can try to live the character, but it's the best that she can do, trying. As for the filing, I do not feel the need to put a student in this story and of course, not just the characters needed. <br /> <br /> The strange thing is, why would I want to watch this movie? Perhaps because of the mangoes ...
