Covering the title, titles and very little print printing at Power of Prayer tricked me into renting this movie. <br /> It started out really well and pulled me in. I loved it. Between 1/3 and 3/4 of it, the film began to send in things that were not set up, it makes no sense. First, I thought, "This is not the one who knows how to tell a story." I ended up looking at the movie part, thinking I had missed something. <br /> <br /> Since I got to the last 1/5 of the movie, it was all boring, annoying, faith-loving dialogue there was no sense, said nothing, and was annoying for listen; I turned on the sound and made a fast forward in the end. <br /> Do not waste time with this flicker. <br /> <br /> Beware of DVDs labeled Whitlow Movie and Productions Path Level. <br /> And I'm a Catholic practicing.
