A less-than-subtle sting in the beliefs and teachings of the Catholic Church gives a shorter shadow of death near the end of the show. Throughout the show, black humor plays a medium in which many have often heard the speeches being asked, especially "If God is so good, why does it allow evil to exist in the world?" Diane Keaton is excellent in her role as an exaggerated version (though some might agree) to stereotyping religious teachers who sprout "the company line" and condemned half the world burned in hell. To celebrate his 25th anniversary, he invited his first students to return and make Christmas Page. However, when Quartet's "play update" quartet for teaching is located Sister Mary's parody, pushing on the edge, throwing the spiral story into a chain of happy events. The end finally left the audience with a sick heart at heart. <br /> <br /> Do not recommend. Go look to the play instead.
