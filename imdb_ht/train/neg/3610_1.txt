A patient escapes from a mental hospital, killing one of his guards and then a university professor after leaving his way to the local college. The next semester, the late Profit replacement and a new group of students have to deal with a new batch of killings. The dialogue is so tricky it is hard to believe that I could predict lines of quotes. This is one of these cheap movies that has been thrown along among the slasher era in the '80. Despite killing the heroine off, this is just substandard junk. Terrible acting, scary scriptures, terrible effects, horrible terrible horrible !! "Splatter University" is just the gunk set in your VCR when you have nothing better to do, although I suggest watching your own tape clean, which would be more fun. Skip her with rent "Nite the girl out" instead. Rated R for Strong Violence Graphic, Profanity, Nudity Letters and Sexual Situations.
