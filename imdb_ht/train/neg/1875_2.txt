The first, I really love Henry Crazy, which puts me in a pool of films in the movie. Parker Posey is one of the best actresses on screen today. But this movie was a full-flown travesty. Watching Hartley and the actors talk about the movie of their extras - so full of pride, and making anonymous star wars - was stomach-turning. This hype on the part of producers (HDNET) has achieved the max. A true example of the Emperor and his new clothes. Especially I feel that Hal was spoiled by HENRY FOOL forever. I do not think I can ever see her again in her pure, innocent light. <br /> <br /> Remember Hal, you may be some of the few people in the time ... etc. The director should nowhere if all he has done was to get rid of garbage. Unfortunately, it is a better example of the lesson taught in ADAPTATION film. The story must be interesting and active, or hope that its box-office is tenth true. Never mind a decent story. For the actors, he was like trying to act in a straitjacket. The note, I believe Hartley's, is flavor. With hitting drum drives all over dialogue. There was one Apple Soundtrack I recognized that gave me a smile. <br /> <br /> When I saw the trailer, I thought, oh, they're just trying to grab a new audience. But it's really this ridiculous ride. I would be happy to spoil this movie for you, but it did. It rotten. Franchise the FOOL dies. Long live Henry crazy.
