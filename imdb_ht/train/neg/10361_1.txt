This ABC straight-to-TV failure absolutely has no justice in the fabulous novel that is a rip off of time. Madame Madeleine L'Engle brought children and adults alike into a magical, fabulous and original world like no author in front of it. This novel, the first of its 'Quartet time', is a wonderful take on life, the universe, and time itself. But it's easy for any children or adolescents to understand. Unconditional morals are prevalent throughout the book. This film adaptation can be seen as nothing but a mockery of Mrs. L'Engle's work in art. Honestly, what were they thinking? Effect to look cheap and ridiculous, the plot is clogged and unmatched, the dialogue is far-fetched and just about every feature of the novel's novel was lost. This was a horrible attempt at bringing this book to the screen. I sincerely hope that one day an intelligent, deserved director (Guillermo del Toro, David Yates, Alfonso Cuar√≥n) made another attempt to bring this book on the screen and understand it for what it really is: a masterpiece. This adaptation can only be done with boring, fake and cheap motel-room art that holds no ground and does absolutely no impact on its audience.
