Before I started, I _love_ Eddie Izzard. I think it is one of the funniest-ups around today. Maybe that means I'm going to join this with too high expectations, but I just did not get Eddie funny in this outing. <br /> I think the main problem is Eddie trying too hard to be Eddie. Everyone knows it as a completely irritating comic, and we all love it for her. But in Circles, it seems they will go more for any irrelevant than funny, and completely lose me in places. Many of the topics she covered had previously been covered - I even thought I recognized a few recyclable jokes. <br /> <br /> If you buy the DVD you will find a rear-stage look at Eddie's trip (interesting in places, but not very funny), with a French language version of one of its shows. Death-hards will enjoy Eddie in a different language, but comedy subtitled is not very funny. <br /> <br /> If you're a fan of Eddie you've either got this already or you're going to buy it whatever I say. If you're just passing through, buy glories or dresses to kill - you will not be disappointed. And dry, you probably will be.
