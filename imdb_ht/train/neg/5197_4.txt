Drink into the Bulldog Drummond series, with John Howard in the role. Usually usually funny and antics, but not much to draw. Barrymore gets something to do as the inspector, swapping disguises following Drummond, Algy, and Tenny on a wild goose run (especially in the circle, perhaps the budget was tighter than normal) to rescue Phyllis, who was born imprisoned by those who want to lure Drummond into his bankruptcy. For those who keep score, in this one, Drummond is planning to ask Phyllis to marry her and Algy is worried about Missing Baby's Baby. It's fun to see Algy and Tenny dress up as the sailor mix of the Angler's rest, but little of it rises above the comic.
