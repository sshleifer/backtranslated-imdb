You would not expect a movie like this to be good, and it is not. It's no budget, ultra violent movie-filmed movie with a bad looking hand-held camera ... and it's hilarious. Actors are obviously never acted before and it shows in their terrible bride reading. There is no scheme to be seen. The little draw I could get seemed to be that a government experience escaped with a group of zombies seems to terrorize a couple of families. The weakest effects are actually some of the most sick I've ever seen. It looks like the gore effects are invading a stuffy store for all body parts, and many scenes involve zombie handmade people and eating the organs. It's a funny and disgusting movie, and it's about as bad as you can get in terms of any movie. <br /> Rating: BOMB / ****. 90 minutes.
