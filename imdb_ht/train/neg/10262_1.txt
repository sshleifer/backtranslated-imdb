Now I flicked over this just out of curiosity and kept watching - in the same way that you look at a car crash .. <br /> <br /> I appreciate the fact it's a parody, but This should not stop me from criticizing God-terrible direct, acting with dialogue. Seriously, this is rated as one of the poorest movies I've seen - it looked more like an episode of Tales from the Cryptkeeper, and a poor one ... <br /> Okay - a few critics (1) When the doctor had his heart attack before the monster (we never saw the monster attack, so we assume a heart attack), the army then launched shells, rockets, bullets in the monster - which feet from the doctor - yet the doctor is not touched by any missile and still alive (2) army attacks from about 100 yards away, and we see an incense flame used - geez, things have a set of no more than 30 meters! (3) when the monster tries to take the teacher, the soldiers enter the classroom and the fire on the ceiling; The kid drops the kid, and the soldiers do not try to shoot the monster ??? come on! (4) The monster seems to be something from Power Rangers! (5) has a scene where the five "good guys" (the priest, the girl, the doctor, the reporter and the kid) all look shocked and we get the reaction (along the lines in the mouth) one after the other - so natural! (6) The general just runs away, time after time (7) the general refuses to try electricity and would not listen (8) the act is awful (9) I mentioned the rubber suit costume ???? (10) God-terrible music, which does not stop!
