Wow. I went to the video store evening because I was in the mood for a bad movie movie B and I found this Gem. I looked at the cover and I thought it seemed just the movie for my mood. I was brought to my home and put it on. <br /> This movie was not the movie of darkness that I was in mind. This was worse. I wanted a bad movie but what I got, I did not know that crap like this existed amongst people. This movie seemed like an old year wrote and directed it and that is being nice about it. <br /> I'm an aspirant director and this movie made me so angry that someone out there actually paid this direct movie cinema. He needs to work in a trash trap where he belongs. <br /> If you are thinking about renting this or buying it. I'll tell you the same thing that I would say someone is preparing to commit suicide. "DO NOT do it, it's not really it!" I really have nothing nice to say about this movie. DO NOT DO IT!
