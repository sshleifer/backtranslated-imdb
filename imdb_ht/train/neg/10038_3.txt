The movie lacks style, I mean original style. Everything seems cheating and action, the first appearance of the movie, song, dialogue delivery, etc. etc. Yes, there are goof-ups being original, as at the beginning is a machine shown with numbers up **** numbers and a few seconds Later it begins to fall down a hill with numbers MH ****. That was one of many goof-ups in the movie :) Anything good in the movie? Yes, for quarantine fans, if any, Kareena in bikini. For fans of akshay, dialogue and exhibition action. That's it. nothing else. So watch it on your own risk and do not blame the director or actor. Director is already crazy and actor, I'm sorry.
