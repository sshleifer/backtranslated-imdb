Since Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon has come together, there has been a lot of talk about a revival in the Hong Kong movie industry. Do not believe it. People now make movies in HK provide new meaning to the word cone. Running from time 2 is a perfect example. Ekin Cheng is the name drawn, here, but she spends most of the movie just grinning idiotically and flipping a coin. He flew the coin over and over and over again. Why? What do you know? Sean Lau plays a cop who chases after the coin sharp coins. But once again: who knows why? There is a beautiful actress of female lead who runs some sort of company and she has to pay a ransom or something but it mostly just looks he'd rather be in a spa or mall than in front of a camera. There is nothing that makes no sense. There is no action. There is no sex. There is no comedy. All there is a name: Ekin Cheng. And you know what? Who cares?
