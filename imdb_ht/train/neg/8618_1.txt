Unbelievably awesome movie. I watched a part of this on T.V. recently. My jaw has fallen as I watched a conspiracy that conceived and I listened to myself. Not a single line from the one-meter meter could come close to producing anything resembling a chuckle. It was so bad she did me want Rodney Dangerfield to train her body, slap it around and cry, "How could you?" I know many films are made in haste, hope to cash in on the popularity of a given actor or theme. But please, Hollywood, show a little respect for your audience. It's sad and scary that people have hoped to pay for seeing these drifts. Below in the cesspool, even by Sunday TV standard TV.
