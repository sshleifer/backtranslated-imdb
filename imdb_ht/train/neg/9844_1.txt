This was one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I'm still not sure if it was serious, or just a satire. One of these movies uses each stupid clue that they might think. Arrrrgh. <br /> <br /> Don Johnson was very good at it actually. But otherwise it sucks. It was over 10 years ago that I saw it, but it still hurts and will not stop persisting in my brain. <br /> <br /> The last line of the movie really sums up how stupid it is. I will not ruin it for you, you want to tempt fate by watching this movie. But I guarantee you a * nghya moment * in the end, and a few in between. If you have nothing better to do, and you like points and laughs, then maybe it might be worth while you. In addition, if you're forced to go on a date with someone you really do not like, suggests watching this movie together, and will probably leave you alone after seeing it. That's a fair price to pay, I guess.
