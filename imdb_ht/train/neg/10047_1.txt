I have now written reviews for several of the MoH episodes, and this is among the worst. An interesting quote at the beginning is completely abandoned by the time the credits are rolling. If it's looking at people things would never be in your real amusement life ("let's check out the basement!"), Then this is your show. Except, it's not fun or fun - it's just annoying. At the limit of the virus never has ever been shown. I can greatly neglect the fact that it affects men only, as the situation may result very, very scary. But then things deteriorate as daughters allow OBVIOUSLY disrupt the father at home, and finally die from her. The woman ran to the north and ran in some tens. Then some sort of mind or alien or something appears and saves it (the thing that you go to HUH?). Or something. Then it is huddling for heat. End a. <br /> <br /> Angry. These directors will mail this troop.
