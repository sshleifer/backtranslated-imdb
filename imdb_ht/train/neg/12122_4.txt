Seeing as the World Championship final championship ends in a too early and irritating way with Ronnie O`Sullivan beating Greame Dott by 18 frames to 8 BBC 2 found a space in schedule and decide to broadcast A Walk on a Movie in a Movie I had absolutely no knowledge of <br /> I missed a few seconds in the title credit so there was no idea Viggo Mortensen starred in her and thought she might be a cheap TVM, certainly the opening with Pearl The mawkish and Marty take their kids to a summer camp there that sort of tea made for TV feel even though the bright light (too bright lit) movie has seemed to suggest that this was a movie theater and it was not until the onset in Viggo Mortensen as Walker guy mortgage that I realized this was a movie release, after all a mortal `s statn wouldn`t star in a TVM, I mean that` s like a legend like Robert DeNiro appearing in a straight to video movie. Wait a minute, did not Bob ...? <br /> Some people on this site have mentioned that Pearl and Marty are a compelling on couple screen and I agree. I can understand why Pearl should attract attractive guy hippies but there is no idea why Walker should be attracted to the Pearl of Pearl home. The sixties were before my time but surely if you've got the choice between chic chicks and wives home bored it's not really a choice at all. Mind you a lot of people took LSD in those days so I guess it explains it <br /> I feel the biggest problem in a walk on the MOON down to the reality it`s the romantic drama heart ( Just like you`d expect of a TVM) and several cloying come to age scenes so why do include a fairly fair sex scene? She jars with the rest of the movie and is perhaps offset by putting menopausal women who were 20 something in 1969. I say probably because the film looks similar to the aim of a teeenage market and comes to age scenes with these youngsters being probably will be bored with the historical and social context of people walking on the moon and Woodstock. In other words A MONTH on the MOON tries to attract many audiences, but they will probably appeal to any of them
