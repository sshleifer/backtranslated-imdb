I read the box in the box and she talked about Mary Shelley and Percy Shelley and Lord Byron. I thought, "Beautiful! That's going to be great!" I was so bad. The story has all been aimed at. In fact, I still do not get it. It just seems to me that all the characters have been drinking, smoke (opium?) And having sex. Not that people who are not quality films, but please! Where was the story? I made myself end up the movie, and yes, he was picked up towards the end, but then the film was almost over. Rent it if you really want. Just do not trust the back of the box.
