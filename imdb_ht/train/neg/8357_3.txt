Man oh people! What is a piece of film-making films! But this is a pleasure of guilt from childhood even if I hate admitting it. They showed this movie about my basic cable system all the time. Where I grew up in San Jose, California (right on the Cupertino border) we had this thing called the G Channel on our cable system. And they basically showed the same movie one over and over and over again. Wanda Nevada was one of those movies. I have fallen in love with love with the young Brooke Shields and love his dopey adventures at the Grand Canyon in the 1940s. The script makes almost no sense, the direction is poor, some indicate that Henry Fonda makes an appearance, a lot of dialogues that are so bad at good with a beautiful song Carole King playing on the end credits. Perhaps you must tune to really enjoy this flick of films. And hey, everyone knows no gold in the Grand Canyon!
