This film is a good example of the extreme lack of good writers and directors of Hollywood. The fact that people were paid to make this piece show junk that there is a lack of original and talented minds in the entertainment business. The idea that audience pays to see this movie (and like someone idiot I rent the movie) is discouraging too. <br /> <br /> Obsede teacher (3 years before) killing the teenager's family because she wants her. There is no reason to kill mom, father and brother. From the first five minutes you see the wrong act and direction. Years later, teachers obsessed broke out of prison. HMM - normal bad writing - no one in the city he terrorized knowing until the last minute. Obsessed professors somehow become like a SEAL seal and can sneak around, sniff out people with a knife is super killer. Sure you !!! Now, obsessed teacher kills hotel maidens for no reason, knifes bellhop for fun in her, and she starts to chase the teenager's friend. Now there are perfect ways to get the girl love you. Obsede professor sneaks out of hotel --- yet she is stupid, ever cop would know her face - but she does not walk right. Now he killed two cops outside the home teenager and somehow sneaks into his room and kills her boyfriend. There is not one single positive thing about this piece of waste. If any other profession puts out this low quality job, they should be fired. But these idiots are doing hundreds of thousands of dollars to write and direct this garbage.
