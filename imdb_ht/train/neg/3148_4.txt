Essentially a story of man against nature, this film has beautiful cinematography, the lush forests of Ceylon and the presence of Elizabeth Taylor but the movie really never goes. Newlwed Taylor is ignored and neglected by her husband and later is drawn to the touring smashing, played by Dana Andrews. The plantation is under the spell of late Father Peter Finch's father who has a ghost project of a pall on Elephant Walk that has become a major point in the debate between Taylor and Finch. The elephants are determined to claim traditional paths of water that has been blocked when the castle was built through their right-of-the-way. The animals go on a rampage and give the best moments of action in the picture. Taylor and Andrews have some good moments while struggling to stay faithful after spending marital problems with Finch.
