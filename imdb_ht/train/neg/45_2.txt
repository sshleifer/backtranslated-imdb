As the number of Nasties videos I've ever seen has disappeared, this little pile of garbage popped up on my list of "rent" when I saw it was available. <br /> <br /> The situation involves a fashion model or something being kidnapped and taken in the jungle that must be ransomed by a motley crew of idiots. Some other goofs are hired to bring it back and give a bag of money used as a bargain chip, though if it comes back with the girl and all the money it gets an important cut. He carries a helicopter and pilots with him and, wow, that pilot is one of the worst actors EVER! Granted, they are totally awful and duplicate will make you cry. After the thief goes to the jungle, we learn that nearby is a cannibal culture that has flesheating earthbound God wanders the Woods as a King Kong man looking for ravages and devouring tribes. Now this fellow is just a nude guy and some of the worst makeup ever, ping-pong balls for eyes and this pretty much to her. Its horror and plainness is a feature everpresent on the soundtrack, and I found myself refusing much of these scenes. Oh, I forgot to mention the almost constant nudity? This is probably the main reason that this film was forbidden, though there was a specific scene, about one second, where God attacked a girl and pulled her bowel out, but it was not a nail factor for Gore fans. Also, Jess Franco goes beyond the usual T and A and shows long-range close-ups in genital parts and, sadly, men as well. So, if you want to "just" in terms of OS, you got it. <br /> I can not recommend this to anyone. It's not the good movie bad. It's just athletic rubbing garbage that only a fan of Video Nasty will probably see and even then, if you're making your way to the list, let this be the last lot. If you look at it first, you can find the notion that this is the norm for the list, which is certainly not true.
