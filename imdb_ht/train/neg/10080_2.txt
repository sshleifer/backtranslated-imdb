I did a research on the actresses to find the board in this movie because the title is now An unexpected love. It's not really worth looking but I've been familiar with both driving and wondering why they were supposed to be a lesbian movie lifelong movie. Everything is very silent and you do not really get an idea of ​​what the characters are so, as a viewer, I could not become emotionally invested in the scenario. I guess I'm not the target audience for this, but I'm not sure who is. Focusing mud and soft tone and earth tone ... there is nothing very interesting. I had a cautious interest in seeing women get out but it's busy so understand that I was disappointed. Rent Rentals better instead.
