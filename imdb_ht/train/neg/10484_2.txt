Being an Elvis fan, I can not understand how this proyect can do. It is by far the worst movie Elvis-related ever, totally unfunny, funny and many mistakes about the king. Come, Elvis' at a public park? A mention of suspicious spirits in 1958? ... and these are just two examples. Some people in the cast are trying to do their best, Mike Starr is funny (especially as an impersonator), Tom Hanks's cameras are a surprise, but the guy playing sucking teen at Elvis. All the movie lacks fun and becoming minus more boring after minutes. If you want to see an ultra cheap, crazy but absolutely funny little movie related to Elvis, I really recommend you "Bubba Ho-Tep" instead of this mess.
