I really tried to love this movie but in the end it just did not work for me. I saw most of Kitamura's production and found it to be very variable. Lively, as all his films have an interesting plot, some nifty sequences and a fair amount of creativity. However, these types are in great supply of breathing. The plot is fresh if not all that is original and could be done for a beautiful Ace movie. Unfortunately, the rhythm is painfully slow down and the film takes a long time to go before you reach fairly predictable places. The action is just over beams, and the final battle is very cool, and the earliest one on OK. It's one of the earliest ones that has been marched by overspeedy camera-work, making for lesser coherence. There are some visual effects and some interesting ideas floating around in the dialogue, but the movie still browses seriously. Characters are neither well-fed out or properly engaged in the environment and general color scheme is drab and boring. The film is not completely awful and it has some points of interest, perhaps the use of the fast forward button can improve it. With about twenty minutes off the long run this would be a very decent thriller to SCI female. But the full length movie is dull. Only recommended patients and determine Kitumura fans.
