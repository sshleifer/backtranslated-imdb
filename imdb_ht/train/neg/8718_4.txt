The third installment of the trilogy of "Carnosaur" features a bunch of Keystone Kops-quality military orders trying to kill two Velociraptors with a T-Rex. I give it a 4th out of absolute sympathy and my affinity for dinosaurs. The movie is definitely the worst of the trilogy, it really can not take seriously. More significantly, however, watching this movie I can not help but notice some interesting interactions between the trilogies "Carnosaur" and "Xtro". The first installment of both franchises is a dark, disturbing film that has become a classic cult, the second is a "alien" ripple, and the third is a slang-language, almost slapstick (whether intentional film or not) that has you rolling on the street floor. Also, like the franchise "Xtro", all the "Carnosaur" movies are completely related to each other. They only bear the franchise name of drumming up interest in the "suites," I guess. Obviously, "Carnosaur" and "Xtro" have two different production groups at work here, but if you've seen all three movies in both franchises you find yourself referring back and forth between the two.
