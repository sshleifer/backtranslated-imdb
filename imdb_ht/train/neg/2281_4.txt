Think "play play". This is worth seeing once for their performance at Lionel Atwill and Dwight Frye. Conducted Melvin Melbourne's "Ghost Story" and Melanie DOLLAS in this movie. Is there any vulture in this 'Bavarian' village, or having a more natural, albeit disaster, explanation? Dwight Frye is Herman, a red herring, who is cast as an especially moron character. It's fun to look at her different facial expressions of what is really a stock character. No much happens for a long time, but then we discover that the smoking Atwill pipe is the real murderer. There are too many 'funny relief' but that's the way for the course for that era. Fray Wray looks really good.
