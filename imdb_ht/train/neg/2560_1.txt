Well I watched this last night and one thing that did not make it completely awful is that it was right forward. There was no beating in the bush that this kid was Anti-Christ. However the movie was just wrong writing. For example, they never explained how to make the incident dentist an "accident" or at the end of how the cop just miraculously ended in the house in time to save the kid without the same police named again. The scene of death was just really bad and not fun at all. The child was chosen to play Anti-Christ was boring and really could have chosen a better kid. Just do not waste your time watching this.
