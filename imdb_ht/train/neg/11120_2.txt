You know a movie is bad when the highlight of it is that they could see a moment of "Jeopardy!". The sad thing about White Men can not jump is that it has tremendous potential. For many years, I have lived in areas quite well as described in this film; The racial tensions were high, and basketball meant everything for everyone. A film about these "basketball culture" members could be very interesting, but the mediocre acting and poor script in White Men can not let Job leave something to be desired. Sequire the movie event is sugar. First, Billy either wins or loses money by playing a game of basketball. He then returns to his home and lounge around with his girlfriend; and the process is repeated. Most stories build a bigger one, but the "climate" I saw was just another sequel to this rehearsal (this was "Billy either wins or loses money by playing a game of basketball"). <br /> In order for a draw to develop, some dilemmas must be resolved; and this dilemma should be interesting if the movie will be interesting as well. Apparently the writers of White Men can not forget this rule, as the plot can summarize as "Billy needs to pay the bills." I appreciate changes in speed in other sporting formula movies, but - I'm sorry - this was just plain terrible. I could handle less if Billy got paid for the rent for her apartment. Despite all that, White Men can not jump is a successful film. Apparently some adult species fans will postpone awful writings for a few scenes and a basketball in them. Others, I'm sure, have been attracted by big names to play the leading roles. This let me be surprised, if they were cast to replace entirely with actors already unknown, and the theme of basketball was replaced with lacrosse, would anyone be bothering to watch this movie? I really do not think so. <br /> I'll give this movie two stars from ten; The extra star is for the "Jeopardy!" scene, which kept me awake for a few minutes. Thanks, Trebek.
