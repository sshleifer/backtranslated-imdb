A noble effort, I guess, but ultimately a poor one. Before seeing this film, I felt "Bartleby, the Scrivener" was unfilmable. After seeing it, I always do. Unfortunately, I think only those who read the story will understand what's going on and will be angry at the movie without the movie review (from 1850 to 1970, coming from New York to London). Even the superb talent of Paul Scofield can not save what seems to me as a good meaning, but Melville 's misguided classic metaphysical film.
