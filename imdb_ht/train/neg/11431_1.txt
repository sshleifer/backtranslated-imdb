It is important not to insult the lack of logic or common sense and people with any "gray matter" will agree that this movie just does not work. <br /> <br /> The problems lie in the direction, cast selection and lack of depth of the character building. The word comedy was very difficult to say when I was hoping to laugh when the words were used. Let's look at the issues in the direction / script. <br /> <br /> Brothers and sisters in the 30 middle seem to be well adjusted. They met a full stranger in a park with Heather Graham characters walking up to it and asking the most intimate questions that even half-silly people should run in other ways or at least call for a police officer. She then clumsy walks over and makes some stupid statements and falls for him. Then after a date they all go out together and fell in love with her and decided to get married in Vegas in a week's time ???? Hello anyone feeling stupid anymore? She goes out with thousands of women and meets the person saying about 10 words that we see on the screen and wants to get married. Not only was it any chemistry just does not make sense. Insure it is a romantic comedy and I want to believe it could, but the direction made it completely flat. <br /> Now Heather collapses on heels with her too, and when Heather Graham and Bridget Moynahan (very deep character) kiss or more at the point she's been kissing sloppiest all the time this chemistry can be there. I found it unromantic and unfunny and while many say Heather can not act I think the reality is Heather was clearly the wrong person for that role. <br /> This was Sue Kramer first as a director and I was just too much for her to grind. It would take a lot of craft to perform this movie and IMHO it can do with best writers and casting and direction.
