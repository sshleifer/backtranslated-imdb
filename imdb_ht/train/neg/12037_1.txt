This series is one of the worst shows I've ever seen. Terrible acting, terrible effects, terrible writing, you get my drift. The stories are so far from the legend of Robin Hood's amazing. Apparently they just wanted to use the name Robin Hood to attract a hearing. It might as well be called New Adventures of Mr Bland Acting. <br /> <br /> Someone commented on me that if you had imagination, you would like this show. This is a terrible approach to a TV set. A visual media like this should provoke your imagination, you should not have the strength of your imagination to do something good. That would be like the Simpsons episode where they tried Homer's Brain and a religious propaganda movie, and began to talk about who died that or whatever. "If a movie is boring, I just do my own story." <br /> In conclusion: Absolute human waste.
