This really does not match up to Castle of Cagliostro. Lupine is not as comical or wacky or as hyperactive. The landscape and music are inspiring and drawn just is not interesting. <br /> <br /> Only good on this' un is the nudity (only in the uncut version) provided by Fujiko. It has helped spice up some of the tedious performers. CoC has a formidable villain and set up the movie for some imaginative imagery. The locations of TSTG are not very vivid or engaged. <br /> <br /> Zenigata, Goemon and Jigen do not even give decent entertainment to this time. It's like they just completed a contract obligation not to appear. <br /> <br /> The DVD is in full-frame with Dolby Stereo sound. It has a decent amount of expenses, including some trailers. But something curious. There is no selection chapter on the disc or timecode displayed on the player once element. Even if you can still jump to the next scene number using the remote.
