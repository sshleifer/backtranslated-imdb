I suppose many people comment / review their first films on IMDb because the movie was spectacular or horrible - I wrote because of the letter. <br /> I was excited for the sequel to "Wargames" .. I thought the original was well regarded by its time and content, I felt it was worth watching more than once. That's 2008, I had high hopes for what they would do with this movie. Computers, gaming, horrors, military sou-zealousness are all grown extensively since time of the first movie, and "Wargames: The Death Code" has been an opportunity to bring it all to a great movie flick. The movie fails on pretty much every level, but I particularly blame the writers and anyone who has any views regarding realism in bank aspect. The "Dead Code" was a flight simulator in the 1990's with a few people on the ground lifting the arms. Meanwhile, Farmer's is mashing button over 7,000 commands - none of them affect what's happening on the screen. Until finally he "wins" by clicking on a box on the screen with his mouse release gas that immediately kills 20,000 virtual people (nobody near the gas). Because he beat 5 levels in 15 minutes, this tells RIPLEY (true machine of life war) that it is a terrible threat to high. Though any 5-16 year old can complete this same work - the government believes it is a lethal threat to mankind. They say such things as "He has expert bio-horror experts" ... It appeared less knowledgeable than anyone who reads the first paragraphs in the wiki on bio-terror. So, then a movie-long chase scene and about .01% of the budget and excitement of any of the Bourne titles came. They have about 1000 opportunities to catch it and clear all the subjects ... sometimes they are crazy barely missing it .. but others mastery creates opportunities just to let it go intently to follow it. Ugh ... I would write more .. but I already wasted 1.5 hours watching this, I'd rather watch Broderick and Joshua play tick-tac-toe for 1.5 hours.
