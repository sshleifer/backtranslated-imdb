Go to this movie you know that this film is six laboratory technicians in a sealed lab and an invisible maniac. So right you guess who will live with who will die. Survivors end up being exactly who you would expect them to be, so there is no point in plotting the draw. <br /> But if you're not sure if this is a movie B or a movie that's just happening in a lab and an engaging story, William Devane plays a part: instant B-movie status. The movie is promising at the beginning. In the laboratory we present in the invisible gorilla becomes increasingly violent. Oh, foreboding. The best scene in the entire movie is when the laboratory team makes the Gorilla visible again. Great special effects. The same thing when making Bacon invisible. There is a couple of breasts done, a really blame blame room and enough out of place to swear to this movie a R-rating that it really did not need. <br /> <br /> For a thriller was not really any surprises, except when Shue performs like the frozen MacGyver, which is the most a 'Whaaaa?' OK, there is only one surprise. This time Caine (Bacon) returned once the last of the elevator shaft. It was a surprise but only because you're calling on TV, 'Noooo! You are already dead! End of the movie! Talking about screaming in the TV, all I did for the last 25 minutes or so. 'Put on f # big glasses!' Instead of putting infrared glasses on them that they can see, they try every other trick in the book (fire detectors, sprinkler systems). The story really loses it to the end. But the special effects were good; That is why I only give it a 2/10.
