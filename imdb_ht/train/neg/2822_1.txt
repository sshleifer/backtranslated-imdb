This OMG is one of the worst movies ever seen and iv is seeing a lot I'm a movie student. I do not understand why Angelina Jolie would be in this movie? Does he need the wrong money? I love AJ and saw almost everything chess ever was in So I watched this 2 tick one another. It was SOO bad! not even bad, just bad bad. It had 1 or 2 funny little moments but all of it was bad n a waste of 101 minutes. I cant even say AJ looked good at her because well it was not. The plot is predictable unless you expect a re-tell in Romeo and Juliet then not its. All round disappointing. Perhaps if you this 12 might be a good movie otherwise I really do not recommend it.
