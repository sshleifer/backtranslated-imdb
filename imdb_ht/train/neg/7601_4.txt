This is a movie that demonstrates that attitudes and music and texture are not enough to make a good movie. Sure, the viewer is treated in many fine scenes in Los Angeles in the thirties - I especially liked to see in the trolley approaching the tunnel, and the tram rising up the hill - but in a sense this fine cinematography is self-defeating, because it creates an attitude that "something happens happen" - and there is nothing to do. The script also keeps feinting in the direction of some scheme or action or trauma - and time after time does not deliver. Not even delivering (I assume) the theme of the movie, the essential characters' essentials. The lead actors, both too beautiful for their role, did not convey any repression or agony, and the script did not expose us to any one. <br /> Now Donald Sutherland? This is another story. Her character was quite fashionable, so perfectly played, that I wanted the camera to follow.
