I can start off by saying that Casey Affleck is a very talented actor and I respect her many tasks. I wish he was in more movies featuring his talent. With this said, Soul Survivor was a very, very bad movie. Very bad. <br /> I should say that I'm lying almost all the fault on the poor script. Affleck is a very talented actress, Wes Bentley had an outstanding performance in Indian Beauty, Melissa Sagemiller did well, and Eliza Dushku is now the girl she's in Hollywood. I do not think any of the actors really got into the script, and I understand why. To say that this film belongs to the horror genre is an overstatement. He did have twists and turns you would expect, but they just did not lead anywhere ... except more confusing. I just found the very anti-climatic end, because it just did not seem to make any sense or really answer any of the questions that I had on the scenario. <br /> I wish I could give this movie a good review, but I can not. In all honesty, the only thing I think you will find scary about this movie is that you pay for it.
