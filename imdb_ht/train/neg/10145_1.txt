Steven Seagal appears to be sleepwalking in a film shot almost entirely in pre-up to disguise the complete lack of budget and resources. To select the technical faults - F / A-18s and F-14s agents take part in an air carrier, and Miraculously gets the Cambridge F-16s for the current strike - would give this film more credibility than it deserve. Suffice it to say that the most interesting thing in the movie is the credit titles that fade over and then disappear from a wiped lightning, which is presumably available to all users of Final Cut Pro. Put all your creativity in your own credit to put Michael Keusch in the same category as Marcel Mandu.
