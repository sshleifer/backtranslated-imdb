Boy Oh Boy oh golly gee, <br /> <br /> The most interesting thing in the movie was hilarity in the bluescreen effects used to create "invisibility of the mother." They seemed to be shot on cheap videos, and it seems totally real, and not even in a great way where it's so funny that you end up enjoying the movie ... <br /> <br /> Here did not end up like this movie. Tried the "stab" shots were really pathetic as well. I mean, hey, if they had a low budget flashlight, that's fine. You can always make a big movie with a low budget. But a movie movie with a low budget and effect. This makes for a bad combination. In this case, as a finishing combo created the audio movie, "Invisible Mom." If you have kids, and your kids do not have to taste, maybe they'll stay awake at all this one.
