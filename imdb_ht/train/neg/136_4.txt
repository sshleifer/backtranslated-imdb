*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** Are all girls slasher cops suffering from a drought of originality? It really looks like that. First of all, this is a noble site that might have been used properly. A young nerd rejection that grows, kicks and kills all the girls who tortured the hell from him when he was at junior high? Can not tell you there was nothing to work with. But this film goes to the same motions as all the other slasher past. Everything from the note to the camera angles allows us to predict exactly when a fake alarm is coming and exactly when the assassin is knocking. We know the pattern is not currently. These stupid slasher movies push the credibility of more and more credentials by the minute. Let me ask you something: Who, in your right mind, is going to surprise a friend of theirs in a dark, bold tide of the night and just surprise it from the blue while it's all alone and surrounded by corpses? Does that make no sense at all? <br /> <br /> "Valentine" is only occasionally innovative. One good shot involves the butcher of Denise Richards' character. It gets trapped inside a pool and the killer pokes in it with a chainsaw. There are some good songs in the band, including one cool track by orgy. The music video is contained in the special features section on the DVD. Even the act is the best mediocrity. The actors all sleep in their roles. Of course, David Boreanaz is often stoic, even in painting as the title character on "Angel." Denise Richards is a fine actress, though, and holds a stoneface across the movie. <br /> <br /> "Valentine" is just like you would expect: pretense, plausible, forgettable, cheese and without a good scary eye. Do not even bother. <br /> My Score: 4 (out of 10)
