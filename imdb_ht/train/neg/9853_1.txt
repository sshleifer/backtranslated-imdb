I think most people all want to believe that these extraordinary things exist and this movie shows there is no constraint in trying to exploit that's all there. The presentation is very interesting, well presented and graphic is state of the art, but at a scientific point in view it just does not work. Hydrogen filled flying notice? They would need to be the size of a Mack truck to be useful. Then there's the ever-present possibility of a catastrophic explosion. I have no problem with fantasy, just do not try to pass it as reality. Some are always misunderstood. All in all the movie is fun, but I still find myself saying "oh brother, what a charge of ....". If you want a FAKE documentary, look at this spinner tape instead. Or at least turn the sound.
