it could be a good movie if it was exploring something more interesting rather than just the surface of a lesbian relationship if this was the meaning of the movie ... it is quite predictable not to mention that the two girls resemble the group TATU group. .. I do not think so. There is nothing original in this film to support it being used for something that is already popular. You know the recipe. The other actors ... well, I just do not know what the roles are supposed to be. Most of them are well-known people in Romania and I must mention some of them are not even actors (egMihaela Radulescu) .SO summarize it: "Tattoo Girl Tattoos" + desperate / advertising needs "actor" + a non existent draw + the occasion to use bad language in order to trauma = ill love .... too bad ... the idea was good, though ... and I am seriously obstructing myself from commenting the title ...
