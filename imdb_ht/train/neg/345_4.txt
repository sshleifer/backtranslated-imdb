This can not be Mandy Schaffer's latest film. Someone, do something! :-( <br /> <br /> What little one life could have been, the direct conclusion of. Do not blame the cast, they did OK. Even the youngest winemaker brothers were very well done , and she did not even go into the movie until the half .. And please, please put Mandy in some movies more! It's too nice to bury her career in such a teens ... Ya 'break me, heah ... <br /> Two specific critics, in the case of anyone who cares (apparently nobody liked this movie so much). First, the road Traci keeps popping up in just this melodramatic moment, in order to watch everything he has supposed to see, and never seen in return, was very annoying Hollywood: please stop giving perfect bandits distribution that runs out exactly when the climax arrives .. It's Mute Writing the best scripts so you will not have to use this scam device Once again, Carmen might not fall aside for this false incident that Traci pulls out. She already had Traci right. laughing and laughing. <br /> I could waste this movie more but have mercy to ban it. Actually I did not hate him as much as others seem to have. It just did not have much of a reason to do, unless it was purely a car shown in the beautiful Mandy. Oh, and those who do not think it was sexy ... the character was not very well written, but how can you say it was not sexy? One or the other of us needs glasses, and I do not think it's me. <br /> <br /> More mandy. (Do not be confused with "Moore, Mandy" - although I would like to see it again. ;-) Did I mention that I expect Mandy to make me more movies? <: - D
