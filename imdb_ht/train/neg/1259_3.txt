Thanks Hollywood. But another classic movie is broken by a cheap, deep, heavily-edged and redundant notice. The original "Planet of the Era" was a clever and thought-provoking movie with a very clear message. It was a movie that focused almost entirely on dialogue, which sounds very dull, but it was in fact very interesting. <br /> <br /> This movie, on the other hand, seems to have been doing away with pretty much ALL the dialogues. Instead of a big movie we get an unbelievably stupid phase of chasing hours. Dialogue has been reduced to a minimum of minimum, character interaction and non-existent development and most of the time it is very difficult to know what's going on. Instead, we find a bunch of unneeded scene scenes, some funny one-silly materials and some very quasi-intelligent conversations. <br /> <br /> The only thing worth mentioning about this film is that it looks absolutely fantastic. Make-up of the monkeys are beautiful, and together with their beautiful backgrounds too. However, this does not distract from the fact that "Planet of the APs (2001)" is a very deep and simplistic film, filled with paper-thin, stupid dialogue and a non-existent drawing. Please, Hollywood, stop damaging great movies by turning them into meaningless blockbusters. <br /> Oh yeah, the ending did not make any WHATSOEVER SENSE. <br /> <br /> * from **** stars, especially for visuals <br /> <br />
