Usually, any film and Sylvester Stallone usually will suck donkeys. Rambo: First Blood Part II there was no exception to this. The only movies that Sylvester Stallone were in were good were Rocky and Bloody First. This movie is really unrealistic, and boring. It has action but not very good action. I did not enjoy watching it, and I never would ever watch it again. Do not ask why she won the Razzie award for Worst Picture. I would give this a 3/10, the only reason why he got the 3 was because it was a bit good action, but not good enough.
