The movie uses a cutting edge title for a lame story. Kill kills, would have been nice. The film incorporates taboo scenes to make the viewer move back to the chairs. The scenes are needed and effective. The movie is something that a novice screen writer could convey. Just a waste of films and money network accessories. I have to write 10 lines of text to criticize this movie when it's not worth 10 lines in my time, but I must push on leaving the people know to avoid the nonsense. If people are counting on you to choose a good movie for movie night, choose something else. If you have a soul does not damage it does not suggest yourself this scum.
