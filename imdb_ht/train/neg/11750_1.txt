The guy who wrote, directed and stared at this shocking rubbish piece should really consider a change of care. Yes, Rob Stefaniuk, I mean to you! Seriously, funded this crap? There are many talented writers out there whom money might be better than over. I think the idea is great but acting, the script and direct is just plain terrible! The jokes are so not funny, I understand that they are supposed to take the mickey. But doing it with style, this film is screaming Saturday night Saturday live skits. Why, I still say why studio gives money to Hacks like Rob Stefaniuk - NEVER give a comedy Opportunity to write directly to Star in her own photo. DUH!
