I keep this a few months ago on Family Channel, and with some memories of the TV show from my teens, decided to look at her with my 4 year old daughter. I should have some psychedelic mushrooms to go along with it, 'cause this is just scarce! Not only is it a music and melody annoyingly forgettable, the necessary cheese effects and camels by star long past collective prime, it seems to have been produced as a good man's acid travel. Talking flut, British kids far too old for this kind of crap ... in the words of Krusty Klown "uuuuuugggghhhhh! What was I about?" If you're a big fan of South South and Marty Krofft's work, go for it; otherwise, unless you want to get looped before watching, stay far, away, far away.
