I could not believe how horrible this movie was; I rarely watch commercial television, but thought "Well, Diane Keaton is always worth watching". I stand upright. Everyone involved should hang themselves in shame. <br /> I realized there is not much roles for women at a certain age, but the script was so stupid, shabby and disgusting that I am surprised it ever got into development or that Ms. Keaton thought he was able to make a suitcase from the plant's ear. None of the characters had a little bit of credibility and were so incredibly unpleasant. The act looked like the exercise of a BEGINNING class - I stared at open-mouth speech in most of this asks "What they thought?". Very, very sad that he came to this. Do not waste your time.
