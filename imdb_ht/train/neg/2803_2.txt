Consider this movie's limit (film all in one setting - a music studio - only about 5 or 6 total actors) it should have been best done. IF you have the limits of making a movie, how could the lighting be so bad? And the actors were terrible, they spoke a hair down the act of Klerks, except that was an enjoyable movie, this had no substance. Well he tried, but really failed. <br /> It attempts to be independent reference to a couple party, but the lines have been delivered so badly by the actors it was just bad. And Neal's main character guy, what a bad patent. Clearly as 10 total people did this 'movie' and they all knew each other, and it probably was a real stone band that they were, but unfortuntly these people really have no idea how terrible they are all around . This was done in 2005, but they all look so naive it smacks in just before Grunge era. <br /> <br /> Fortunately I did not pay to see this (Starz on demand delivered again!), but it was under the title "Owned" by Studio 666, it does not matter what you do in the title , he can not help this. This could be a better movie movie - there is no excuse for this bad movie-making when you have the limited limitations filmmaker parameters when they did this, working within the boundaries you should do The thing you can control with the thing you can work with the best you can. Instead, mediocre calculations should be good enough. And that music video, wow was bad, I quickly fowarded at that. So, 2/10 is fair, if you are in the crap all b-movie I suppose you'll go and see this.
