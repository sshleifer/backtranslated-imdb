Good luck! While I still maintain that Manos: but in fate is the worst piece of mental torture available, Hobgoblins has become awfully close. This ... this insult the audience of all opportunities. <br /> <br /> At least films such as Space Mutiny and Future Wars can enjoy on mst3k, this one was a struggle to get through. I was literally writhing on the couch in anguish. This thing managed to embarrass me - alone! Even if you are a MST3K fan-dead and have made it your mission to see each single experience, think twice about seeing this one. <br /> It's that bad.
