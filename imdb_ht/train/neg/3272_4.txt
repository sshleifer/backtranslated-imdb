I'll say one thing about this movie: there's no lulls. You can not get this bored. The problem is that it is too intense. There are too many actions and need marine! That is the risk you take in modern action films. You want it interesting, but not too much. This is way overdue. Even though the act is fine and features a couple of "no" in Gary Busey and Roy Scheider, he still has the feeling of a movie "B". The best part of it is Scheider's dialogue: only "A" part of this film "B". The rest of the story is forbid Rambo mentality but it has a few exceptional scenes. One particular was a highly innovative scene featuring land mines. That was memorable. Not enough at the other scene made this a shepherd for long.
