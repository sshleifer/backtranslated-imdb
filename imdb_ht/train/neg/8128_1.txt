OK, do not let me summarize your fool. This successful film is difficult. But the worst movie ever? This movie was terrible in how people should not have their brain rack to describe. But it is in no way worse than Manos: but in fate, hobgobblins, horror of spider islands, or a handful of movies. As a movie review sucks, it's awful. Do not see it with STD or you can develop health problems. But there are worst movies.
