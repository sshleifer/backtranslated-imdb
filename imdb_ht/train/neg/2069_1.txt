I went to see this in the Tequila Theater in Cincy, OH, and - I hate my life now. Christopher Reeves would have a more credible boxer. a movie he was painful, but seeing Carr Bret saw people desperate at his pinnacle. <br /> <br /> My favorite part of the movie saw BC slammed into the face and what appears to be a "C" battery. The jury is still out. He was from a dildo and was in slow-down. Yep. <br /> "Shoot left in the face only ... people become more popular by asking things!" - Bret Carr B. Carr donned a chicken suit for a bit of reverse psychology, roaming the streets of Clifton's bashing his own movie. It should be. This is correct in hitting the movie. <br /> <br /> My soul felt chafed after this film. <br /> <br /> Bret Carr is not charismatic enough to be the leader of a cult, or smart enough for this matter. That is the feeling you get from the What's the Bleepesque range in brainwashed, impressive neo-yuppies that came to see this Bret Carr piece of work. It's an emotional tearing experience just thinking about writing about this movie, so goodbye. <br /> <br /> <br /> -Anonymous
