This movie is so bad, you almost feel that it is contaminated by it. Actually, there is a strong sense of relief when it's over, rescuing that you can now put the tap back in the rewinder with this RUSH back to the video rental store before it contaminates the rest of your video collection. I'm jokingly suggested when we rent it as it looked like the movie type where William Hurt would be the "phone" performance. I mean he should not try very hard. But now, in a huge number of scenes in this movie, Bill Hurt is actually on the phone! Our realization of this irony was the only fun we exited from this confusing mess. The cinematography and corrections are quiet and befuddled, the story is chaotic, and the sound is barely sounding. There is a very slight resemblance to "Falling Down", but that film has a history of crashing history-story lines, great writing and acting, and a band engaged. "Contaminated people" are just some kind of crushed old European tourist traps, and watching it is like driving along some familiar routes in an unknown country where you do not speak the language of a steady rain just after falling as fast as the car keep fogging up. You get the picture? Do not get this one.
