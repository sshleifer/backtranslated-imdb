William Cooke and Paul Talbot share directors / credit writers for this fun low budget film about three boys camp out of the woods and horror magazines. Master sustains up the fire and complains schoolboy returns with ideas ... with a scroungy town tramp called Ralph (Gunnar Hansen ... at Leatherface Fame) wanders and exchange stories in gorges in return for food and the heat of the fire. One story is the old retread of the "Hook", two adolescents on the lover line attacked by a demonic assassin with a hook for one hand. Another story has a couple of tokers who need to score some weed. They stumble upon a guy who knows a guy who has some great # t. As they smoke a couple of full-sized bags start to turn gray and green before bubbles rise and fall. One of the best stories is about a happy man returning home for Christmas, who can not wait for his mother to drop dead and enjoying his nephew and nudging on Satan Claus. Four fire fires four are in a vicious seagull that washes mad ground on a empty treasure chest and ends up being chased out by sea by zombie. <br /> <br /> Without a great budget for special effects, CAMPFIRE TALES gets the point across and really could be a lot worse. Somewhat unreasonable, but fun to watch except for perhaps the sailor story. The act is understood by worthy awards. Cast members include: Tres Holton, Courtney Ballard, H. Ray York, Johnny Tamblyn, Walter Kaufmann, Kevin Draine, David Avin and Paul Kaufmann.
