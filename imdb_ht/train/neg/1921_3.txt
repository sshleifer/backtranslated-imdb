For some unusual reasons the movie world is driven by fashion. Someone makes a movie about a killer shark then all of the sudden movie world's oceans are flooded with giant squids, bloodthirsty octopuses and sea monsters in every ilk. A man is leaned by an ancient lover from hell then each film is tightened by a cop from hell or a flatmate from hell or a babysitter from hell. Then, when a large Hollywood company produces a huge budget FX packed blockbuster on tornadoes then other film producers jump over the move, the fact that the budget does not have to pull it off by stop them. Nights at TWISTERS are a quarter to point. What struck me about this was done for TV movie is the fact that it tries to hide its lack of budget by cutting off ads. Each time a tornado appears locksmith over the expression of fear of the actors as they scream like "Oh gawd it's way this way" and "Run for your life" then disappear to black screen saving the producers needed to go up the special effects of the budget. Unfortunately, they should be NEW in the budget of TWISTERS that they have built up the best actors. The cast does not mean the bad but impressive impressions and lack of skill in carrying a movie that is character driven. Where are Josh Hartnett and Eli Wood when you need them? <br /> And the last word on this being a twist script ..... Yes NOTT was released a couple of months before TWISTER, but TWISTER was hyped for several months being blocked in summer in 1996 and NOTT has a hurrying feeling of it leading me to believe he did and release the tide and hype surrounding twister
