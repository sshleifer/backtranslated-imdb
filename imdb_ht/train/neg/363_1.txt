What ends up killing this movie is self-consciousness, among other things. here's a short list: 1. irreverent behavior. When the beatles came over and injected the marks of "original behavior, irreverence" / humor, he was greeted as cool. That was over 4 decades ago. get on it. <br /> <br /> 2. sophisticated fake. Spotting out base, kasi-socio-political-izm is hard ground to perform funny tasks. ask all Woody everyone. <br /> 3. The post-modern "I'm hard on this false world and yes, I recognize it in my head" Snake feeds itself - used as illustration with another creature in the movie itself! - It's like a return. <br /> 4. smarmy, drog scene. <br /> 5. Amateur writes, acts, directions ... ever see the movie? a victim of himself, on the only thing I can say is positive that he at least has a sense of self, and sheesh, now I get caught up in the self-reflective thing that he posits as refreshing, whose value . br /> <br /> but towards ... what? Finally, it just rings as hollow as any other unpretentious piece - hey, ever see Woody everybody taking on mountain ranges, meaning "Interiors" ??? Well, this just makes it more amateurishly.
