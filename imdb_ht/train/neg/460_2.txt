I had to watch the movie for my work, so I did not pay for it (on the contrary, I paid), but I still get the movie sucking far more than average. The jokes were crippled, the actresses ... well, they use "First Wife Club" division of women of the Hollywood age, they are not at the age of "hot chick" but more of their "district attorneys" age. What's upset me most about the movie was the main plot line, which pretty much completely plagiarized "Beavis & Butthead makes America" ​​(in which the boys all jazzed up on some dude offering their money to "make his wife" , do not realize they are expected to assassinate him). All in all, a fragile piece of crap.
