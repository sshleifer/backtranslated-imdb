I can not believe that this film has been made lately as 1984. He has some reassuring act, not to mention one of the stupid cemetery ever. Who would ever ask Texas sheriff Joe Don Baker an Italian escort illegally arrested in Mexico back to Italy? Not to mention that the title of the movie tells you pretty much nothing about it - in fact, it's about as a generic title for a wannabe movie movie cop as I can think of. I'm glad I only saw this on MST3K and Mike and the bots as a shield. They noticed the female lead resemblance of Elaine from Seinfeld ("None of them are spongeworthy") and reef that does not stop on Baker's beans. This film is probably no worse than "Mitchell," but Baker's reputation definitely specifies him here: when his title comes to the film's start, Tom says, "I wish I was illiterate so I should not read this . "
