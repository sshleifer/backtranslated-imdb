The revocation starts looking promising, and a brutally death scene by a masked killer mask. The mask itself is very cool too, and it looks almost identical to the one used in the movie 1990 "Granny" movie. From then on the film is mostly boring. We get a few more deaths, which are yet good, but there's not enough of them. The reasons why their deaths are so good is because they are frenzied and bloody. The story behind the film is actually rather interesting and would have worked very well it was not so boring for the most part. <br /> I would avoid this unless you're a dead-hard collector - there's not enough here even making it an average slasher filler.
