I saw this film at the Edmonton International Film Festival, with great Dr. Uwe Boll's presence. The film is, simply put, very, very bad. And no, not in Uhl Boll's habit of "so bad it's actually fun" way, but just plain bad. The plot worries a man who leads a terrible life (because of a past criminal case, apparently), can not find a job, and a terrible 900 book wife cheating. This person turned to his uncle's leader in a plan to steal a truck load in games with influenza viruses. Al Qaeda also has designs on the game thieves, and what follows is just under two hours of incomprehensible sex and violence complexes. The act is terrible (except for Dave Foley, who really tries, despite it all), the jokes never go higher than the kids shot at the chest in slow motion, and those who take a poo. It is supposed to be satir, but I'm not sure of that. <br /> <br /> Think "Airplane!", but done by the creators of South Park, and without any jokes.
