Really, really, abysmally, garishly, awful. But actor Clayton Moore (Lone Ranger's film) buys himself completely as an actor. It's the only one. <br /> A rare treat, for five minutes, if you want to wash the depths of the transparent scrotum effect, South California as the "moon" (again and again and again), and act so formally stupid as it can a parody. . . except that it is clear that it is not - no humor here, except unintentionally. The dialogue can become worse than any of these other aspects, and their costumes. . . Well, enough said. Draw? What is drawn? Bad guy (well, bad guy guy) and his henchmen, including his earthly agent called Krog (listen carefully or you will suspect it in a parody of McDonald's founding name of Ray Kroc) and insoluble insects Insects (which, however, have pistols that never need to break, similar to Commando Cody, so there are many fire extinguishers).
