The only reason I give her a 2 is that filmography is so stylized these days as having at least something to comment on. This film is asinin. It's like many other 21st century home fodder mill. The throat is free and simply riot. I did not care about any of the characters, but I did care that some cretin bothered this crap: I would complain about the money I spent, but my date and I wisely left behind 40 minutes Going to an adjoining theater to watch the adventures and fun "Live Free or Dead Hard," which probably got a higher rating from me simply because I endured the pope uttering "Captivity" for 40 minutes.
