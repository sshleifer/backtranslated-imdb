A bomber gives a secret service a tip on a secret service man in the presidential detail that plans to kill the president. Baloney. How did the bum know? The script then returns to a more detailed examination of how the secret service works, but cares. Most of this just slow down the movie. All the chases that follow are the movie version of the chasesome car chases in many movies. Then, after a lot of athletics impossible in that outfit our hero and out-gun all his buddies, we have a shooting at the Toronto City Hall. Canadians are clearly labeled with maple leaves, but how are they found in this? Finally, all is working out. But it still does not make any sense.
