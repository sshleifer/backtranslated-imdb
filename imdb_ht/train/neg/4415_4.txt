I've always said that some play by many nature they just can not translate films, and this one is an example first. As a game, this is a very funny satanic border in the Catholic Church, with a razor understood and a central character that is so shocking to our real root we have to start by killing its parishioners (one of those who did The fatal mistake of admitting he did not sin since his last confession, so he felt sent him straight to the sky). Only an example of how far outside of the play's play goes, and to make believe in the world of the theater, it works. However, the type of intensified reality rarely works on film, and it certainly is not here. <br /> <br /> Director of Marshall Brickman has assembled a fine cast that does great job, but does not present all of this absurdity in a realistic fashion comedy to tragedy and leave with an empty sentiment in the abyss of the abdomen you. <br /> <br /> Find out a production step by step instead, you will not be disappointed.
