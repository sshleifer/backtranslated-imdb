The first half of this film is a pure fun. Novel. Funny. Wonderful performance. A brief brief summary of Sister Living in Manhattan falls to the same woman! Adult. Bright. Witty. What more can you ask. As a romantic comedy this begins to refresh. It is ruled by unexplored territories. Then it fell apart. <br /> It's going to be a universal adult universe in a coming-of-the-world come-out-of-the-closet story that has been doing many times before. What a disappointment. As a movie she starts with these promises. Why does he need to turn in such a pedestal "I am I myself" movie. The freeze-frame end of Heather Graham's jump in the air to celebrate his "happiness in finding himself" underlines the banality of the last part of the movie. <br /> It could be different. It could be magic. It ended up being the same old old man.
