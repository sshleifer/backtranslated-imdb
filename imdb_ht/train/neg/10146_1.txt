The 'Wrath of Fury' is a long, but worst shock in all Boring Action Films - I do not expect much of a Seagal movie, all I expect is to be moderately entertained for 90 or so minutes and some stupid actions - unfortunately This does not even realize that low expectations, the scene of action are few and far between, the plot (which is totally irrelevant in these Films) is unusually complicated and confusing with great scheme holes at all, the acting is Really Abysmal - Narrow and Seagal Border and its expression expression one expression was the best among many regrets in 3rd ratters - I find it hard to believe that nothing close to $ 12M was spent on this disruptive disruption of this if $ 11M of 12 was Salary Seagal - I somehow doubt it! One moment of any interest in just guys or gay girls is that out of seemingly nowhere two hot chicks end up in a lesbian sex scene in kind of filling and big baps in other exhibitions than that - it's mediocre thing that does not different from many of the Michael Dudikoff B-Movies I have endured <br /> 1/10
