A craven, loose film. Director Boorman shows Cahill breaks rich homes, but men's occupants show that they are turning away from the nanny, which is true then. The medical lawyer legal investigating Cahill is blowing up in his car, but Rats are facing sourpuss, and they do not look like a nice man, so it's all right too. The bees, Russborrough House owners, made their money by exploiting 'darkies' dig diamonds, so it's okay to rob priceless art from them and hide it in a bunker in the Wicklow Mountains. The murdered Garda and involves his murder. Moral equivalent is disgusting, Boorman looks for a hit movie, but it does not have the guts to stand against the gang criminality in general, who terrorized the neighborhood, and unleashed another wave of scumbags on Dublin. He even liaised with the son of the General while doing it. DÃ©goutan. Shame on him for his cowardice.
