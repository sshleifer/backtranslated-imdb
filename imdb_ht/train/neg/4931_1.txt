This time we find a psycho maker called "Joe Petto" (find it?) That makes living, evil toys. He goes after the family has the bad luck in just simply living in the same place where he and his automatic mutant sound "Pino" (yet, get it?) Used to live. <br /> <br /> Easy the worst (and hopefully [presumably] the last) in this semi - series, this one and the previous one look like soft cinema porn movies, but without sex and naked. It's kind of a hybrid low rent of "Halloween III", "Master Puppet", "Doll" and bad home movies. Supposedly in 2000 they started making a sixth chapter of the series, but was abandoned and never finished. We can all hope it's so ... <br /> <br /> 1/2 a star from **** <br /> <br />
