Falls in the movie category of "too ridiculous way in the dialogue and execution of the departments must be taken seriously". While Shriek If you know what I did last Friday Third or my boyfriend back known are bad, Scarecrows do not. Evil dead set such a high standard for the comedy horror on a budget genre, which perpetuant is simply out of place. <br /> <br /> Suspicion of inexperience are immediately in play as there are no suggestions in noise or vibration in the bark and cabin of an airborne aircraft. The expo is repeated in a photo of 3 men just recreating for an arch in history, but nothing comes. Although people are obviously scarecrow, there is no explanation. <br /> <br /> When you know this movie is too serious for its own good power may produce some grin. I do not remember if Joe Bob Briggs has ever seen Scarecrows, but I believe he would not lower this low. However, with an IMDb rating of more than 6, many people agree.
