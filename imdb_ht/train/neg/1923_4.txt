Ironic that Fabrice Seuss' emphasizes that non-commercialized in Christmas should be one of the most hyped, marketed, and successful blokbusters of the holiday season. The overall gust of Ron Howard's adaptation is that Grinch's plague against Christmas stems from an early childhood incident and whose whos are kept in materialism in the season saved for Cindy Lou Ki (played very well by Taylor Momsen). This movie makes a tough, ambitious attempt to capture the wackiness and feelings of Seuss' story, but the end result is a movie that lurches and never packs emotionally out of the pinned version Chuck Jones. Jim Carrey is important to his performance as the demonic grinch, but whether it's in the dialogue, the rhythm, or the whole strange story about the initial scheme, the transformation from bitterly enraged benefactor just by convincing fire. Some wonderful visuals and the make-up work are amazing, but beyond the technical triumphs there's an element or two here is missing .. <br /> <br /> Succinctness? <br /> <br /> Soul? <Brr <br /> Or maybe Jones made the first adaptation all too well in his 25 minutes drawing that Howard fell short of in a movie that feels three hours long. Howard, Carey, and Crew are all very capable and talented, but that would seem a winning combination is just weak and plodding in its final product. If you have to view the feature-length version, rent it on video and Jones' animated version and you can see how bigger and glitzier is not always the best. I give this movie three-Hash boxes from five.
