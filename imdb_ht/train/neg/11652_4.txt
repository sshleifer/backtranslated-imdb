The script for "Scary Movie 2" just was not ready to go. This is a problem with the movie which is flagrantly obvious, the actors and the audience alike. Director Keenan Ivory Wayans, and many of the actors are funny people; and so the film is not completely humorous. In the credits, the film has several funny moments. But as a whole, "Scary Movie 2" is not even close to being as smart and entertaining as the original. The first "film of beans" was a laugh at a minute movie. It turns the least finer of the slasher movie genre of gold comedic. The humor of "scary movie 2" is as heavy release as it is un-original. They even miss obvious opportunities for parody. Two of the old movie stars cast in "Beverly Hills 90210," and that was a show that required parodied! In the final analysis, "Scary Movie 2" is like a fine fine bottle that has opened too early. The script requires a lot of time for ages. 2 stars from 5.
