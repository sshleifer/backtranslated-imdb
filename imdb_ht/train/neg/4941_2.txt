I actually did not mind the Geico networks first 50 at times times I saw them and even found them to be a bit wry and fun, but seriously! This is the best thing that people might come with?!? This show is absorbed! It is bland and feels like watching an episode of the "Office" with the disguised characters like cavemen (I know a lot of you will hate me saying that but the "Bureau" just does not do it for me) . Well, I found it: we have the poor slob just trying to keep his nose clean and has a boss who hated it; the pseudo-intellectual who really just has a barely-functioning intelligence; and one of dopey who just wants to be accepted, but so what !!! I worked with these people and found them as annoying in real life as I do on television ... why would I want to waste another 1 / 336th in my week watching more of these qualifying nominations ?! ? Please call your parents and ask them if they fall on your head if after thinking about it, you still delude yourself in believing that this is entertainment.
