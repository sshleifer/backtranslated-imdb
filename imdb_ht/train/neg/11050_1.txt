Terrible use of scene cuts. Any continuity is lost, either by the direction of script or terrible therapy. That robot villainous ... Musta was a jazz dancer? Also, one of the worst sounds I have ever heard (monologues usually drowned out of music.) And ... where to find the props? This boat looks like a milk carton .. I made the best effect on 8mm at the age of 13! <br /> I would recommend that any movie student should watch this cops (5 minutes at a time) to learn how PAs produce a movie. Or ... was the blame editor? <br /> It's really too bad, because the storyline was actually a good concept ... just wrongly executing all the way around. (Malcom Malere You should have sent a "double cap." You're too good an actor for a bomb-stomp bomb.)
