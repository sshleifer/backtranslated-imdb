Wow, what can I say about this movie? It's a disgusting piece of crap. I'm surprised that he was rated as high as he did. What's wrong with this movie? Here's a Better Question: What's NOT wrong with this movie. <br /> <br /> The story itself is just crap and cliche. Here's pretty much what it's about ... Some Nerdy kid who has no friends gets caught, gets killed, and turns into a scarecrow for revenge. "All" in charge of 86 minutes of filthy films. If you did not see this film by wasting time you watch it. Also, the second one is not better, so do not bother watching that either ... I rated this movie a three because I liked to equip the scarecrow, not because there was anything good about the movie. I think you get the picture.
