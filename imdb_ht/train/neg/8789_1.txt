I checked this one out on DVD for a dollar so I could easily smile like this movie unfolding films. Every time you think it can not get any worse, it inevitably does. The act is absolutely awful. The plot makes no sense at all. The title "cold revenge" in the US DVD version has absolutely nothing to do with the script. The action scenes are so obviously taken in their first take. There are many errors while dialogue indicates that there is just no intention of making another take at least trying to make this bearable movie. I can not remember seeing a movie worse and I occasionally get bad people - well, except for irresistible with Wesley Snipes. No, who I kidding, while a malicious, irresistible one deserves best premium photos of the Oscars when compared to this piece of crap.
