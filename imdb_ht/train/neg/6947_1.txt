Without a doubt one of the worst movies I've seen in recent years. The story focuses on four women driving robberies that we are somehow supposed to sympathize with. It is difficult to sympathize with characters that keep up like stupid decisions. Oh no, the cops on us, they know who we are, what do we do? ... Let's rob another bank more then we're outta here! What! Each character is a stereotype and it's easy to say who will end up dying.
