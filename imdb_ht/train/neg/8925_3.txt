I do not like many films in Myra, because I appreciate how he pushed the Hollywood envelope at the time. Certainly Miss Welch's costume has become an iconic image, though I have to ask if many people recognize the image really saw the movie and know what it was all about - <br /> I rewatched myra on a couple's FMC years ago and did not think it was age any better than years. There's a segment on her in the social movies movies, where she gives good credit for wearing such big stars in what was then an outrageous production. However, IMHO, the movie is too bitter to be good, too unusual to be a turn-on, and so busy trying to hit that it fails to inform, engage, or entertain ---
