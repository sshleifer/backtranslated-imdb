How unfortunate, they have a lot of "my" list, and good "b" actors list agree to make this movie, but they did, and that is what sucks me in watching it. I never heard of this movie, but was Cuba Gooding Jr right on the DVD cover, and James Woods in the background how bad it was? In a very word! This film starts o.k. There are some twists and turns, then just lay an egg. The end was so weak, it was as if the writer was called away with his 4 year old son sitting in the type writer and hacking out the finish. How ironic for a movie titled "the end game" has such a poor one. These are the types of films that can move "a" list of actors from the list "b" in hurry. I hope Cuba Gooding JR, and James Woods do not have this habit.
