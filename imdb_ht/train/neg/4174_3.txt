Whoo-boy, which was definitely one of the worst flicks I've seen all summer. Granted, she was on Sci Fi, and I do not look much Sci Fi, but man, talk about a thin razor draw and two dimensional characters in the max. <br /> <br /> The characters were stereotyped and overdone, the plot and environments were incredible, the vampires were less intimidating, the more funny-looking, throat was needed, the special effects were down-right, in? Well, the only unpredictable thing about the end was when suddenly the tomboy becomes a lesbian and begins to do it with the vampire girl, which, by the way, is not really all that hot considers it occurs for about three seconds, which you are closer to "Where the Hell?" Then, "Man, that's hot." If this ever appears in reruns, God forbid, do not look at it.
