Filmography: Excellent, nice angle camera (I do not remember seeing a movie at the end, with good pre-ups, until this one). May have to avoid the scene that has come up with a soft camera. NY is good picture. I liked the angle to bottom, in particular (a different touch). <br /> Music: Not Impressive. Sing by sticking around in your head even after watching the movie. For me, I expect the same kind of "Anniyan". A deception. <br /> <br /> Actor: Kamal needs to slowly pull away from hard-core sections. Her age and belly really show up. Also, it should avoid closing the romantic sequence forward. It was a very awkward to see a mature star / aged trying to play as a hero 20+ scene. Love can be expressed at any age; As we get older, you can always express love nicely from a distance (without touching a woman too much. For example, the love that expresses Rajinikanth in "chandrmukhi"). <br /> <br /> Jyotika just appeared for the omon√® of the movie. Not sure why it is accepted. Well, that's not my problem, I guess. <br /> <br /> Others just have a small presence. <br /> <br /> Directions: I hope Gautham has been expert (or measure-up) in his other film "Kakka Kakka". He was discouraged. It took a long time to publish the film due to various issues. It slips in some scenes. Even festive things got slipped from a famous director. <br /> <br /> Overall: Just an okay movie. Too much graphics. DEFINITION not for children (and adults who expect some types of "Entertainment")
