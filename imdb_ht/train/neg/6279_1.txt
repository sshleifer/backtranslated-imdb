No, <br /> <br /> Basically you look something that does not make sense. To not spoil the movie for those who actually want this take a look at the flick I will explain the story. <br /> A normal day every day, walking down a street then getting into it does not drive by car. She followed her and many events took place during this time including her and her family. <br /> <br /> I especially made an account for comment on this movie, in how horribly writing this was. The act was great, the events were great, but the story just brought it anywhere - it could be added to many and be done in a worldwide epidemic. I'm not sure what the writer tried to accomplish by doing this, usually at the end of the film most of the questions you get the response but this movie you ask, what happened just with 1 hour 20 minutes just over nothing. /> <br /> Spoiler Starts__ <br /> They had this 2-dimensional area (us and behind the glass) that would enter our world and kill us. It was not elaborated on all during the movie, and you never know how it happened or why it was or when it happened. There is nothing to explain during the movie. The main character should not be the same main character. At the end of the film the guy who finally figured it all out and ran away (his sister companion) would be in the main character but the sad movie ended 20 seconds later. <br /> I bought this movie for $ 10, dropping it out right after .. do not waste your time. I really hope nothing like this has been done yet.
