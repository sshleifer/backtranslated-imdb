If you appreciate the revival of Asian horror, do not bother with Gawi. The newly invented film along with A-list works like Ringu, A story of two sisters, healing, and Ju-Sou (or even such good materials as the eye or inner sense). Those movie films and subtleties, unexpected imagery, rich characters, and a Western determination take on the fear. Gawi is nervous along with the rest members and organs of everything that has made Americans horror for the past twenty-five years. The movie tries to combine Asian ghost stories with Hollywood slasher flicker, but it's a bad fit. An aesthetic is tied to dipping the other; guess what? There is no history of their own to say the Ringu planting movies for a evil-born subplot, but the situation is hopeless. Clashes, crap characters, uncertain plot, a dull ghost, hum hum.
