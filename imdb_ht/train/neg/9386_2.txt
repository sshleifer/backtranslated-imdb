In the many films I saw Warren Oates, I came to a definite conclusion, here is one talented person. The first time I saw Mr. Oates back in the 1960s series called Stoney Burke. Since then, I have been following his career well and felt it was destined for great roles. That happened in 1974, when Sam Peckinpah gave him a bill called "Bringing My Head Alfredo Garcia." Of course, his biggest claim to fame was his magnificent role in the 'wild bunch'. I always thought he was able to carry any character of a certain magic, that's until I saw him in this flop. The film is called "Chandler", a tribute to the detective fisted in the 1950s created by Raymond Chandler. Because the summary said it was on a hard nose private eye, I was immediately interested. However, I sat patience of the entire movie and found it to be a dull, ten-interesting, slow speed, twisting, confusing legends that if it had a theme or scheme to have been left on some dark heads you. Collectively with some of Hollywood's best stars, such as Alex Dreier, Mitch Ryan, Gordon Pinsent, Charles McGraw, Richard Loo and Scatman Crothers, this film had enough power to reach Mash five, however, it fizzled over the launch , he went. As a result, one of my favorite actors got stuck in a wrong machine that has never received on the ground. **
