Another British wave cinema. Real estate waste on offer here once again. I can not understand (and even British) why this over the head, patriotic story ever made. Eight years mark you, since the global war has actually ended! Other comments here have been noted on the correction and apparently seamlessly used in archive footage. This is very poorly observed. The archive is in abundance. Model planes swing in the wires of the 'action scenes' such as kit so many children in the wind. The four sequence sequences of four films in the film make us supposedly drawn to the event all Malta. Guinness must have his worst performance ever. Shocking back dog fighting scenes are fighting them. Hawkins will make you all of the death in the map area. Ealing has made many big movies. That's clearly not one of them. They should have stayed away from such compelling robbers!
