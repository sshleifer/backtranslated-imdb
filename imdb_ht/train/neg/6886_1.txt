John Heder was absolutely horrendous in this movie. I felt I was watching a malicious college act for the first time in a student movie. Anna Farris was parried for the neck, not good, but not horrible (plus it's nice). Dianne Keaton should know better. Jeff Daniels has only favored the saving of this movie (though he was poor trial on his part as well). <br /> <br /> All in all, I would avoid this at all costs. I'm just glad I did not pay to see it! John Heder will forever stick to the role of typecast in the 'dorky kid,' unless he does some serious work on his acting chop.
