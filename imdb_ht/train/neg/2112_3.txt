Bela Lugosi plays a doctor who will do anything to keep her young and beautiful. For this, it's bridal drug during wedding ceremonies to make it look as if they are dead so it can steal their bodies. I'm not exactly sure what he does with the body. I do not remember it ever since being fully explained. All I know is that he extract something from them and inject it into his wife. (I'll just guess that it's spinal fluid Spinal Line was all the rage of angry scientists in the 40s.) You can pretty much guess the rest out here. <br /> There are a couple (well, really more than a couple, but I'll just write about two) of the issues that I have with this movie. One is how Bela is used. Sure, he does a decent enough job to sort his own foremost way (BTW, the rest of the cast is simply profound). But they have him hidden in the back of a hearse or whose creep in the female reporter's room does nothing is just funny. Also, why not beat him and / or kill every turn? Does it make him look wrong? Well, someone who is kidnapping comatose bride does not really need to be making them look worse. <br /> <br /> The second problem I have is the idea of ​​marriage medication. Why Marriage? Will not be any girl under 20 years old? Watching Bela goes to these candies to get his victims, I recalled to the idiot fisherman in my always knowing what you did last summer. In each case, there would seem an easier way to reach your goal than hired a seemingly impossible plan that depends on the very way of circumstances out of control. (BTW, an alternate title for this film is the case of the missing brides. I guess that partially explains the need for 'brides'.)
