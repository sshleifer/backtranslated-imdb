I read a few positive reviews of this movie, and it was really surprising at how dreadful everything was. Positions like some cross between AIDS-related stories and some kind of "Ghost" / "Blithe Spirit" stories, this film can not always be upset by what he wants them to do. Simon and Mark are a gay couple who have an "open" relationship - Simon can be anonymous (though safe) sex on the side when he wants. Mark is HIV + and he and Simon do not seem to have a sex life anymore. When Mark died, Simon - who made a referee in closing his emotions after he was rejected years ago by his father - trying to erase his memory and just found himself being a bachelor. It's not that his behavior before Mark's death was so different. But the brand returns to ghostly forms and blur its various sadness, while getting Simon to open up and admit his true feelings. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Simon is such an selfish SOB, it's impossible to feel any sympathy towards him for most of the movie. Since it is supposed to be more sympathetic, it's too late to care. Mark, on the other hand, followed in Demi Moore's footsteps from "Ghost," not to cry abundantly throughout the film. <br /> <br /> There is a rare switch in tone after Mark returns. Suddenly we get some lame attempts at humor, a TV show "Avec." But it does not last long. Once Simon's emotional health is at stake, the whole thing becomes increasingly mawkish, and amateur attempts are wobbly in your heartstrings. The final, and an angel of the muscle-golden boy leading a tearful mark in the sky while a chastened, grief-cry Simon Wave goodbye is just stupefying, primarily because he is not intentionally funny.
