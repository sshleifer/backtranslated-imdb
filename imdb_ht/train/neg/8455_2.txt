"Arahan" adds nothing positive to the genre of kung fu. To compare this confused motion picture with inspirational insanity and Stephen Kev's type of movie is a mistake. The first stage of the fighting is nothing new. All that featured here was made first and best by the likes of Yimou Zhang, Tony Jaa and Jackie Chan. Fighting in Smart Photo Movement Needed Logic. There seems to be no point serving courses that have no damaged effect as in the "Matrix" windows. Attracting the female lead so Yi Yoon captures the screen, but it is never compelling to conquer the physical demands of the role as Ziyi Zhang did so easily into "House of Flying Daggers". Having a martial arts background serves well in Kung Fu movies. To throw inexperienced actors into these skills is a serious mistake (see Aya Ueto's "Asumi") unless you are a very talented director as "Arahan" proves Seung-Wan Ryoo is not.
