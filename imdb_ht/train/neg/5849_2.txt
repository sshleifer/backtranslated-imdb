Being a fan of silent film, I look forward to seeing this picture for the first time. I was very disappointed. <br /> <br /> As mentioned, the film seems to be a long, long, commercial for the Maxwell vehicle. <br /> <br /> Perhaps if the Chase scene was about half the length that it is, I could enjoy the movie more. But it was very fast. And while I acknowledge that reality is extending many times in film, without reducing the viewer's pleasure, what was the Mexican bandits? I mean, they're chasing a car in the hills, a machine that most of the time moves in about a kilometer per hour, but can not catch it?
