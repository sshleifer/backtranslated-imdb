This was probably the worst movie I've ever seen in my life! It was stupid there was no scheme and special effects were ridiculous! And I never saw what they were doing wrong in my life! The only good part about the movie was all the hot guys (especially Drew Fuller). I do not know what those people were thinking when doing this movie !! I did not even want to finish the whole thing because you get to this point in the movie where the guys are all in bed touching themselves. I mean it was like some kind of sick and tight kiddy porn! I would advise anyone who has heard of this movie and was interested in seeing it in just forgetting it and found another movie to watch! I was very disappointed !! The film was all a complete waste on time in my opinion.
