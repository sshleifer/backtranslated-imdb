Doubleganger has its moments, but they are few and far between. <br /> <br /> Essentially, this is a class B mix of pop-sized thriller, ghost story and horror. Drew Barrymore plays a young woman who is haunted by the demons of her past (most of her family was murdered and she was, at least one case, the first suspect), or she just has a really bad case of multiple personality disease? George Newbern is her new spouse, and most of the action centers on her. <br /> <br /> Newbern's character is pretty sympathetic, and both it and Barrymore make decent work (though not exactly good). The mediocre at (at times) completely horrendous script and the impressive directive seems to have combined them with the rest of their performance in oblivion. Character Leslie Hope is memorable, but so disappointing that you will want to forget her. The plot eventually disintegrates into a bifurcated (one archetist is psychological realism, the other is horror surprise) higher than that is so seriously conceived, acting with photos that it effectively counteracts most of what value the movie was has already been realized. <br /> <br /> Overall, the film has the feeling of what might be expected to be the result of M. Knight Shamalyan's first-ever undergraduate film. Acting with the script for the two behaviors are just good enough to take you a little bit about them - at least until the film is hacked completely and completely. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
