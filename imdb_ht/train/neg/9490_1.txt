This is complete and absolute waste, a good example of what a BAD movie is like, this can not appeal to anyone, not even b-movie fans. NOTE, I repeat, DO NOT make your precious life time on this piece of waste. Bad acting, wrong direct, awful (but I mean really awful) script, and complete lack of an idea of ​​what entertainment (in any form) is. I bought the DVD for $ 3, I swore I could almost pay someone to take it. Burning it would not be enough for this movie to have me. I like the b-cinema, killer games, the strange lagoon monsters, but this is nowhere near. Do you know these movies are so bad funny? Not even. Just plain ancient pathetic.
