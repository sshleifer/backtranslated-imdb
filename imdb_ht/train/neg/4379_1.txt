<br /> Ok, well I was renting this movie while I was dogging was pulled up on pain killers, and let me say, He did not help the movie any. is about a man who buys a car as it passes through a midlife crisis, he likes the car more than anything around him, one day his wife decided to borrow the car. Since I do not want to spoil (not having anything to spoil) I'll let your imagination figure out the "Zany" (and I use this lightly) antique word that follows. <br /> I had to fight to stay awake in this hack a minute trainer in a movie, and I would like to say that if you are advantageous in the movie store and are thinking about being adventurous, please do not, it's a waste of the movie it was printed on. <br /> Then again I could be wrong ...
