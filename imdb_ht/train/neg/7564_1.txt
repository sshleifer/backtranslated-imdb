Man of Wicker. I'm so angry that I can not write a proper comment on this movie. The plot was ridiculous, thinly tied together, and all along-just lame. Nicolas Cage ... shame on you! I assume that since you were in it, it would be at least decent. It was not .. I felt like big parties in the movie lived on the chairs room off, and even though it's the full-movie was just weird and funny. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I have never heard many people leaving a theater on the opening day and hating a lot. People were complaining about it in small groups at the mall, four floors down from the theater near the entrance. It is that bad. <br /> I heard it compared to: glitter, American werewolf in Paris and Gigli. My companion was so upset that he did not even talk about it. <br /> <br /> Grrrr!
