Well, basically, the film courses! She's Witch Blair meets Sean Penn's sick on getting to Iraq to show the world what "War on Terror" is really over. The script sounds like it was written by 8th grade (no offensive to 8th grade); of the main actors on-the-act movie all; They used the wrong type of camera and wrong kind of movie (not that I knew anything about things - but it just did not look real documentaries I looked), and the worst of all Christians Johnson took a great idea and make it suck. He reminded me of the time I tried to draw a picture of my dog ​​and ended up with a really bad looking stick figure looking more like a giant turtle. I'd rather look at Blair Witch VIII, than sit in that again.
