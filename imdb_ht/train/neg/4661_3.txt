This film has Richard Pryor, Rosey Grier and others. He is a curious WW2 film, and serves as a declaration of racism. It is worth looking to understand the fact that Movies reflects how we feel about their problems when they are produced and not over the period of time shown. That means this film is a 70's by a 40's film (WW2). Still, there are some good action scenes of 7 seven black men led by a white capstan trying to take a dam. The center's story about the Captain learned that these guys are soldiers and not just a service company. There is a scene that might come from a Civil War movie and not a WW2 movie that reflects what the movie is all about. Black Lt gives a German woman an innocent peck on the cheek, and the white becomes mad. I enjoyed the movie from a point of curiosity since the stars and the genre was interesting to me.
