"I love New York" is another entry by VH-1 (MTV network) that shows the entertaining side of dating a shrill, obnoxious, woman. It must have been an easy decision to take the most cheese, Ebonics talk, crazy contestants - and her mom - and give them a show on this network. Many will argue, "this is a show." True, it's not as bad as it's before show, "Taste of Love" - ​​but it's just as bad. <br /> It reminds me of a sketch from the 90's show in "Living Color" where Keenan Ivory Wayans imitated Mike Tyson's boxer on the "Love Connection" dating show and chose "Robin Givens" for a date. Mike talked about how the date was okay, but how the obnoxious mother kept butting in. This show reminds me of that. <br /> <br /> The guys are choosing and giving names to degrade themselves and the woman that's dating more - (I would think an intelligent man looking for an intelligent woman would not allow her - and her mother - give you a names that are so ghetto, you will be embarrassed yourself every time you appear on TV.) But these are professional actors reality, so why bother. <br /> She saved me to discover what's so fun about all of this. The fact that this is as fraught as adding new to his implant? 15 minutes of fame and hundreds of thousands of dollars in time ad for the network? (Well, you can not hate them to try to make a buck.) Perhaps the wonder is - who wants to be with this woman over an hour? Or ask if she and her mother's next show should be on the WWF! Either way you slice it, it's a wreck train you've seen countless times before that now the value of shock is down to null. No twist or spin will make this a more exciting raft, or any different from any of the others. Appeals to the lowest common denominator and for those who call an "end" of reality show, this is just another nail in the coffin as to why they should end, immediately.
