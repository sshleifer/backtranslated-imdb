This is a weak end: it lacks interest and touches the magnificent "man called horses" in almost every aspect and when compared to each other they hardly seem to have the same. is almost a parody of the first and try to evoke different American ceremonies but come across as trying too hard to bottle the magic of the first. In this film the tribe is lost and abandoned, lost its servants, modern lives landed on paradise and are living in lust and poverty. Perhaps this is the point: the first movie took us to a place where we would want to be, a simpler time. This takes us to break Indians into a miserable world and the White Man is the hero and savior who rather negates the whole idea of ​​the movie. <br /> <br /> The beauty of the first lie in the fact that the white man learns and discovers that real civilization lies in value rather than western materialism. In the second film this is all but missing and so we end up with a weak film. <br /> A great disappointment.
