Hope a combination of scifi and film periods on Ada Lovelace, Charles Babbage, the story of computer, etc., I was disappointed by this nonsensical pseudoscience film and mix of real and fabulous stories. He gives the impression that his writer (Lynn Hershman-Leeson) has no real understanding of the mathematics, technology, or history of the film, but it works instead of a sort of soft artistic impression in them. This striking a painful spot with me, as I have long been irritated by trends in glum art and awfully misuse of science terms and ideas at the point of confusion, such as: Emmy Coer: "Information waves have a half-life" Ada: "I'm not sure that half a lifetime is better than no life at all." This movie does worse than fail to entertain - it misinforms. The only thing that I can imagine is that it might attract a viewer to learn about the subject so badly damaged. Most likely, I think, promoting a superstar perception of science and technology at any degree of advancement as confused from magic.
