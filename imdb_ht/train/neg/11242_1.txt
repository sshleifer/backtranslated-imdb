I saw this movie last month in a free sneak preview and I walked out. It was very hideous. In the process of trying too hard, they act on and made a terrible movie. I was ashamed since I felt all the actors had made respectable in the past for this one could not be far beyond the brand - but I was wrong. I hoped to give a survey at the end of the movie so I could say they did not release this movie. I was drawn to by the free aspect of the glimpse, but it turned out to be a waste of my time - and, generally, I am very amused. He tried to be innovative and creative with the shots, ideas and filming, but because they were thrown together many ideas at once, he failed. I'm not usually serious about movies and I usually do not feel the need to show my opinion on movies but I warn everyone not to watch it. I'm recording IMDb just to tell everyone you guy
