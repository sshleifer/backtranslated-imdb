Geez! This is one of the movies that you think you've already reviewed but you did not. I mean, you did not give a crap about it but somehow it came to your mind. <br /> <br /> To be honest and short; This is one of the worst, boring, and stupid silly ever. I can not say anything good about this piece of crap because there are so many decent sequences that might have been said by professional film makers. Death scenes are terrible, bloody, stupid. The plot is somehow good taking into account that it copies "Popcorn" from 1991. <br /> To make things even worse, this is not a movie so bad that it's fine. It's just plain bad. <br /> Molly Ringwald tried to do it better, but it was not enough.
