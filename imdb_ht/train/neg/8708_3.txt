Like all the Carnosaur movies, this is a joke. The path dinosaurs move, remind me of my sister's play with her dolls, because they can not be any sting or more fake than they were. The plot had no sense too. I mean, first they're on a bus, then in a storage then, all of a sudden, they're on a boat. And let's be serious, does it make sense that a couple of dinosaurs can stay together on a van, or on a boat? I thought dinosaurs were the largest animals, and now they can fit on a moving wind. It sounds stupid even when you think about it. <br /> <br /> The only reason for that I gave this a 3 is because it's still fun. I found it better than the first one (do not look the second again). Just do not rent it. I saw it on TV and it's a good thing I did because I would not want to waste its rented money.
