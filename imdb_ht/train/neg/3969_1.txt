I wrote this because I somehow felt they were led to believe black tea was a good movie. Also it is not the worst I've seen, it certainly is not good. <br /> A weak script, weak actors, and weak LEDs. Even if they can not pay big names, would it be too much to ask for a more attractive actress? She was painful to watch a plain actress in the movie out and her dull performance. The story was a clich√© and wrong scripted. Special effects were minimal. "Sispens" that tricky workers repeatedly here were difficult to swallow. <br /> <br /> To be fair, black is not worse than quite some of the Masters of Horrors' episodes. But not quite on par with movie quality again. Dark remedies are only recommended for the hardcore horror fans who do not want to miss any movie in the genre, even if it's a wrong one. As for anyone else, time should be spent on something that is more valuable - that would be very easy.
