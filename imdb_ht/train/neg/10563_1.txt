Time spent watching this film was time to waste. I'm not flu fiction science. I do not reject any genre each is, since good work can be done in any genre. This movie, however, is not good work. I can not visual the visuals (not involving foreign makeup), and the special effects are impressive. The story did not come out-and-out BAD, for a comic book trekkish. But the fx visuals were obviously all the interests of the musicians / attention / money away. The direction changed between sluggish and confusing (one was not at all sure exactly who did that and what with whom at least an important moment). The "act" was mostly very bad indeed. There was no basis in most of the reading lines besides a hint of "It was that way on the page and the director told me I was supposed to be angry / sad / scary / whatever. Okay, so It was a SF series pilot. Since an excuse for shoddiness is correctly in areas when it should be considered essential in a dramatic way. I am surprised the pilot sells the series. Or is the money also in the hands of technerds?
