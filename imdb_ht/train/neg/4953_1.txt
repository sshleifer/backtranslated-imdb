I never commented on IMDb before, but I feel there after watching the Batman animation. Its absolute trash! Warner Brothers had the perfect animation series of Batman in the early 90s so what the hell are doing trying to mess with the formula winning? I feel like a letter complaining to WB. The original animation was black and brooding, exactly the way Batman was intended. WB was messing up this with some Batman Triplets in the future. Now they are producing this drivel. The joker does not remotely resemble the Joker from DC Funny. DC should call. I encourage everyone who agrees with me in email or write WB and uses people to get back the original formula
