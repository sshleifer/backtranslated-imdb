To put it simply, I'm not western fans. And he never sat in one from the beginning beginning, I decided to look "I Darling Clementine" and see it all the way through, no matter how painful he was for me. At first he was excruciating as expected. I found the act to be ridiculous, the scenery (dessert standard, horse and cowboys) boring and the music and its distributions teetering on the painful edge. However, after mental pep is talking to myself to struggle over, after the first 20 minutes he began to be a bit easier to support. Focusing on the cinema, and how John Ford managed to make the same dullest situations (dulled according to me that is) look quite stunning at times, made it a lot more interesting. <br /> In conclusion, I can not go so far as to say that I enjoyed the movie at its end. However, he did well enough for me to sit all the way to the very end, and that in itself impressed me.
