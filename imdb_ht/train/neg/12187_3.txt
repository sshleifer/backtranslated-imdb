Worst De Niro Scorsese collaboration in this terrible violent disaster relief. Scorsese is totally out of his element in this movie with the sudden stereotype horror loud ringing clamor and slamming slamming that looks ridiculous and embarrassing to come from like a master craftsman. The cast is totally wasted here and the southern accent is very annoying and forced. Nick Noltie plays the wimpiest lawyer in history who would ever believe he can defend anyone! The Psycho Bowden de Niro is nothing more than the typical 90 psycho-typical psycho killer. The scene with De Niro and Lewis early on is very awkward and the climax goes on and on and we all would be more than tired of the never-ending psycho stalker. One of my most terrible movie experiences. Its original rent is 100 times better. <br /> <br />
