I watched this video at a friend's house. I'm glad I did not waste money buying this one. The video covers a scene from the movie Capricorn One 1975. The movie starts out with several clips of missile-ups, most not related to theft of spacecraft. Smoking Smoking Guns is a short video clip of the astronauts who prepare a video broadcast. He modifies his own voice instead of letting us know what the crew said. The video surgically ends with a show in the Zapruder movie. Claiming on radiation, protection, star photography, and others brought me to believe it is very ignorant or there are some sort of ax tossing against NASA, astronauts, or Americans in general. His science is bad, and so is this video.
