So great recruitment in history continues Hollywood style. <br /> <br /> This was absolute ridiculous garbage. <br /> <br /> It's my shock that can be such an amazing amount of money they can spend to produce what is most comparable, wrong to act the correct movie I've ever seen. It is appalling. <br /> Nic Nicage's flirtation with severe acting. I can only assume that leaving Las Vegas was a glitch in an otherwise litany movie of terrible movie. <br /> <br /> Diane Kruger proves that her performance in Troy had no fluke, it really can not act. Harvey Keitel should be ashamed of working on these trials. <br /> Only recommends that either recuperate into a contemporary lobotomy or person in an opinion that America invented the world.
