This film is a lot like the movie host, except with * BAD * acting and not much suspense. The Gore elements have, but you do not really feel anything for the characters, which makes the violence not very effective. Some parts are just strange ... like forcing a snake down someones throat. What's up with that? Is this supposed to be frightening or gory? It's just stupid. As for torture, there really is not any (except for the guy getting layer-torched at the start, where they do not show anyway). The bad guys keep saying "make them dead slowly," but the butcher killed them very quickly. Deaths are all relatively quick. Yes, I looked at the "unrated" version. So in general, not the worst Gore movie I've seen, but not really either. You will not miss anything if you skip this one.
