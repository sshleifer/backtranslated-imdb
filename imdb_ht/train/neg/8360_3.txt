What's love about this movie ??? <br /> It's Color! <br /> It has some impressive underwater photography! <br /> It has a rhythmic music note in the background that works well at times! <br /> So, 3 out of 10! <br /> <br /> Sometimes the music is up! Especially when the shark or cruel are about to move! <br /> <br /> Sometimes it slows down! As if to hear the audience it's about to be time for sympathy! <br /> <br /> As another one bite the dust! As if in a "Western Spagetti" this has a lot of similarity! <br /> <br /> It's not that the Italians can not produce quality production! There were a series of TV cinema and a title like "Octopus" counting on 1 to 7, screening on SBS TV in Australia in the 1990s on mafia-type conflicts! And they were excellent! But alas, you will not find it here !!! <br /> I suppose he's done over 1960s! Unfortunately it was 20 years out of date, as evidenced by a funeral scene near the end! <br /> <br /> Then there was the razor-sharp bite of the quick shark that made for a red dirt repeatedly emerging in the blue waters! <br /> In the middle of it all, either in bar-room brawl or by observing the latest coastal demolition side by the hungry relentless shark, the hero's hero looks over in his glasses of little anxiety, as if he's too bored in unrelenting role among a lack of evidence of plotting or character development of anyone! <br /> <br /> At least the hero indicates a passenger anxiety intermittently, for his ex-wife! But of course, even if the music fails to awaken our realization, we have the disaster sound of the baddies' voices, as if we are nudging that another dark paper is on them out! <br /> <br /> And near the end, someone thought of a twist! Just when we thought it was all totally predictable! But stay tuned, folks, so you can get another twist! If you look good! For, more or less, warm your heart! <br /> Follow the advice of the hero, and have a few beers along the way! It will make your look at "night of the sharks" more enjoyable! <br /> Then you'll be ready for something like a movie "007" to facilitate your way back to reality then it's about !!!
