Massacre is a film directed by Andrea Bianchi (Ground Territory) and produced by legendary Italian legendary director Lucio Fulci. Now with this mix of great talents you would think that this movie would have a true Gore fest. This could not be more out of that. Massacres fell right on his face as being one of the most boring slasher films I've seen from Italian cinema. I was actually struggling to stay awake during the movie and I never had that problem with Italian horror films. <br /> <br /> Massacre starts out with a hooker being killed along the way with an ax. This scene was used by the Fulci Nightmare Concert. This is not a bad scene and raises your expectations of the movie as a touching ax is killing. Unfortuanitly, the next hour of the movie is SO boring. The movie goes on a series of horror movies being filmed and has a lot of character development throughout the scenes, but the characters in the movie are so dull and seriously acting your interest to start shedding away. The last 30 minutes of the film are not so bad but still could be best. The throat of the film was pathetic and since Fulci was used most of the Gore scenes at Nightmare Concert there was nothing new here. The end of the film left a beautiful twist but still has a lot of unanswered and the continuity falls straight to the floor. This was not a very good movie, but for a true Italian freak (like myself) this film is a must have since it's very rare. 4/10 stars
