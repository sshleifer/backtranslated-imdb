*** THIS IS THIS ISOLATED, GOLF, NOT MY QUESTION, THAT IS A PATANLY OBVIOUS **** <br /> O my God, where am I starting? Well, here - this is my first time ever to come home from a movie, saying "I have to get on IMDb and write a review right now. It's my civic duty." These are bad things in flick of films. <br /> <br /> * start digression * But let me just indicate one thing before I start. I'm not a few Harvard-art-great-movie-noir-weenie (in fact, I went to college at the other end of Mass. Ave in Cambridge, one of the real people smart without father dad and money away , which should put me downright into the nerd-that-obsessively-loving-comic-book-movie censored band, and I still hate this film ...). My viewing preferences are for highbrow cinemas writers including the Dead Hards, Bond Flicks, Clerks, and Grail. I wish the titan never flew, not so much for their lives lost, but so we would not have been subjected to this dump-in a movie. With the sole and only reason I'll watch a French art film snooty is whether there is a young and often incredible Emmanuelle Beart in it. I even gave maximum Overdrive one of its 10s precious presents here on IMDb, for God's sake. So I'm as deep as they come, so I do not criticize this movie because I'm looking for some standard of cinema excellence - it's because Elektra feels like a three-week old goat goat. * end digression * <br /> OK, there is plenty of cruelty here that I have to try to categorize it. Here goes: <br /> <br /> MS. GARNER: One of the convincing reasons a man wants to see this flick is to see many hot jg (I have no idea why my wife wanted). I think between this and "Finding Nemo", the latter was the movie sexier. Do you know the red outfit announced in every freaking announcement you see? You see it in it TWICE - once at the start, once at the end. Bummer. In the rest, it basically seems that Morrissey would look like it was a girl - lots of pouting and black dress. Which brings me to the incredible series of expressions of the JGar show of acting - from "pouting" all the way to "pouting and crying". Oh my God, you would think he was forced to date Ben Affleck or something terrible like that. For, wait ... <br /> <br /> THE GAD / GAL GUIDE: They are shown on the same series of expressions and ability to act that you would expect from a slightly overpriced grapefruit. At least next to JGar's performance, he does not stand out too badly. One guy's role is to stand up and be great, the other is standing there and there are things out of it, and the role of the woman is to stand up and breathe over and / or kiss people. They managed to pull these incredible feats. The bad guys have the most difficult role in all - it has a SIMULTYLAY) looks angry and b) looks Asian. He does a great job. I think there was a fifth bad guy, but my brain started to block parts of this movie from self-defense. <br /> <br /> TWISTS PLOT! This film has many surprises as a talk at the National Democratic Convention. Let's just put it in that way - my wife, who was only in the U.S. for half a year and she speaks only a small amount of English - this word is' when the girl first appears in pad JG , and I swear by God I do not do this: "She goes to the house to kill girls. And dad too." And this is before the father had even appeared on the screen. Now my wife is not stupid, but she was not crowned by Mensa for her gift, either, and she had zero exposure to Daredevil or genre of comic books. And he calculated this from .00015 seconds with no prodding and no previous information. These are the blatant evidence of this movie. <br /> RELIEF-SUPER-SUPPORT SUPPORT! OK, so there's this great dude in the movie. He can take a chest of explosive shotgun and brush off the shot as it's curved, and he can take a greedy Electra stitched in the chest and just bend the metal (or dissolve it - or something - more defensively kicking in, says God thanks). But JG jumped on his head, and he exploded? An Achilles Noggin? OK! These are self-numbing sort of this movie. <br /> <br /> Ack. I start to feel a cerebral eruption coming up, so I have to stop. But you were warned. If you have to intentionally cut your own tires to prevent yourself from going to see this movie, do it. But if Armageddon is coming, please let it be> before <this from DVD.
