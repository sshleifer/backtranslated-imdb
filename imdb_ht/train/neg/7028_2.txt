Somewhere between the Food Court and the Zip Code, the mall in this movie <br /> <br /> There is an explosive shop. This is the only place the title character <br /> can buy bombs in it plant in the mall in the dull final. <br /> A fictional city has a new shopping mall, built on some countries that have been sentenced. Cute girl (I did not catch her name) gets a job as a waitress <br />. She lost her boyfriend in a fire at the site where the mall stood. The owner of the mall will employ the arsonist <br /> responsible for the fire as a security guard after his first safety. Rob Estes, before "Stalkings Night," is a photographer / photographer trying to find a story. She hooks up with cute little girl, <br /> and their mutual "funny" friend Pauly Shore, and try to find out if Eric <br /> is still alive. It is, living in basement at mall (?) And traveling <br /> <br /> in the air ducts and offending different people who upset her <br /> <br /> ex girlfriend, including arsonist la. Eventually, she kidnaps her <br /> and the final involves the bomb and everyone runs out of the stage <br /> before the big kablooey. Morgan Fairchild is together for the ride <br /> as the mayor ... yes he is the mayor. Of course, you probably do not need a plot to draw since all of the story is in the title. A person named Eric is taking revenge against people <br /> as a ghost of a mall. This also means no suspension <br />. We know Eric is behind this, but we still have to see <br /> Estes and pretty girls go to the motions of an investigation. <br /> Look like Fairchild, who we know has been in cahoots and the mall owner all along, pulling a gun on our heroic duo in the middle of a crowded party, but no one says words as he leads them to his office desk, and eventually death it. The fictional city is great, but it's not a police <br /> ever, everyone depends on the safety of the shopping mall. <br /> <br /> Eric was hiding since the mall was built, but I'm not sure <br /> <br /> place. It seems live in a basement area, but you would think <br /> some construction workers would find it. It also has <br /> furnished pad love well, and found a few outlets, since it <br /> <br /> there is electricity. It might be nicer than your own apartment! <br /> <br /> Pauly Shore fans, both of us, take notes. It tricks a security guard <br /> from its booth by mooning the camera. Yes, stop scanning <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />: .. <br /> <br /> This is just junk, with positive evidence that I go down to rent just <br /> about anything in the video store to stay in the horror section. This movie <br /> is not Eric's revenge, it's the Movie Maker's revenge for me <br /> being dumb enough to watch it. Here is my revenge: I do not <br /> recommend it. This is rated (R) for physical violence, some gun violence, gore, some profanity, some female nudity, kidnapping, and some sexual content.
