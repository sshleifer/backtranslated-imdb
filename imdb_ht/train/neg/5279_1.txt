My friends usually can put up with a lot of hopeless movies but this one was too poor for us to look at it in the end. It was just boring and unoriginal. Not even the "hot girls" that play in this movie can keep me watched. Everything was just predictable and annoying. The act was at good times ... but more times bad. The most annoying character of the whole movie that you just wanted to die would be to make the main character's best character. The more I saw him more I wanted to break my screen. (you know what fat boy I'm talking about) <br /> <br /> The plot has been doing many times before I think they should be sued by other film companies. OK, it is a good idea, but that all this movie was. <br /> Overall, this movie can only be watched if not self, to save any abuse from your friends. Or, if you have absolutely nothing better to do.
