If you want to see clever, philosophical discussions about human potential and potential, see "waking life," which is brilliant. "What's the # # * we know" is all over the place of its focus, poorly directed, poorly written, wrongly acting, completely devoid of any artistic art and completely annoying. It was not thought-provoking or fun at the slightest. The inclusion of this freak "Ramtha freak" in this film is just enough to avoid it. Is not it strange how the filmmakers choose to look at the fact that this woman adores some 2,000 years old Atlantic god or something? What a flick of old chick is, and what a total garbage of my time and this movie money was. Those responsible for this movie should not be allowed to make another movie ever again.
