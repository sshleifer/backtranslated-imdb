For a set of fans, I must admit that Frontier Hide is not at all wrong. But this series review can not be based on whether it is a fan series or not. The initiative itself is commendable. Creativity too. I guess these are people with ordinary jobs, and a great enthusiastic heart for Star Trek. But do all this work. Pull all these resources. When taking all this time, and you're still all those flaws. <br /> First of all acting, with the terrible lines. For most. The dialogues are part of the 70's military show, not the Star Trek. The commander (Mr Squinty) seems to be in the laugh at anytime. And most characters are just reading the lines. Directors should be aware of the fact that "retake" is not just a word in the dictionary. But I guess that the series was made in the manner of "Two Takes Frakes", which led many of the TNG episodes and movies also, I can not help but think most of the actors are typical trekkies. Without going deeper into this assumption. <br /> <br /> My biggest concern about the whole project is the quality of releases. When they first decided to spend a lot of time, and resources on this series - why did not they make it available in decent quality? Using the quick time format, low resolution is a waste of talent. Even the epigrams "higres" are considered high quality compared to the standard quality range released in. Using Xvid Codecs, with a larger resolution and file size would enhance the massive experience. If the tape and problem were the problem, set up a torrent tracker should resolve it. <br /> Let's hope the crew decides to pull the set up, and maybe release it on DVD, giving it the quality the project deserves.
