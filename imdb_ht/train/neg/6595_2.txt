I put this movie in the hotel room to entertain my kids on the morning we left home, because I was busy away from all the games. (Baby does not like to watch "Regis and KAthie Lee" or "The View.") My old year old card was found to be a funny scene, but he told me the rest of it was "too funny." This is ONE YEAR, YES. Anyone on the age, say, nine will want to kill the TVs rather than leaving this one playing himself out. <br /> <br /> To tell this movie is bad as saying the Holocaust was a little mistake. There is no word for how ridiculous and awful this "movie" really is. The act is bad, the plot is stupid, and the script is unfunny enthusiastically. Since this is supposed to be a comedy, the fact that you can not even laugh at the bad stuff in the movie makes it even worse. Bronson "Balki" Pinchot is the worst with some unusual fake accents (Irish-Pakistani-Bronx-Cockney-Cajun as far as I could say), but all the characters are terrible. I have not looked at a real Laurel and Hardy movie at age, but I know they've gotten way better than this. What is the point of damaging a classic classic Duo and ... this? <br /> <br /> Bottom line: Garbage Derivatives. Avoid all expenses unless you have some brushes Branson Pinchot fetish. 2/10
