First, IFC runs Town and Country, and now this. The difference between this stinker and this Pink Panther rip-off is that Town and Country have watched. This is not. <br /> I can only suppress that the cast was signed so that they could go off in Europe over another two in dime. Belushi is especially disappointing. Scenes and candies (making a Z-class Dom DeLuise) were tortured. Speaking of torture, five minutes at the talentless shepherd, and I bet the prisoners in Gitmo would crack like walnuts! <br /> <br /> The real "Crime" (besides this being green-light) is Shepherd's character: a witty wife who takes a Monte Carlo Casino for a half-million dollars! If you buy that, I have some oceanfront properties in Arizona you might be interested in!
