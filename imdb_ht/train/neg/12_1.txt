All I could think of while watching this film was B-grade slope. Many people have talked about how to smack it out is how this movie shows such a realistic representation of drug effects and a person with their subsequent spiral in an independent perpetual state of unfortunate events. But really, the techniques used (as many have already mentioned) was too much, and so compelling and irrelevant to the movie as a whole. <br /> <br /> As far as the plot is concerned, it has been substandard, inimaginable, implausible and entangled. You can read more about this movie and will say so much as I would. <br /> <br /> Granted some of the actors and actresses are attracted, but when confronted with the boring actions ... may seem only to bring a movie so far. The action is poor and intermittent: a few punches thrown here and there, with a final gunfight towards the end. There is nothing really written on your home. As others have said, 'BAD' movies are great to look for the many reasons that they are 'bad', or revel in this fact. This movie, however, is canceled. It's nothing. In addition, if one really needs an educational films to spare away drug use, I would definitely recommend any of the other outside movies that chart these issues in a much more effective way. 'Requiem for a Dream', 'Trainspotting', 'Fear and Praise in Las Vegas' and 'Candy' are just some examples. Even if someone should also check out some of the most proud movies on the same topic as 'Jump' (in general, both serious and funny) and 'Halfbaked'. <br /> In a final note, the one possible to pick up lines in this movie, delivered by Vinnie Jones stolen from 'Lock, stock' and 'Smokling' barrel. To think that a bit of this big movie was attached by 'packed' is vile. <br /> In general, I strongly suggest that you save your money and time you do not see this movie.
