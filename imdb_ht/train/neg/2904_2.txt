If, in the first 10 minutes of this movie, you do not realize that the main character, who writes a column of life guidance, will have the tables-oh-so-cunning-turn and learn some vital life lessons itself, then there is probably something wrong with you. The configuration is so predictable as to break the movie, though the rest of the movie was good (which it is not) <br /> There's almost no chemistry between the leads, and Steve Carell's stalker-eye behavior is embarrassing , not funny. It's hard to believe Binoche's character would have any interest in it. Then at the end it's all wrapped up wonderful and everyone lives happily ever after. Is not that great America!
