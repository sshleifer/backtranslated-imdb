The first there is nothing wrong with studying Daniel, Revelation, Matthew 24, Isaiah and other prophetic scriptures. There is also nothing wrong with doing a movie like this in an attempt to present the gospel message. So I feel with this movie are not in either sincerity or aspiration. As a Christian, though an amillenialist, I believe there will be great tribulation and I believe Christ will return as he has said so much. So, even if I have disagreements with this movie about the rapture that is not why I would like this movie so much. <br /> No, what makes me this movie rate so low is not her sincerity or its message, but rather its lack of output value, terrible script, mediocre act, and pitiful FX. This film hangs down with some of the cheesiest sicily frauds in the 1950s. No, this movie hangs down with Plan 9 from Outerspace. This movie failed to be well-old and was probably dating by the time they made an end. <br /> <br /> The Apocalypse movie genre producer could learn how not to do a movie ending from this, but they failed. Behind the back row, the Apocalypse series, and the Omega Code series all failed to learn in this because they address the FX issues with issues of dated look, but the scripts are still poor, and acting are wooden. <br /> <There are many Christian films, with extremely low budget, but this movie is not one of them. I seize the MST3K crew never this one lamp.
