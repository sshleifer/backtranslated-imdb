We expect something great when we went to see this bomb. It is basically a Broadway play set on film. The music is terrible. There is not a memorable song in the movie - to hear any hits from this movie? You will not be because no. Some of the music numbers go on as long as I got up to go to the bathroom and get some pop corn and it's always gone when I was back! If they were good songs well - but they suck. The speed is slow, terrible character development. The lead was praised for singing, but sounding like it broke all songs - it was almost impossible to stand. This film has nothing to offer to anyone, but hardway enthusiasts Broadway. This is without a doubt most on movie rated I've seen in my whole life. A full waist of time and money. There is nothing memorable about this film except Danny Glover - who was not on enough screen and his character was not developed enough. Rent the video and you will agree - this movie was an expensive, on products, polished dogs do.
