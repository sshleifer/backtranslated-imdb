I have never heard of this one before the owner of my local DVD leash rental mentioned it to me; being a 1980s horror movie with the notorious elegance of being banned from U.K. I decided to check it out. The movie turned out to be a dull, amateur and ugly-looking ride; The sound recording is so poor that dialogue is half unintelligible in the time, whereas the act gives new meaning to the word inept! <br /> <br /> What's worse, the movie follows the roundtable formula tired of a trio of young girls being involved in an accident and finding themselves shelter in a dysfunctional family of environments remote. Soon, one of the girls goes to look for help and never heard of again; another, always bed-dog, quickly disposed of (after being forgotten for most of the duration). The heroine is one of the most communicating with the three inhabitants of the home: an arrest of a bib-encouraging mother (his lousy overacting), his daughter reprimanded (and long suffering), and the weirdo letter brothers who occasionally appear on the bottled scene on the sleeping guests. <br /> <br /> Frequently resorting to dinner-table reminiscing by the man-hatred mom (as a means of filling in the sad, they say nothing of unoriginal backstory) and which consistently develops sparring mother-child spouses Fi, the movie has one ace up its sleeve - the twist end is as unexpected as it is inventive spirit, but it does little to remove the bad taste left in the mouth by the movie (as much through the lameness in it all as the gander intermittently) or the inevitable feeling of having wasted 80 minutes of my time ...
