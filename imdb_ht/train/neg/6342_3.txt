I've collected this in the video store because of Tarantino's recommendations ("If you do not like (this), go f & ^% yourself!") On the box ... seemed like an endorsement ringing. .. I was expecting something a bit more like "Evidence of Death" ... not many real violence in this one, or draw, character, or dialogue. <br /> <br /> Look at the poster. It all has. Cascades, and stones. He goes back and forth. A week or so in the life of a band that makes a magic magic show, at a level that you might possibly see in one of the smaller casinos in the strip, and a new Aussie stuntman in town finds his footsteps. They worked, they met the girls and went away. End of the story. The group obviously needs all of this because they are frankly second-tier, and plays a style that was already dating in 1978. It has to be said that the cascade bits in the movie are really spinetingling - that Aussie fellow really is something , and the film looks largely motivated by love and respect for the "art". I hung her to see what crazy thing she would do next. Just want it could get a better car.
