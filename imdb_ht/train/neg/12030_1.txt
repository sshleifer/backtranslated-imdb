'Our Barbeque Baptist' is the best movie ever to do. Now that I got your attention and that marking exactly that should be an offense hanging if speaking, let me start my beauty short on this tacky, offensive, pretentious and boring couple of junk guys you might consider a movie. First of all, the low budget of this stinker is totally evident based on the very poor and inexperienced direction of Christian Vuissa, with the pathetic, overwhelming preaching, whiny and vicious scenario by F. Mathew Smith. I really despise the fact that it sends a very pro-Mormone, and the sort of anti-all other religious message. Yes, the story is about a half-town filled with Mormons and half full of Baptism. It shows all the main and role-patterns of the characters being the Mormon, and they were so beautiful and perfect, yet they were taken over by the evil, compelling and many judgmental births. It shows how beautiful Mormon and how cold-hearted and ignorant Baptists, instead of showing a little solidarity as would be appropriate and realistic. I'm part of neither religion (I actually an atheist), but this confused me, with another amount of number of boxing most likely. It shows Baptists that they were very unopened and unwelcoming Mormons, and Mormons were very accepted, when again, in reality there is a mutual like / grip between them. Sorry, I do not mean going on a luck. <br /> Another aspect of 'Our Barbeque Baptist' I did not care very much, was acted. Performance is very amateur and unnatural, especially from Heer lead to Heather Beers. Miss Beers slows his way into his party without any passion or feels for his role, and I was not too impressed with Dan Merkley, who's the main character of this substandard in a motion picture, but I said he is more talented way or show more talent in this movie by Heather Beers. Anyone who plays the city sheriff was also terrible. Although there may be a deep laugh in the film, it's all the glories. For example, the main character, Tartan (Merkley), finds awareness with a Native American Indian who always gives him the best advice on things related to a tribal way of life - how is it that? To make the situation even more of a pathetic clich√©, Tartan buys the poor, lonely nation of a puppy dog. Ugghhh! <br /> If you want my advice, stay away from 'Baptists in our Barbecue' as you can. I saw it on the shelf and thought it would be a nice and interesting little self on religion. All I got was a well, piece of crap. Grade: D - <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br/> One (a near-perfect masterpiece); A- (excellent); B + (large); B (very good); B- (good); C + (a mixed bag); C (average); C- (irritating); D + (move); D (very bad); D- (absolutley lurid); F (not one kind of redemption of this couple in Hollywood poop).
