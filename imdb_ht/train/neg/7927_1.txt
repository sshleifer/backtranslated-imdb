This movie is AWESOME. I watched her the other day with my cousin Jay-Jay. He said he was fine, but I think he's RULEZZZ! I mean, it's so cool. Ted V. Mikels is so brave and clever. She has made a movie totally unlike these Hollywood movie holes, like the uterus and STOP or my mom will shoot. It could be better, though. I love ninjas and pirates. I also like the great heel that the funny man puts. I think it is the coolest guy since Claymation guys prefer dominoes. Not only does this movie look really cool, such as my out-of-focus movie my dad did at my birthday when I turned 6. BW told a complex story with dozens of characters that seem to be totally associate , but they all meet up at last. It's engineering how this website is woven to make everything meet up. I wish Ted Mikels would make an end. But he needs more aliens. With a boat.
