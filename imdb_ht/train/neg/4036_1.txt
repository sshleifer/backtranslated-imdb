Almost from the word goes this movie is poor and lacking conviction, but then again most people would struggle to show commitment to a script as uninspiring like this. The dialogue really does not flow and sometimes as in this case more is less (or should). This also leans-up by odd scenes (eg slow-motion cemetry) that you think might lead somewhere, but only seems to waste a few more seconds in your life. The plot is a strange combination of gangster / comedy situations that I certainly seemed a good idea at the time, but if ever there was a case for someone who needs to be honest with the scriptwriter Then here was it. Martin Freeman is okay but then he looks like a character that always plays so I start wondering if he gave a script or just filmed, saying he reacted as normal. <br /> <br /> Finally - humor. This reminds me of 'Python (I think) quote on Shakespere, in his' comedy' - if he meant it to be funny he would have a joke in it. Well I did not see one. <br /> Do not waste your time - I did because I watched her with a friend and kept hoping she was going to get better. <br /> /> It was not.
