My goodness is this bad movie. I was totally deceptive in my local movie review because this is garbage certified. Yeah, yes, good guys wear white, bad guys wear black .... and the guys are always there. Now go home and hug your kids and feel how good Hollywood has made you feel. Sheet metal! I can not believe this dead brain movie made by Wes Craven. I guess he needs a little money to pay the mortgage, so he did this piece of manure. It's sort of production that makes anyone watching movies regularly believe they might be as good or better than an experienced director. <br /> <br /> Yeah, a bad guy wants a sweet girl who loves her dad to do a wrong thing IL 'bad thing or he'll hurt her dad. But Madam All-American girl next door, we know she will save the day and beat the bad guys ... the end. Girl Power Rocks. <br /> <br /> C'mon now, only one idiot would get this fun ... "a roller coaster ride," let alone something fresh or new. All of these "Super-Duper" reviews you see on this site are from hacking industry that either make money in this cue, pay back a favor, or have sold the souls of the devil. <br /> Rachael McAdams is beautiful ... yes, that's it. Not a good performance, not a terrible ... it's just pretty. It would have been to show a whole lot of skin to save this movie. It is not difficult enough to be a good female action leader. <br /> <br /> Cillian Murphy was at least 28 days' walk. But here he plays a wicked mute to pretend to be a smart one. He gets his ass kicked off by the 5'5 'McAdams's 5'5, because after all, he was a cheerleader ... and a field hockey player ... and I'm sure he owns all the rugs Bo Tae .. So it should be able to kick the crap out of an international terrorist for hire. I would not believe it to steal a pack of gums from 7-11. <br /> <br /> Yes, this movie was done before, except before doing it well. Go to rent any of the Hard Hard movies. You have those who love in danger, international terrorists, except their characters are more likable and credible and the bad guys are more competent and interesting way. I simply do not understand how Hollywood can continue to make such crap as if the subconscious patterns are appropriate can easily be copied. No winning film profits are down. <br /> Throw $ 6 or down the toilet and save yourself 2 hours into your life, you will never return. <br /> CIAO, FreddyShoop
