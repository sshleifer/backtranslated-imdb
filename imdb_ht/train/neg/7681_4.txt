Sean, you know I think you are absolutely the greatest actor in the world, but I can not commend you for that. Comedy just is not your fortune costume. <br /> However, it was not all your fault. Some of the thing was just too hard to understand. Alfred Lynch has done a decent job, but you have to ask where the lines are from the beginning. <br /> Again, Sean ... I'm sorry.
