This third Pokemon movie is too abstract for younger children to follow with too much repetition to entertain older children. The message of the movie - about dealing with loss - is cybercriminate not to return to the girl's father during the movie credit. Rocket teams provide some entertainment, but they are not really a part of the small draw, so they do not appear very often.
