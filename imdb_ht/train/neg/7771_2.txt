This is a strange one hacked along film, you get to feel that the bond company has come in to this one, I'm not surprised that there's no credit on it, who would want to be associated with this movie. The interim of all involved is strongly stilted with the plot to jump around all over, it all makes a lot of sense. As I said before it seems that the bond company came in because it seems like there were lots of feet that were not shot which needed to be, and the music was very ill-appropriate music library (cheap I guess). Very, very odd. I might actually buy a DVD in it though, if it could leave me in on what the hell was going on, and what happened to this movie.
