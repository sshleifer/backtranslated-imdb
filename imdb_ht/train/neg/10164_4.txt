I just saw this at the Venice Film Festival, and can not quite decide on it. We've never been allowed to get enough close to any of the characters in care about them. Maybe that was the point, that we are all in a "bubble" of our own, but these people did not force me to be concerned about them or shocked at various divisions. At a time running just over an hour, the characters were not very well developed. Many times have been devoted to vaccines in factory equipment (trek, conveyor belts, shovels); With the little-climbing-looking-looking dolls and surprisingly lively eyes, most of the characters made for a living, were somehow more interesting than people are living. An exciting experience, but somehow it never assembles together.
