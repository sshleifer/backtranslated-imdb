This US soap opera, 'Landing Knot' has all the entertainment value for being blocked in an elevator. Each episode contains plots such as rape, murder, kidnapping and smuggling drugs, not much different to the plots of other drama shows in the period. As for the cast, I saw best actors on a cereal box. From the middle of late '90, repeat the stunk' Knots' up U.K-Gold as a hill of mildewing nappies. I'm sorry to announce that I have suffered this as my mother was a big fan of the show and would look at her religion. Even though since then, the re-run has been some and far between (let's expect it to stay that way). Only positive things that can be said at 'Knots' are the tune of the melodic Saxophone melody, later used as the title music for the sitkon I.T.V, 'The Upper Hand'. Great heritage, eh?
