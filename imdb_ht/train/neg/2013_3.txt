This movie is approximately as it sounds like: a futuristic version of legendary Cinderella but with songs and (fairly tame) sex scenes! The film is not sure what he wants them and pretty much to finish up a mess. It's more expensive than most of Adamson's movie directors but it's not the same level of budget that the viewers have been expecting in sci-fi films. The actors are very bad and unlike most Adamson films, there are no great great namers or actors B. Some of the music is OK but it's easy to see why Cinderella 2000 has been forgotten for many years.
