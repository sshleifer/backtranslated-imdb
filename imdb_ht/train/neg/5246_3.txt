Wow, the spookiest thing about this episode was the price of home 40 years ago. I will preface by saying I'm not a fan of storytelling episodes. If the story / actor / etc. They are worth their sole, they should be able to convey the bulk of the narrative without having it read out, remind me of characters who can not think about the handler but rely on teleprompters. The psychobabble was tedious and boring, but some enjoyed the kind of stuff, it just was not O cup. They could keep the narrative but at least made it more credible and interesting if it came from a psychiatrist or perhaps a journalist or something. Niggling little things like Peugeot were in the house, which had a singular half-circle driveway, but it seems he's parked his car in the tree he stood down, because he's nowhere to be seen on the road or on the property. Sloppy correction, as it pulls into the driveway (for what looks like the 100th time) exactly who are these 2 men you see in 24m30s walking towards the car as it pulls into the driveway into the desert house? Dolly pre-ups were also overdone, as some Jr. High drama students discover the zoom function on their camera for the first time. I could keep picking apart, but that could get almost as boring as this episode was. He kept dragging on and the true purpose seemed to be to use absolutely all the stock footage fired at the Elaine Drive Newport Convertible. I fully expect to see the Chrysler logo with a nice jingle playing while a voice over told us all about the player 8 track, automatic head etc. The only good thing I said about one it is that it just ends, abruptly. No end exchange rate, nothing explains or stops. Not that many people would notice, I suspect most had already changed the channel or stamped off to the end.
