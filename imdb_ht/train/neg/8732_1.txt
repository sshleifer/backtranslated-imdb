The plot is about the death of infants. Hopper is one of those who must investigate the killings. During the film she appears to have some problems with her daughter. At the end of the serial killer get caught. That's it. But before you find who was, you have to see some terrible act by all the actors. It's incredible how bad these actors, including Hopper. I could go on like this but that's a lot of a waste of my time. Just do not watch the movie. I warned you.
