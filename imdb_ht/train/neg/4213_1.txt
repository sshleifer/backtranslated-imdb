Wow, I'm a great Henry VIII / Tudor fan era and, well, this was .... interesting. The only salt I watched Catherine was one of Aragon. And wow ... just wow. I've seen bad acting before, but this came to new heights. When the actress played Catherine was umm .. crying? she sails and shouts and I must admit I rewinded many times ... many, many times .... funny, funny things. The only person who even showed any junk of talent was the actress playing Anne Boleyn (I might be prejudiced though, I have a slight mania and Anne Boleyn, she was a really feminin woman, she's up to her it's worth it!) Also, I read a lot about Tudor's long period and I think the characters were not very well displayed, they were all very stereotypical. Just see this movie if you are prepared to see a very important period of time, and the important lives of those involved in a laughing stock.
