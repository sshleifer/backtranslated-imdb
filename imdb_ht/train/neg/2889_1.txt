The case is the best part of the movie but it alone is not worth the purchase price. I was expecting a "Based on the True Story" movie only to get a shot on the hog-podge video video clip shot incorrectly bound alongside pathetic and unrelated home theater scenes. The video scenes had many reminder situations that were used to maximize the length of the feature rather than for effect. I started this review before I was even halfway through the movie and waited until it was about just in case she had a better finish but low and seeing it only got worse. If I could mark it any lower it would be a negative one. Learn from my mistakes and save your money and time with this one.
