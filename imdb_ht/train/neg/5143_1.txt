Though 99.99% of people who saw this movie are Brazilian, I'll keep up with the English since it is the language of this website. <br /> <br /> This movie is a piece of CR * p. Worst act I've seen for a loooong time. Children are awful. Especially the boy. This was the first time I saw someone with less facial expressions than Arnold Schwarzenegger, with a single voice voice, as a 5-year-old reading class reading. How can someone be the bad movie actor? The scenario is so deep my daughter could do better (she is 3 years old). It is so simple she can write in a cloth and says in 3 minutes. There are only three possibilities for someone to enjoy this movie: 1) you are a pre-adolescent; 2) you were so brainwashed by the stupid Globo that you think nothing of the globo seal is awesome; 3) Do you have a serious brain damage. <br /> Avoid at all costs! A shame in the Brazilian movie scene.
