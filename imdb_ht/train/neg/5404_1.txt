Do you ever find that the yarn just kills an hour or two doing some chores and watching a movie so badly it's challenging why? Well, out renting a movie weekend I see the box art for this one and see the T-Rex. Knowing well that the dinosaur on the T-Rex package was out of Jurassic Park, I know I had to rent this cause just because I was in the mood for a bad movie. <br /> <br /> I was not disappointed at the youngest. <br /> <br /> Mad scientists, secret formula, a company more concerned about its fortunes and shareholders than life, and of course, a great, insulting, sock-puppet T-Rex. Is I our out of the movie there were clearly spliced ​​scenes from other movies? Not to mention the hungry Rex never satisfied ... ever. How hungry is beyond me because it actually does not have a throat (really if you look at her mouth when she roars, it's solid ... like a toy or something). Now I like watching incredibly bad B-Movies from time to time because it reminds me how best a blockbuster movie is. This one was hilarious. I'm not sure if this was supposed to be a comedy or comedy, because there are places where, make no mistake, you will laugh. <br /> Do I blame the movie budget ... yes, but the act did not help either. OK, Tony Todd was actually pretty good, as for some of the female roles ... when you cry would not be "tears" out? I will not be mad at this movie, I knew what I was entering and if you are looking for a bad movie to watch with friends, here's what I recommend: Watch this movie, then immediately look Jurassic Park and then lost World back to back. You will write Mr. Spielberg thank you later the letter.
