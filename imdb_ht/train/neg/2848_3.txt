... So I thought I would throw in a few words about William McNamara. Not a bad way to spend a couple of hours if you want to see her in her titi-whites - it's obvious she pumps up for this role and it looks pretty darn good at them - or less. There is an extended sequence in a cave where it is stripped down to his undies. There's a nice little place where she chases Miss Eleniak in the scrub, and only her hand cupped on her blanket. William McNamara is naturally slightly on the thin side, but it has a nice, generous handful of a loot. Also, there is a moment when it is getting out of bed that if you pause the action at the right moment you can see the whole enchiladas. If you are inclined to do so, and come on, the half of those who choose to watch a movie about Navy on a "road trip". I would just like Dennis Hopper thanks for his equal opportunity to nudity. Does William McNamara act? And if I know.
