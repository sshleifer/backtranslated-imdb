If you are the sort of person who can get a kick from a very bad movie, then I highly recommend this one. If not, stay away. This is an amazingly cheap-looking movie, and at times you can find yourself wondering if it is not just someone scratching will crawl over you. The most positive comment I can do about it is that the guardian seemed to realize that it was super-low-budget nonsense, so there is at least a sense of pleasure here. <br /> But this is as amateur as it gets. The ideas of giant mushrooms mushrooms are merely men covered with beige colored leaves and this looks garbage can cover on their heads. It obviously does not mean that you must take seriously (mean the least), but even with that warning you will find yourself nodding yourself in the awesome cheese in it all. Or laughing often, as I did.
