I see a lot of movies. Have seen the original wargames years ago and love it. Computers where always "a great mystery" for most of us and the movie was convincing, in its own way. <br /> <br /> This one, however, looks like a low budget Wednesday night special. Total crap, from start to finish. The plot is so weak, you will not believe it until you see the movie (which I would not recommend in the first place). I can not point out an actor who actually did a good job in this movie. But hey, with that script I would've been surprised if anyone can do a good job acting. Many clique scenes. CGI seems to have taken out of the version '86. <br /> <br /> No, I, I come in a bad mood just writing about this. Do not watch this movie. <br /> <br /> The short life of wasting it on watching crazy movies.
