My wife and I started watching this movie with an anticipation. He looked hot and touched. It started out well; but soon became boring and frankly idiotic after a while. It was so bad that we turned him off the movie was wrong to act with honesty, we could not really understand or wanted to understand what exactly why or how the Hell could wear with this woman! You lost sympathy for her after she was rude and acting wackos singing and cleaning. I would have done it. And, of course, like most movies and TV series made in Hollywood we have cast it a sign of "gay" character! This movie was boring. I was expecting more from Diane Keaton!
