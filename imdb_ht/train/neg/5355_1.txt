Now I do not hate cheap movies. I just do not see why you should waste any money for a movie you can shoot with your dad's camera. If I rent a movie, I want it to be a movie, not a bunch of people thinking it would be a good idea to wasting some miniDV - tapes. Maybe I hate this one so much because guy in the video store said it was great, and he did not. Perhaps I hate it because it's cheap, there is the dumbest plot EVER, the most unrealistic characters ever, and really, really, really WORSTOWN in the story of EVER movie. Even Tom Savini can not save that. <br /> <br /> Seriously, this one is a complete waste of time.
