To call this nothing at all would be a reproach of everything else. Some explanations can describe it, but are still too positively. Normally one ignores this kind of waste, but it was so stupid that one can but despair. Would even be that even the Americans and commercial television stations would give this piece s ** t a miss. But as the Germans say: Everywhere in Dummheit kaempfen Goetter self Vergebens!
