I do not like this movie very much. If you have read Puzo's book, or at least looked closely at the first movies (especially the first one), you're going to agree with me. <br /> <br /> Compared to the legendary Corleone presented by Puzo's novel, the script of this film is, sometimes ridiculous. Characters and their relationships are distorted. The story ends up coming up, although it seems to go in some directions during the movie. <br /> It is understood that different times should be expected for Corleone's legend in the 90's, and that we would not find things as they were before. But on the other hand, I do not know why they had to copy some dialogue into the other movies, in their context when they did not fit. Why this? It sounds like those who hurt that just try to copy the original movie type. <br /> <br /> What should never be understood is the fact that Mario Puzo, Coppola and Al Pacino together have done so. A man who leads pieces like Apocalypse Now and Godfather has to be forgiven for almost anything he does in movies until he dies. So Al Pacino, for being the actor he is. But Mario Puzo should not write this. How come? He damaged all previous tasks. What a shame, my friends. Roman Puzo's "The Last Don" is a 90's story about the crowd, and it's great. We can never say the same about the plot for Godfather III.
