I did not expect much of this TV movie. You have to set the bar lower than you would for midget limbo for any TBS movie starring Antonio Sabato Jr. Still, he managed to disappoint, failing to be a good-bad movie. <br /> <br /> Each scene was not red, as if someone was cut and glued to scene from a dozen movies and TV shows dealing with big business scheme of the script, backing back and saying, "work I do ". It's all clich√©, all predictable, and, even worse, the actors are forced to look like they're taking it seriously, (even when the scheme developments are ridiculous). <br /> Do yourself a favor. See the "X-Files" if you're in the mood for paranoia. They handle it better. Also, let someone know that sitting in "Fatal Error" is just that.
