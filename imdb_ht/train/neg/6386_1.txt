I really wanted to like this movie, but it was just impossible. The act was ultra hammy, the plot was annoying, and the pace was SLOW, sooo slowwwwww. Ever sat in the theater I wanted the movie to finish. Twelve minuets in a movie and I pray for an end. Ensure some of the visuals were beautiful, but guys c'mon, I mean really! And for a movie about a guitar instrument tuning guitar there really was not much music to talk about. The music was annoying, boring. There were loud sounds at times too, these were also annoying. Mostly this movie managed to make me, and creep me out of the same time. <br /> I'm happy about it. I need to go see "Tideland" and wash this bad taste out of my mouth.
