... are they bothered to make this movie? Anyone? I did not think so. <br /> If you are looking for a come-of-age movie, go to rent in '42. This is not summer in '42. When your big star is Nolte & Sarsgaard, & Sarsgaard gets more time screens, that's the first sign of your warning, and, of course, for such a movie "artsy", there are many curses and skin thrown around, just making it look "artsy". Sarsgaard made his usual refreshing, carton character, punctuated by moments that were supposed to be intense. The intensity is that of a person with bi-polar disease. <br /> <br /> Miller is famous for her looks & what she said about the city of Pittsburgh after this film. Pittsburgh should keep a bad account. He mentioned an authentic Pittsburgh native. <br /> <br /> Foster gave Sarsgaard a run for his money in the style acting box. Wow! Is her first role after graduation from high school? <br /> So we have this weird triangle. Foster has a break on Miller, but she and her boss / girlfriend. She can not take Miller to bed, & will not take her boss to bed. So it hangs with Sarsgaard & Miller, & Watches to get it over. Then, after one of Sarsgaard's pseudo-intense moments, Foster & Miller found it on a scene that we are "treated" in every sloppy, moaning detail. Finally, just round it all out, Foster & Sarsgaard get it over, and Foster in the role of Miller. Now I know how 2 guys found it on (as if there was anything else I needed to know). After all, all that remains is to end the tragic for a character & retrospective views of stay 2. It gets me right in the abyss of my stomach. Oh, wait! This pepperoni pizza I was just here. <br /> I would like to back this time film taken out of my life, please.
