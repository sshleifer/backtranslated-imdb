One of the worst movies I've ever seen. Thinking only I was: "How can I get my money back from Hollywood Video". This is no way worth four dollars, or any dollars. I think it was a ripple attempt at the Mexican, or the Diesel cinema, but it failed to do so. <br /> <br /> The act was terrible, I felt sorry for the actors that they could not find something better to do with their time. The story was ridiculous. We called out the front lines of the actors, it was so predictable. The Mexican accent of the leading lady insultingly exaggerated, worse than a cartoon. <br /> <br /> Skip it.
