I figured the whole joke in the movie should see some white guy acting like Chris Rock, and then see Chris Rock reacting to people's reaction. Instead you just see Chris Rock being himself and those who do not understand him. There may be 2 scenes from the movie wherever they are used to the gadgets. This would be a lot better.
