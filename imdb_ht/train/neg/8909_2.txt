This movie is lame and not funny at all. The plot does not even make sense. Some scientists who work on the edges of science open a door to another dimension (maybe hell ???) and her daughter gets sucked into it or something, then one day for no apparent reason return and now she has breasts and wears a skimpy outfit (I guess the demons in the other dimension did it for her?) The main character is a guy who wants to marry her girlfriend but she is gay for obviously her The more interested in her new girlfriend, and they stumble on this witch spell books (they want to do witchcraft or something ???) and the wrong end spell to find out which is how the evil spirits come on Earth that only girls in bikini's head and the guy spurned in love can stop apparently. There are topless scenes for no reason and a guy in it that my boyfriend says is a well known wrestler but his party is completely unnecessary, obviously doing something up just to put it in it because then maybe fan Writing will actually watch this movie freeware. I'm sure the topless girls do not hurt to either. The extra features on the DVD were even more confusing than the rest of the movie, I thought it might help explain what was going on but it actually just made things more confusing. Who are these and what they are doing? Basically this is a go-camp-to-make-out-then-fight-a-monkey movie but there are lots of stuff (like the other's dimension and seller's books) than making it confusing. I did not like the movie but it was just like five bucks so great deal. I do not recommend looking at it even though it was just too stupid, I can not think of any part of the film that was good.
