Kojak meets the mafia. Telly Savales is one of the last guys that looks pretty forgettable. I never thought that her show was all that great. This is its one-dimensional feature of a crime boss, with very predictable results. If you take the car chassis and the rambling generator out there, there is not a lot of draw or action development. I find mafia movies to be dull because I have no respect or interest in common criminals and their actions. Hollywood, and in this case, the Italian cinema, treat such guys as heroes. I saw the movie and in a few days I will not miss much on it. Many of the shooters, innocent dead inspectors, betrayal, and ill loyalty. The movie is very beautiful and the act is decent. But the dubbing is so bad (due to voice that just could not come from body people), that I almost started looking for Godzilla approaching the bay.
