There was some low moment in my life, when I was disoriented and depressed. Sitting at Rancid Aluminum was one of these. <br /> <br /> warning signs were there. No premiere (the same star did not want to go in) and no magazine review. The only reason I sat in the movie was in hope that I could catch up on some sleep. <br /> <br /> Nothing in the movie explains. The narration was idiotic. I was encouraged to point out when the lead in the film appeared to be shot, then in my growing despair, he revealed that he had not really been shooting against my joy. I sincerely hope that all involved in the film are hanging for this atrocity. <br /> <br /> There were some positive aspects, especially involuntary moments of humor. For example, the scene in which the main character, for some unknown reason feels the need to relieve herself manually in a toilet cabin, while telling the person in the next cabin to put her finger to her ear. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> My words can not explain my anger, so I must conclude so. <br /> <br /> Rancid Aluminum: for sadist, wastel, and regressive only who want to torture themselves.
