This is typical normal norm of sex in the Russian Meyer genre, though perhaps less strangely than some of Meyer's works. This film has the largest 'value of production' than many of its contemporaries, suggesting a larger budget. It's drawn, writes and acts straight from the B area, though. By the end of this month, this movie has become a major feature of B movie channel (like the "Classic Drive") in the 500 channel universe. If the soft core is what you are in the mood for, this is as "good" as any other thing in the series B. Do not expect Polanski though, Sarno is just Sarno. There is nothing more, nothing less. Jennifer Welles performances as "the mother" is perhaps the best of the cast. None of the actors in the movie went to greater fame, surprises. Confessions of a Young Indian housewife is far from the worst example of his kind. It is look, if this is your kind of movie. 30 years ago, this would be an avant-garde avant-garde movie. You can see more or less the same thing about Showtime / HBO series on these days, and in prime time.
