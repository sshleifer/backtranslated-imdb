Rarely I witnessed a guarantee of talent. There is almost nothing constructive to be told about this swamp swamp in a movie. What some interesting section of the film seems to promise to initially turn out to be little more than red herring. The high-performer - Robert Duvall, Robert Downey, Jr. - is deployed in the role that is nowhere; a director of occasional engineering produces a film that looks like it is filmed in a coffee-attached camera lens; a writer (John Grisham) who never produced anything in merit, discovering new depths of under-motive incoherence. The film has a cheap, feels about it - but barely at the level of Book - really a part of the aesthetic. Normally, I came to IMDb to write balanced, generally appreciative comments. This dubious disaster in a movie just makes me want to produce an endless, bilberry annuity. I will not, but only because I do not want to stay in "my head" with this garbage.
