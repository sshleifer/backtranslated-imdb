This is really a very bad movie. Why? First of all, the story is bad. It's an artificial story, combining all sorts of things together that makes no sense. It just seems a wrong experience. Secondly, the actors can not play in a realistic way. They can not even speak as an actor should. Why did I buy this movie? And what should I do with it now?
