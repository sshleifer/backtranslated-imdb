Spoiler Warning. . . I have to agree with you, it was almost there. This was such a bad movie, about these and interesting stories. He had such promises, but the act was ridiculous at best. Some sets were beautiful and realistic. Others are something from a theme park. I found myself laughing as I watched, what would be supposed to be, serious scenes. I really wanted to love this movie, but I could not. The best part was the battle between friends who ended up with the "king" dead. I loved Queens punishment. And the final shot made a beautiful picture, though. There are many better movies to watch. I do not recommend that.
