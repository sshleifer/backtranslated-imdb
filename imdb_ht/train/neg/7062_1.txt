OK, maybe, honestly the worst movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> This made absolutely no sense, there was no scheme, no characterization, no act, just nothing. Here's what I thought when I first saw it to be 28th, 2003 ** precautions, this is a spoiler alert. It also very much in my complaining about how bad the movie is :: <br /> <br /> ok for the movie to start with the characters they presented, but no character explanation. as far as I knew the main character was new to this school, but apparently not. She also appeared to have lived in her head ... then that she was a kid adoptive ... then that her mother was a bad alcohol who stayed with her still. Also all his friends apparently had no parents and lived in themselves. <br /> <br /> Now we come to a main draw point, this crazy guy broke out of the insane asylum and is rampant running. Now our main character is obsessed with this guy and focus' stare on it for the unforeseen of the movie. I think I must have missed a primary trace element here, there was no noon for the main character to get hooked. even if it's the point, there is no reason, why all his friends, who are uncertain as 5 minutes before, suddenly follow him and do what he wants. <br /> <br /> So the movie continues, and it gets all right. They are running havoc in the school, blah blah blah. but wait a minute ... suddenly everyone knows that the main character is running the 'show' here. wait a second, did not the crazy guy especially say the main character DO NOT do that? It was supposed to be anynomous. <br /> Another important plot element was jumping over ... The crazy guy was supposed to be crazy ... everyone said it was not crazy. but as the story goes on, it is very CLEARLY out of her mind. but I thought that the news people said he was not ... hm ... <br /> <br /> now the movie comes to a close. What was closed? What the HELL Wanted? Not only ended the finish by answering any questions about the main character, he did not answer any questions about the insane guy. are they in the same situation? yes, then there are some very basic story lines that do not tend. if no then what is the point of saying "that's you in two weeks." ?? <br /> <br /> * the end of the stuff ... * <br /> <br /> that's what I thought then. this is pretty much what I still think right now. It's 6 months down the line, and if I can get it for free, I might give it another chance, but I doubt it. I'm very skeptical.
