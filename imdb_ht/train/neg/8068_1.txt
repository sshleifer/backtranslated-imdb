I did not have great expectations for this movie when renting it for $ 1 in the video store, but the box at least showed a little promise and "cut it killer" to "more gore! More sex!" Can not go wrong! Well ... unknowingly say, the box is a fraud. How did the actors and actresses in the theater sign up for a movie this low? <br /> It's all open and a drunken collection girl is walking out of a frat house or some other building like that and says some unfriendly her boyfriend crap (?) as a camera on a bad stadium watching him. Then he gets chased by some dude in a clear plastic mask and was taken by another. They wiggle their arms for no real reason and you can see when they "cut" it that someone drew off and what looks like a pencil. <br /> From there, repeating the same theme of the girl getting chase unbrutally by two guys for about 84 more minutes. Add to one title shot. This is survival soul. <br /> I would not have a problem with this movie that had the box not rubbing my to rent the flick. If I rent a bad movie that claims to have more violence and sex .... I want more violence and sex! A full-time shot of 85 minutes from a chick who is clear of trial and gore that would not scare a child by cutting it. If this is off the killer, what is the theater cut? Of course, I doubt this waste actually put in the first place theater. Shame on the actors of this movie. I could see they made the debit screens in here because they did not do anything before, but they all were established before this was released. I do not know if it was filmed before all had been established and the studio sat on the movie until they were semi-large or not. But what I want to know is .... they really spent $ 14 million on this movie ?!
