This is the third parody of movies are scary and hopefully the last. This time the parable is mostly on the ring, Signs and 8 miles for some strange reason. In my opinion this movie was very pointless and unnecessary and not even funny. I laughed perhaps three times and that's not enough for a comedy. I really liked the first two but this one was just plain mute. If your joke is composed of corpses beating them and those who are constantly throwing things in each other then this movie is for you. In my opinion, if you're smart enough to stay at home and save your money and please stop these kind of films, they just keep getting worse 3/10.
