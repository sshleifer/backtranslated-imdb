I heard a rumored future "Leonard Nimoy Demonstrate Blu-ray Disc". With over the past 25 years ranging from Steady-Cam CGI, it will be interesting to see if the franchise can reinvigorate. I just hope he helps to remove the bad taste left in my mouth by the magnitude of Magnavision's demonstration. <br /> And yes ... "Leonard Nimoy demonstrates the Betamax VCR" was a great milestone in entertainment stories. After Leonard Nimoy's attempt to "Demonstrate the compact tape" and the outright minor "Leonard Nimoy Demonstration 8-Track Tape", who would expect such a piece of glory in movies? I cry now just thinking about it.
