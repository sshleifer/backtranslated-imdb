The only good thing about "People I Know" is that it serves as a perfect example of movies that Al Pacino should avoid doing in. The first big turn I had the way in which Pacino tried to show a Georgia accent; At times it was weak and unattractive while in other segments it seemed too much. Dialogue and character interaction was awesome along with a weak scheme. The support cast made a very perfunctory job to keep the movie exciting, and within an hour I still see no signs of a solid scheme. History in general is a real thing, and I have to calm myself in the face a few times to keep myself awake. <br /> This movie will surely make you as good as ... avoiding at all costs.
