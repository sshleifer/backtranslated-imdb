Quote: Theorist: Anyone with an I.Q. More than 50 would have seen this film what it is, a well-interactive prequel in a classic modern day, yes it does not have a blockbuster throw or a big budget but it still pretty well done and was tuned to the full duration. <br /> An IQ over 50 you say .. most mean you have an I.Q. below 50 .. Its name is CARLITOS WAY: Rise on Power !!! That means it should have something blob one of the first ones to do .. <br /> all with a movie its OK .. you changed the title and there is no character NAMED CARLITO BRIGANTE !!! <br /> /> Ps does not comment on a movie if you do not know anything about movies. but I guess an I.Q. Under 50, you do not know what the hell I'm calling on ... <br /> <br /> Peace Out !!
