After hurrying to the end, I must say I wish I would not have joined the whole set in the first place. The final episode was everything against the previous seven years. He lost everything. The trip was 23 years, but commander Janeway has the power to reduce her ... let's say, seven years only. Why seven? Why not only one? Or nothing? Why not avoid the entire adventure? Crewmemebers have died all along the journey. Why does he want to save Seven of Nine only? Others do not count or what? The most ridiculous part when the crew declares that getting home is not really the most important thing. As said, "the most important trip than the destination". Incredible. And in the final stage are surrounded by other pirate ships and the Earth is in sight. There is nothing about landing, returning to the normal life. <br /> <br /> Worst end up ever.
