I, too, was fooled by the packaging. I, too, was dropped for the inside packaging and the DVD box that claims "dear fans as every copy was pulled out of shelves". Even though it was expensive ($ 6.99), it was not really all that worth it - no crisis, and very limited Gore. The finish was very cheese and did not deliver the punch it should have. I really do not even know how it became a "Nasty Video" and how tame it is. The storyteller drags, the characters are obvious to amateur actors ... it does not live up to the promise. The DVD bonus feature (the "interview") is very strange as the director looks very incoherent and not the whole. Activation actors lead as it appears in a Shakespearean production. It's a great laugh.
