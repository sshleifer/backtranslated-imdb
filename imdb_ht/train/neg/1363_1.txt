This movie begins to slow down, then the flow. After watching for about an hour, and seeing absolutely nothing happened, I walked out. I mean, nothing happened. Zero. Zip. Nada. There is no history. Characters are the wave representation of the most boring ones any of us know. The producers of this film might be sued to a court of law if they try to sell it as a "motion" picture. There is no motion. I could have said the same "story" with a couple still photographs and captions. The script is a joke. It's just awful. I doubt any scriptwriter in the world can save her. My biggest mistake is not that I wasted 60 minutes of my life watching "love in time of money", but I miss a great opportunity to be a leader. I could first walk out, but I waited a bit too long. Instead, I look at 20 people walking out in front of me.
