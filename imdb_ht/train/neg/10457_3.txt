What's wrong? I'm a secret fan of action on 'top' with horror movie. Especially when it comes with a lot of humor and innuendo, but I'm not a fan of snake on an airplane. There are three potential draws of this movie :? Comedy the situation; ?? Grangou; with ?? The gift of hundreds of snakes was on an airplane. First, this film is not written as a horror-in-cheek or comedy, and there are only 1 or 2 points in the movie where you will smile in mind. If you want to get the feel of the movie, the trailer really represents the movie, a horror. <br /> <br /> Second, if you are waiting for a full movie of action and trauma, you will not be disappointed. It does not stand out above other movies, but it always keeps your attention. Although the gift of snake on an airplane is not set, but you will leave the movie thinking "what was all the fuss about." <br /> I know this movie has a high rating, but it does not add up. A) Many of the comments that were written before the movie were released and, B) Users of user ratings have a lot less variation than normal 77% of those movie rated at 10/10, and only 7% of those giving read 9/10 - Why such an enormous space?
