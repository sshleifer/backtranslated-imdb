Now I had better intentions when watching this one. I like some of Tony Scott's works, also a friend I told me he was a big movie, though I heard otherwise from others. But this was simply hopeless. <br /> <br /> In humble opinion, Tony Scott was trying too hard. It was all just too much. Allow me to elaborate. <br /> <br /> Miss Knightley was overacting, and not in a great way. The people who did well, were Mickey Rourke, Edgar Ramirez, and Christopher Walken, but their screen screens just could not save the movie. <br /> <br /> There was a few scenes that jumped out of their originality, but somehow it felt like they were written by someone other than the main writer. A certain melody has been used around 4 times, which really started insects after a second. I'm a firm believer in not using the melody even more than once. <br /> <br /> Also, the correction really comes out on this one, as the cut rate is rather high. Oh, and the repetitive echo of some of Keira's lines simply sounded smoothly after hearing it for the second, third, fourth, and so on. <br /> <br /> Basically, my opinion is that if you want to see a high-rhythmic action-packed movie with a "bit" funny, and you do not care about everything I mentioned above, you would love it. <br /> (On a side note: I'm not a Keira Knightley fan.)
