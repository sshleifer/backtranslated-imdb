What a sad eye these stalwarts TVs do, running out the clock on the barrier careers on a rusty shrub in a boat ship - may be more appropriate. The whole production feels cheap and shabby, and it does not help by a "big name" star that is barely able to spit out the few lines that he gave in a credible fashion. supporting upward casting of the material; They are clearly watching the clock here. Bang out the scenes, get the paycheck, go home, and try to forget everything about it. <br /> It's not particularly badly scripted or filmed; There is no real client, it's just absolutely anodine, and injected into a very limited number of cramped lying and a bit of overtime. The gathering is a bit rare; An embarrassingly romantic sub-plot is only beginning after the main action begins, making it feel irrelevant. <br /> <br /> Maiden trips score a couple of points for being fully scored, and for being a fun game of "the perfect little kiwi spots"; Most of the cast is graduated from Shortland Street or Xena: Warrior Princess. The sad thing about this production is that this film probably constitutes great crimes.
