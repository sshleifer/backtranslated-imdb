a friend gave it to tell me it was another classic like "Debbie do Dallas". No location close. I think my main complaint is about the most unpleasant actress in the porn industry ever. Even more terrible is that it is on the screen virtually all the time. But I read somewhere back in those days, pornography has some "artistic" value. I could get it though. Watch it only if you are interested in stories in the mainstream pornography, or can appreciate the art of porn movie. I know I'm not. But the director of the film appeared to be a talented person. He even tried to find Simon & Garfunkel to give him permission to use his songs. Of course, they rejected.
