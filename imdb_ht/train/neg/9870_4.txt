I had several issues with the movie: <br /> (1) The scripts - especially, Kim Basinger's voice on: Movies are not books; should * show * the action rather than having a voice over * telling us what is happening. Occasionally I get a movie with a voice on that job, but here it looks more in a lazy way to write the script. In fact, he blushed me as if he had practically excerpted the novel in his voice over. <br /> (2) I felt no emotion in the relationship between Jessie and Brother Thomas and also felt that Alex Carter's act was very bad. This is a major failure for me to define Jessie's and Thomas's characters - which has no connection between them, it seemed to me as if he just wanted a stud and for him it was a matter of being sex-private. If it was well done, the relationship would give much more context to the story. <br /> (3) With the book I understand Jessie's mid-life crisis. In the movie, it seemed more like just plain boredom. <br /> <br /> On the plus side, I did not think the movie was so bad as for me to close the TV. . . though that thought happened to me.
