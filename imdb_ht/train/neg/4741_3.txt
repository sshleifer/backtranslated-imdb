Wendy Wu: Homecoming Warrior has a very good, strong draw, but is lost by cheesy details throughout the movie. I'm a younger teenager and did not enjoy this movie very much. I thought the effects were awful, but they might seem fun to younger children. The uterus moves to ruin the action, you know it was absolutely false. Then there was the Yen Lo, a devil who temporarily owned random people and Residents in which Wendy made efforts to win. It all ends as a typical frail movie when Wendy and her cousin Buddhist cousin Shen defeat Yen Lo (and destroy her forever) in the end. So Wendy learns a lesson ... blah, blah, blah. I am ready for the upcoming DCOM.
