The box for "to die for" sucked me off - a guyless hunky guy and the promise of some laughter and sex. There were many Thomas Arklie (Simon), who is easy on the eyes but there is no laugh and little sexiness. <br /> <br /> The couple, Mark and Simon, have allegedly been together several years, but neither character is interesting enough to care about, so it's hard to imagine that they care about each other. The fault seems to lie in the script, not their performance; Both actors do the best they can and what they are giving. <br /> The end is trail and infact (well, not totally definitely, I felt relieved that it was over). <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a movie about gay and AIDS-related relationships, "Thinking Glances" is far better.
