Only part of the filming of this film was the price I paid. At least all I lost was $ 3.00 and the time spent sitting in this bomb. Members of the crew were in charge of continuing to miss the boat. When the female lead and the FBI guy went to the alleged killings, Mr. FBI handed the girl a revolver. When the assassin allegedly came out of the door, the magic equalizer was transformed into a robot. One let's think it would be a FBP agent but a gun in a civilian? I think not. Ms Xavier appeared a very beautiful girl. It's too bad the rating R did not allow much of it to be seen. It would seem that a movie editor cut that could be the best parts of the movie out.
