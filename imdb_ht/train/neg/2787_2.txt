By the tale number of the Kid (Prince), a singer, on its way to become a star. Then he fell in love with Apollonia (Appolonia Kotero). But he faced his father's wife beat (Clarence Williams III!) And his self-destructive behavior. <br /> I saw this in a theater in 1984. I had no big fans of Prince but I did like the three great songs of this movie - "Purple Rain", "Let's Get crazy ", and" When Dries Cry ". The concert scene in this film is great - filled energy and excitement. Unfortunately this is a small portion of the movie. <br /> The story is screamingly obvious and they did many times before - and better too. The subplots are, they are set up nicely, seriously occupying. The love triangle between Kid, Appolonia and Morris Day was so predictable and tired that I actually came insulting. His wife is beating father who is needed for the story, but the scenes are so poorly handled (in acting and direction) that I could not believe it. The script is awful - disgusting dialogue and some really painful routine "comedy". And there are tons of misogyny here - the Kid's mother is getting beaten; The kid hit Appolonia and (for no reason) Appolonia strips and go topless to swim in a dirty river. Also Williams 'and chief' characters treat women in a horrible way. <br /> <br /> The act is where this movie really fails. Appolonia is sweet and beautiful - but no actor. And Prince is (easy) the actor says that I've ever seen. Her blank timetable and timber dialogue were so bad I could not believe it. This movie only comes to life during concert scenes but not really that much. The "dramatic" scenes are so seriously acted and handled that they make this movie a chore to sit down. They should just make this a concert movie. I give this a 2 - only for the music.
