This is the worst piece of crap I've seen lately. There is nothing good about this movie. The plot is plagiarized, dialogue makes no sense, funny scenes never heard anything about the real humor. Actors just do not play, the worse they do not even try. The script itself is a bit of the same league with Ed Wood and Uwe Boll. There is only one good thing in this movie, fighting. They are well choreographed as one would expect from the Hong Kong men, and they are the only reason to look Prince of the Sun. Although I believe the fights are just supposed to fill the empty space so that the senarist did not bother thinking about the scenario. However, this weak and absurd draw can prevent you from looking at the end. Avoid it unless you are Cynthia Rothrock's dragon dragon.
