Awwww .... Yes, it's heartwarming and all that has some malicious families adopted by ABC / Sears and has their home "Renovated." This is where the humanitarian appeal ends. I liked it early in its run, but now this show became disgustingly too much. <br /> <br /> Ten ten-relief families can provide relatively luxurious homes with lots of goodies for every single family who each episode shows splurges over. The people of habitat for humanity must shake their heads in disbelief. For example, is it necessary for a six-year-old boy who has a jacuzzi in his room, or has his tram-out and hydraulic "Low Rider" bed? Does the mother really need to dislow her, which does not run and rust out old pick-up truck to restore and "pimped" by some of the best customizers in California? A new one would do the job quite nicely, and probably for a third of the price. Do people really need a sixty-five inch plasma screen in each room at home? Then there's the problem of paying tax on the increased property and utility bills. Even after the zaniacs in "Beauty" leave, someone still has to earn a living. I doubt the friendly way down to the Social Services will see the humor in all of this. <br /> <br /> This show is nothing more than a Grabber Review for ABC, with a sportsbook for its sponsors.
