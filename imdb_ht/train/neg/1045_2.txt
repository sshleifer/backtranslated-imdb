Pose Victor Vargas failed terribly in what he tries most to be: they were real. Unfortunately, there is no reality of this movie. The characters and situations feel completely artificial and fake. <br /> <br /> The reason? Bad is directing. Peter Sollett uses all the tools in his arsenal. It looks like Mr. Sollett is a non-lighting movie that he would give him an authentic feel. Move! It just gives it a bad-made feel. Similarly, shaking the camera does not provide a documentary style of your movie, it just gives the audience a headache and detracts from what's on screen instead of improving it. <br /> <br /> Of course, what's on screen is so painfully fraudulent, as if Mr. Sollett wrote his script with the only purpose of trying to look "hip" at his Sundance buddies and shows how "a donkey" is a cinema. <br /> <br /> In general, only this long-lasting film impression leaves you and this is a bad director of Mr. Sollett. Next time, how about taking a few written and led classes?
