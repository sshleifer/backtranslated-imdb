This movie is not good at all. Maybe it's just the impact and characterization characterizing, acting, and directing that we have seen with the Sopranos, but I just see Honor Prizzi for the first time, on DVD, alone. The experience of watching it with a 24-year hearing has to be quite different, but I said, I was just amazed at the finish. Not only the violence in it, but the only idea that somehow this would be a satisfying ending. <br /> I like a good shocking, but this looks like this from the character ... Also, when was this move supposed to be set? Cars all seem like being from the 1960s, and yet World Trade Center towers {completed in 1973} were clearly visible in many urban scenes. Another way in which the movie of old age is the only idea that a passenger can travel side by side with a knife on her. <br /> <br /> Somehow, mid-1980s audience found this movie good and funny. Mid-Eight, meet the Late Audi: the only you can live.
