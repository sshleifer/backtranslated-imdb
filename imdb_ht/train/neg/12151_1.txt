This is probably the worst act I've ever seen in a movie ... ever. and what's up with the casting. The leading lady in this movie has some kind of ten-figure nose and is almost impossible to look for any period of time without becoming staring at her nose. you could go to your local store on a Sunday afternoon and easily find 50 more qualified, best looking guys. I made the unfortunate mistake of renting this movie because it had a "cool" DVD case. This film looks like it's just some class projects for a group of multimedia students at a local technical college. I would rather have spent the time or so that this film was about watching TV accessibility ... at least the special effects are best and people are having more attractive than anyone you'll see in this movie
