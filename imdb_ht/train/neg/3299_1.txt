This must be one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I was actually waiting for a bad movie but I was caught by surprise to believe it or not. The scenario is the traditional, all the clicks included. The dialogue is so badly written that you actually laugh when actually half the descent tries to make it sound real. The picture is not too good, the music is so bad it actually makes me angry, the actors are not even trying, alto the script makes it almost impossible you might expect more from those who have been acting for 30 years with this action called the scene actually manages to miss "action" in itself. <br /> I do not understand why these kinds of bad films keep on coming, who financing this shit? Where is the screening? And why do the world make the actors take on this impossible mission script? <br /> There are a million Hollywood-movies in this genre without the same aspiration in reaching theaters, but even Straight in Video Things actually managed to look professional in comparison. <br /> I can not say anything positive about this except the title that explains it all, I feel stealing in 2 hours of my life.
