Very obsolete film with terrible, cliche-dog and mawkish dialogue with a very poor construction. In addition, Cassavetes and Falk overactivate. A pseudo "good movie". It takes no time to discover how catastrophic this intellectual turkey. The first stage is a total make, full of Histrionics and hysteria trades. The sound is awful. Moving the cameras without imagination as is the building of characters. No poetry, no subtle psychology, no interesting vaccine. The actors still smoke and we see ads for beer drinks. Very cheap, indeed. (one exception: Ned Beattie "beautiful and simple way of playing the hit man).
