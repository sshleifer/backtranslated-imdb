A Crater Lake Meteor strikes (hence our heading), Awakening a Plesiosaur, who continues to snack on the HICK population (in California, which hickes capital of the world.) There are bad movies, and then there's The Crater Lake Monster, which somehow managed to save MST3K. Featuring grate acting, a decent stop-movement of animals, and more, this is an objectionable piece of budget low-budgetary 1970 / movie monster. While the film is guilty of many crimes, one of the greatest is Arnie and Mitch, of obnoxious rednecks who serve as our comic relief. They bend around, fight in stock "banjo music", women, and act as a pathetic pathetic to humanity. Characters are so bad, they should be counted as a crime against humanity.
