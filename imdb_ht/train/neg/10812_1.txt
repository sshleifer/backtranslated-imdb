What a tacky movie. <br /> I will not waste much time to comment on it. I'm still trying to get back the couple hours I wasted on it. <br /> <br /> Let me leave it simply with - Shaq has no BUSINESS being an actor or singer. It is absolutely talented in both disciplines. It's a weeping shame who has more talent waste away in community theaters and karaoke bars while Shaq uses his name as a basketball player uneservedly to get drowned in movies and cuts. Many of this movie's failures have no talent that is Shaq.
