Georgia Rule has to be the one - if not the worst movie I've ever seen in my life. The movie all has a very surreal feel that made me gasp, "what?" Out loud at least 7-10 times in all its flow of hourly hours. In her trailer as a film on three generations of women - Jane Fonda as the matriarch, Felicity Huffman as her daughter, and Lindsay Lohan as rebel, over-sexual, scantily recreated grand- Daughter, the viewer thinks this will be a clich√©, light, chick-flicking movie about growing up and coming together as a family. <br /> <br /> Talk about fake ads in its worst. <br /> After many animal shots do "funny" things in the background of "pivotal" scenes and not to mention a whole five minutes focusing on an old woman who comes to a weekly doctor's office to have diapers It has changed, or the fact that this film is actually about Lindsay Lohan's character being sexually abused by his father-father, Georgia Rule creates its own genre of movies: unrounded, orably acting, appropriate comedy related issues Very serious in the most awkward way, surreal, weird. If Garry Marshall wanted this movie to be a drama / comedy, then he should watch the Royal Tenenbaums. Sideways. Junebug. So on. So on. <br /> <br /> The only way I feel I can find a reader to understand the awful genus that Georgia Rule falls below is to create a hypothetical situation. Say that the movie, the 40-year-old Virgin, was on the main character being celibate because she was sexually ill like a child. But instead of having the movie take a more dramatic turn, laughing belly and comedy would apply, and all the reaction of the characters being that of fake, dead, human beings pretend to care. <br /> Throw in a yellow parakeet, Dermot Mulroney as the flatest, most non-dimensional characters that might have been completely off from this Wrong Writing Script, along with a male character that throws away all his religious beliefs and morals to be with a garbage, too-tanned girl who shares none of the same interests as it, as well as a unnecessary car scene, real-time characters trying to relate to each other, and you have Georgia rules. <br /> I found this movie to be a reproach to any of these people out there who have difficulty filmmakers, screenwriters, actors, editors, etc. .. with a lot more talented and not getting noticed. <br /> Do not see this movie: my rules. <br /> <br /> But if you must, get enough drink before your hands.
