A sentimental drama set in Denmark, 1969, "We should overcome" offers a Danish pathetic to take on US culture. Frits (Janus Dissing Rathke), a blossom-powered observer, 13-year-old naive, exits and half his ears hanging from the brute master Lindum-Svendsen (Bent Mejding). Lindum-Svendsen, a principal, described as a fascist tyrant, has the local community in control. The Lindum-Svendsen goes too far this time, with his father, recovering from a mental breakdown (sure, there was not enough drama already ...), and overly stereotyped hippie music teacher Mr Svale ('Hi, call me Freddie '), Frits stand for justice. <br /> <br /> Tell you what. So compassionate, sub- (methodical) acted, and so full of misery, that as a 'family' of this grotesque - was filled with clich√©'s- excuse for a fictitious failed movie to persuade non-Scandinavian audiences. Sorry, quality Danish readers, accidents like this in your sentimental journey .. But it's definitely not a story about a 'boy gets a man not fighting the system'. The boy never became a man, but rather remained a naive, weeping-face. If you call a church in small, small minded city, led by a dictator such as the cartoonish character "system", I'm sorry if I miss something. <br /> <br /> If you are in family photos, go see Happy Master
