THAN NOTE is a low film American movie horror that somehow manages to win 2 awards. <br /> <br /> The plot seems to involve 2 separate sections. First, a woman committed suicide by cutting her arms too. Secondly, the young daughter of a technician writer finds the sore throat. The grief couple decided to get to an isolated cabin in the hills. It later transpired that the cabin and surrounding places are haunted. As the movie goes on, the two separate sections of history eventually converge as one might reasonably expect. However, the execution is haphazard and the result of confusion that might perhaps only be solved by seeing multiple. Unfortunately, the film is simply not catchy enough to attract most viewers in watching it more than once. <br /> <br /> Just about everything that can go wrong and this movie goes wrong - and fast! With the low budget can not be used to justify all the imperfections found here. <br /> I believe it would be wrong to pass judgment on the actors involved in this production as the material was simply too poor. /> <br /> Refreshing characters are outlined by other reviews on this site. The wrong script writes introduces too many people without giving them interesting dialogue, without creating character-driving status opportunities and without adding depth to any of them. <br /> <br /> The Direction is inspiring. Inspiration of J-Horror movies like RINGU, GRUDGE and one CALL MISSED obvious. Unfortunately, the directors of DAN REMAINS did not pay close attention to the style of J-Horror. J-Horror works so effectively because it plays on the unknown scary. Tension is created by constant schedule between a rare situation (a ghost on a CCTV camera market towards it for example), and the reaction of a central character who is dealing with it without any warning. There is no humor or tongue-in-cheek in those movies. Everything is played so straightforward and without remorse or limits that you can not help, but persuade and captivated by it. The atmosphere to unlock the suspension and ensure the horror has psychological impact, much unlike the "jumps" being used in Hollywood films. <br /> <br /> The directors of DAN REMAINS made a brave attempt to avoid Hollywood clips and also successfully avoided using CGI. The J-Horror homage was well done. Unfortunately, lack of inspiration is likely to make the radio laugh supposed to "crises" on the screen. Effect of make-up of the "ghosts" was not too bad to give the budget low, but their actions just challenged logic. I was scratching myself quite a few times during this movie. <br /> I could not give away the finish even if I wanted. I simply could not understand it. All that I could inferior was that it was something of an anti-climate. <br /> What remains? The answer as a review of a different website was pointing out is boring. The film is a chore to sit down. Fortunately, the pain ends after an hour and a half. However, most would probably change in time before the end. <br /> There are only 2 positive things I could get in this movie - avoiding the success of scary cliches and the absence of "f-words" in every single phrase as one would normally expect to find. This is what the 2 stars are for. People who love supernatural or psychological horror-related ghosts and haunting could do well in movies such as LEGEND at home, CHANGE or J- Horror sub-genre. <br /> If you think you've seen too many established movies and want to see an ultra-low budget "R-rated" horror movie about ghosts, watch DEATH OF the HUNTER GHOST. It may not be the biggest film ever made, but it is surely a lot better than DAN REMAINS and has a few genuine surprises in store. <br /> I advise everyone to avoid DAN REMAINS like the epidemic.
