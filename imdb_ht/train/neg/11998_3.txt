This is a terrible, terrible movie !!!!!!!!! <br /> <br /> first of all long TOOO. The longer movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> The stories are all too damaging to the top !!!! <br /> As a matter of fact there are too many stories that the story line is ruined. <br /> <br /> The comedy has not been Comedy !!!!! It was not funny at all .... <br /> <br /> The story is so crowded and seriously written that it does not matter if the characters live or die ....... <br /> <br /> I had some expectations from this film ......... but my expectations were crashed completely in the first few minutes ... <br /> <br /> The thing Only good on this movie is the music ...... and obviously Vidya Balan. it gives the best performance and stands out among all the senior actors ...... it's just a new couple and yet it shines and does the rest of the look for Pathetic !!!!! Govinda and the Blon who plays his favorite interests also help save this movie disastrous. Govinda perfectly fits into the taxi driver's role. and the blond also gives a very subtle and consistent performance .. <br /> Another talented actress Ayesha Takiya is completely wasted in this movie !!!! So, is priyanka !!!!!!!!! Akshay performed his role well but it seemed too over the head !!!!! Anil and Juhi are also totally wasted ...... <br /> <br /> The one not only wasted is Salman Because he does not have that talent forever to be wasted !!!!!!!!! <br /> <br /> all in all this is a very impossible movie with Mishmashed screenplay and TOOO Masladar that the storyline is shaped by the stupid comedy scenes. Imagine how stupid this film is !!!!!! <br /> <br /> 3/10 it is four hours long !!!! Think of RETHINK before going to the movies !!!!! better to prevent it !!!!!
