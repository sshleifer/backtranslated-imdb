I absolutely fail to see what's funny in this movie. The humor seems to be destined for corpses. It's slow. The story is too simple to be true. Characters do not greatly increase sympathy, a few non-important characters aside. There is nothing surprising happens. What was the writer script writer? "Oooo funny! Let's do some old ladies on the skin! Let's do them ... gray ... Let's make them ... behave like little children !! Oooo, yes, that's absolutely brilliant and original! " <br /> <This movie has been irritating me most of all the films I've seen in the last five years.
