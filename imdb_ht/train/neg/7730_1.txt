Despite many style, flash, and shine, this French music neglected to speak. The tunes are repetitive, predictable, and tedious. The story is refreshing, as are the many characters. <br /> <br /> People crush in songs and dances, without motivation or purpose. Most of the cast also put papers looking for wigs and hairpieces, and lying to look indomitable tidal studio. <br /> <br /> To be honest, this video of the restored version stopped before the end, so negative one was on me. Certainly a shame, they have such a multi-talent cast in weakness of a final effort. <br /> <br /> Go to show, I guess, where followups (in this case, in the great classic, "umbrella") often do go awry. One can not recapture, only recreate.
