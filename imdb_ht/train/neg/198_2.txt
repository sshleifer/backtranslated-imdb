Burt Kennedy has served as a very good director, but you would never know he's not lumbering. Not only does this film look cheap, it is cheap - most of the battle scenes are rising from the superior "Last Command" from 1955, with that footage, shooting 32 years already, looks more contemporary than anything in this picture. The few action scenes that were actually shot for this movie are disorganized, confused and incompetent, looking as shoddy as the rest of the picture. This has the look and feel of a bad movie film (and the budget does not seem to have a lot of everything else). It moves like melas, acting for the most part is either on top of the head or under-the-top comatose - although Raul Julia comes in better than most of the rest of the cast - and it's full of annoying historical historic trauma. On top of that, it's way too long. If you're going to make a boring film, do it in an hour or so and get it on and - do not stretch it out about three hours, as this one does. If you want to see a good movie about the Alamo, check out the Wayne 1960 version, or even movie in 1955 from which this film stole its action scenes. Difficult to believe it has taken six producers to make a movie this disgusting. Skip it.
