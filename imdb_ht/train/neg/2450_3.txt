I looked at the Peter Jackson version of the Rings when I was halfway through the reading of the towers and I thought it was absolutely brilliant. At that time the animated version of the Lord of the Rings was released on DvD but I told myself that I would finish reading the towers and returning to Kings before watching it (as I thought it was all trilogy a). So when I finished the trilogy I went and brought the DvD, which was a stupid mind because it was absolutely garbage. I was actually bored 20 minutes into it that was really weird because I loved the book and I tightened that the marker of this movie could be even thought of fitting at least 1 and a half of the books in a 2 hour movie movie minutes 8 None of the characters had any emotion when they talked to them seemed to read it on a page, even my favorite characters that Gandalf did not seem interesting at all. <br /> <br /> The animation was only the hiccup of part of the movie except for the orks (they looked terrible) with Aragon and Sam dealing. <br /> I do not know how this film was released because there was not even a finished finish, but maybe it was good that the maker ran out of money because the movie could not have got any better. <br /> I just hope nobody judges books by this movie. <br /> <br /> 3/10
