This show was absolutely awful. For one George is not funny, and his kids snobby brats little. She also treats her mother with no respect. As an Hispanic, I'm very fond of showing this and the way the characters describe. <br /> <br /> The more dysfunctional family has been done to death. For once, I want to see something original. What makes this funny show when other shows made it millions of times? I thought ABC would come in its essence and pull this piece into waste air, but sadly, we will have this abdomen until they are "jumping the shark". <br /> In my opinion, they have already done.
