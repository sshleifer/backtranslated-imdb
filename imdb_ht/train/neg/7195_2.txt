Disney has done it again. The company that made "Mr. Magoo" and "George of the Jungle" made another movie that barely resembles the cartoon on which it is based, and kept by one of the minds of the original. <br /> <br /> "Gadget Inspector" was one of my favorite designs when I was a teenage, and for a movie he existed could be a dream come true then. Now that this film exists, I was seriously disappointed, even outraged. <br /> <br /> First we have the characters. Gadget itself has gadgets that have made it a fun character in the original cartoon (and well-performing special effects accompanying them) but it is now more competent and hoping to solve the crime itself while penny and brain just look. /> <br /> Penny has little to do; while playing a major role in the cartoon, discovering the crime and stopping it, and occasionally getting captured by the MAD agents, now it is simply introduced and then forgotten, although it does At least tune at Claw's base. <br /> <Claw is the movie version of Dr. Claw, who was a rather disaster, raspy-voice man wearing metallic gloves and sitting in his chair, his face hidden from view, as he stroked his cat and overseeing various crimes. Now it is simply a man and a claw for a hand, with no mystery behind the character. <br /> <br /> Brain and angry cat exist in the movie, but rather rather insignificant of it. / Even the small part of the cartoon does not kill in this butcher. The famous expression "Wowsers!" Mysteriously changed to "Wowser", and gadgetmobile Gadgetmobile now looks different and talks. <br /> There are even widespread product outcomes. Why is "Yahoo!" published on a sign? Why the Gadgetmobile has buttons for M & M or Skittles? <br /> <br /> Fans of the cartoon will hate her, others may be lucky to find the movie below by, and when all said and done, this movie is another attempt to make some bucks quick to another old show.
