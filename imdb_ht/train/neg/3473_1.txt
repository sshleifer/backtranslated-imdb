This is probably possibly the worst Christmas movie ever. The plot is usually non-existent, the act (Affleck in particular) is the poorest. Ben Affleck fans will probably defend this film, but the funds must be agreed. As far as I was able to pick up the plot held by Ben Affleck, a millionaire seller, was told not to shrink to go to a place that reminds him of his childhood and burned a list of things he wanted to forget out from childhood. On doing so he ends up paying the family now living in the home to be his family for Christmas ... and that is it. The movie goes on and eventually it gets along with the daughter of the family ... blah blah blah.
