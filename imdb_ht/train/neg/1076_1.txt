This was one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Branaugh seemed to have many problems to remember his accent that he could not save his line. The plot was definitely not worth the name John Grisham. No wonder he has never been published as a book or release of the theater. I did not even look at the whole thing. I decided I did not care for who did it, then realized there was no "whodunit" to care about!
