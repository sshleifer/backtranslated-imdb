This movie was so disappointing. From the bottle that made me decide to see Phantom love (why he called this?) I was hoping something artistic and thoughtful with beautiful imagery. It had some interesting images but they often seemed random and made sense. In fact they seemed like the elements were filled in time. At the end the effect was smooth. <br /> I believe that the film was meant to be atmospheric, but it just was not. The lack of a coherent scheme did not help matters. You can say it was mysterious, but I think it was just incoherent with no atmosphere. <br /> <br /> The main character seemed to be disturbed, but the plot did not draw me into enough to care about her situation. Without looking at the disposal list I would not know that you see the main character as a child. The film has very little context for time, location or character. I'm not a pride, but the sex scenes (there were several) seemed unkind and confused me further, I recognized Lulu, but I was not sure he was the same man, different men, a lover, or she read a whore. It was only when I saw the credits that I discovered back in the haircut meant to be part of her lover. This movie has managed to do what would be shocking (the dream sequence involved Lulu's mother) looks a bit boring. <br /> <br /> The nail belt actually made more sense, as it did to give some clues to Lulu's emotional state. I'm not going to blame the actors as I have not had much work on .. <br /> I do not know if the lack of context or flow of the movie was because of incompetence or because it was pretending but the end result was dull. <br /> I can not bother talking about it anymore.
