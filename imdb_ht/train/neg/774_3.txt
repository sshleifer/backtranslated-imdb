This film appeared to have made some good ideas, but never made a movie before or considered a script to be edited or even funny. When I saw this movie, I saw it for John Candy and supposed, wrong, that it would be hilarious. Instead, there was a stupid scheme of self-control and very flat, unfunny moment. And, by itself cutting, Candy delivers some of the credible lines I have ever heard up to this time. So, despite a potentially funny and storytelling cast, we leave with an amateur and bit movie that probably can be too stupid to the average adult, though adolescents will probably get a few laughs. It's really a shame - it could be so much better. I mean, with Eugene Levy, Joe Flaherty and John Candy it would be wonderful.
