Perhaps because I was so young, innocent and BRAINWASHED when I saw her, this film caused many sleep nights for me. I have not seen it since I was seventh in a Presbyterian school, so I do not know what effect it would have on me now. However, I'll say he left an impression on me ... and most of my friends. He served his purpose, at least until we were old enough with enough knowledge to analyze and create our own opinions. I was particularly scared of the newly converted Christian post-rapture they had to endure when they did not receive the mark. I do not want to spoil the film for those who have not seen it so I will not mention details on the scene, but I can still picture them in my head ... and it was 19 years.
