Well, I do like the gorilla in this movie - it's really unsettling. Anyone who was at the dentist will know why. The story really is not that bad, motivating character Corbin Bersen's make a lot more sense of movies than most horrors. <br /> I've seen worse acting, directing, scripting, etc. but at the end of the day this is still a bad horror movie. So it comes down to if you enjoy the kind of stuff or not. I tried to look at the end, but it was exactly, exactly the same as this movie. Just keep in mind if you enjoy getting tortured at the dentist, then this is the movie for you!
