Let me start by saying how I love the TV series. Despite the tragic nature of a middle-aged man who is unable to pursue his dreams because of harassment, manipulative father, he was incredibly light-hearted and fun to look into practice. In my opinion, it is without doubt one of the largest British sitcoms of all time. The TV series has 10 me out of 10 rating without reservation. <br /> <br /> This movie turned-off in the other hand is a true tragedy in every sense of the word. Hardly any of the essence of the TV show transfer to success on film. This film has a very sad, depressed tone that has almost moved me to tears on several occasions. See Harold being beaten to a pub (and not in a funny way) is not my idea of ​​comedy but is most definitely a reason that fans of the TV series will not like this movie. The movie was painfully except except for the scene where Albert bathed in the sink and was seen by a neighbor. The novels between Harold and Zita are completely out of tune and he asks me whether the producers of this film ever bother to watch the TV series. In the TV series, Harold still went after respectable girls, not annoying. <br /> <br /> The reactions of Albert's remarks were made by Harold's girlfriends were absolutely priceless in the TV series. In the movie, Albert says virtually nothing when such an opportunity arises. Most movie-offs in British sitcom tend to be quite dull, with the remarkable exception of the BUSES films (which in some respects were actually better than the TV series itself!). But STEPTOE and child were ranked right at the very bottom of the deck, even under the GEORGE and miled. <br /> <br /> My advice - jump this one and see second turn-off, STEPTOE AND SOUND RIDE AGAIN rather. It has a lighter tone, is more loyal to the TV series, and it is actually very funny.
