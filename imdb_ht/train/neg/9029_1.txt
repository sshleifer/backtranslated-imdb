This film teared virtually all the talented actor in what could be best to be outright called a "potboiler". Although its action-packed 'top weapon' opening it is all downhill from there and many of stereotypes and situations easy to follow each other until you try to choke yourself on your popcorn. <br /> <br /> There are so many dead-line sequel lines in this movie I guess at a point he did by collage along a discreet TV set. <br /> <br /> The Mexican drug Master-Quinn is ridiculous and his 'harassed' right off from a Quinn-Martin cop in 1970. Costner's character is wild and gives us no reason We believe he actually fell in love with Mendez's wife. We are not convinced to believe that the painful wife for the company will jump the first hot body that comes together. <br /> <br /> Definitely a B 'movie at best with a great time garbage for everyone involved.
