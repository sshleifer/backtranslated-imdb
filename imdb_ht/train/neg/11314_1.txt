This film is probably the worst I've ever seen. Bad act, bad script, bad things. Comparing it to mostly other movies in the same way and out of about the same time is interesting. Both cyborgs (Van Damme, 1989) and Nemesis (Olivier Gruner, 1993) are best and seem more robust in both direct and continuous history and are always in Albert Pyun who led these two as well! history is not original. The world has become a terrible place, perhaps due to environmental disaster or nuclear war, and people living under medieval circumstances. A special breed of robots (Cyborg) lives on blood and has in the history ... Siborg needs to get a lot of people accomplished having "prophecies" and people they need someone to stop them. A girl with a robot (Kris Kristofferson) constructed by the creator of cyborgs was appointed by destiny to save mankind. <br /> In this movie director will try some Hong-Kong fighting scenes with participants flying high and leaping far. The movie fails miserably in this attempt. <br /> I recommend this movie with the only reason that most people will find a new "worst" ever movie related. And fans of the genre I recommend "Cyborg" since I think it's a lot movie that underestimated and quite a fun entertaining factor. But if you can not stop Van Damme then check out "Nemesis". <br /> I rated this movie 1/10.
