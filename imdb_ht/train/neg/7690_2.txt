Anyone giving this movie a good review obviously must have had something to do with its creation. This movie is a painful suckfest. The act is stiff, the generic band stock is ridiculous, the direction is bland and weird at all, the teacher really is not all that attractive (making the blatant avenue all the more left). The creative spirit behind this garbage should break and spread to prevent more focus concentrates. I'm sure some hungry children in Africa could use the money to waste on this project. Hell, the money would also have to see a more powerful force again fueling a crack-addict; At least someone should get some fun out of it. For single reasons that she did not give me a terminal illness, I'll give this movie a two.
