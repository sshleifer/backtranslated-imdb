The only good part about this movie is the beautiful scenery. This film was long and boring. The Minister should retire from the polipit when his son Paul turned from the teachings he had proclaimed. How often can the boys take the Lord's name in vain in this movie being from a Presbyterian background? It does not fit. I wanted Paul to sweep down the river without a boat at the very beginning for our comic, smile, selfish story of Paul (Brad Pitt). So Norm becomes a teacher and Paul becomes a compulsive gambler who Norm wants to save but not-so. It is very refreshing. We see the white prey that they stand up to by Paul because of his native American girl. That was the only party that had some interest and perhaps was able to develop into a real 'wild west'. What we only see is a sleeping city where the son of the minister has nothing to do but 1. Norm chase a lame girlfriend and deal with her family and 2.Polit up dumb story in the store newspapers while scratching his head and taking lots of swigwear and tying a lot of flies. I would like to watch a show about fishing that movie again-that will never.
