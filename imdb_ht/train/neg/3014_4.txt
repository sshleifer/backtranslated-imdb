I recently saw scenery scenery at the Festival Film Festival Seattle. I was drawn to the movie as a photographer because I'm both familiar with a fan of Burtynsky's work. While I believe the film does a good job getting her message at all, I could not help but feel that she did as a complete reflection of the pictures and subsequent popular books by Burtynsky. It is obviously a reason for this is the use of lots of still pictures featuring zoom and pan across them. While this is a good effect when used economically, I felt like 75% of the film was just still in Burtynsky's book (which I already own). This is probably an exaggeration, but that's how I felt. If you own the book or are familiar with your work you might better jump this one.
