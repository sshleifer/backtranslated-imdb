This is not so much movie like kids kids kids big budget. As far as I can say, the villain is a giant swarm of chocolate covered pepper espresso. This theory seems to be verified by the fact that the subtitles refer to it as 'insomnia'. When it's first mentioned that a civilization was wiped out to insomnia, I thought "Wow! A Nihilistic martial kiss movie!" but there is no such luck. Although you have to consider it experimental cinematic when the villain is teased by the old man's long, white eyebrows. To warrior do exactly the same amount of sense of whether the subtitles are over or over. It's not a good sign. I found special effects to be somewhere between Ray Harryhausen and Xena: Warrior Princess. Primitive.
