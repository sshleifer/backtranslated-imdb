I wrote in at least a dozen dozens of obvious reviews in this little eagle cops and did not get published, so I must opine that someone in imdb.com really likes this horrible movie. The idea that a bunch of oilmen can resurrect a military tank that was set in the desert for more than a decade, and making a fighting machine in it is still funny. So is the acting and direction. Spend it.
