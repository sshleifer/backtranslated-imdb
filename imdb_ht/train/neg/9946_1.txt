SPOILERS HEREIN <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> My high school did everything we could to try and motivate us for the tests. But the most memorable methods used to bring you into the state right in your head was a guest speaker, who was no other than the Australian favorite Kickboxing's son, the Stan "Man" Longinidis. The first mistake was to give this guy a microphone, because he was screaming half the time even though we sat no more than 3 or 4 feet away from him. Now his speech was filled with the usual "if you fail to prepare, then prepare to fail" stuff, but there were various circumstances where I really worked. The guy stood in front of us preaching how throughout his life he did everything for himself and no one else. He has offered many deals in the past to give up kick-boxing, but he never looked into the prize to become the greatest Australian kick-boxer. He said he was not a sold-out, he was happy with a retired, he never participated in any other activity other than Kickboxing ?? Then she connects her movie. Yes, you hear well, he PLUGGED his new movie. As she talked about her, she received a woman coming in and holding her a poster post, and then she showed this shitty 4 minute clip of this movie wrong called "Trojan Warrior". (That's all he was before being beaten by Gurkan Ozkan in his final career battle (for now)) <br /> Stan plays Ajax, a former-boxing former special forces force pulled into the Melbourne seedy dead. Ajax's cousin, Theo (Arthur Angel) recently sold (well, at least Stan did not lose too far from all) to the feds, and as a result is on the run from all walks of organized crime. Ajax and Theo get into all kinds of ridiculous situations, from fighting in a Kebab store to posing as playboys to a slave party. It's all pretty ridiculous, but if Silverstein was actually aiming to make a credible movie here, the man would never have to give a camera again. <br /> <br /> I'll admit, I've actually pumped to see it. I love action movie, though they regret, and especially if it's put in my own backyard. But what I presented was a filthy and aggressive act out of the word "go", and continued to do so after the words "for God's love please make it stop!", The subplots were presented and they Do not even touch on again after they came from the open, the characters were just thrown in for absolutely NO reason, and the most talk-choreography scenes that did not even remotely reflect Stan's current talent in kickboxing. The cast occurs in vince outright vinko by just about any person REMOTELY famous (Dermot Brereton, Mark "Helicopters" and Greg Matthews). The whole time you're sitting there and playing the guessing game of just who stands there in the background. Too bad the movie depends very much on the split-second appearances by former celebrities. Remember these draw-holes I told you about? Ajax once over time was apparently locked up, accused of killing his wife. Now we hear that Ajax was in special force through one single phrase of the WHOLE movie, and then left it to fight. This is followed by another SINGLE phrase that convinced Ajax to help the same people to close it up. Then find this, in the end, he reveals Ajax that his wife is not actually dead, but was sold in prostitution. We see it? Ajax's name goes to him as soon as he hears that? No. Now is a wedding! <br /> Among all this some irritated spies, some websites depict this movie as "a cross between Jackie Chan & Guy Ritchie ??". Does this man ever sit down and watch a movie Jackie Chan? Chan shows more dexterity to take a dump than Stan does ??, well, ANYTHING! And Guy Ritchie is the crime-movie Christ, and you'll compare it to Salik Silverstein! This movie is more like a mix between "Pizza" and "The Nose Wear". <br /> Now, where are you all the "Trojan Warrior" title out there? Ajax's fight like that of a former Greek warrior? No Gamer 'unification found to Theo, like those of the Trojan Empire? No. It is because? wait for it ?? Theo brings a condom around with her. Yes, this is because THEO is always prepared with a RUBBER MAK Trojan in his pocket, it is a Trojan WARRIOR! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </a> "Read: Chopper did this for the sole purpose of proving that anyone can rap. The funny thing was Chopper just rapped for 30 seconds and then threw it on those two young Albino from Doncaster, using the words as "ten" and "drugs" etc. in the Australian accents. Facing it people, rap was developed in the United States, leaving it there! The clip looked like something a cameraman 31 Channel on Ecstasy joined together. <br /> <br /> Bloop: There was no real difference between these and the current movie. <br /> <br /> Stan's "Man" Longinidis Kickboxing Featurette: This was not too bad, considering it was just 6 or 7 different battles to show off different angles (I think I saw Dennis Alexio falling off about 15 times at this time 3). /> <br /> I do not mean this movie contributes to the reason that this country will be in hell when it comes to film, but ... Oh wait, I just did. My advice to anyone who reads this is to get out and buy 4 or 5 copies of "Trojan Warrior", tape them together, and use it for a paper, because this movie is just awkward.
