How often do we have to see a bad horror movie with an assassin in a ripoff mask? The plot of bleeding is an original way but the movie itself is a complete failure. For one thing the dialogue is poorly developed, it's boring and waste too much time on trivial details, the act is bad, and tight. I want my money back, this stink is worse than a skunk.
