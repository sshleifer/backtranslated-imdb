Pathetic ... worse than a bad movie made-to-TV movie. I can not believe that Spacey and Freeman were in this movie flick. For some reason Morgan Freeman's character still speaks of saying "pussy" when referring to boyfriend NSync boy. Morgan Freeman calls "pussy" woman is just left ... What the hell was the person behind this film thinking? Too many imaginable holes combined with the surprised act, angle confusion camera, a script and good music music made this movie absolutely unbearable. I have rented this flop with low expectations .... but. Well ... it really sucks.
