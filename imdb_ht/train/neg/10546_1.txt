I just saw that atrocities in my movie program, and I thought it was awful, as I said in my slogan, it was pretentious, trite, petty and self-important phenomena. <br /> <I consider myself a fan of film, and all that movie has to offer. If I want to watch a documentary on the Cannes Festival, I'll watch A & E .... and would probably do more with it. <br /> I do not recommend it, period. <br />
