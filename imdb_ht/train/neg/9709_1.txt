30 seconds in opening credits, I had this feeling that this was going to be a bad movie, but I did not know just how bad. Then the actor plays the evil Nazi scientist opening his mouth with my friends and I decided that in order to survive this movie, we'll have to turn the volume down, make up our own dialog with double speed on the DVD. But that did not help. Approximately halfway the way we turned it around. Now I've lived in some very early movies, both with and without the "Mystery Science Theater 3000" and "Svengoolie," but there are just some movies that I doubt the same Bots can be saved. The biggest part of the movie that bothered me the most was that people hypnotized in believing that zombie was rotting green pots. I guess they all were hypnotized to death, then hypnotized to disassociate themselves. Stick in classic B-movie classics such as "Nine Plan From Exterior Space."
