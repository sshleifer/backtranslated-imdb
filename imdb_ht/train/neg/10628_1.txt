The so-called "documentary" is trying to say that the USA hailed the moon-landing. Year straight. <br /> Everyone who actually studies the case knows differently. <br /> <br /> First of all: there is definitely evidence. When the astronauts were on the moon, they brought back many books of stone from the moon - for geological study. These places scatter around the world in hundreds of labs, who test them. And they all conclude that they came from the same planet, not earth: because the interior isotopes of basic elements are different from those found on earth, but similar to those calculated to be on the moon. I.E. Theoretical scheme never studied anything: they only take the thing that fit into the theories and ignore the rest. <br /> Another bad claim from them is being wind in the hangar where the moon landing has landed, the IE flag moved. There is a logical explanation: the astronaut moved with his hand, so he moved. And this proves this: well, if the conspiracy theorists even studied the foot, they would see that the flag NEVER move after the astronomer left it, I.E. The scholars of the bad-theorists, they cant study a topic well, or only study it until they have what they have come to, that they can make a lie out of that, and make a profit (ie so called " documentary ") A claim says it cant possible to have filmed the moon because all the shadows come from different places, because there are different source lights, the artificial lighting from the studio. Once again the conspiracy theorists are wrong (as usual), the same that could happen in a deserted desert at night, with no source light. But I doubt that any conspiracy theorist has ever been outside the Grand Basin for more than how many a Star Treck-convention was held on .. Theorists conspiracy in refusal, great time. They only see what they want to see. So they make up all the lies that seem important - that's a fact.
