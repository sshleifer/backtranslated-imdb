Comedy Central has been successful with original programs using professional comics. The Chapelle Show, Mind of Mencia, the Daily Show and The Greatly Popular Colbert Report all professional comic stars and all of them, or in the Chapelle Show case, being solid shows. Given that Sarah Silverman is one of the best female comics in the business, I was expecting good things when I tuned in. <br /> <br /> I was so disappointed. <br /> There are some legitimate sequences funny, but given that the star is the Silverman gauge, the show was the best. It was just the pilot, and hopefully next week will be better. If not, get some help in the form of the best writer for the show.
