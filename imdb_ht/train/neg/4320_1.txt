First of all, let me say that this is not the movie for those who are looking to look something sweet and joy for the holidays. This film is cold, brutal, and just downright depressing. Mary Steenburgen plays a grinchy mother who came down on Christmas because her husband lost his job, lost home, can not buy Christmas presents for kids, etc. You get the idea of ​​happy holiday things. So, together comes Harry Dean Stanton as the Christmas Angel Gedeyon, who is in his black hat and covers so much more as a pedophile hanging around the children all day observing. What better way to encourage the Christmas spirit of Mary Steenburgen than to kill her family and then offer them back if she believes in Christmas again. Santa Claus is a blackmailer and his Christmas workshop looks more like a refuge for Nazi refugees on the blizzard. The film lays everything so thick that you do not care about the unhappy end when it comes because the rest of the movie is so bitter and incredible. I'm sure this movie wanted something Capra-like, but she left joy and feelings about what a holiday movie would be.
