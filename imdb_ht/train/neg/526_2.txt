Almost as tiring to watch as she read, Tonight is a gorgeous product ... until Meryl Streep walks in and slowly shows other members throwing it out how to act this kind of stuff. Vanessa Redgrave is shocking to her role as Ann Ann and Claire Danes are a chiffon. Perhaps if Vanessa and Claire had changed the role we could see the vibration of the young Ann who gave her into the rare world of the story and we could imagine that the greatest Ann actually died. <br /> I was expecting the addition of Michael Cunningham in the writing credits would smooth out the jumper story but alas. She gave me a headache.
