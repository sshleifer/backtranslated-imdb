This is a make-for-television and rather useless Sci-Fi Channel storytelling in the Beowulf story, especially after the 2005 2005 film "Beowulf and Grendel". This movie does not really go into Beowulf's story, but just takes us to fight it against the ravenous beast known as Grendel as it leaves a government of absolute scars and turmoil while the powerful viking warrior, Beowulf is called on getting rid of the monster's rampage. If this succeeds successfully, the king does not have to sacrifice the kids to keep it in butter. After a few attempts failed, the animal was killed, but it's angry and vengeful mom soon to attack, leaving it up to Beowulf, again, borrowing his mighty acts of courage and strength to defeat him. "Grendel" seems to have fired on a small budget and the CG effects are awful. As I said, this film is absolutely useless.
