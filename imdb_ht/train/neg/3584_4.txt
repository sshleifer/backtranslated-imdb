Curiosity, it is Rene Riso's eye and mouth - by Buddy Gorilla's - from the focal point of "Buddy", a Jim Henson Photo Production of Francis Ford Coppola's Zoetop. Somehow, countless close-ups in Russo's face slipped over to the post-production production steps, and it literally fills the screen for many awesome awesome upstaged times. Unintentionally funny stories are really adapted from Gertrude's "Trudy" Davies Lint Memoirs on a wealthy doctor's wife who turns their castles into a menagerie for pets and wildlife. The film goes beyond good intentions ... it positively drops and earnest sincerity. The film never shines with the kind of "family movie" magic that it needs, and before too long both people and animals seem to be strictly scheduled (nothing here feels real). About ten minutes, the chimpanzees goofing around the Russo's kitchen and begin to knock a blind knife back and forth (he misses Alan Cumming's head by in.); But no eyebrows are raised because it's all in one's fun. Still, when grand-grown Gorilla Buddy gets crazy during a thunderstorm, the cops are called - and everyone stares at Buddy in the window while busts up the living room furniture. The furniture should be least of anyone's worries in this flabbergasting, make-good chess. But at least we know Russo was in good hands: whenever director Caroline Thompson needed a good pick-up shot, he gave Rene unstartled another extreme close-up. I wonder what the lipstick budget was about this picture? ** from ****
