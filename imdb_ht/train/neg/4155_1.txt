OK, I knew this would be a back go F-movie (well below normal B-movie) going to it, so I thought, "Man, I could use a good laugh, so let's to see some Nether-beings kill each other. "Well, what I got could be found in your local store" store ". Random lesbian scene, very little fight, and no scheme. For example, one particular scene I remember (for its absolute scooter only; I've seen better pornography on ABC) is where the main character (i can not remember the names touching ... big movie, huh?) are driving together, as they are mostly doing, and the driver was tired of driving and stopping: <br /> <br /> Driver: "Let's pull on, I'm tired." Do you want to take on? "Passengers:" Be sure , I can drive for a while. " (Once pulled on, the driver starts grabbing the passenger's boost) passengers: "What do you do? I'm not like that!" Driver: "It's OK, everyone does it sometime." Passengers: "OK then." (Continuing to take the shirt, fondle, kiss, and make fellatio) <br /> Now, last time I checked, horror movie was not in the porn section of Hollywood video (unless you're in S & M, then , you go elsewhere), and it definitely should not be in the mainstream videos of blockbuster. Do not get me wrong; I'm definitely not one of those who hate pornography, but I only look at it when appropriate and definitely do not want to look it if I'm looking for a movie in the mainstream stores, like this one I rented in one of two The retailers I called (and probably the other one also if I went and watched). <br /> <br /> Worst movie ever, no one should rent it, and it should only be bought for a public burning ceremony. If I could give it a 0, I would, but I can only give it a * of 10.
