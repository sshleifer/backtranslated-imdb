Actually, the film is neither sorrow nor sci-fi. With a very Christian Christian theme, this film delivers minimal content and non-suspension. The second-tier actors perform half-decent work in reading boring roles. The only good performance is not Sydney Penny who plays a role in a mother ... I'm not going to spoil the movie, it's Christ or Anti-Christ. Avoid watching movie unless you are a religious Christian observer with Apocalypse. <br /> <br /> Being a non-Christian Christian, I was forced myself to watch this movie just because I wanted to write this review. It's a pity that Sci-Fi channels were in that movie movie in the peak evening time.
