This was not enjoyable to watch. Frank puts all his dreams on the burner back and gets a normal job (boring!) Just for his bacon can go to film school, but his berries decide he will make a humiliating documentary on the man instead. A documentary film maker should display the camera and simply shoot, do not manipulate comments and snip captions. The pain and resentment of the cinema towards his stepfather is obvious. And sad. The goal seems to be to make Frank appear dumb and pathetic, rather it comes across as the most people in the 3 people. <br /> <br /> Primarily a test campaign all dress up as something smarter and edgy than it really is. She left me with an intense flu for the cinema.
