Even though the book was not strictly accurate in the real situation it describes it always brings a sense of Japan. I find it hard to believe that anyone who participated in this film has ever been in Japan as he did not feel Japanese at the slightest. Almost everything about it was awful. I will admit the actors were generally quite good but could not stand a chance to save it. Before the movie began I was surprised that there were only ten people in the cinema on a Friday night shortly after the movie was opened in Japan. 30 minutes I was surprised to stay. I stayed up to criticize him. The whole movie was punctuating my hunger and suppressed the disbelief of my Japanese girlfriend. Everyone I saw is walking out of that movie that looks like confusion and disappointment about their faces. <br /> <br /> For the musicians in this movie, you have to be two hours.
