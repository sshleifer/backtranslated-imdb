I decided to look this one because it was nominated for Oscar this year. I guess as much here I really wanted to love this movie, but ended up bored and humiliated. The first scene was OK but the whole rest of the movie in "but worried" camera mode is really annoying. <br /> I guess the main reason for making a movie and nominating it for Oscar is this: / / <br /> American "military machine" (people, making money on war) urgently need an excuse or justification of war in Iraq does not inclined to cling to something (patriotic). "Heroic" directors' efforts with the main character of the _inspire_ audience with an idea of ​​"love-war-like-a-drug"? .. Oh, please come on! what a do! <br /> <br /> See this to get an idea of ​​how low the film academy can fall ...
