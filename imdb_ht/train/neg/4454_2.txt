The first few background; I am English and lived in London all my life. I was in many games of the 'Den' and most other London club yards. I'm familiar with the type of person who gets into vandalism and I know just how to act and how to talk. Let's say this is a bad, bad movie. I can tell you that Green Street is one of the most unrealistic movies ever I have ever seen. I spent most of the film brighter and troublesome. I felt I should write a mini review because I felt I needed to point out a few things. <br /> <br />) People just do not speak like that in London in real life; The filmmakers took the whole jargon thing so far and made it sound stupid. Unfortunately violent types exist, but those you see in Green Street are more like parody. b) The actor who plays Burke Dunham (Charlie Hunnam) unfortunately blew on as 'English' or 'Cockney' as Osama bin Laden. It is from up north to Newcastle and I'm just surprised any of the other actors could hold right face acting with him - how we should take it seriously. Why did not just get someone from East London to play that part is beyond me. I could do a 'bang up work' myself, hehe. c) Mr Frodo. I mean how can I expect to take seriously Elijah Wood kicking the donkey at twice his size and who is really embarrassing hooligan. He would die. Simple like that. Honestly (as a British) it was hard to watch this movie. I'm pretty sure that this movie will bomb here in the UK. It can be a bit better in the states because Americans just know (or care) how correct it is. <br /> <br /> Please, my American and foreign friends, do not believe in a word in this nonsense. Yes these companies exist, but it's all very robust and silent silence, and on a much smaller scale. The movie only gets a 2 from me because they actually filmed some of it in London. Usually they try to film the things in Cardiff (Wales) or something and expect us not to notice.
