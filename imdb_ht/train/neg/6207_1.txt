This movie commits what I would call an emotional rape on the viewer. The film supposedly caused quite a stir among the critics of camp, but for me the final stage was just a pathetic attempt for a senior director to find herself noticed. Usually a voice in the discussion about the issue of violence, drug abuse or juvenile delinquency (or any other problem, for that matter). Metamorphosis of the main character comes from the good, but troubled little violent boy is virtually nonexistent, then the rape scene (being an over-dragged, exaggerated version of the rape scene from "An Orange Arrangement") is unbearable and I refuse to comment on its aesthetic value. There are some things that an artist should not do to try and achieve his goals. At least in my opinion. <br /> <br /> To wrap it: shocking brutal, rioting and you do not waste your time. See "An orange craft" or "Le pianiste" instead.
