I feel like I was, the hub is over, not falling for it. After reading glowing review (The director was a movie review and Sky for years to have a lot of peers in the press ready to make it a favor in writing favorable reviews) I hope solid act, atmosphere, suspense, strong characterization, an intriguing trace of development and poetic moments. Unfortunately, 'Sixteen Years of Alcohol', does not deliver on the promise critics, for the most part, killing these types of cheese low special budget budgets (what was the scene screenshot scene?), Unrealistic battle choreography with the idea of ​​numbing narration, cliche edition and camera angles. <br /> <br /> 'Sixteen Years of Alcohol' begins in interesting and some beautiful shots in Scotland, but it's straight down from here. Unfortunately, instead of spending some time building atmosphere, creating characters we could care about, or building suspension - the director opts to start driving your crazy and self heavy indulgence released the voice-over. The lead characters are so unsympathetic with them, so seriously acting - the audience does not care what's going on, desperate actors do desperate things ... like this movie !. To make matters worse, the 'homage' (typical of a director trying to pay his dues at past meters) is either cliche or compelling. The soundtrack is the only thing that awakens me and keeps me in the movie but even fails to support the other dramatic narrative connecting a period of time to the action. <br /> <br /> For some reason the film has been increasingly flawed and must be honored annoyingly. I'm still watching all the damn! <br /> I guess I liked the attempt of realistic fear of the movie but that was destroyed when they were often interrupted with strange and abstract, sometimes free stage. You do not need a big budget to make really move the movie, so much has been told about how little money was made to this movie, half a million is not a little bit of money ... so there is no EXCUSES! Sometimes I ask what the actors ... Or the agents thought! <br /> Spend on this turkey unless you are masochistic or mindless anyway ... NO MONEY <br /> <br /> 1.5 / 10
