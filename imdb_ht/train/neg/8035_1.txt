This is one of the worst horror movies I've ever seen ... Unfortunately, I'm a horror film scrub and will rent any horror movie unless it's not done for t.v. When looking at the box it says it is rated R for gore and some languages ​​... where was the gore? Was a single good death scene where you actually saw Gore? I could neglect that if there were some short nudity or some good dialogue. There was not even one remote sense or fun line of this lame film. Sometimes sinister movies are scary because they are so stupid, but that's just sad.
