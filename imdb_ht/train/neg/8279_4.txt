This movie has all the elements to be a smart, brilliant comedy, but for some reason it took the dumbass road. Maybe he did not really know who his audience was: but it's hardly someone's movie to give the cast and sketch, yet slapstick cloths and blonde-full-female women. <br /> <br /> If you've seen legally blonde with her sequel, then this is like the ending expansive end. Large actors like Luke Wilson should expect better material. Jessica Simpson could also manage more. Rachael Leigh Cook and Penelope Anne Miller languish in supporting the roles that are funny rather than fun. <br /> <br /> Many of this film were paint-by-numbers, various Uber-clich√© montages, last minute "misunderstanding", even disorder of children's parts. This just suggests lazy script. <br /> <br /> It should be possible to get this enjoyable movie if you do not take it seriously, but it's such a blatant could-be much better than you'll likely feel frustrated and increasingly shame as the last rolling scene.
