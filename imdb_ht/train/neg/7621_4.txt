As noted, this formula was filmed several times, most recently as "You Received Mail", with Tom Hanks and Meg "Trout Pout" Ryan. In the several versions, this is my youngest favorite. The problem I think is the studio's side about the star charisma, which does not quite cut it here. <br /> <br /> The chemistry of betwixt of the drives never comes to a boil in this movie. There is no real spark. Van Johnson and Judy Garland remind me of old, handsome but bold donut days. But when the drives are boring the rest of the movie can only follow. Judy in particular is disappointing. It looks like it has no strokes! I do not know if it had problems with pain or something but it looks like a turtle trying to pull itself in his shell, all hunched up with everything. I could not figure out what Van Johnson was getting hot. I would make a bee line for this violin lovely player. And wind was not big either. I've always thought about it as a rather generic Hollywood leading man and he does not do anything to dispel this image. <br /> <br /> If you're a fan of stars or at the beginning of 1900 then you would like this movie. But there are a lot more fun romantic comedy out there, and they offer you more than a drop of stale jam.
