Oh, this is so bad, it's funny. The only way one can explain something like this is a pornography and drug-related part of the resolution to make a movie just for fun. I mean: you get to see topless actress porn, sex, then killed by human mutants. There are many gore, including classic "something wrong with it, oh no, it's half the person he used to be" and the murder of crashes caused by panic. But you can also find funny things like triple pulling into a donkey and someone running in the woods then finding himself decapitated by a wire tied between two trees (making a metal doiing afterwards, as in drawing anime). Somehow there is a market for those who go beyond porn, they really need to know what is inside an actress, only genitals are not enough. Therefore, you get to see autopsy summary about killing bimbos. There is no dialogue. Jenna and Chasey are really small parties and I really wonder what Richard Grieco wanted when accepting a role here. I think this is a single movie to watch with the button on fast forward and watch only the juicy thing, just to be reminded of the old school cinema school cinema.
