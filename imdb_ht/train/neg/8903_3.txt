Prophecy II, what to say about it? They completely abandoned the originality of the movie first, and simply made a Chris Walken Movie Splatter. It's not even written by the original writer! <br /> If you saw no. 1 do not look no. 2 it is a real disappointment ... <br /> <br /> If you have not seen no. 1 do not look no. 2! Go See No. 1 to experience something original and fun
