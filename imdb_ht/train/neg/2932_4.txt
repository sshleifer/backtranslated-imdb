Not that he would care, but I'm not one of Simon Pegg's friends. If I was, there was a good chance we would fallout if it continued to make red like this. The problem is, he found a successful formula as the bumbling, ordinary guy-next-door type of Shawn of the Dead, runs Fat Boy Run etc, but it's starting to wear thin. Here her character has no kind of discernible, it's rude and obnoxious, and her thoughts are funny when she frankly is not. Being transferred to New York in London (and I suppose this link is meant to appeal to viewers on both sides of the Atlantic), it also proves out of place with its new colleagues. Still, is he surprised if he's jolly she hired a transvestite decorating to appear at an editorial meeting of a revenge for her boss. But somehow, Kirsten Dunst starts to warm up, even though she did nothing nice. Oh, and because she is a superfish boy she falls for Megan Fox at first sight, maybe because her character is as deep as her. It all does for a predictable film conclusion, although I can not see any visualizer expressing how this reflects life. The shame is that on this paper is a supposedly cast worth watching. Pegg, though, plays herself, Kirsten Dunst looks just like the motions, creating no screen on screen, and Megan Fox is not stretched at all. One big one is Miriam Margolyes, as New York's Pegg's owner - now if he's been on longer screen .....
