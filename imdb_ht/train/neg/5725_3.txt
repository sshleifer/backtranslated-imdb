2005 has given us the very decent "gore porn" movie hostel, and 2006 gave us Live Feed; a not so decent rip-off of hostels. Live feed follows the very formula of the same formula as El Roth's earliest movie, except the time of mute children in Asia rather than central Europe. The draw focuses on these mute kids, and one of them has annoyed one of the locals to find themselves in trouble. The locals decided to close them all in a theater, and killed them. Despite the fact that I would have listened to something less than favorable to this film before seeing it, I still hoped that it would be at least half decent because director Ryan Nicholson had already done so much for the 45-minute rape and movie revenge 'Torched 'but this movie simply falls because most of it is either ridiculous or boring. The movie is obviously trying to embrace back in the good old days of Grindhouse movies (which Hostel was, successfully), but it really does not come there. Surprisingly, consider Nicholson's work in special effects - not even the gor is impressive ... although it's a lot better than the act! There are not many other things I can say about this movie ... it's bad and not in a great way. Avoid it!
