Does Francis Ford Coppola have a brain anesthesia some time after directing "Apocalypse Now" that made him absolutely incapable of making a good movie? <br /> You must ask what the director of the "godfather" and the "conversation" thought when he made this film flabby. He gives Kathleen Turner a car that begins, plays a woman who travels back in time and gets her adolescence to know everything that life as an adult has taught her, and Turner, the trooper that she is, doing so she can with it, but this movie can not be saved by anyone. <br /> It does not even have any style, and, given its director, one would expect that even if he had nothing else, he would have that. <br /> <br /> Grade: C-
