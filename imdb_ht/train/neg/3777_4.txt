Flat, superfluous image on less than amazing fantasy animated a horribly predictable story of this movie. Absolutely nothing takes you by surprise, you can even say when Bryan Adams songs will go into them, which is still in bad air. <br /> <br /> The main character, the horse's spirit, gives a annoying voice when it tells what's happening. The narrative is not needed, though, as everything happens is really obvious. You can even say what the horses say, although all they do is neighbor. That would be good, but all the horses do exactly the same sounds - one for warning, one for sadness, one for laughing, etc. There is no variation between the horses' voices. <br /> <br /> Young children can be like this movie, though. It soppy enough for a family to sit and watch, and there is little danger to anyone who was scared. If you have nothing else to do, and you want to watch a movie with your kids, this is not a bad choice. <br /> But otherwise, this is not recommended.
