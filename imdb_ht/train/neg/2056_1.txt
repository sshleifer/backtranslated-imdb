Anyone who likes the two classic novels by Edward Ormondroyd will be disappointed in this movie. All the magic and romance have been upgraded from its original story to a girl who makes a good paper for a mysterious old lady, and gives "three" in return. Three what? By three wishes, but three rides in the 1800's on a rafting elevator ... <br /> <br /> The first novel is time to the top. The second is all at the right time.
