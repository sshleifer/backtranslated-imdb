Daraar got in a very good start. The first scene really left me in the corner of my seat asking what would happen next. Other than that, the first half of the movie is a total amount. All the first half of the movie is over, Rishi Kapoor is heading over the love heels with Juhi Chawla. By the way, do you think it's a little old for her? <br /> <br /> Things finally start spicing up among the movie when Juhi tells us about her previous husband; and wow what a crazy is it! It was a protection, clean-freak and a really HOT TEMPER! He used to beat Juhi poor for good reason! One of the reasons I really do not like this movie is because I can not stand to see Juhi (my favorite actress) to get so abused. This film in general has excessive blood and blood abusive ways; I find it so disgusting !!! <br /> Anyway, all I'm trying to say is if you're thinking about renting Daraar, you should put it right back on the shelf where you find it and choose something else!
