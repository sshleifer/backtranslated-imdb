This movie forever left an impression on me. I watched it as a Freshman at High School and was home for that night. I think I lost all respect to Robert Reed as an actor being a big fan of the "Brady bunch". I also thought Chuck Connor's role was lurid and evil. However, this movie has made such an impact on me that I am now a volunteer in the prison state of the women doing Bible studies and church services and trying to change women's lives, one at a time. What fascinating me is that so some people actually watch this movie. None of my friends have watched it and my family is clueless that day when I discuss this movie because they did not see it.
