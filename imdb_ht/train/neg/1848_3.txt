There are bad movies, then there are those films that are SO bad, that they become almost art. This is one of those films. My partners and I are always both shockable shapes, you know, set off in space and drooling! You can say that people are involved (I hope they change their names to protect themselves) they had an explosion, and they definitely did not shy. I give this one three out of ten just because of the free smut and really bad bad effects. I laughed loudly during most of the movie, so I guess you might say she showed me a good time. Beware the viewer, the words above are in no way constructed that this is a good movie, because it's not. All I can say in my defense, is that it was impossible to film a movie with such a great title!
