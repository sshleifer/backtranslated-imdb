I ask who was responsible for this disruption. The jokes would not work for Gilligan Island. If this was going to the series, would there be joke about Auschwitz, or would Eva have replaced his oven, only Adolf suggested the 50th seat? Another post compared to this show I love Lucy. The problem with this is that Lucille Ball was a genius of physical comedy and bizarre situations, and this disruption had just plainly plotted to do with an insult to my intelligence. In the Nazi area of ​​England and the number of people killed, I would think the very concept of a comedy about Hitler would seem repugnant and the most normal would have killed this concept before any episodes were produced.
