Another case of a decent DVD case is to betray the shot-on-video quality of the movie. <br /> It was not that bad. Rochon is doing a job with humor! The throw is good looking. I have never seen that many muscular men hang out together on a regular basis. This movie really wants you to think Rochon was the killer, but he did not owe it. My biggest problem with the movie was that in the end, I was not very careful who was the killer, and the real killer made little sense, since it was out of the blue and the filmmakers thought , betcha did not see one coming, suckers! '. Yeah, there was continuous error on (especially Rochon's finest patient ever changing), but for an indie slasher it's not that bad. I was very sure at the start it was just a clear sketch of the girls to go topless, but that was just a gadget. The dialogue was too painful and painful at times. <br /> <br /> Just do not have great hope going into this, and it will not be bad. And Lloyd Kaufman's camera is pretty understated.
