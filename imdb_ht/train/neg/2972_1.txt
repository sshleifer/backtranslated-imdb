My teacher recorded this and showed it in Child Care to show how pregnancy pregnancy affects people. She just demonstrates how pregnancy pregnancy affects a child's jock not well educated about how to work sex with a whiny, unloved girl who throws fruit when angry and could not say she was with the wrong man though she was put a sign saying it was like. I would not be surprised if the father of the baby had eight girlfriends in the first edition of the script. The Stacy (carrier) is a riot. It is subconscious to her daughter's reality over the age of four and is seemingly uncheck when people spy on her in her dining room window. Bobby's (father) name best friend is Dewey, and it is an obvious rip off of Sean Penn's character at Fast Times in Ridgemont high. This movie is simple, simply because none of the characters are credible. Thanks to it's only good for TV, limiting the public's chances to watch it.
