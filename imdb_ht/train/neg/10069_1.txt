This is a terrible movie. Yes the girls are beautiful but not very good. The plot has a cowboy involved in an Indian girl would be interesting if the gender did not get by the way. Well, okay it might be interesting, but not it, because it's very seriously rhythmic and only partly acting. I can only imagine what the close ups of the dancing tush looks like on a big screen, probably more ridiculous then done on TV. (I will not even mention the topless knife fight between two women who are tied together and spending everything in the chest chest. Never read about that in the ancient west) This is a movie that requires the liberal use of fast forward . /> <br /> I love sling but this ridiculous movie. There is a reason I do not go for this sort of movie and that they tend not very well, the plot takes a back seat to breastfeeding. The Nidie cuties are originally called being original nudist films or films where there was no touch but as the adult industry began to grow the movie makers either tried to be smart or tried to exploit something else in order to put Butts in the chair. These smart people were very few who only left the hacks of limited talent. Comedies have often come up with the humor of approaching first-class, infantile but harmless fun. Something that would rarely be said about any other genre cross dressed like a nudie. The Ramrodder looks good and has a couple of nice pieces but it's done by being neither western nor sex movie. > <br /> I need not look that again. <br /> <br /> In interest probably not one, the violent and killer of the movie played by Bobby Beausoleil, a member of the Manson family who was arrested for killing a school teacher shortly after filming wrap. Obviously these sort of things will ruin some people living.
