These reviews claim that this movie is so bad it will be extra way with that one. This film does not have the wrongful guilt of guilt that Leonard Part 6, Battlefield Earth and Gigli had. Those cinemas were amusing in the terrible but this pile of dinosaur dinosaurs is so badly painful. I was not in this pain very much watching a bad movie since I watched Baby Geniuses and Superbabies. Before I start the review let me tell you the story. Theodore Rex is a $ 35 million New Cinema bust in line refused to put into theater. The cuts are sent straight to the video making it the most expensive movie-to-video movie in decades. Whoopi caved in to be in this disaster after a great check. <br /> <br /> Draws a millionaire dinosaur clones to launch missiles in the sun that would kill humanity and start another ice age. A cop named Katie Coltrane and a idiotic dinosaur called Theodore Rex reluctance team to stop him after the death of a Buddy dinosaur. <br /> <br /> The draw is given to you from the beginning of the movie that stole the movie all its mysteries. Then you have to deal with the fact that this movie is actually terrible terrible. Whoopi seems tense and tries to wield his or her performance but no avail. Theodore Rex is flattened annoyingly with bumbling behavior and puts minus after five minutes on screen. Most of the jokes revolve around him threatening to bite people and hit those who have it (on injury and on purpose). I thought that Burglar was bad but it took a backseat Theodore Rex: the worst movie in Whoopi's career. <br /> <br /> Do not let anyone tell you that this monstrosity is bad enough to be enjoyable. I did not see that when I watched this movie. All I saw was a train crash that was written by people who had to have some sick admiration for the movie Howard Duck. The humor is on this level and Theodore Rex looks like the Embassy cousin of Barney. Outwardly painful from beginning to end.
