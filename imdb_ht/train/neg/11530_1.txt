In the past 10 years, I have worked in 3 independent independent fighting organizations, managing many Pro Writers (including 2 stars Wright stars), who have worked on two different TV shows and voice-overs and books for DVD many DVDs. I have never witnessed the level of amateurs, talent and skill, and quality production found in Splatter Rampage Wrestling. Even this list as a literal video of any kind is a misuse of the theme. Shot with low-dollar video camera, it's essentially home-to-play video play-fighting in yard rear. The sound quality is bad, the video quality is bad, and the act is horrendous. The "Wrestlers" wear fascinating costumes with hand-drawn tee shirts and ski masks and hits each other with a variety of items and half imitate battle movements. Sometimes the "matches" are on the grass. Sometimes on a backyard trampoline back. ALL of them have acted and executed with a cynical lack of any battle skill. In short, do not bother with this stinker. If your interest in this DVD is amusement or academic (both in my case), you will be terribly disappointed.
