Friday the 13th stage on! There is officially a movie worse than the series of lovers out there. I won this film in a college contest, and it was a waste of money even though it was free. Jack Jones star as a really terrible singer who has tried to find some murderer or something. At least Friday thirtieth never bored me. I'd rather have my nail pull than to see it again.
