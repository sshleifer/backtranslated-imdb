Given that this film was put together in less than a year could explain its customs (81 minutes - including end credit, thus approximately 76 minutes of current film). But what can not be explained is the lack of humor that the movie previously owned. <br /> The gags are quick and sometimes not even funny. Only true comic parties are the quick parody of the Nike basketball spots, James Woods' paintings of Max Van Sydow's character of the exorcist, and bits and pieces scattered throughout the movie. Very unfunny took to Charlie's Angel, who likes the first pair of scary and the Matrix dress cut scene, basically recreating the scene without much humor in his shot. <br /> <br /> Young today might not be able to relate to the parody gags in the supernatural classic films of the 70 as the exorcist and maybe in the 80's poltergeist, et. See More Than Movie 3 will take some time to put together, making the spoofs more enjoyable. One thing though, the movie features more than one of the latest promises of young actress Anna Faris (who I'm going to admit seemed exceptionally hot at the end). Just for filing it with the ability to act, I give this movie a "3" from "10".
