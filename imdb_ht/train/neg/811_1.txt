The original was a good movie. I bought it on tape and watched it several times. But if I know that the sequels are not usually as good as the original I certainly did not expect such a bomb. The Romans were flat, the eyes are old, the humor speak just was not. This could not have been the worst film I've ever seen but it comes close.
