I saw this movie the first time in about 12 hours on a Saturday evening. It really is the perfect time for this one. I never saw ALL a movie that was actually more predictable and soaked with stereotypes. If you want to see a thrilling action movie, do not watch it because you might lose the desire to live half. However, if you want a good laugh, please watch it! I even bought the Chuck Norris 3DVD collection thanks to my enjoyable night Saturday. What's especially striking me is that outline scenes that might be expensive to have been duplicated from a discovery documentation or an old TV-special on the US Army. In addition I was amazed by the fact that they did not put the slightest effort into making real-world production. Afghanistan is, as far as I can remember, nowhere near any sea and yet with one click Deke saved from the saber-castle terrorist and its packet jet and is captured by a submarine (probably discovery). Later in the movie, Deke launches a terrorist Islam against the wall. At the slow motion scene you can very well see the long hairs in the Korean stunt boxer in the air when breaking against the wall. Love love it. I recommend you watch it with some friends and a good amount of beer though, only then you will understand why I was crazy enough to spend the Â£ 6.99 on the box.
