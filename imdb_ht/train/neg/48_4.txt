Some nice shots in this movie, it catches some of the landscapes with such a beautiful light, in fact the cinematography is probably its best advantage. But it is basically more of a made for TV movie, and although it has a lot of twists and turns into the draw, which holds it quite interesting look, no subtitles and key development developments have been revealed in Spanish, so Spanish speakers will leave a little lost. <br /> <I have been as a gift to Xmas, as it is a very family of work in the films of an actor we get talented, and Matthew Mconaughey was just scared of "A Time to Kill", and "Newton Little men "so I expressed my wish to see more of his work. However although it says on the DVD box it's a Mconaughey Matthew movie and uses this as a marketing plot, it has a few lines and is on screen for not very minute at the end of the movie, it is basically an extra and not exactly light up the screen while it is over, so dead hard fans, re ally not worth it from that point of view. <br /> <br /> The movie star though, Patrick McGaw is great though and very easy on the eye, and her character is just so beautiful and kind and caring, a true saint to a guy, should be well written in a com com. <br /> So, for true Mcconaughey acting shine at what I saw, I would recommend, "A Time to Kill", "Newton Boys" "Frailty", "How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days "," Edtv "and" Amistad "and avoid too" Bigger than Life "and" Angels of the Outfield "unless you feel like a movie child or have kids around like that of them is indicative of his talent , but the movie movie movie for kids, again MM is really nothing more than an artist supporting and just a few if any line. <br /> As for Scorpion Springit's not a bad movie but it's also not scary screen either.
