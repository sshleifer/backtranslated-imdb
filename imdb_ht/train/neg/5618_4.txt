I'm currently amazed at how good this anti-Christian pseudo-documentary was received. Now I respect the opinion of the guy and faith, I am not, in this state, believers in the doctrine of teaching Christians. However, anti-Christian propaganda is a bit of a different problem. <br /> <br /> This movie has valuable points, but very few and represented in a very pertinent context. I do not recommend seeing it. In fact, I think everyone should see it and decide on their own if they believe it or not. And this is actually more of a chance than one of the director of Christian teaching. Rather than an approach to questioning about the subject, it looks like a personal vendetta on the Christian school that affects his childhood. It also misrepresents Christians most of the times as either naive or fundamentalist either, there is no moderation in between. The director uses movie scenes from Christ's Passion without permission, sets an interview with the director of his former school and presents almost exclusively anti-Christian historians and writers. I actually found the director to be the most down-to-earth and thought that his attitude was completely justified. I also strongly doubt that any of the Christian Christians interviewed were consulted after or even said before the interview for the purpose of the investigation. <br /> <br /> With this being said, there are certainly new and interesting facts to be found here with some very original thoughts about the question of Christianity. But the way in which this whole thought is product is often offensive, very unfriendly and dreadfully biased.
