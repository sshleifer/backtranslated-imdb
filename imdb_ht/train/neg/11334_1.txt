Here again another dishonest European story where they explode the religion of their country. (These atrocities are relentless.) Here we see a brutal explosion in the Catholic and / or Catholic Church (and not Catholic). This was actually won an Academy Award for film films. This is probably because the story made catholic and religious beliefs in general look very weak. One of the main characters is a priest and cares for more food than anything else. He was described as nothing but a fool. No wonder the Academy of Religious liked this movie. <br /> Also, some people deceive people who play a guy who renounces his religion so he can marry one of the four daughters playing in the story. The daughters took turns smashing the student's "seminar" (stating he studied for six years, but said he was an agnostic!). I mean, how blasphemy is this movie ?? !!! <br /> This is a shame and another excellent example of prejudice in the progressive exclusion of the film business, worldwide (not just Hollywood).
