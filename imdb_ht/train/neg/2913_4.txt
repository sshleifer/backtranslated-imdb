It is of course very nice to see improvements on the Turkish film industry, however, I would expect the most creative thing in Togan Gokbakar. Starting in the script, which I believe it was not a single wisdom as some might think. especially the dialogue cheese, which puts the audience in a position, as if they were not smart enough to understand the situations, which, most of the times make the movie unbearable. It also has an obvious end; you can easily guess the murderer in the beginning. The weakest part of the scenario is that it is impossible to patient patients with mental illness to act as normal, as professionals right away !!! have never been researched for the possibility of patients on heavy medical, they act as professionals and use all medical terms that even normal people can not use ????? !!!!!! Also at the scene where employees were looking for the most dangerous patients, and out any weapon to protect themselves was another weird point in the movie. and this scene was so suitable for the title "Dikkat Sahan Cikabilir" !! These are not just the weak parts of the movie. There was also a lot of preciosities in the movie. The most dangerous deposition of patients was an exact copy from Hannibal, also the appearance of Togan at the very end is obviously the worst mistake that he could do in his first film! The melo over the scope of the movie and the interviews that the actor gave just make people to be curious and forced to see it. There is a total deception. I would wonder, if Sahan was not this famous, would Togan be able to shoot this movie, and this much in the budget amount ?? I hope that Togan would realize that it is not fashionable to play in a role as a director as he said in an interview. Hitchcock has been doing it wisely and Shyamalan night to continue it successfully! it should be aware of the fact that it is not Hitchcock nor Shyamalan again !!!! hoping to be more careful and creative next time in this great industry!
