Currently, this film is listed on IMDb as the 42nd worst movie ever made - which is exactly why I rent it from NetFlix. However, I'm sad to report that the movie, while bad, has no place near bad enough to deserve being in the 100 movies under ever. I personally saw at least 100 films worse than this one. Slowly a glowing endoscope, but it just did not meet the expected level of terrible to be included on this infamous list. The movie begins with Stewart Moss and Marianne McAndrew on their honeymoon (by the way they are married in real life as well). It is a physician who is obsessed with sticks and insists they go to a nearby cave. Once there, they behave very, very, very stupid (features of a bad movie), and are soon bitten by a stick. According to this film, sticks love to attack people and have vampires in the U.S. - both of them are not true at all. <br /> <br /> Strange, after biting, this man does not even bother to go to the hospital !! The first thing about someone's head (especially a doctor) is to get medical help immediately, but not this boob. Soon, she had a crisis - yet she still is not interested in seeking help! Again and again you keep thinking that this must be the stupid couple of movie history !! <br /> <br /> After a while, she eventually went to see a doctor and sent the hospital. But not then it's too late and his attack becomes more violent and begins to kill their blood suckers. When it's totally evident to everyone that the man is a crazy killing machine, the wife (who, like her husband, has a grapefruit for a brain) refuses to believe it is dangerous - even after he attacks people, steals an ambulance and runs a police car on the road !! <br /> <br /> Now most of Moss's time passes through these episodes, her eyes roll back and it looks like a normal person. Strangely, however, once his couple developed but beats-like and in the end they used some pretty prosthetics about it to make him look-like. If this was really cheesy, the movie would deserve a 1. <br /> At the very end, in a twist that hardly made any sense at all, the inexplicable wife turned into a crazy lady crazy and had a swarm of bat Kill the sheriff evil. How all was arranged was a mystery like Moss' and McAndrew's belief that this film would somehow help their careers - even though they both had reasonable careers on television playing roles since 1974. <br /> <br /> In general, very dumb. The plot is funny and it makes no sense and strongly depends on those who act way too dumb to be real. Not a good movie at all, but not among the worst films of all time either. <br /> <br /> NOTE: For some reason, the IMDb displays the graphic for the three series of DVDs for its ALIVE and its in two suites web pages for the person. While the BAT PERSON saw and the title "He lives", the two cinemas are not at all related. It's easy to understand the mistake - especially since they both came from 1974, but the movie I just reviewed Starred Stewart Moss and Marianne McAndrew and the other film starred John Ryan and Sharon Farrell.
