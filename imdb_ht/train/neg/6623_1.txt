First of all sorry to give even a rating of 1 movie (nothing less than this is available). The movie failed in every department to read scenario, direction, characterization or acting. <br /> <br /> 1) To begin with, the name of the film is really C grade (though the movie itself matches up to the name). 2) Amitabh Bachchan is trying his best to live up to the character but the weak script coupled with pathetic direction to finish up making him a funny character. 3) In Sholay Gabbar Singh has won 50,000 rewards (convinced). Here at Aag's face was 100 crores for Babban (Amitabh Bachchan but poor man was beaten by our hero named and there were only a few bicycle people (with all automatic weapons). Make a Sholay like the movie setup movie Mumbai in modern times does not look convincing. 4) As for Nisha Kothari, someone needs to tell her that he does not know act. Why Ram Gopal Verma sent him again and again? 5) Mohanlal was good but hardly anything to do. 6) Sushant Singh and Rajpal Yadav who have great actors are wasting the movie. 7) The Legionary role played by Lila Misra (Mausi in Basanti) in Sholay replaced the cheapest of this film by some Gangu movement. Ramu please grow and understand that there is need to be some intelligence in your movie. Enough of the stupid character of your movie like Shiva and Aag. 8) Should not say anything about modern Jai and Veeru .. pathetic at greater limits. <br /> <br /> For summary, I was shocked to see this movie because it looks like a cheap and funny translation of the original classic. Please do not waste money and time on this movie. I think watching Aap Ka Surror (which I thought was the worst movie possible) would be a better idea than to see this awful pack of stupid characters, bad songs and miserable directions. <br /> Thanks, Saurabh
