I already know that criticisms and some hearers say it was a satire, there were many political and social messages, names are referenced with some other names etc. It might be. I can not achieve these things (I do not want to do anyway) because I'm not interested in, I'm interested in 'movies'. As for the movie itself, again he says that the movie is smart and dramatically powerful. I could not see anything that we did not see in the movie cinema except the scene that took place at an office in the second half. Yes, the scenes say somethings about humanity, but it does not make the film glossy. The movie is fun (mildly) and exciting in some moments or scenes, but no more than that. As for the biggest flaw in the movie, it is visual effects. It was just shocking, I could not pull myself together for a while, because I was expecting a real monster, because it is not one of the old Gojira movies, he did in 2006, but he did not '. It's as if you do not believe that there is a monster, you can not care about. If you agree with me on this, I highly recommend your Cloverfield which is very realistic. The design of the monster is not interesting, but at least planned, there is an effort. Dramatically powerful criticism. Some critics talk about it as if it's a Kurosawa movie. Yes, it is rather a drama than a thriller or action, but it should not mean that it is dramatically powerful. I do not want to compare the army with other monster movies, but I try to say that the army does not do something other monster movie does. By the way, maybe some people call the movie's chief because of their sympathy for Asian movies. Yes, I love Asian movies too, but this is the fact.
