First, I must admit that both of my films have seen this director I've seen without the titles and that may have missed the points. My Czech is not bad but she sat in two of her films, I wish I did not even try to learn. Samotari is too cool. Way too cool. It's about ten different story lines that are tied in and out together. Not so deeply strange in a city the size of Prague (small, really.) The main characters are between 20 and 30. They had to work with one science. The best character is the Balkan girl. Its sentiments are echoed by immigrants here everyday modes. That's about it. The only great character. Everyone else makes their own life well on their own. How can I sympathize with this obvious incompetence? Maybe there are interesting bits with Japanese tourists but I need another movie stereotype? If you like music well, watch this movie. If you want to laugh at other people, watch this movie. If you love irony and humor, see an original Jarmusch by an imitation. And under the circumstances see the Ondricek film, Septej (Whisper.) This is unless you enjoy steroids.
