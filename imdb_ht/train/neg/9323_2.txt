What have I been looking for? I spent 90 minutes in my precious life watching one of the dumbest movies I've ever seen. The concept of a serial killer sort is actually afraid to see many people scared monkeys .... but it has a nourish apple 300 pounds recess killer sort make a mockery of the genre. I'm always wondering how the character brand could not run away the sort ... It's 300 pounds, she had to get tired eventually. The whole end made me up and literally said, "What did I just look like?" Apparently Brandon is Denise's cousin ... and having her on the middle of the movie meant she had sex with her cousin ..... yes that's something she wants to see * shudders *. <br /> <br / Another thing I found hilariously stupid was the opening scene where the clown stitched a woman and said "What do you do?" Well, right, what do you think he just did? The last thing that was stupid to comic was the second main character was tapping the hitch-hitch and calling it ac * nt and then 5 minutes later saying violence does not help anything .... made the writer in the script gives the line to the wrong guy? None of this movie makes sense anyway. The film was more or less a low-dumb pornography I was sucked in to buy (all 3.99) and got no entertainment out of it besides the sex scenes. I'm surprised the clown fat did not get into the orgy, would have fit right in. I was expecting the movie would have some entertainment value as other B movies might have, but I was wrong. This is a waste of waste that does not even look good. <br /> <br /> 1 out of 10
