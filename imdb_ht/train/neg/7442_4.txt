Sorry this movie did not scare me it just annoyed me. It was just so frustrated when I saw the potential and that, all that, fell by the way. Children! Daddy! The Premonition! There were so many potential and numbers! zero, nada! I heard it all before. Scary! No! I can scare myself, here where I sit, than they could in the movie. Are people writing that face that women should be so annoying? Huh? This film was quite atmospheric. Or at least he could, the director / writer was bothered to work. We might have some good music that would add to the tension as well as someone who made the effort. What do I really want to know is why they get the money? Just give it me and save all the hassle. Abandone? ... Our name is betrayed
