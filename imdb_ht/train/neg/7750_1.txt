This movie was the worst movie ever made on the planet, I love BARNEY more than this movie. The graphics cigar, half the animated film, death suck, and over all, I was ready to sue the people who made this movie! PLEASE DO NOT CAN LIVE in your life to watch this movie. The only good part was when the movie ******* ended! This film is 50 percent Jurassic park, .1 percent Sabretooth, and 49.9 percent DUMB! Please do not waste your time watching this movie, you'll regret it. You want to know why this movie is absorbed? Well, the cover sucked, the graphics sucked, the bloody look (I mean is) tomato sauce, people have tried to blow themselves up, college students think that all that and can stand in front of the animal. I mean, there was a 5 ft tiger running straight into a woman, and throwing a spear into it from 100 feet away! HAPPY DAY YOU CAN OUCE ALL IT! The act was also terrible. Jurrasic Park is actually a good movie, and this just went and ruined it.
