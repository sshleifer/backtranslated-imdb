I can not fully understand this hype. OK, if you like Splatter cheap, you will love this movie, but if you love good stories and good actors - do not watch this. Personally I really neem the actors in this movie, they seem to be hired straight from the street. The dialogues are completely flat and you still know what's next. The overall quality of this film lacking in the budget is supposed to be very low. When we saw this movie (me and 3 others) we all had in mind that this film was made by some people who needed to do this, just to get their graduation to a movie school - with effort the lowest. Another problem that really reduces the entire experience is the bad cat (very quake) and the bad sound, the whole movie seems to be ruining with a single microphone.
