If you are under age 6 or 7, then you will really enjoy this movie. My youngest daughter is stuck on the television when she watches her. As an adult, I can not stand it !! I'm all up to the end .... when they have a decent storyline. But this is nowhere near to standard. Please forgive me for slating what is after a kid's movie, but when you have to sit in it almost every day when your kids love it very much, you'll understand why. My daughter would watch this movie over and over again on the same day if we left it. <br /> I gave this movie 4 out of 10 purely for the fact that it keeps my youngest entertained.
