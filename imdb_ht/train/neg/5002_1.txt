How did such a terrible script manage to attract this cast? Ridiculous, predictable and quite incredible, this is well-acting and slickly directed, but the material is so bad it still qualifies as one of the worst ever stairs I've seen over the years. Amazingly bad, and not in a fun way. Avoid all costs, even if you are a fan of someone at the disposal.
