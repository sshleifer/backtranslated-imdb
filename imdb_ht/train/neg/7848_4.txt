This movie was just plain mute I do not think it was scary at all I went to hoping to be shocked and scared but mostly laughing some of the scenes were just fake and dropping along the scene without being incredibly cg and some In the mutants they were ridiculously gay looking she also sucked because the act was just plain terrible u thought they could get some good actors and most of the characters I hated just because how stupid and lame they act though was supposed to be in the military i get to watch movies for free and see many people walking out im imitation because it was so mute jana glad i did not have to pay for it in ass ass fuck movie but then again that's my opinion
