Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy had extensive film career before they were eventually associated. For many of Pre-Stan films, she has billed companies on screen as Babe Hardy ... and in her adult life, Hardy was known to her friends as 'babe'. While pursuing postwar Britain and Laurel in a musical-hall act for Bernard Delfont, Hardy gave an interview to John McCabe's journalist in which he explained the origin of this nickname: Earlier in his career acting, Hardy got a cut Hair in a hairdresser's massage that rushes Hardy's Chebergon movie (these on her face), she says' Nice baby! 'Hardy's worker started crying her babe', and the nickname was stuck. Although many of Hardy's pre-Laurel works are very interesting - notably his comedy role in support of Larry Semon and Imitation of Billy West's Chaplin - his team and Billy Ruge (who) are in a series of low-budget shorts for the Vim Comedy Film Company is very stressful indeed. Hardy and Ruge were named Plump and Runt screens: The names that are unpleasant to their own right, but they did worse because Ruge (although shorter than hardy) is not specifically a runtime. Look here, Hardy looks very much like he does in his movie early Hal Roach and Laurel ... but without the spell curls and fastfast little whiskers. <br /> <br /> 'A too many', an absolutely typical plump and seasonal amount, is unfunny direct ... and it is hardly made even more evident by the fact that this film has exactly the same same As 'This Wife', one of Laurel and Hardy's most hilarious films. Plump (Hardy) is the star boarder in a room-house run by a gawky tall land. Runt (Ruge) is porter la. Plump receives a letter from his rich John, whose dosh is expected to inherit. His uncle came to see him and went to meet Plump's wife and baby. There's only one problem: Plump had no wife and baby. He lay down his uncle in order to resemble a family man. Now, of course, Plump expects Kunt to get him a wife and baby on short notice. Of course, results are disaster. It would be good if these disastrous results were funny, but not. Most of the unfunny humor here is just empty slapstick, and characters resolve the arguments by pushing one another into the basin. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />! from frame. This would be funny if done on purpose, but it's simply stupid. At one point in this bad comedy, a very deadly gag is displayed on the horizon as Runt approaches a dark wash. 'Surely they would not lower low for a laugh,' I thought. But they do. Runt steals the baby's black baby and tries to fob this as a Plump family. Somehow, Plump bought a baby's bed, but she still had no baby. With John Upcoming Stairs, Plump recognizes Runt for babyhood. This gavel could just possibly work with a midget, or even with a really runt-sized actor such as Chester Conklin, but Billy Ruge is only slightly below the average height. Ruge's imagination of a baby is neither credible nor comical, and John's uncle should have a full scour for her. Amazing, it does! <br /> The most remarkable aspect of 'One Too Many' is a short appearance - apparently his only-ever appearance - by Oliver Hardy's first wife, Madelyn Saloshin. The wedding was not happy, despite Hardy's hardship difficulties never reached the epic proportions of the Stan Laurel. <br /> Only one thing in this movie impresses me. There is a very short flashback sequence, and Hardy reminiscing on his seaside romance with a bathing bath. In 1916, there was still no longer a standard movie grammar for transmitting layoffs: the one shown here was gracefully and simply. Too bad this movie has no other base. 'An excessive' is definitely a movie too much on Oliver Hardy's CV, and I'll rate this movie just a point out of 10. Laurel and Hardy together are definitely much funnier than one of them separately.
