Oh God, I had to see this when I was only 11 or twelve, (no wonder how) I could have been young, but I was not stupid. Anyone could see that this is a bad movie, embarrassing, gross, uncertain and very funny. I saw the more impressive effects of Disneyland, I saw better performance in a school play, and I saw more convincing crocodiles in the zoo, where they do nothing but sit in the water, ignoring children tapping on ice la. <br /> The story is set in northern Australia. A handful of young people ambitious, trying out a new water sport, surfing in full water sharks. It soon becomes clear that something more dangerous is in the water. After learning this, they get help in a grizzly middle-aged fisherman, who wants to kill the animal to avenge the food of his family. <br /> I think I saw every crocodile film made in the last fifteen years, the best of which is Lake Placid, and the worst of which is its end. San Surf should make the second biggest biggest cops I think, and Primeval and crocodile tailing backwards. The Australian Saltwater Crododile is one of the most dangerous animals out there, causing more than one hundred injuries or deaths each year. Movies such as surfing surfaces however ruin not only the wild image that is like an animal, but a good hour and a half of the viewer's life. Unless you really want to see it, avoid surfing.
