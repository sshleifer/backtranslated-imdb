Just imagine the real Hitler, who was a master of propaganda and speech, would have been such a mumbling moron as Carlyle described him in this movie. <br /> <br /> No one would follow it, not even a desperate, unemployed guy in the 1920s. <br /> This is just a Hollywood box of propaganda itself, disguised as "true story". <br /> I have mercy on everyone who actually believes in this show. Carlyle and the producers did not find anything right with that. <br /> <br /> Why Hitler could have many people, a whole count for his idea if we were like a sausage? Why do people follow him to death? Do not show him such a deficit to make their own movie totally incredible. This film is a mixture of WW2 propaganda and MTV propaganda town on one of the most important people in the last century. Imagine a movie about Churchill where the director only shows him as a drunkard for 90 min. <br /> <br /> This movie is a shame and I wonder how they could talk to an actor like Carlyle in this drak.
