"Children of Dreams" in 1989 is the fifth film of the series (generally overrated), "nightmare", and at the latest from this point on, the series has become total garbage. The good films of the series are the original 1984 Wes Craven, and the third part, the "Dream Warriors" in 1987. The second part was disappointing and boring, and was the fourth part of Freddy Krueger's old frustration begin to annoy and joke constant idiotic. This fifth entry in the series has hardly anything to recommend except for (admittedly great) visuals, and a creepy scene, a flashback sequence how Freddy Krueger came in existence. The rest of the film consists mostly of our razor-clawed maniac-turn-jokest crying stupid one-material, with the old formula of a bunch of youth Jackass, which desperately try to avoid falling asleep, because Good old Freddy awaits them in their dreams. Lisa Wilcox is back in the role of Alice Johnson, with a bunch of refreshing crap, as a super-dumb rum 'rim has been added for any other reason than some sort of justification to make this stuff unnecessary and boring. In Short: No originality, just a decline in the old formula, and an over-load joke pleases annoying. I (generate) rating of 3/10 is due to the great visuals, and especially emphasize the difference to the next terrible end, "Freddy's Dead", which is terrible beyond belief. In case you are not a Freddy Krueger Hardcore enthusiast, "Children of Dreams" should be avoided, and even if you are, this is more than likely to disappoint.
