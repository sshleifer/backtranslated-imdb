I was interested in seeing this movie because I knew she was Christian based. The director had a good idea / intention when he made this movie but he could be better. I can understand why someone would still have feelings for whom they believe is the greatest love in their lives. However, I did not understand why the director made his friends so sensitive, mean and rude. The main character stopped exposing his friends when they were what they meant. They did not understand at all and were used by God as a reason to explain their behavior. The main character, or anyone else did not know if the ex-girlfriend was divorced, still married, but was against her to solve old feelings that need to be done with them. Her friends thought to be Christian and should have been described as being supported if they agreed with her decision or not. So many times we do things in life where we do not apologize what we have done wrong in the past and when trying to do everything they have against. The ironic part of her new girlfriend girl has accused her of having to follow behaviors for simply looking up an old friend, when she did something really odd to get a hold of her name, address and phone number. it seemed to be the stalker !. he did not seem like a friend at all but he just looked out for himself. God is love ... and I think God wants people to be and people they are meant to be with and I feel the movie made a terrible injustice by making it seem like God does not care about true love ... just that you stay with someone you've made a bad choice with. We all make mistakes ... it's all about what steps you take to make compensation. As I said the movie was potential but I was tired of pointing to one-sided view of being repeatedly and blocking down the viewers' gates and not being called ... well-meaning friends. This film did not hold true Christian beliefs in love, but I gave it a C for its efforts.
