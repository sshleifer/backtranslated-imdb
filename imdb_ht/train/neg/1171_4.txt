I can hardly believe that this latent, turgid and many movie scenes are not a cinematographer whose other work I enjoyed quite well. Experience in enduring the LADY and the DUKE (and no other words but "endure" will do), leaving me in an unusual attitude, a relief condition only when reading the IMDb user by ali-112. For not only was Rohmer tried (and success) to see the world of the genre art in the 18th century France but, as ali has pointed out, has shown (the cost of alienating his audience) effects of both the awareness class and the revolution he inspired in the eyes of an elite elite woman at his time. The director accomplished something endlessly difficult, but I wondered whether he was worth the effort it took to do that - or to look at the dull results in his work.
