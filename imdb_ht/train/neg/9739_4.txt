It's not so much that COMBUSTION has little potential. Indeed the under-exploration phenomenon is quite intriguing and, for at least half of the opening, this Tobe Hooper effort promises to entertain in a way only cheese '90s horror can be. But somewhere between Brad Dourif's over-again-off-again performance and the overly complex scheme, this would be thrilling to lose its way. <br /> <br /> Slip, featured here before the build-in Thunder thunderbolt has accumulated, is average guy Sam. Of course, the average men do not stay on average for long in horror movies, so after a well-deserved description, we see various parts of Sam's start fire. Soon he stacked others, too, very much in the constellation of Gallows Lisa, playing unmemorably by Cynthia Bain. While the title of the movie implies a fire-happy monster on loose, director Hooper Opte makes Sam a killer want. This approach gives the film an added amount it would otherwise miss, but it also prevents us from really scared the flamethrower people. We are wondering whether this might work better as a straight-up effort-against all NIGHTMARE efforts on ELM STREET. <br /> <br /> <br /> CONNECTIONS is a very nominal effort when all is said and done. It will bring added calls to the Passionate fans and those who can not get enough 1990s horror, be it good, bad or in between, but only in a slow night.
