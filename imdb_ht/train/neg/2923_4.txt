The plot was very interesting, and the background of Russian revolution. I also like to see Budapest as the movie was partly filmed. Unfortunately, there was zero chemistry between the two main characters so it was hard to believe the love story between them. The love scenes are forced and mechanical. Jordan kirckland was really stiff, almost ice. Rob Stewart was good and youthful, so he looked like his older sister rather than his girlfriend. The finish, when we finally know who was actually after them, was quite weak and made no sense too. I think I would like this movie much better if the relationship between the two actors was a little more credible.
