With this ABC's attempt to block the blockbuster "cheaper by the dozen" comes an obnoxious amount of ragged dialogue, line draws, and horse trading. With about two good actors among the many wanna, this movie was a big disappointment. It's a wannabe Hollywood in a already bad plot. Then, because they need a lot of actors, it means they would probably be more louder. So the act was not five-star. The draw moved fairly quickly, and the twists were bad and horrific distribution. The connection to character and the "end relations" were also too mushy and clear to me. Spend yourself and rent something better.
