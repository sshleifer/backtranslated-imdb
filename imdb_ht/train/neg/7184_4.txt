This was not really a very good movie. There were so many things that are implausible and predictable that happened during the film course ... but I think most of the reviews are missing points why this movie should be enjoyed by a wide audience. This photo was produced by JOHNSON MAGIC! Is not it enough to inspire us all to check out this movie? A movie produced by an ancient NBA star does not come together every day, you know. Pretty stupid children in a large house are getting slaughtered by a touched psychic ax. Each glove is treated out of bed. Teen sex. And it was all produced by MAGIC JOHNSON! I can not say enough about this movie! Teen Drugs Used! College hijinx! And it was all produced by MAGIC JOHNSON! Yippeeee!
