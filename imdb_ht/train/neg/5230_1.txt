Although Robert "Knox" Benfer has his fans, I'm not one of them. Its films are asinine and amateur, and with just not very funny, unless you are a 14 year old and an undocumented sense of humor. <br /> It is certainly not famous, as it immature fans would like you to believe, do not bother people in Wikipedia, or stuffing the assessment ratings here in the IMDb. It has certainly not been profiled by any major media outlets, speaking merchants about it and his "fame creation". <br /> <br /> Benfer has some slight skill in limited animation, but he needs to get away from his young Psychopath and learn to write some current funny material before it will be taken seriously as a real artist. As of this time, though, it is just a kid with a camera, and it shows.
