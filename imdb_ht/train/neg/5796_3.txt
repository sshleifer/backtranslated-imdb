I saw this feature as part of the Asian American Film Festival in New York and was feared by the graphic, sado-masochistic, child pornography that I witnessed. The storyline hidden under way too many graphical sex scenes - and, no one at least in the least erotic - sick is the more feeling. The director seemed to go for shock values ​​rather than exploring the various levels of why these characters are like this. See if you can bake it - I still have flashbacks.
