Even though I would hear that "Cama de cakes" was the worst Brazilian film of the decade, I looked at it giving it a chance; After all, first-time director / producer / writer Alexandre Stockler managed to make his first feature (shotgun in video) for just US $ 4,000 and - even though it looks even cheaper - I can not start to imagine all he's going to finally find It exposes the theater with no great sponsors or production companies behind it (then as I watch it I realize why). But regardless of your chances of getting "Cama de cakes", they shrink to zero in 10 minutes: it is an unforeseen, verbal, ideologically and technically catastrophic attempt to show Brazilian middle-class youth as a bunch of spoils Neo-Nazi stuck on bad sex, drugs and violence (and are doing look like gossip gays too), making no visible traits of talent, imagination, expertise or notion of structure. Visually and aurally, he recalls the worst amateur thing you can find on YouTube - only here it suggests that the countiem of minute is relentless and clumsiness, and it's not even funny-bad. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> We all have seen the previous story: The bored guys want to have fun, go out, take drugs and everything goes wrong - there's gang-rape, spanking, murdering, falls down the stairs !!) to the mother of one of the boys, culminating with the boys are deciding to burn the corpses of the girl and the mother in a waste landfill. Moral and literal waste, find it? This movie is influenced by Larry Clark (especially "Kids" and "Bully"), but Clark's movie - though also moralist and sexploitable - are high-grade masters compared to this crap. Do not think there has ever been such a monomaniacal drive in a woody cinema to go down to the public throat: Stockler grabs us not the necklace and tries to force her morals to stop her in our brain by repetition and fatigue - you get dumb- minded and much babbling, screaming, inept direction, unstable camera and awful act to go on. Stockler does not care little about techniques (quality of images, framing, sound recording, sonic songs, dialogues, sets, editing, etc. are unmatched uniforms), but it's a narcissistic control freak: it anticipates the critics read The tides get in adding subtitles and smartie / cutie comments, and do not make the protagonists comment to a point how far-faced and licking it all is (I might have to deal with that). Despite its megalomaniac ambitions, Stockler seems incapable of giving us a minimum of visual or narrative structure - it can not even decide whether it wants realistic fear (but has kept video cameras etc.) or stylization (repetition in scene, use of alternate capture, etc.). Unfortunately, he can not even decide where to put his camera (there's use of subjective cameras for the three drive)! The water features some of the most stupefyingly bans allergies ever; The scheme exists simply to justify the profound hatred of the director for his character and those standing for. All you see is a movieist being lovers, preach, condemned, moralized without the benefit of a minimum of talent (or techniques) going with it. <br /> It's very disappointing to get Caio Blat in this mess. Certainly one of the most promising young films in Brazil, with her puppy sleeping dogs looks like emotional corner that often remembers the Mineo Room, Blat can be very effective in the right direction (as in "Carandiru", "Lavoura Arcaica" "Proibir Proibir"). Here, he told them to go over the head and he had to play with some of the most embarrassingly actors under the auspices of "memory actors." He also entered the risky scene of sexually transmitted graphics (so the drugs look rather like porn webcam) The film opens and ends with real interviews with "typical" (?) Middle-aged teens - Stockler wants us to take these interviews as "proof" in what he tries to preach in fiction. The pleasure of his interview, choosing a record of abuse, racism, sexism, stupid statements (showing only assholes exist everywhere.) Stockler wants to prove that young Brazilian middle-class boys are ALL present or future fascists middle class and enjoy recreational drugs (does he tell all the neo-fascists about drugs? Or drugs to potentially fascist my behavior? 's not telling). <br /> With dogmatic self-righteousness, headache-induced techniques and mind-bending boredom, "Cama of Cake" is bad for a reason that 1,000 men, above all , it's dangerous in a very insidious way: it gives opponents in Brazilian cinema a powerful case of argument. "Cama of Cake" is best thanks, unmentioned, buried and forgotten.
