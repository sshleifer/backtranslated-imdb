I went to see D-war on a whim and with very low expectations. The movie failed to meet them. <br /> I do not mind history that stretches credulity - remembering Reign of Fire? - but I hope to be internally consistent. This movie scrambled out of diaper skimmer without standing for breath, all interspersed with special effects that lagged far behind the likes of LOTR or even Godzilla. <br /> <br /> A shapes-shifting mystic warrior in Korea, thrilling metamorphose into an antique antique dealer and popping up like ancient machinas deus to get the hacky protagonists from the latest chaos. A special agent from the FBI who seems to be completely abolished up on ancient Korean tradition because of excellent "excellent in the Fed" - has gone unremarked up to this point. Lovers kiss on desert beach where one call "I never meant for this to happen." A reincarnated fear of Korean died long ago that "died as starred by those lovers." Mystic pending, anonymous track of robot soldier (which must be a lot of Peter Jackson's orcs) and a serpent that tears many roaring times that each time chooses his choices in reaching something comes together to distract it. The <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> However, for me the crown moment was in the end, after the final, when the music for the closed credit was - Arirang! This is rather like Akira Kurosawa closing "Ran" with a pronounced version of my Way - and let me be clear that I'm in no way compared to Shim Kurosawa's director. In short, a self indulgence, subtle collection of cliches and narrative non-seclusion that can appeal to the melodramatic sense of popularity in popular culture, but should not be worth the cost of the ticket to any other movie goer - or even a movie goer is not so serious. I would suggest that bypass these movie cinemas altogether and go straight to video, but I'm not even sure it's worth it so much.
