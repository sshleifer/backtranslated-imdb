This film was made for TV feel over all over it. Though, it started out with great intentions, featuring great looking sleeves and authentic accessories and costumes. The film quickly degenerates into the horrible nose of the dialogue, and runs melodramatic sappy TV act. Characters were so unlucky that at times I thought they were about to degenerate into a puddle of goo, and the action was so much mixed and offended that it looked as the soldiers were just standing around and taking the shot too with each other. The Germans were so irrelevant to show that it was painful to watch. The only thing that the German officers spoke about was the wonderful American. Please take my word for it. I'm a big fan of the genre of war, and this movie is crap. But this DVD has an excellent extra feature, covering letters from the WWI lines, so making this rental not a total waste of my time.
