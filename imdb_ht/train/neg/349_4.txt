A pot - pan if ever I saw one. An alleged imprisonment is assumed to come from "A Time to Kill", "The Silence of the Lambs", even an inverted "In the Heat of the Night" and a little reversed murder, a "foreign to a train" cast in, it failed abysmally where all the above, to a great degree, succeed. So, in delivering emotions. The plot looks condensed from a larger book, making the obvious drawings and uninvolving drawings, while the direction is lacking pace and verve. Ready to any kudo, a great twist had to be delivered on the road and here it also feels tangible. Connery is clearly slow in his old age, barely harassing and attempts at a US accent and besides looks too old to be the husband of Hope Lange and the father of these gosh - daring kids . He even has a father in law that looks younger than him. Laurence Fishburne barely gets the chance to live her role and you're confused at the start as if he's a bad guy or a good guy. Someone once said that flashback should not lie - they do, confusedly, here. The rest of the play is merely averaging not a reasonable throw in the scenario stereotype role. The supreme supposed to manage too, in rolling does not let me firmly entrench in the back, not like the aim, the front edge of my seat. Mediocre Sloppy Hollywood movie makes for sure.
