I saw this movie in New York City. I was waiting for a bus in the morning, so it was 2 or 3 in the morning. He was raining, and he did not want to wait in the PORT AUTHORTY. So I went through the street and saw the worst movie in my life. It was so bad, that I chose to stay and see the whole movie, I have yet to see anything else bad since. The year was 69, so call me crazy. I was left alone because I could not belive it .........
