The memory of a geisha is a very well-filmed movie, there is no doubt about that. And the act is generally excellent, at least in terms of how it shows the characters as they are scripted. <br /> However, many small details and great are just _wrong_ that it just harassed me too much to be able to enjoy it completely. A small detail indicating the lack of quality sensitivity is one scene (no this does not spoil anything) where Mameha rings a bell hanging from the door to the house where Sayuri lives, on a snowy winter day. The bell ringing it is a furon, or Van chimney - which only leaves hanging in houses in Japan in the summer! People in traditional Japanese homes did not have doorbells - they just opened the door and announced themselves. (You may think this is such a trivial detail, but I would like to equate this to a movie made on America where a Christmas crown hangs on the door in July and no one thinks anything of it.) And not even Finding me started on the hairstyles totally wrong to give the maiko and geisha, which is vaguely pan-Asian / Chinese / Kung Fu-ich, and nothing like real things. I think that this attitude rather than rider towards the culture are trying to really show out the attitudes and portraits of people and situations as well. <br /> So, I think less you know about Japanese culture and the world of the geisha and Maiko in Kyoto (which is what "Miyako" is), then I suppose the more you will enjoy that a. I honestly think this movie could be so much better ... as it is, it's just another Hollywood version of "exotic Japan".
