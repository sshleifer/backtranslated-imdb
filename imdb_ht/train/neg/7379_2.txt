What was Steven Seagal thinking? I mean first I love Seagal. I love all of its movies up to the mid-2000s. Early things are some of the best in the genre. This however does not live up to its excellent name. Force Assault (and protagonist Marshall Lawson {Seagal}) should be expected to be a mindless action movie with Seagal in a typical one-liner mom kicking form. However, what we find is a crime mystery, bordering on a political thriller and little or no action. Seagal is still in shadow because of his weight. I could not follow this story. There are people who are targeting for superhumans by taking a drug. What happened in this film. Seagal slippers are a shame, a fantastic and a shame. Why dub this man? The story is terrible. This was received a 2/10 in my hand because of the scenes where Seagal requires backup despite having an army with him, and a hilarious battle scene where Seagal swings his hand like a girl facing the camera! "Revenge is a way of street" seagal saying in this movie ... well forget Steven, you need redemption!
