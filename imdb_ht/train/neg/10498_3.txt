I keep this in a screening. All I can say is: What ... ... hell? This movie plays out as smoothly as the Mickey Mouse reading script for "Scarface." It is beyond the slightest bit of sense; And even if you leave your brain in the car, the movie is still so rare that it's not even funny. The plot involves crocodile hunter Steve Irwin trying to "save" a crocodile with a CIA topic. The CIA will come after Irwin to return the probes, Irwin errors for the poachers, and put them in their "stop" .. That's all about the story there; The rest is over-top-lampooning in Australian culture ("Didja see date?" and "Crikey!") and strange section choreographers section. At one point, Irwin steals a RV speed and knife fighting with a CIA agent on his head. Yes, that's right: Steve Irwin knife fighting a guy on top of a RV. That's why it's your guide to this ridiculous film.
