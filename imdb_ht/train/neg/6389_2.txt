I was expecting nearly 25 years to see this film, thinking it might be a underrated job, from an animation period to no longer in the quality it once had. She starred one of the best movie films of all time, based on a beloved series of children's books, and was a Disney Studios production. What could possibly be wrong with it? As it turns out, almost everything. <br /> Well, not everything. Vincent's prices such as Rattigan and Henry Swingman note Manchini are two films filming their films. The price is enjoyable, with Mancini more professional than the material deserves. They carry classes in a project that otherwise belongs to obscures. <br /> While the rest of the movie, while full of situations fits unreasonably, still suffers from a completely dull, blandly generic voice voice, terrible songs, and lazy animations that would not have been out of place on any of Disney in the mid-1980s saturday TV show. <br /> <br /> This was a complete disappointment about me. It's amazing that this film was almost contemporary with the secret of NIMH. Listen to a fraction of this, an independent studio producing something with more creativity in its trailer than GMD has in its endless time it runs. <br /> <br /> The extra star that keeps this from being "awful" goes to Price and Mancini.
