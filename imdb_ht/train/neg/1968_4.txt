Fairy dental was put in a small town somewhere in Northern California where Peter Campbell (Lochlyn Munro) brought a farming property that it is renovating & planning to turn into a holiday home, he is with his girlfriend Darcy Wagner ( Chandra West) and her 12 year old daughter Pamela (Nicole Munoz) who came to help for the weekend. While exploring Pamela's property to meet another young girl named Emma (Jianna Ballard) who warned her to go wrong in her new home, she told a story of an old evil witch known as Fairy In the teeth that take baby teeth in the children and then kill them. Pamela is worried & gets even more so when she bounces on her bike & her last baby's teeth fall out, it's not long before the evil ghost of the Fairy tooth has her eyes on the pamela's teeth & just to kick her too deciding to kill anyone he came across ... <br /> <br /> Led by Chuck Bowman I thought the fairy in tooth was just another poor right-to-video bar budget support film that failed to distinguish between herself from the other countless store shop store shelves & filling late night black night television, basically it's not very good. Scripts by Producer Stephen J. Cannell, Corey Strode & Rae Brown's Cookie is a completely rehearsal-Fest for the 40 odd minutes, nothing of any major interest occurring during this period at all & is basically the dolly display as if has gone to surprise anyone. It introduces the character, lying in the legendary Fairy tooth & that's it. The second half of the film improves a little, but even then it's hardly spectacular stuff, there are a few decent set-piece gore scenes but apart from it's everything very predictable & forgettable. The character is not large and most of them have peppers to be killed in, the story has inconsistencies like the story of the Fairy itself, saying it killed the children after giving the tooth babies so why Does it go on a tempting spree that has nothing to do with teeth? What happened to him after the prologue was placed during 1949? Why is it like a ghost? Although being a ghost of some sort it seems very human that has opened the door itself & using the murderous weapons, no attempt to make any use of the supernatural elements except the ghostly children who played for maximum feelings. <br /> <br /> <br /> Director Bowman does OK, it's reasonably well done & there are a couple of half decent scenes but nothing to get excited about. There is nothing I would describe as frightening or atmospheric in here & no notice of the comparison between this & Dark Falls (2003) as well as the tooth things are quite different. The throat is OK, someone is pushing into a chip wood chip, there is a decapitation, someone with the penis cut off & the best scene when someone is nailed to a door & then the stomach is hacked open and an ax and slip them out. With an estimated budget of about $ 1,500,000 tooth fairy is generally well done but nothing special is shown here. The act is not great but it's not too bad & pretty that I did not find the actress kids annoying so that's something I suppose. The tooth fairy is the usual just below the average budget low-to-door horror ticket that looks like anywhere these days, if you can get a cheap copy then it might spend 90 odd minutes if you are not too demanding otherwise it's very poor & forgettable stuff.
