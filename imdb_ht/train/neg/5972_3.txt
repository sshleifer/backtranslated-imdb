What a disappointment! Piper Perabo is adorable, Tyra Banks is beautiful but pitiful as an actor and talented and beautiful Maria Bello is wasted! Bello must have been embarrassed by some of the lines! The plot, script and quote are a joke! <br /> I'm not against funny movies, I think something about Mary is a masterpiece, but ugly koyote is a waste of 90 minutes .....
