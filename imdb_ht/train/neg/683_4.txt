Lulu (Louise Brooks) works as a tipist and she misses something in her life. He joined a Miss France contest against the wishes of his companion Andrew (Georges Charlia) and wins. She sets off for the title Miss Europe leaves her boyfriend behind. He wins again, but returns home to Andre because he asks him. Once back together, her life became Munde again so one night she wrote a note and left to experiment the fame that is waiting for her as Miss Europe. Andrew follows it ..... <br /> <br /> This movie is a silent film with a musical-piano track all the way through. It is also sped-up so everything seems fast. There is limited dialogue that is added later and it is very dark. Throw is quite hopefully that it is a silent film. The best part of the movie comes to the end, but the story goes on a little too long. After watching this, I'm not really sure that the deal was more than the looks of Louise Brooks - she has a terrible couple making her face look fat. I do not need to look again.
