Mario Lewis of the Competitive Enterprise Institute has written a definite 120-page point-by-point, line-by-line refute this mendacious movie, which should be titled a LIE Convenient. The website for which the debunking report, titled "An Exceptional Guide to a Troublesome Truth", can be found at: www.cei.org. You can find a shorter version of 10 pages at www.cei.org/pdf/5539.pdf Once you read these demolitions, you will realize that the alleged "global warming" is neither more real nor dangerous than Y2K 1999, which Gore also endorsed, as he did the pseudo-scientific film in the morning after TOMORROW, based on a book written by alleged UFO abductee Whitley Strieber. As James Randi's "Amazing" makes psychics, and Philip Grace makes UFOs, and Gerald Posner makes JFK conspiratory-idiocy theory, so Mario Lewis makes Al Gore's film with the "global warming" scam.
