So what's great to do from making a wannabe wannabe Jones when you have an actor who is cast as a fictional dude from adventure story book that does not want to go out on an adventure ??? Anyone who writes the script for JAKE speed has probably been shot, but for whatever reason, this movie is a lot of excitement! That does not mean that he has no action but look at the dark side of the picture. This has happened to no matching INDIANA JONES or other adventure-adventure adventure that has cliffhangers and narrow summer, and JAKE speed has promoted this way using smart propaganda to make me and several others interested in it! Moreover, I never heard of the guy, so needs his attention?
