Amy Heckerling's Two-Thousand Johnny Damier film is a parody of the 1930's gangster movie made in the Warner Brothers tradition. Michael Keaton star as a middle-aged gangster coming back to her life in hard knocks when she catches a kid trying to steal something from her pet store in 1935. Maathin Stapleton (Maureen Stapleton) has continued health problems , so Keaton falls into crime at an early age via Peter Boyle. Meanwhile, Fargan Richard Dimitri's play a rival crime meter to Boyle and Keaton eventually got up in the ranks. Joe Piscopo has a hilarious turn as Danny Vermin, yeah right, Vermin! Griffin Dunne is Keaton's younger brother turning to the district attorney, Glynnis O'Connor's wife, and Marilu Henner playing Keaton's brow. The film seems notoriously cheap, making it seem like a TV show instead of a theater movie. The movie starts out big and then slowly as expected after the first half hour. Due to the combination of dialogue and gag, the film holds its own for the first half, but then it quickly loses steam and down to the substandard and vulgarite in the second half. Keaton chews the scenery to do her best James Cagney impressions. Stapleton has several vulgar lines that are only obnoxious, not funny. Piscopo does "once" bit one time too much. Several actors support attempts to keep the fort as Danny DeVito, Dom DeLuise, Ray Walston as a street vendor, Alan Hale, Jr. as an office sergeant, and Sudie Bond as a dishonest cleanup lady. The second half evolved into a hit or miss television shows the tip type and never recovers. The closed scene used the Roaring Twenties is an anachronism as the movie call of Clark Gable Wild is seen on an earlier brand of the movie. I think Heckerling should have known better, since the target audience would certainly be aware of Roaring Twenties's current date in 1939. * 1/2 of 4 stars.
