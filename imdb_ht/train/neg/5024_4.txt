There is not much to say about this one. Gammera is some kind of fire breathing turtles. It is released from a nuclear explosion. He directs to land and begins to destroy buildings with tanks and other junk (oh yeah, my current line almost forgot). At one time, early in the movie, he befriends a boy, and instead of just throwing him away, or squashing him and putting him down to the ground. Safe. From that time we must watch this chubby facing small show up, run, show up, run, show up and run away. For some reason, Gammera is able to hear this kid from 20,000 feet away. Oh, well, the plot is to try to find Gammera to get to a place where he can put on board a rocket and shot in space. As usual, the monster is unleashed with coordone (a guy in a suit of Gammera). The Japanese army (with the help of Americans), uses up enough ammunition and fire to solve the national debt, and, of course, it does not. They should know this anyway. We've seen a lot of stomp monsters on Tokyo. Do not put these down because they can be fun, but it's really not very good.
