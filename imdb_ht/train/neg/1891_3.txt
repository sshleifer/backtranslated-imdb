Documentary about the Persian nomads make a trait traitor in massive mountains to get their herds of grass. Watching this silent, black and white feature, Marble is partly a twink-twink-twink-oriental music that could not be used in the original exhibition, is even duller than it sounds. The spectacular landscape is lost on a small black and white screen, and there is a pronounced failure to establish any kind of line drawn. I loved Nanook in the North and Mars of the Penguins, but despised this movie, despite the theme similarities. Physical difficulties alone are just not interesting.
