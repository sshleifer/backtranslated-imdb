This movie made me feel as if I had missed some important scenes from the very beginning. There were continuous mistakes and plots that were stopped as suddenly as they started. I was very disappointed because I love Whoopi Goldberg & Danny Glover, in addition to being always trusted & honored by Danny Glovers in his choice of role, "Grand Canyon" for example. I just could not finish this film, after which seemed an eternity, but was probably just a little over an hour; We had to turn it around. There was no comedy, there was nothing about the characters to make you empathize or sympathize with them, there was no evoked emotions at all regarding this movie and the clips in the past were wrong edited, confusing, and unnecessary. What could be a great idea for a movie, as a drama & not a comedy (although I think a comedy in this situation would be best, because I like to look out white people freak out & start acting like complete idiots, it made me laugh) became a waste of $ 1 credit in the video store.
