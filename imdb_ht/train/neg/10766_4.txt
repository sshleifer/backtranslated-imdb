Anyone who sees Tammuz's Children know that this is a director who can do better. Let's hope it was not a case too much but in the skin (anybody else's phone) And that's a case of jitters second feature. Characters are single-dimensional and on their use. The scenery is terrific however with the Pacific Northwest show very well. <br /> <br /> The cinematography is great. Injections almost entirely outward, the images are dry and beautiful. You can almost smell the wind blowing from the leaves. <br /> <br /> Technically this movie is as sound as they come - it just lacks a heart.
