*** Can include crowds. *** <br /> <br /> If you live in Tokyo time has been a bold experience where real actors have been given partial film about the condition that they would have to take a combination of powerful anti-prescription prescriptions, anti -depression, and anti-psychotic medicine (this is the classical classic pop patients who render patients in drooling zombies) all during filming, then this movie would hold far more interest. Or, if the film production was another kind of experience where all actors were sleeping privately before and during filming, then TOKYO TIME might be easier to explain. <br /> As it is, this movie is full of miserable, low-energy actors. At the scene where the new husband was sitting on the stairs talking to her sister, she appeared to have trouble keeping her eyes open. In almost every scene she speaks line her with all parts of her body motionless. From the beginning to end, its facial expressions are best described as "near to sleep." Cold not about the actors talk about each other because these actors can barely shut down subscribers from any line of dialogue. Everyone speaks to a depression, monotonous voice. No laugh. Do not cry. There is no vigil. No one has enough energy to crack a smile. The result: complete and total boredom. <br /> And it does not help the directional affair is simple and amateur .. <br /> Avoid this soft movie at all costs. Better to look GREENCARD which has a similar plot and has charm and energy. Or, for an original Japanese romance story, check out the SALE with a sufficient amount of everything that lives in TOKYO time by doing so.
