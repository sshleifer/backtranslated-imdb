This movie was the worst movie I've ever seen. It was such a "duty homework" for a movie class. It totally misses the mark when it comes to the "message" it is KASON relay. The characters are exaggerated, poor acting and a conspiracy ... well it is absolutely ridiculous. The cover is covered by what makes me think it can be a decent movie, the co-actor is beautiful and that's about it. Moral in this movie: NEVER JOY a movie by it's coated! Save your time, money and energy and make your own home movie and you will be far better than passing. It was painful to look and frankly surprised to me that anyone would spend money making and distributing it!
