This film could be very good, but comes short. Cheese special effects and so-so act. I could see past that if the story is not so disgusting. If there were more in a background history, it would be best. The center conspiracy of a malignant dirty witch is linked to this woman who gets migraine. The film drags on and off and never explicitly explains anything, it just keeps plodding over. Christopher Walken has a party, but it is completely meaningful, as is most of the movie. This movie was potential, but it seems some really bad for film. I would avoid this film.
