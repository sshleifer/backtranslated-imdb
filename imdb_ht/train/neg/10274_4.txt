In Texas, seven friends meet in a bar to celebrate Halloween night before going to a party. Meanwhile, the American nightmare radio is fun for confessing their intimate fears. A reliable assassin, who listens to their confession, makes their dream come true, killing each one of them in a sadistic way. "Nightmare Americans" is a strange budget film with a horrible start: without any previous explanation, a woman killed two couples in an isolated camp area, as if it was Friday, 13th. Then the story shifts to a bar, where seven friends are celebrating Halloween. From this moment on, the story has a great potential, and the gap cast has a very reasonable performance, which also shows some nice breasts and naked bodies, as usual in this type of production C. However, the end of the cynical provided no explanation for the murder instincts and motifs for the Jane Toppan nurse, giving the sensation that the budget ended before the finalization of the shoot. With a better beginning and conclusion, this strange story would be a good movie slashing budget low. My vote is four. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Agonia" ("Agony")
