Ascension is actually a step up in terms of what the original film was in history and in special effects. Jason Scott Lee is a good thing as a vampire hunter looking to count himself (if you remember him, he came from the movie dragon, the story of Bruce Lee.) Jason London is funny as Luke, the kid helps The woman she likes from a body far from Dracula's steal from the slab. Diane Neal It's the kind of woman who steals the Dracula's body in order to find a remedy for her dead boyfriend, and Stephen Billington is great as Dracula himself. Giving a better performance than Gerard Butler made the count of the original movie. Roy Scheider gets out of the rest of the film cast, and he does a decent job as counselor to Jason Scott Lee's character. This is the second sequel of the trilogy, and they are going to a good start. It's up to the sky if the latest movie will lock the series out on a good score.
