I read the book and the book was fascinating. <br /> This film, its direction, the scenario, and the act was totally obnoxious. I cringed in the lack of a scenario that could not follow the novel, a novel that has all the action, simplicity, and courage to illustrate a temerity of a great reality-based reality. <br /> I can see why this movie has not been released to the general public in most cities. Never recommend this movie to anyone I know. One of its worst adaptations I've seen has transformed into a minimal exploration of Earth's sky. Cinematography was the only record. But how can that weaken when filmed in a beautiful country like Peru? <br /> <br /> For prospective viewers, do not waste your time or energy on this flop.
