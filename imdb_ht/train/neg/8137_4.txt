Stewart Moss star as a scientist who is on a journey working with his wife, and one gets feeling that he has taken for this role for his ability to roll his eyes back to his head ... Imagine the auditions for that .. "you can ... name, that's not quite it, thank you, next!". Anyway, it was bitten by a stick, and then, it either changed into some types of sticks and kill people .... it's not. For anybody to see her weird transformation, but she seems to think that she has changed because her wedding ring pops off when her hand turns into claws, etc. In her credit the movie does kind to keep returning on if she's just black or whether it actually transforms into something until almost the very end. This has some good places & sort of a decent atmosphere at times but unfortunately none of that can make up for the story a bit lame and wonderful act. Kind of fun in a "so bad way in good" way, but leans more toward just plain bad. 4 out of 10.
