The first of the film is that Thomas Archer's son was murdered and his wife was brutally - and it is giving a chance of air revenge (after post traumatic therapy therapy), it is set in a room with a man attached to a chair and said this was the culprit. It provides a great table of applying and offering punishment: exercises, sticks, nails, sledgehammers, candles, whatever you may think of that one may possibly want to physically hurt someone else. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />. The two then create an uncomfortable alliance; who put them in this situation and why. <br /> Well, when all is said and done, we do not really care ...
