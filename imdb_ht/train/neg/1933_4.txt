Final Score (an average of various types of classic cinema-acting, visuals, creativity, mulch, humor, fun, ect): <br /> <br /> 4.3 (out of 10) Atlantis: The Lost Empire " from what it would seem like a bold, serious new direction of Disney animation. However, it comes just a year after the innovative and almost genius "New Groove Emperor" and marks a step back to free Disney from it's repetitive "Disney Formula "I'm a big fan of Disney's favorite feature animated films." Atlantis "is an animated throwback of" 20,000 leagues under the sea "and similar to live Sci-Fi Adventure -Fi in the 50s and 60s.The problem is that this version hardly has a single original idea. It feels like a remake of something, even more so than the current Disney rhyme (Tarzan, the Hunchback of Notre Dame). is little more than a walking click of the usual suspects that typically populate these types of films (the oddball mechanic, the gung ho overall, women are sassy hard). Beyond Milo Thatch (Fox) and Rourke (Garner) cast in support is flat-out obnoxious. The film also suffers from its passageway pace. Instead of whitish it out of an epic story, Disney jams a lot of usually briefly brush over opportunities to develop ... suspension, character, nothing really. They bring us into this new and beautiful world and barely we'll get our barings. The left peak sometimes makes confusion that is a relatively simple story. The animation is black and sad and cheap. This thing looks like a slapped Saturday morning cartoon. Let's hope they do not forget that traditional 2D animation can still be surprised. The "giant iron" among others proved that. <br /> <br /> Negative: visual, speed, and absolute lack of originality. <br /> <br /> Possible: Probably possible scenes of coolest deaths for a Disney villain in a long time. It's the creative recovery of the movie.
