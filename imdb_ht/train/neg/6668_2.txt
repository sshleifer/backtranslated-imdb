The longer this film went on and it seemed tediously going on forever-more annoyed I came, as well as frankly, what a waste of time to sit in this total nonsense. How on earth do people get films like this, or really get financially for such trash? Do not be fooled by the relatively high ratings of IMDb as it just proves you can dig some of the people all the time. And in this picture the main players have an armed mania, so it's not hard to work out the way this movie will finally unfold. America can never understand that the rest of the world finds it rare how society in the USA has such an obscene and fatal weapon culture. <br /> <br /> No matter: the lead actor shows a deficit that escapes from a fantasy world of being a cowboy in a Urban Sprawl.I. He comes across a family of two children frat spoils, a young girl and boy; take care of a single parent parent who can barely face. The cowboy is seduced by the girl or vice-versa, and the impressionable boy is seemingly taken in by the slender deficit. <br /> <br /> The cowboy pass all the time in a state of unreality and depression. A total loser who prefers to go to the beach then works for living, and then commits a family robbery as it is too lazy to make legally money. <br /> <br /> Ask yourself: <br /> <br /> Who wants to watch either a sad loss of failure in a fantasy world to keep a desire for death, or indeed see a poor family in effect by better than white garbage? This film is freewheel drivel. <br /> It only saves itself from receiving the lowest brands possible by half listening to music: <br /> 2/10.
