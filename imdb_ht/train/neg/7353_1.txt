Watching it now it's still as skanky and sexist as I remember. come out at a time when the girls were "Dolly Birds" and basically play in the waiter. It's hard to take into that it is from the Hammer studios and the fact it's available on DVD movie when they are not good. Our nations are ashamed of where the class works to describe how to work shy or worse! Problems are you can not help feeling nostalgic for a clippie on a bus. Try to keep that stomach when you see the Olive in a Fluffy? Blue "saucy" nightie or something that looks like Shirley Bassey was used to wear for a concert in 1972. This film warning shows illegal practices of towing a couple of motorcycles by a red dual bus decker, which I informed is not a Routemaster but a Bristol. <br /> Look just do not bother to look something decent rather like the bride or the father's father ... or a fly pull up a wall.
