This was the worst movie I've seen for a long time. <br /> <br /> Not only that it has almost nothing to do with the other American cinema, the story is obvious, flat and absolutely not funny. <br /> <br /> The girls are beautiful though, but spend time watching a cheap soft porn would perhaps be much older than watching this movie. <br /> This film seems to be a very bad ad sex, made for an audience of no more than 12. I've never visited an American college, but I'd seriously doubt anyone who did really laughs at any of the scenes. <br /> Save your time, do something else.
