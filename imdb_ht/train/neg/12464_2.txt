This movie, supposedly a thriller, had about five sub-cemeteries that developed along the Biggest Point in the end, but it ended more as a javelin. <br /> <br /> The word was frank, the pace was slow and disoriented and the characters were boring. George Clooney seems to need to get to a gym, Matt Damon hammed him and the others seemed to read the lines from a teleprompter. The worst part of this film was that it was carefully fabricated to be politically correct and so it ended up saying nothing at all about big business, oil and the Middle East. I saw the documentary giving more excitement. Watch it only if there is absolutely nothing else to do.
