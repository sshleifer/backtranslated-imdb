Who searches for this movie? It's set in Baghdad in 2004, however all the soldiers are carrying ACUs and they have all Universal Camouflage gear gear. No one brought the things to 04. <br /> I just saw this film while deploying abroad and I can say that the overwhelming feel of the WTF audience was? This movie had no sense, there were characters coming and going with no explanation, and those doing ridiculous things that would ever happen in real life. I realize that it's a movie, but it's obviously trying to show something realistic. It fails miserably, but it's trying. <br /> It's like someone who came up with a bunch of random ideas, bind them up and swallow, then vomit out a movie. I would not recommend this movie to anyone. I'm still not sure why I sit in the whole thing. GI Joe has been one that really makes you think of it. STAY HERE!
