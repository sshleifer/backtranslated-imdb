Because 'cruel' should be the only word of existence to describe the intentions of these movie makers. Where do you start? In a bit of b * tchiness, I'll start with the terrible act of almost everyone in this movie. Grate that. Almost does not belong to this phrase. I can not think of the same characters that have been described well. Although, in all fairness, it would be almost impossible to show these zero-dimensional characters in a successful way. Still, the girl who played Katherine (whose name my purpose is not included - I pretend he does not exist) remains one of the worst actors I've ever seen, only eclipse by the guy who played Sebastian. The story was terrible God. He tried the bright mirror that was the first one but failed in many ways. Pretty much every part of it was pointless - though I'll admit (grudgingly) that the twist plot was quite good to read its surprise. And the finish was at least a little funny. But this movie is there and the worst I've seen. Do not look at it. Just do not. There is absolutely no value in watching it. None. It only takes pleasure in the first.
