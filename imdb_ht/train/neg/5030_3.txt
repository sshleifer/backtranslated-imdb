What's the Sky in Heaven? Is it a plane? Is it superman ?? Errr, no ?? It's a TURTLE!?! Look, that's what gets into the Cold War! There is nothing but bad news and other issues! The Americans shoot down a Russian combat plane somewhere on the Artic Territory and the subsequent explosive explosions & literally up the giant pre-historic turtle-beet named Gammera. He / she is not a very friendly critter as he promptly tries to destroy everything and everyone on its path. The governments argue finally decide to kill the ugly battles with a brand new and super-sophisticated ice-bomb, but Gammera has another surprise in store ?? The damn turtle can fly! The first time this is the result of a lot of gross and hilarious sequences! Gammera lies on his back when suddenly burns out of its entirety and it skyrockets itself up in the air. How can you not like that? Then there's also a traumatic subtraction on an annoying kid that's able to telepathically interact with the monster, but that's just not interesting enough. Flying turtles, people !! There's a little else to write about this Japanese (and American re-edit) sci-fi effort, apart from that it's an obvious and totally cynical rip-off of the classic like Godzilla's original and the beast from 20,000 Fathoms. The effects and monster designs are very hokey and, unlike the aforementioned films, it never succeeds in creating an apocalyptic atmosphere. Performing actors such as Brian Donlevy ("The Quatermass Experiment") and Dick O'Neill ("Wolfen") seem unaware that films put on and even the original Japanese-scene-scenes are not very compelling. Gammera's very own and personalized theme-song is rather cool, though, so it becomes one extra point for that.
