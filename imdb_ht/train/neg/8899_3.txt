Where does he write that suits must be sucked? Call 2 was not! Others were not! But this one is sure to have ... problems include awful actors (only Christopher Walken could act in the movie all), bad writing (you'll never understand what's going on I even researched the idea in previous ninths), and just horrible choices for filing. Eric Roberts makes the Michael Archangel stupid that I've ever seen in my life! <br /> Avoid it as the epidemic unless you desperate to see Christopher Walken. In this case just fast-forward in the parts where it is in the movie and avoid the others. <br /> <br /> Yech !!!
