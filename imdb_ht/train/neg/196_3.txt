This movie flares over many fronts. As before, it shows more of the mythology of Alamo than the story. The output is poor, usually giving impression of a wellness project for many actors who might have otherwise had to work on Hollywood Square. This I was the greatest flaw - I know the ages and generalities of the real Alamo coal drives and the healing teaching of TV actors choose to show they never let any hint of credibility entrude. Texan, I grew up with the mythology. I later learned more about the story. I can accept a decent production from perspective (although I prefer more historical accuracy), but that never gives me a chance to enjoy it. Even John Wayne or Fess Parker's version had more life than this stolid mess, while being just a little less accurate. <br /> <br /> Very irritating - avoid it.
