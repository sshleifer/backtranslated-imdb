Mind, my friends and I've seen the movie based on its heading alone. It's nice, though obvious in its scheme and direction - you know where the movie is going in the first five minutes. My main conflict with the draw is that while it remains tolerably consistent, they never explain much to the things behind the characters. An alcoholic father, who has too much mother, sister raises ... is a bad family, but in the place where the mansion does not come from the sister, there is no resolution. I was also confused as the scene and the bottles ... it looked pretty random. <br /> <br /> The writing is a high concern ... The kids were not bad actors, but the script left much to be desired. Unfortunately, that could be a niche movie being pushed aside for one, blade special effects, scripting noise, and a clear splash scheme.
