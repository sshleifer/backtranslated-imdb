This is an interesting treatment of a subject that is quite controversial, (just read the other reviews about this movie). Apparently, you either love it or hate it and looks like most people distinguish based on whether they believe the tribulation and finish times will happen as described in the movie. <br /> <br /> Basically, the movie - and its suites - are made for about $ 1.30 each. The production values ​​are allowed to go down with "Plan 9 Out of Space" and the act is on the same level as "Glen or Glenda", (my Ex Ed Wood). Save the religious message, the story is as scary as they come. Add to the slightest thought that the story might actually be close to something that can happen in the future and becomes even peasant. This movie, and its end, did not try to bring in the cause of the tribulation occurring when it did. "The Left Behind" and the "Omega Code" tried to get into all "thieves" made and explained all the policies and maneuvers of the Middle East leading up to it. The net effect "thief" has done a better job on the part of the film scary, instead of spreading himself too thin trying to explain what happened in the Middle East at the same time. <br /> <br /> Forget the politics and watch this movie, and its end, for what they are - horror story. That horror stories can be said, indirectly, by God they are just more scary. If it makes you think about the subject, he did his job - even if you never believe.
