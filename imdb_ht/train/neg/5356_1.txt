I'm sorry to say that this movie is true bad. He reminds me of a c-class pornographic film with a big difference: not pornography. <br /> <br /> The story and dialogue need a comprehensive overview. Perhaps then the wrong act would not have been as apparent. At the very least, the rhythm should be collected. While I accepted that this had a low budget and the director did a good job visually giving what little resources she was, she should have spent more time on the story or better yet, finding someone else to write it. Many of the action scenes were just pointless. <br /> It was a complete waste on my time.
