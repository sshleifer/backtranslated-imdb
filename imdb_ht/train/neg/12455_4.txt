I remember watching this on the first time when I was about 7 years old. I was a great comic book reader at the time, and anything related to Superheroes was anticipated heavily. The end result, however, was underwhelming. <br /> I was aware of Diana's "Emma Peel" story stories, as were just recently coming to an end and Diana had returned to his Amazon form. However, there was so little action that I was bored in most of the movie. The final costume was an interesting idea, but look more like a cheerleader than a superhero. <br /> I saw the movie again by the end of my teenage years. It did not improve much. Cathy Lee Crosby was more familiar, thanks to that incredible, but she did not have the best. The script had a few good ideas, like Naughty Amazon, and a decent villain at Ricardo Montalban, but it just did not come along and it was always boring .. <br /> I think they should have built the back best storytelling, and build the show at an epic point. It was too much like a blown spy movie, crossed with a superhero story written by someone who never saw a comic book. The Amazon elements were intriguing, but they need to be expanded. The film succeeded in forcing the producers to go back to the drawing chart and to come up with something more loyal, though a bit too low and low budget. The budget was also very low here, and Superheroes did not come cheap. <br /> It would be good to have the movie available on DVD, if only as a comparison with historical documents. Even the 4th Superman is available, and there is nothing about this movie (except Chris Reeve and Gene Hackman). It's worth seeing for the sake of curiosity and for a bit of inspiration and precautions for future versions.
