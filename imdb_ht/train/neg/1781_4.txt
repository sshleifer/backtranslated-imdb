Written by Stephen King, but this treatment is not as solid as most of its history on film. A mother and son moved to a small Indiana town with a secret. They are Sleepwalkers, animal feline types that feed on young virgins. This little story has its share of gore and special effects; more suggestions of anxiety. <br /> Alice Krige is outstanding as the mother. Others appear Madchen Amick, Brian Krause and Cindy Pickett. Look for the very small role for John Landis and Clive Barker. Stephen King cameos as the caretaker of the cemetery.
