I liked the original story, there was plenty of hope for the movie (especially since Barker was paralyzed in interview), finally seeing it and what can I say? It was a total MESS! The direction is everywhere, the acting atrocity, the flashy visuals and choreography were just flat, empty and completely unnecessary (that got up with the generic music videos techniques such as the quick-forward-slang word wording? It was the stylish answer to Yes but not needed in this film and cheapened the Ambians in some mute MTV Marilyn Manson / Smashing Pumpkin / video music video). Some of the killers are very cool and brutal, some are just ridiculously ridiculous (the first kill on the Japanese girl was hilarious and Death Raimi's death was just stupid funny). It just rushes everywhere with zero tension and suspense, totally moving away from the original story and then going back to it to the final non-point that just feels mad about chaos up even more. There was no explanation given any, I meant I knew what happened only as I would read the story but for those who did not read it even more confusingly as at times I did not know that where he went and what he was trying to do-he went to a crazy tendency all the time. <br /> <br /> God, I really wanted to like this movie as I'm a big fan of Barker's work and likes the story as it has immense potential for a cracked movie, Hell I even enjoyed some of the movie The kitamura as fun romps but this movie just reeked in amateris and silliness from start to finish - I did not care about anyone or something, the whole thing was running and seriously cut out from the current source, in something else entirely. Granted it was gory and Vinnie Jones played a superb Badass, but everything else was all over the place, over disappointing. Well done
