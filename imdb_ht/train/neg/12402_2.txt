I always thought that people were a little too cynical about those old Andy Hardy films. A couple of them were not bad. Modern movie criticisms are not usually those who are pretty cute, so goody-two movies are not such a shame. <br /> However, I can not defend this movie either. You can always have a dated dialogue, but it's still laughing and crying about the story. Watching this, you just shake your head to ask yourself, "how stupid can you get?" This is annoying than corny, if you know what I mean. It is so corny I can not fathom too many people actually sit throughout the hour-and-a-half. <br /> The story is basically "Andy" (Mickey Rooney) trying to get out of jam because it does make some stories about involving some beginners from New York City as if it were the ultimate. People were a lot more social-conscious in the old days. You would hear the term "social-climber" as if they knew the rich or beautiful was the highest success you could make it life. It's all nonsense, of course, and looks even more so today. However, it's about as innocent and own a story and series (there was a dozen half of these Andy Hardy movies did) as you could get. Also, if you like to hear Judy Garland songs, then this is your ticket, as it sings a couple of songs in here and it croons her way to the heart of Andy. Oh, I almost throw it out on that!
