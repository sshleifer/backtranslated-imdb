This little show is obviously some stupid little prequel / turn off in the original set. <br /> <br /> Compared to action in live action shows this is crap crap. Show live action was a smart joke and story line. While the animated series is basically a tone downward version for small viewers to digest but I think maybe kids have to crap this crap. The scenario of each episode is basically just Sabrina has some stupid and freewill sleep and uses magic to fix it. This basiclly idea of ​​every episode. The most scary episode was Sabrina's use of magic to become Gem and Gem to become Sabrina. So then Gem gets a witch and hypnotizes their courage to become his slave. This then leads to a rare but extremely interesting scene was Gem says "just worship me for now" and Harvey came down on his hands and knees and began to kiss his feet as a god. (which is quite right since it is self control slave) but this stupid turn-off is not worth the time or effort.
