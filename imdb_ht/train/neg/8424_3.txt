This film can be judged from three views: as story, as a profile of Amin, as a fictional thriller. <br /> It does not fail as history, it's mentioned by the coup that drives out Obote, the expulsion of the Asian, and has the Hi-Jack Entebbe as background, but not in any consistent chronological frame. <br /> As a profile of Amin it may have been interesting, because Forest Whitaker is incredibly good, and if this was a better movie, he would get an Oscar. (He had it - proving the Oscar voters not watching their films to vote on.) It ignores the important historical episodes of the novel, which observes Amin and the history of Uganda from the point of view of the doctor. He says rather the story of art of scottish physician and life is impossible to love him from the point of view of Amin. But the story said the one incident was that Amin was probably innocent. <br /> <br /> As a fictional thriller, there is no conspiracy to keep it together. The start is stiff - it takes the cinematic and romantic liberty, but sets the story. The physician's character is well-defined, but it gets lost in the second half of the movie that suffers as a result. <br /> Why did the doctor decide to stay in Kampala seriously explaining - seduced by power? Why it befriends no one is weird. Character of the friend of the novel was lost because the Scotsman has the affair instead of the black doctor - a comic book that does not seem even credible believers, but allows the writers of the movie to show the frenzy of Amin close by. The man named Little Horse at the end is crucial. <br /> <br /> Finally in 1971, Uganda drove to the left, by right, the number plates were three letters with two or three numbers - and where are the Ecuador teasks? <br /> In short - if you have never heard of Amin, you may want to spend two hours watching this movie appreciating Forest Whitaker's act, but the last hour confuses you. If you know Uganda or read the book - do not see the movie - it will only press you. But if you want to know why the doctor was so bleeding - it was not.
