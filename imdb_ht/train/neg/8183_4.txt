This is a piece of fluff rather than WW II code being broken, stolen, etc. The act is on what I hope this cast of actor MGM "B" .. A great precaution. Jean Rogers, who made such a great work Dale Arden's very sexy plays at the first two Flash Gordon series is just awful in this movie. Her character is very annoying. It absolutely does not allow-up and it overacting. We suppose that during a World War height of what would obviously be a top setting facility code, it would allow them to just pop in and out of any office in it's chosen although it has no official functions. From this point I'm sorry that I've ever watched this movie. He has forever changed my perception to Ms. Rogers. Talentwise, it is a lightweight extreme. Lee Bowman is his usual self, meaning he is simply adequate. <br />
