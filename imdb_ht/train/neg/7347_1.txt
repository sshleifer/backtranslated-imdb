No fault here but I've been a fan since dreaming the Dead started, but the last series, which only 3 were about so far is terrible. The stories do not bring any resemblance to the original idea of ​​the series. I found these 3 in the latest jigsaw puzzle series jaw. As a BBC payer, after the show I ring BBC BBC to pass on my deception. I'm surprised that actors in the caliber of Trevor Eve and Sue Johnstone did not object to the story line. These actors were with these characters for 8 seasons, poorly can see it losing all directions. It is a great job it is the last series or the next series can begin with the team to investigate the death of Father Christmas! <br /> <br /> Paul Bentley, West Yorkshire, England.
