I have absolutely no knowledge of author Phillipa Pearce or any of her novels and if TOM`S MIDNIGHT GARDEN is typical of her work I would probably have little interest in reading her as a child. When I was a kid I was not really interested in writer unless he was fighting fighting monsters with a high body count <br /> <br /> Judging by this movie version of TOM`S MIDNIGHT GARDEN I guess Pearce writes for lower middle school children since much of the story of revolving around Tom Long protagonist moving in a home with no gardens then suddenly found a metaphysical one. Having a garden of your own there was no doubt something working class people did not have in the 1950s so i guess there's some subtle political subtext policy somewhere. There is also a romance involving a young girl called Hattie but yet they are cynical children amoured by love stories? Maybe the worst criticism is that very little in the way of excitement or adventure happening in the narrative <br /> <br /> This is a movie movie that looks like dating by its source. It's inoffensive but I'm surprised by its high rating by the IMDB voters. I wonder how many of them would give him many high marks if they were 10 years old who`d just saw the Lord in the earrings trilogy?
