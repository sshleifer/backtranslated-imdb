There was a lot of love that was put in Wes Anderson's "Fantastic Mr Fox", unfortunately all the love is for himself. Granted, there was plenty of time and effort being put in doing this ever so self-conscious stroke universe but if only the same time and efforts were put into the script to try and make it funny. The worrying thing is that I think it was, and this is the best that Wes Anderson could come up with. The animation is good at the close-up shots of the animals, however when the camera is far more everything gets really hard on the eyes and must be honest honestly looks a bit of a mess. Not really anything special about the act either, and Wes chooses to choose her sweetheart with great name on more specialized voice actors who might probably have made the movie the best. I'm really sure George Clooney's voices are summarizing consist of two rising appearances in South Park, one of which he plays a dog. The film is too smoking and trying to way too hard to be clever and different and usually, despite the film being put in England, all the good Indian species are basically playing baseball, too, the bad guys are English stereotypes and accents most insult the English. I can not stress how much of a waste of time this movie is. I did not laugh at once.
