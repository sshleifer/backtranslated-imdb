It's hard to believe that in 1997 David Duchovny was at the top of his fame, with X-Files, one of the best sci-fi series ever, being at the forefront of the glory. Nine years later it is almost forgot, and his attempt to make it on the big screen failed miserably. I can not even explain why, he's a fair actor, but probably his moment of fame thrown into an eternal role that takes great talent to break out of. At the same time Angelina Jolie was much less known, and she was really lucky that a movie like 'God's Play' did not lead her career to a dead end. Fortunately for her, 'Zoe Collector' and 'Girl, Interrupted' were waiting beyond the corner, and when Lara Croft arrived, she was quarantined. <br /> No too much to be told about this movie. It is the only movie screen great Andy Wilson, and there must be a reason. Everything is banal and most of what's happening on the screen is expected in this story of a senior physician who saved the life of a victim shot in a bar only to find himself working for the crowd. The off-screen voice is mostly malicious, with a moralist text that kills any shadow of the movie experience from the movie. Probably you will not meet the movie but in DVD rental locations, or on TV. Try to find something better.
