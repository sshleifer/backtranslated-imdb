As an ex-teacher (!) I must confess to cringing in many scenes - 'even though I continue to look at the end. I wonder why? (Boredom, maybe?) :-) <br /> <br /> The first opening scenes hit me as incredibly mished and unfocused. The scheme also, although there were some good ideas - the combat of a rescue teacher, for example - were not concentrated enough in any direction for development of 3-D. <br /> <br /> It's not one of Mr Nolte's finer moments. Like Mr Macchio's youth, does he speak in the whole movie? <br /> <br /> Draw and complain aside, hair-styles alone is a nostalgic (if nauseating) journey. <br /> <br />
