I should never watch this movie. The style of filming can be considered artsy of some, but it is considered migraine-induing me. I think it might have been an interesting draw, but since I could not watch it for time stretching in a while I missed so much. Photos are flickering and stop filming motion marking my brain. I stopped watching the middle way and will not come back for a second try. I suppose if I was home alone in my own dark night and storm, this could be just the ticket ... PS Not whether the film style can be considered as a spoiler, but I Do not want to blacklist me on my first review;)
