The minute you give an 'art film' 1/10, you have people giving up for your ignorance, half-ass-ed, artfully delaying blood. I will not try and justify how I'm not an aesthetic delayed defying by listening out all the 'movie theater' I liked or mentioned how I gave some classic 'unknown' a 10/10. All I ask is that someone explains to me the point, purpose and message of this movie. <br /> <br /> Here is how I would resume the movie: Opening montage of three urban legends describing almost absurd levels of incidence. This is followed by (in a nutshell, to save you 3 hours of pain) the following - An army game shows the dead child of lung cancer trying to plait things with her coke- , whom he may or may not have violated when he was a child, and who was crowned by a bumbling police officer and relationship problems, while the game star-show contest has decided he does not want a childhood Prodigy to fail, a fate that collapsed another one of the game competitors from the 60s, which we see is now a homosexual unemployment in love with a bartender and braces and in need of money for 'corrective oral surgery', while The game show producer, himself killed in lung cancer, asks his male nurse to help her patch up with her son to abandon years ago, and who has immediately become a self help guru self , as the second wife The producer suffers from guilty wounds on being cheated on pesky a dead man; and oh, eventually, it's raining frog (You read it correctly). And I dispatched you the incredible long and free monologues, literally rambling monologue every character seems to come up with on the fly for no rhyme or other reason than, perhaps, to make sure the movie crosses 3 hours and becomes classified as a 'modern season'. <br /> You are probably thinking that I could do a better job of resume the movie (and in turn by your confusion) if I wrote the damn thing a little more coherently, perhaps in a few sentences instead for just one ... Well, now you know how I feel.
