One of Farmer's earliest movies; At 22, it is absolutely beautiful. Bing Crosby is in great voice, but the songs are not his best. Martha Raye and Bob Burns are interesting, but the comedians, probably great in its time, are really corny today. Roy Rogers also appeared in a song role. In my view I'm worth considering whether you're a fan of Frances Farmer, and possibly a fan of Bing Crosby.
