Seeing how long I hate reading trials hoping to find a point and being ashamed, I'll first tell everyone that this film was awful. Initially awful. And not, amazing for the reasons mentioned in the first review. I thought I could agree with him, seeing how he gave the film to the rank he deserved, but he was grieved by what he said. I'm ashamed to be taking the same side as someone commenting that the film "definitely misses good-looking women." Let me first say, "Wow! This was definitely some thoroughly deepening there. My mind can hardly understand the philosophical reliefs on this movie." However, a lack of "good-looking women" should not be considered an essential in a movie. If you're desperate enough for "good-looking women" you should really look at other types of movies, not necessarily falling into the sci-fi category.
