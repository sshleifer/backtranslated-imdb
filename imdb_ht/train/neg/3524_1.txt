This is one of the worst cases in drivel movie I've seen in a long time. It is so awful, that I'm not sure where to start, or even if it's worth it. The plot is the real problem, and I feel sorry for 'Sly' as it puts in a decent performance for his part. But that draws ... Oh my dear oh. I particularly love the road near the end he managed to pop out from the foot of a hill at the top, too the helicopter is on the road. A creepy day or two takes it all five minutes! I could go on: but it's not worth it. Apart from the grim opening (which even a five-year-old could predict the result of) the rest is drivel. Sorry, but this is as bad as making movies become.
