The story line was pretty straight forward and easy to follow and contained a lot of no-brainer comedy at a point where he just got bored. Some of the audience seemed to find it funny but I love more email humor. <br /> There are several actors acting allegedly in the movie and performances were decent considering the script. Lena Endre was good looking. <br /> I do not remember the original movie so I can not tell if it's best or worse. <br /> If you enjoy movies such as SÃ¤llskapsresan this movie can be worth taking a look at.
