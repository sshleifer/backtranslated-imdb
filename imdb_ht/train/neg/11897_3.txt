William Lustig's follow-up to "Maniac" proves that, without the spectacular effects of Tom Savini and convincing the Spinell's performance, "Maniac" could never hit the cult of it. "Vigilante" is seriously led, with a simple-minded script that spells everything out for you and is predictable at every turn, and also performances mediocre by all the actors. Judging from the essence of "already gone" this movie gave me, Lustig looked at "Wish Wishes" several times too many before doing so! (* 1/2)
