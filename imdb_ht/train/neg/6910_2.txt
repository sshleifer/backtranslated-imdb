I have never actually seen this movie but it can tell you one thing about its production. While a comedy / oldies radio DJ in 1988, I received a call from the production company. They asked if I would write and write a bit to drop in the soundtrack as eminent sound from a TV (the TV screen itself could never be shown). I said that, wrote a parody of '50s sci-fi monster monster, rounded up some sound effects and called to another DJ, Pam Landry, to play the female part. As it happened to be in the air at the time and put on a long song, alongside me in the mike in the production room and we cut the voicetrack into one taken. Giggling, he then returned to his show while I mixed in the sound effects to jump. We would never do it if we knew that "Woodchipper massacre" went on like a turkey - but then again, we never paid for our efforts, either! - Gary Theroux
