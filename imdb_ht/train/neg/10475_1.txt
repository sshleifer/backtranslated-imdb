I'm a young pastor's wife and we've got some teens to watch this movie. We then spent an hour trying to explain it to them. They did not find it and I did not enjoy it. It is based on a concept that runs through all three of the world's largest religions (the Bible Code, Code of Torah and the Code of the Koran) and is so questionable that they must be mockingly. This is not a step forward for Christian art, it is a step forward for those who believe we check our brain at the door.
