National Lampoon was once a comic magazine. If you loved the hippie day stoner in the late sixties or smoked and sassy shells-head days in the sixties (when the comedy was boosted and naked babes) depends very much on your birth date, but everyone agrees By early eighty, middle age was killed in whatever spell of humorous anarchy that the drugs were not, and offerings like this film and record twice dramatic turn-off hole holes in the cockroach. Outside of a nicely titled illustration, there's absolutely nothing to recommend this stinkbug singularly depressing. If you do it in the obscure opening segment, 'Growing myself', hope things will get better, hard chance - they do not. Anyone who thinks the idea of ​​a woman being brutally raped with a stick of butter was gold comedian deserve to have himself surrendered back to her on a platter of dog mess. If there is a global shortage in guitar picks, the negative in this rambling, incoherent ragbag in gromos mind and dire performance can be good to serve some reason.
