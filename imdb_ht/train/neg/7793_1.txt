This really is one of the worst movies ever made. I consider myself a big fan of zombie movie and usually tolerate the bad act, lame "special effects" of a mute story and whatever you can meet in the second movie, as the film has a good atmosphere / story / suspension or whatever they offer. This one has basically no positive aspects of it and is third or fourth percent, possibly worse. Some of my friends and myself made a movie during a week's holiday and definitely did a better job (no zombie movie though). This flicker is not even funny, not talking about anything else. Really bad and redundant, special effects, zombie-like normal people (except for a white skin incomplete pull on their face), the many unrealistic ways (I love so much realistic, the combination of realism and zombie movie was debatable, but featuring Gore is just plain funny). The camera stays long and scene scene, it gets boring, and you can not help but wonder, why zombies use WAPONS (!) They kill animals. I will not go into the details of the dubbing (others did). Although I am from Germany myself and I at least a bit curious about the original version, I will not waste more in my time with this movie. <br /> <br /> Keep away from it, as far as you can.
