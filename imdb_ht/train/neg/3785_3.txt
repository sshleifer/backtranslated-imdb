Speaking like a true gangsta hard-boiled gangsta. The story is no worse than any number of gangster cops, but has never confused this movie with the godfather I or II, or Goodfellas. It is not in the same league. But what makes the film painstakingly painful to watch is all these Italian Americans troubling around to cast gangsta malicious guns into an even worse fo u'an accent. Pacino would be great if they could just be armed. I was looking forward to seeing Abrahams and Loggia, but the steenky accent was spoiled. <br /> Ah well, the script is not too hot either. Don Corleone would have made this disappear five minutes after satisfying her, smiling and patting her on the back all the while.
