I am a 11th grade in my high school. In my current class World Affairs a kid in my class was this video and suggested we look. So we did. I'm firm believer that we went to the moon, being my dad working for NASA. Though I think this movie is the biggest piece of crap I've ever looked at, the guy who created it has some serious balls. First of all, it has to show JFK getting shot? And how dare he uses all those biblical quotes. The only good thing about this movie is that it's sparking debate, which is the best b / c in my class we have weekly debate. This movie did not want to change my mind. I think he and Michael Moore should work together and make another movie. Michael Moore next film can be called "Something funny about Spetember 11th" or "Something funny happened on the way to the white house".
