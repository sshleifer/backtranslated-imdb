I read the book "7 years in Tibet" by Heinrich Harrer and was captured in it. Then I immediately grab the DVD and started to watch the movie. I remember the first time I saw it back in 98, I like it. Well, now I look at her again to the full knowledge of the book she is based on. and soon I realized how WRONG it all said: <br /> <br /> when they joined Lhasa the people started to stick their tongue out of their mouths with Thewolf and Pitt having the impression that it's way to say hello in Tibet , So they greet ... in Harrer's book explains, the sticking language is a sign of absolutely humbleness and loyalty to Tibet and can be done before the Dalai Lama, but certainly not for these two European! not only the mother, but even the Dalai Lama herself was wearing glasses to the public. in the book Harrer mentioned, that no one in Tibet has put glasses at that time (sorry to forget the reasons, but it explains in the book too) .Lama's lama did, but only when he was alone He and nobody could see him! and what about that Mao Tse lookalike, destroy the mandala in front of the young "living Buddha" ?? kids ... and the tailor made Harrer and Aufschnaiter tibetan dress by European designer costume! why are so many events that really get rid of the story, just filling the time with a fictional love interest (tailor in fi ...) which is completely non-important? just like the whole story about Harrers, son, Rolf. There is not a word mentioned on it or even any Harrer family member of the book. but that was OK for me because "7 years in Tibet" is not a book about Harrers. read on Tibet. I'm very disappointed by this "adaptation" of the famous book. and I bet Heinrich Harrer was, too ... 3 stars, just for the cinematography.
