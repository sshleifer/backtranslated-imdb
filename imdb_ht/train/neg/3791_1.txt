I can not vote on this because I would not look at garbage from these people. My money was received with another movie (Mr. Jingles) and I swore it would never happen again. I feel it is my civic duty to help people stay away from this waste. Go to the forums on this movie and read where cast members try to act as they see the movie for the first time. A guy even responds to himself ... using the same name! There are shills in the forum saying it's as good as redemption Shawshank and Citizens Kane ... Not even closed (no means). If this is the company's 2nd film, it would be better than the first. That means the 3rd film should be a lot better. Not so, I've seen it. All I want to know is the way you distribute this waste using the same names all the time. Having fun with friends and making a movie over the weekend is fine ... but do not try to walk garbage!
