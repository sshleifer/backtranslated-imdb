I'm currently presenting Robin Williams in her most serious role (like Bon Will Hunting, Fisher King, the World According to Garp). These are my favorite Robin Williams movies. But seize the day, although well-acting, is one of the worst movies I've ever seen and certainly Robin Williams is the worst movie (even worse than Smoochy's death, Paradise Club, and Alladin on Ice). <br /> <br /> Every good story that will have its ups and downs. This movie, however, is a giant down. I do not need a good feel-Hollywood cheese-fest, but I've got to have something other than 90 minutes of complete and utter despair. This movie reminds me of "Love Liza" (which is actually worse) because it seems that the only point in the film is to see how far someone can fall. The answer? Who cares.
