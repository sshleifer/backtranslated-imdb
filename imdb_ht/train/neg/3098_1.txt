How Rick Sloane was allowed to make five films is more difficult to believe that cold fusion. This film is absolutely criminal. Before watching this movie I thought Manos: Here's the fate was the worst piece of crap I've ever seen, but at least Manos moves so slowly you might fall asleep, so rescuing your eyes from the pain He will suffer. The greatest tragedy in this movie is that the old man who holds the Hobgoblins "close" up makes it to the final stage. The time I spent watching this film was an absolute waste in my life.
