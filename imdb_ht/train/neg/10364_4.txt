The book is so good that at least the opening of this make-for-TV movie will move you, but then, as it diverges more and more in the book, takes all the religion with love and math and the set Click cotton candy, it becomes boring. Still, from the comment I heard, people who do not read the book tend to love it, and if it even brings a child offspring a time, it will serve its purpose. The most embarrassing change is to cheer a script of the Albert Poppins' uncle (I love laughing). There is nothing so badly induced to provoke as characters on the hilariously laughing screen in the things that are totally unfunny.
