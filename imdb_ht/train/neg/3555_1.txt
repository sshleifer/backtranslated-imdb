Years ago a movie went to friends and I went to see a horror movie that we thought would be good because it starred John Cassavetes. For uninitiated, John Cassavettes was an actor, screen writer and director (married to actress Gena Rowlands), nominated for Oscars three times, who wrote and directed a variety of good film film films using his revenue as an actor holding himself afloat. Until seeing the Incubus, we did not understand that John Cassavetes's revenue was made out of any movie that offered him. Did you know what the movie was before it could be avoided altogether. But we did not walk out. At that time, my friends and I joked that she was the worst movie ever made. Now, honestly, this is not true. I've seen many bad films made on Friday nights in Cinemax (did I just say that loud?) Far worse than the Incubus. Almost all films that begin with Brian Bosworth are by definition a movie worse than the Incubus. Certainly Santa Claus Conquers Martinians are a movie worse than the Incubus. However, I've always used the Incubus as a threshold below which I do not want to fall. When talking to a friend about a movie I can see I'm still noticing that it was the best (or worse) than the Incubus. <br /> http://thevillagevideot.blogspot.com/
