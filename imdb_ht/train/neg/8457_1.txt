I only watch this movie because I was so impressed with Olivier Martinez in SWAT. But this is not SWAT. SWAT has a plot with some characters and makes sense. Bullfighter did not have any of these. <br /> I should realize that it's not possible for any good, after all, Michelle Forbes's great suffering had a starting role. <br /> A poster here is called the incoherent film. Another call it the worst movie ever. Both gave the movie far too much credit. I'm glad I got it out of the library for free, but I still feel torn off. <br /> <br /> IMDb needs to include a "0" of "this movie rate" vote, just for movies like this one.
