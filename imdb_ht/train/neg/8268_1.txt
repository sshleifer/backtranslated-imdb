This movie is terrible. Everything has been done before. There is nothing original. I can not stand when writers do not come up with their own plots. <br /> A girl makes a wish on her 13th birthday and wakes up as an adult. Hmm, sounds a lot like a movie in the 80's called Big. What even more annoying is Jennifer Garner's acting. It does not act like it is 13 it just acts like it is stupid. Since then, you can guess the whole sketch. She gets a good job and it's just so that a friend she's at work 13 with her. Wow, how awesome! But no .... his friend is bad and turns around, trying to get his job. But of course, it has the end when it comes with a "big" idea. <br /> There is also a dancing scene in the movie that I saw once a thousand years ago. <Brr /> <br /> I hate this movie.
