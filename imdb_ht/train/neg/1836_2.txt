How Barry Levinson possible to assemble white-hot comedy talent Ben Stiller and Jack Black, Gorgeous Rachel Weisz, old pro Christopher Walken and still deliver such a humorless stinker? <br /> <br /> Stiller and Black are friends until the latter invented a spray to make chaos disappear and become a conspicuous multi-millionaire consummate. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />! <br /> <br /> Stiller and Black are simply not funny for way too much of the time, Weisz seems sensational as always but criminal underused and, with the exception of Walken as a batty butterfly that encourages Stiller's character to capture revenge, it's a turgid trudge at the end of this tartar maceration.
