I watched this movie alone, in the darkness, and was full moon out! I did not do it for purpose, it just happened that way. So all the elements were there for this movie to scare the hell out of me !! Well, he did not, in fact I wanted to close the DVD player after only 8 minutes, but I thought coming on giving him a chance, unfortunately I did. The act was terrible, the only one and decent decent was Samaire Armstrong. The plot is not original, if you're a horror fan then it's just the same thing you've seen many times before. Some scenes did not make sense at all, and you just get the feeling that the director wanted to make the movie again! The monster was the biggest disappointment of the movie. The scene (scary) seemed to be part of a horror movie from the 80s when there was not enough technology, yet some good movies were made back then! I was surprised to see the name of a major production company at the start of the film, I thought could not put some money into this and make it decent? !! I could not agree more with the ratings that the movie got, it is also my rating for it, 3 out of 10.
