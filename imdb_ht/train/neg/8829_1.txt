This is an abysmal piece of story-telling. It's about an hour in the movie before we have a lot of ideas about what it's supposed to be about; The characters are often irreplaceably inogable; Actions often seem to have no relationship with each other; nobody seems to worry about who is actually murdering the girl; a pair of spooky kids go swimming in water that seems threatening but nothing happens; The Irishman gets drawn to the face by one of her buddies for no apparent reason ... continued to be as boring as the movie itself. Only half-fun elements are landscape photography; but anyone could show a camera in the Australian outing to get memorable shots. In general - sad, incoherent, firefighter - and downright annoying to wasting a lot of time the viewer.
