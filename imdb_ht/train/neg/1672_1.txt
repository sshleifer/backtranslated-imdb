This is the only movie I've ever seen pushing me to write a scrutiny on any web site, and that's an important statement from someone who loves the "monolith attack of the monsters." This movie is perfect for anyone who wants a harmless movie. It is devoid of sex and violence, for example. I believe this movie is safe for children of all ages. This movie is perfect for anyone who does not want to be entertained, challenged, or encouraged in any way. Adults could easily catch up on the TV front while the kids watch this movie. You do not need to surprise, however, if you wake up the kids have turned the TV off and started a board game. As an adult who enjoys being entertained, who enjoys everything from the world of the fantastic in realism, drama, comedy, and action, all these adults that reflect real life on earth and / or promote the imagination, This movie has nothing to offer.
