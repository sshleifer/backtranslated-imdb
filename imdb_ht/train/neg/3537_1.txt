Convinced the world that it did not exist ... <br /> <br /> This is a line that is probably remembered by a lot of people. It's from the Suspects Frequently in the course of Kaiser Gold .. I mean Sose .. <br /> I got another like that: -Trick's dumbest a never-to-be-directed director was trying to convince her a hearing actually There was a storyline <br /> <br /> This movie is one of the sad pieces of make-movie I've seen in a long time. It starts out well, and really fantastic movies, great acting and a very smart site. But alas, the only way this film is heading is on a course of self-destruction. And it does, not by one blow, but with little naked little-cut. <br /> <br /> Do not pay attention to the comments here that are amazed at the fact that they have found a way to explain this donut. With enough my brain bottle, I would probably be able to explain the very existence of humanity to a very possible degree. I've seen it over a dozen totally different ways to explain the story. And they vary from a totally different story to top of some, playing chess with his head, in a clever way for a criminal to play out his enemies by means similar to chess banks. So, all jolly swollen. But at the same time it is a painful gift that there is something terribly wrong with this story. And apart from that, it is in any case a brunt rip off in a note of cinema and books such as "Club Fight, Kill Bill, Casino, Suspiciously Safe, Snatch, Magnolia and Shachnovelle. And we do not deal with lending type here, it's a blatant flight. <br /> <br /> Which ultimately went wrong here in this movie is that the whirlwind storyline like a bom drinking on speed.If this movie was a roller coaster ride , you would have crashed into the next attraction shortly after taking. There are many twists in this movie that will never be resolved, that if it was a cocktail, you should need a life spare of neon bucket work in the heart after drinking There is nothing that has ever explained and when you finally get some hands in the direction you think it will be, you get pulled in again another .. <br /> I guess this story went anywhere on paper and Ritchy must have thought it was scary to make a movie out of it anyway, being David Lynch's next thing or something. / 10 or totally violate their own work (Ritchy: seek professional help). What could have easily been a gem instead become a comedy art-piece, food for intellectual pseudo to debate over to sundayafternoon debate-club. <br /> <br /> Spare your soul and stomach, avoid at all costs!
