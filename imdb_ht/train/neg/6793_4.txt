Gritty, Western dust from director Richard Brooks, which looks quite rude in the genre while maintaining all the usual scratches intact. Early horse rally 1900s attracted a low-loaded cowboy (Gene Hackman), a gambler (James Coburn), a kid (John Michael Vincent), and even a FEMALE (a Candice Bergen game surprise). Once the preliminaries are out of the way (with the predictable arguments about whether a woman should take part), this becomes a fairly rude entrance, though one that breaks no new ground (it instead looks like something in the Gary Cooper era). Well-looking, if overlong overlay has vane and a fine cast, but the mechanisms of the plot get tedious rather quickly. ** from ****
