The week before I saw Iowa, I saw the School of Confidential Arts, in which a pretest student made a movie and could not decide if he wanted it to be art or violent exploitation. Iowa was able to film it. I can see elements of the best movies in Iowa - File and Natural Tater were born. However, in addition to artiness, both human movies have good character development and coherent history lines. Iowa. This film will break to a late precedent. I must admit that he had consistency. This movie is bad from beginning to end and is not particularly worst or better at any party. The actors all did what they could. Roseanna Arquette deserves better. He demonstrates that he is very talented, very funny, and very sexy. But why she has to demonstrate it to this turdy ball.
