You might be tempted to rent this movie because Peter Sellers appears in it. That would be a mistake. This is one of the most pointless films ever made. I kept waiting for something funny happened, but nothing funny appeared in this movie. Even the movie industry recognized this was a very weak film and did not even try to encourage it. It's an amazing thing he has ever put on video. <br /> I ask that sort of deal that causes Sellers to be in this movie. I also ask why those responsible for this movie were allowed to go on doing other bad movies. Surely this movie is a waste of the money they use to create it, and a waste of time anyone watching it. Surely there are high school students who might write / produce a movie that as a plot.
