Another Priyadarshan / Vohra flick another film that was seen for TP rather than real desire, the only reason I saw this movie was the fact that the regulars were not in this movie (Akshay Paresh and many others ), but the useless say I had a lot of expectations from this movie. <br /> I was pleased with the casting in general except, Rajpal Yadav who once again annoys no limit, it does excite some laugh, but these were those slapstick standard non-jokes originally, in fact films This whole thing is like playing the dhol, I mean it takes hardly any talent to make loud noise, or even play the strange good beat on the dhol for a while to make it ?? It is only people who can carry different beat in a beautiful sequel way, for an extended period that is considered great. <br /> <br /> Which brings us to the other instrument, the Dumroo hardly requires any talent, it has no variation, and it can be enjoyable for a short time dancing to the monkey (hmm sound like Rajpal Yadav, good analogy ), but it's not an instrument that will entertain you for long or even get you dancing like Dhol's do. / This film was like the dhol and the dumroo played, sometimes Dhol sometimes played the dumroo, sometimes both together, but mostly the Dumroo played alone with the dancing monkey. Like any 24 year older earlier than later I was bored. The movie has some good Dhol (good) moments but after a while all I heard was the annoying Dumroo (entertaining initially, then then irritating), the big party ordinary really ensured films This is especially good for a few funny clips on "MERE BHAINS KO ANDA KYUN MARA" (if you did not watch it look at Filmy, it comes in the evenings and is really quite funny). This movie has its moments, the actors have done a great job, except Rajpal Yadav (which can act if I've seen it at Main Meri Patni ??) that annoys more than entertainment, I've been saying it's a lot of time and I'll say again I really think Sharman Joshi and Tushar Kapoor have a fine career ahead of the multi-star comedies specifically. <br /> Some scenes were really funny as attempts to embarrass them to impress their father, trying to woo the girl and taking it away from each other. <br /> But then passed ailed attempt to make this movie of more and an added mystery, meaning that once the girl was in, these 45-60 mines were increasingly tortured The highest point was "So, it was the best category," I mean what they thought if you had tense ends at least making some attempts to make it taste. The movie is also very predictable, there's hardly a scene you can not predict and you'll break into spontaneous bursting in here, and more like you see it coming and almost start laughing in front of the gag. The movie follows a gradual decline in all these films, except for the odd ball, down or up, and then rapidly tumbles down once once made friends with the girl . <br /> <br /> Most of the really bad scenes were reached in the end, one movie trying to have more than one run in the gruel comedy, too many of the jokes were very very stale and reeked in repetition , The last 10-15 has been SPECIALLY DISTATEFULL and completely SPEED MOVIE. <br /> I did not find Tanushree Datta's good mermaid, and his acting talent is in serious matter, especially in the look of non-appeal looks, if you can not be a HOT and cant acting how long you can survive. <br /> <br /> Technically, this movie was weak, with the constant gaze and lighting lighting and camera-work. <br /> <br /> The lyrics except the title titles were not good either, when the songs played in the 2nd half I could feel the collective gas of the audience. <br /> Throughout this movie, this is just ordinary simply because of the cast, and very low is waiting for it. <br /> <br /> And if she had to watch her watching on TV for free or a very cheap morning or something is a must, if you pay your full multiplex rate you'll feel ashamed. <br /> <br /> -a lot of stomach jokes, RAJPAL YADAV, LAST 45 MINS AND LAST 15 MINS SPECIAL, bad techniques, bad songs. <br /> /> + / - It's trying to be more than it was, not the regular cast (I'm happier to read), Tanushree Datta. <br /> There are some good scenes towards the start, titles, good acting and casting except RY. <br /> <br /> total 4.5 / 10 (I'm trying to target here, I do not like Rajpal Yadav or Tanushree Datta and this movie has met my very high expectations, so I give it the benefit of every doubt, on absolute theme this movie was not more than a 4)
