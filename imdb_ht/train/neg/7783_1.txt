Hey HULU.com is playing Elvira late night horror show on their site and this film is under the name Monsteroid, good fun to watch Elvira comment on this crappy movie .... Have fun with bad movies. Either way this movie really has very little value than to see how bad the 70's were for horror flicking effects, bad dialogue, just bad movie making. Avoid this unless you want to laugh at it. While you are in HULU check out the other films that are right now there are 10 episodes and some are very decent movies with good designs and outputs and you can look at them at 480p as long as you have a speed connection decan.
