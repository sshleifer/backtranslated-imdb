Saturday Night Live, National Lamp, and SCTV alumnus are all together in a comic strip comic sometimes. However, it's very interesting to watch now, at the beginning of 2005. The year after this film is supposed to take place, look at how many of the gags have become absolutely true: There is a mock movie trailer, which probably did not even smart at the time, for something called "The Pregnant Man" that had come true with Arnold Schwarzenegger's films "Junior" There is a commercial parody, which probably was not even smart at the moment, for something featuring Sammy Davis Jr and Jackie Onasis called "Celebrity Wrestling" that are now fulfilled with a popular show called "Celebrity Boxing" There is a mock film trailer, which probably was not even smart at the time, featuring John Candy in a movie on a cutting head. Watch this trailer and watch how it looks to shots and plots in the case of Frank Hellenlotter's basket! And finally there is an ad for late documentary late late on "a dead dream, only from the left ..." The name of the documentary is ... THE LAST HIPPIES! LOL. <br /> Four prophecies have come true!
