In 1972, after his wife left for her own way, Elvis Presley began dating Linda Thompson. Miss Thompson, a good-anime, long haired, beautiful, quaint beauty queen, is plotting to complete a cancellation of Elvis's life. When Elvis's divorce was final, Linda was already in place as living-in the scenario girlfriend and travel companion until 1976. <br /> <br /> This is a watchful look at love affairs with companies. Linda whole-heartedly cared for her lover needs and desires. And even set up with medicines swallow her by the handful and introduce her to her love affair with valium. At this time film is harsh and dark in heart; a very dangerous look at the 'king' and her queen. <br /> <br /> Don Johnson is absolutely awful like Elvis. Over acting in the pig is not attractive. Stephanie Zimbalist misses the class of Linda, but does the job very well. Support cast includes: John Crawford, Ruta Lee, and Rick Lenz. Watching this twice more than enough for me, but do not let this review stop you from checking it out. For most Elvis fans that I conferred with, this is not a favored presentation.
