This Italian film is basically a soap opera and skin. <br /> The VHS box said it was rated "R", but in the on the actual tape said it was "X." The letter makes a lot more sense because there is a short scene near the end that was shocking. Even in the dark, you could see Dutch actress Marishcka Detmers doing all the sex on this guy - and, yes, you could see her penis in her mouth. I read somewhere that this was the first time a "main actress" did something like this on screen. <br /> <br /> Detmers parade around the nude on several scenes but his face was even better than his body. She looks beautiful. Unfortunately, the movie is ugly ... a real waste of time and certainly does not recommend despite Detmers' looks.
