If I could give this movie a real rating, it would likely be the fewer numbers. While I respect the fact that someone has kept doing these terrible "horror" films, seriously, people, buying a ticket for this movie is a waste of money you could spend on something far more worth your time. <br /> <Although being a horror movie, nothing is scary about it, unless the idea of ​​how much horror resonates you can fit into one awesome movie. If the rating was higher, it probably would make for a better movie in the long run. Who made this version of "Prom Night", you screwed up. The actors can probably have done a decent job if it was not for the scripting questionable. This was a terrible waste on a movie tour. I would soon go and see "One Missed Call" again, at least that was some scheme.
