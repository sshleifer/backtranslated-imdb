Worry IMDb does not allow me to lower Judge below 1. What a shame. This horrible film is so bad that I actually turn things off sent well before the finish. The script had a bright moment, but the directing, editing, acting, audio quality, and specially distribution of line delivery was so abhorrent as to make the whole unbeatable judge. Judge was released as a modern day comic book Western style, but in reality was not anything of the sort. What it is favorite is pop dog on the bottom of your shoes. You can try to pretend it is okay, but it just keeps on stinking. <br /> Why video store thinks it is okay to bring this kind of crap with constant gaps in the audio and worse than high class drama drama acts beyond me. We rent movies in order to see something better than what's on TV. But judges are worse than the original original SciFi Channel. I intend to ask my money back from Hollywood Video.
