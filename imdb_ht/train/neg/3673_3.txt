William Hurt diving scientist diving ??? US agent runs the investigation abroad? The sick who contaminates people kicking off after falling 20 feet on his back and running away? Sniper is missing and does not kill Hurt (just wounds him) but the second "kill" shot dead? Lose time. To compare this fall down as other evaluators made is ridiculous. Oh and at the end of the movie they decided to start wearing gloves on their hands except for the "wrong" agent and Hurt decided to kill him by giving him the "virus negotiation". What? BTW ... when did IMDb require 10 text lines? I'm just babbling here. Do not this just dillute the content of review if you have to have x amount in line?
