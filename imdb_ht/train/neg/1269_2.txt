This series gets 2 stars only because it puts some of Dickens' weak House on film and maybe someone reads the book. Unlike what probably got opinion, Diana Rigg was poor as Lady Dedlock. It was clunky and wooden. Lady D. is a reserved character, but not a martinet. Denhl Elliot is wrong, wrong, for Mr. Jarndyce. So I will interrupt myself and respond to all those who are saying: "I did not read the book, so I do not have to take this guy's opinion because he based his assessment on the book." True and not true. For the past, Diana Rigg is bad in her role because of poor acting whether you have read the book. On the other hand, Denholm Elliot is a Jarndyce beam (although too old). The series fails not because it is unfair to compare it in the book, but because the line draws various and characters just by koalesce make a common, dramatic, mysterious and compassionate. It is dull and flat. If you want to make proper Appropriate Good Door, you need to spend 20 hours of film in 10 episodes of time. But I suggest producers etc. leaving Dickens alone (even A Christmas Carol). Television killed the genius of Dickens as manifested in his spirit cemetery and unforgettable characters.
