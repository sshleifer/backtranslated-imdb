The three-part film "movie" and some guys in a rising home rally encompass the viewer by going "out" and (unfortunately) giving us three proven stories why. <br /> <br /> The first story involves a young couple in a car crash that meets up with two psychos. It leads to totally predictable twists. Still, it's fast (about 15 minutes), violent, well-done and well-done. Predictably handsome. <br /> The second involves a man on the run after stealing a large amount of money. His car broke down, he was attacked by a dog and stumbled at a nearby clinic. VERY obvious, seriously done and very slow. Even in 30 minutes is too long. Good act though. The third is just barely a horror story. It involves a beautiful, lonely woman looking for Mr. Right. She has beautiful series designs, a beautiful erotic feel and a beautiful sex scene. But (yet) predictable and not even scary distance .. <br /> It ends pretty stupid. <br /> In all, the first one is worth watching, but that's it. Tune in for one then turn it off.
