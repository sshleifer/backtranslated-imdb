I've seen virtually no type of redemption in this film. The only thing I've seen was Quentin Tarantino's precedent mania for her ... There were some attractive women in this film and maybe that's just one decent quality. In general however, I found this movie surrealistic and ridiculous. The film was held well coupled with slow motion and other startup cinemas I found clumsy and dizzying, even disgusting. Overall the widespread music was awful and repetitive in the extreme as well reminded me of the psychological war of the US military against various malcontents.

A depression movie (not a true _film, a theme I reserve for true art) that leaves me with a bad feeling. Do not believe the various people who try and turn this as a "romantic comedy" though there are certainly isolated elements in both of this film repudiates in the content, form, and conclusions of any association with this genre. suggest staying far beyond the seemingly overwhelming positive opinions of IMDb and other sources of evaluation.
