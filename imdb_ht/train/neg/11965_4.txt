As a black story that is particularly interested in this particular historical event, I was very disappointed with the movie. Granted, costumes and staging were authentic, but Hollywood's portrayal of this "British Little Big Horn" was really boring. <br /> <br /> The amount of footage dedicated to market troops or parades has been unprecedented in film history. Eveytime I heard the triumphant background music begin, I knew I had to prepare myself for another worker in filler. Obviously, the producers invested heavily in "Platform" and were determined to get their money value. Despite the exceptional cast, dialogue was, again, boring and the characters never developed. Every time Peter O'toole or Burt Lancaster finished a scene, I would be discouraged and disappointed. The given lines were so weak and meaningless that I could hardly believe these were the same of the great actors depicting Lawrence of Arabia and the bird man in Alcatraz respectively. <br /> <br /> There is worse era, but this one is not much better.
