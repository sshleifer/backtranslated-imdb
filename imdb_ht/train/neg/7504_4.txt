I'm afraid I do not agree with the majority. I found Spike Lee the last a bit boring weeer! Although it was trying something different, it means not just documenting the rise and fall of the serial killer, I do not think it worked too well. There's really a bit too much going on - Vinny (Jan Leguizamo) and Dionna (Mira Sorvino) relationships, Ritchie's form (Adrien Brody) and then the local mafia types. The story is good, but at the end of this all you have - 2 or 3 stories. With such a provocative killer could Mr Lee not put more of that side of the movie? > <br /> <br /> There are some good points though. All the scenes with David Berkowitz's killers 'Pit of Sam' look very nice (saturation color saturation ...) and the act is very good at all .. <br /> Overall I felt that the different stories would have worked well on their own or other people without the killings. It just was not strong enough at the end. <br /> <br />
