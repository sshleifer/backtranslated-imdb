DeNiro is a master ... one of my favorites. And I like good sports movies {not in baseball, but hey, its sports movies, right? I waited more for this movie. It seems to start out well: DeNiro is what I hope, Snipes {who I really do not like} is very good as the spoiled star. Barkin's role, for me, was OK. She is a good actress but seemed out of place in this role. For me, they always seemed to run the scenes, and then it dragged somewhere in place. It just seemed my tio to be so unmatched! Considering the cast and the plot, it could be so much better. I rated it a '4', and I was being generous ~ I'm one hard with numbers!
