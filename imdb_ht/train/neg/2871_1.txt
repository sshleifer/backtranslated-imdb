I rent this horrible movie. The worst thoughts I've ever seen. I believe that a 1st grade could be a better job. The movie got worse I ever saw and I saw some bad people. There is nothing to fear except I pay 1.50 for renting it and that was 1.49 too much. The act is horrible, the characters are getting worse and the movie is just a piece of waste. The slut performer is to give the budget to a B look as an Oscar candidate. All I can say is if your wnat wasted a good evening and a little money going to rent this terrible cops. I'd rather watch monkey soldiers from outer space while sitting in a bucket of razor than sitting in this flop again
