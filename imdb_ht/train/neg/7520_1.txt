This movie proves that you can not judge a movie by the awesome job on the DVD cover. He also shows that you should learn more about a movie before you buy it (or get it for someone at Christmas). The beginning of this movie actually looks a bit promising. Well, until you meet the characters. Pumpkin Jack (the old guy from the street) brings the college to eds a book full of spell the witch that he leaves in the annual annual homes (where the movie takes place). And there are some drinks, battles, and core core core. Then the action of the movie finally takes place after an hour. <br /> <br /> In general, Hallow's end was predictable, unspensful, and reminiscent of a soft-core porn. This film is probably best seen with a group of friends who has nothing better to do, as it is a good movie to make fun of. And for first time viewers, it's really fun to make predictions in the order of the dead.
