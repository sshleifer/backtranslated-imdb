Really, I can not believe I've spent $ 5 on this movie. I'm a big zombie fan and think the movie might not be bad. It has zombies in it right? I was wrong! To be honest the movie was her moment ... I thought it was cool when the guy got his head torn off but that was on it. Overall I think it would be more enjoyable to slip down a razorblade slide over my dark in a battery of vinegar then watch this movie again. The film could be best if we could see some boob but I had to watch the trailer for other movies produced by this company to see it. Buyers are careful ... unless you are in masochism.
