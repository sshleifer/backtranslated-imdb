Parasomnia has an interesting site, but the story is wrong without any tension or even a logical approach. The compassionate cast, even Patrick Kilpatrick, played great roles in movies like Scanner Cop 2, Fire Fire, under Siege 2 and eraser. The rest of the cast is unknown (and not very good) with the exception of Jeffrey Combs. (Herbert West from the great Re-Animator trilogy). But it can play roles like this in his sleep (which is a little what he does here). The main problem is that the actions of the characters do not make sense at all. The story is rather dull and predictable with good computer effects mixed with some concept scenes, especially in the end. <br /> <br /> This could be so much better, I do not get the good reviews on this one. It is below average.
