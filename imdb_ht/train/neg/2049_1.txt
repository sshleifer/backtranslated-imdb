At least I could enjoy mocking the movie that is surprising since I was barely able to sit in it. In all honesty, I guess the coverage of the DVD case costs more than the entire movie. He says he is the director of the same as Boogeyman, when a new version of just came out ... nice touch touch, he was deceiving enough to code me in. The only thing that frustrated me over the obnoxious act The copycat was itself. Usually you only see that the kind of hair of a ten old boy and the character acted like it. The film looks like she's shot by a D + grad student in some film schools excited to use each movie technique she ever learned while going to class .... sometimes less is more friends. Through out I would get lost by random plotting plots that have led nowhere or have been unreasonable. All this makes a movie bad but when the finish does not even come close to pull it together, well, making it an exceptionally bad movie. Without a doubt this is the worst movie I've ever seen, including my French final friends for high school years in high school, but hey maybe I'm somewhat partial, i mean i did to play an extra. P.S. I do not even think this deserves a star ... not even a half. NO TO YOU !!
