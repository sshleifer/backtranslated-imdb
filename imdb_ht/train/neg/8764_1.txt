This film was absolute torture. First of all, it's a whopping 4 + hour long! True, the Kargil war may have been several points that were captured and fighting for, but each one of these battles did not need to be shown. So maybe this is a documentary, not a commercial film as published. Make sure you did not seem like it, as enough background information was not given and there were some flaws. The battle sequences were so badly executed. I'm very shamed from the man who gave well to the Border sequence. Each battle was the same as the previous one. It was so predictable. (This would be a spoiler.) The whole army is walking hard, five or so cursed soldiers five thousand times each (they also use the same cussword every time), one of the lead actors is shooting, someone yells a bed, the actor said, "No, do not get a bed that will take 6 guys out of the battalion," and then a dead actor. That exact same thing happens on and over and over again. Oh, and the songs are so bad and long. Throwing in the movie is too big for its own good. Despite such a long film, none of the characters have been well developed. The actresses had the most miniscule roles. They are all dressed and described to be the same. Two of them were crying to synchronize. It was so funny. They moved their hands and heads in the exact same time and then dupatta bit together. The list just goes over and over. I know I always forget something. Anyways, I think I've bashed the movie enough to get the picture.
