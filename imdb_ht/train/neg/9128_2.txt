Though one did not realize that Sellers was in poor health at the time of filming and passed away before releasing the film, FIENN MORE in DR. FU MANCHU should be painful to look. It is allegedly a lamp in the famous Rohmer Sax Rohmer mechanic but it lacks any focus. The potential for satirical comments on the anti-Oriental obscenities in Rohmer's concept are ignored. Indeed, the film of insult racists. There are hardly any actual jokes or gags, just mostly actors who behave idiotically and spouting sad lines. It's mostly distressing to see South Caesar force them to curse racial and slabs to try to laugh. Most of the other actors embarrass themselves as well. <br /> Then there's Peter Sellers. He plays the double roles of Fu Manchu's disaster, who tries to challenge a formula to regain his youth, and struggles to continuously British Nayland Smith. Sellers are not one hundred percent bad; He translates an original heat as Smith when he describes his fetishist attachment to his lawn mower and is strangely moving as Manchu when he expresses his love for English music music entertainment. But most of the time, he plays both roles and a weary grimace, thus more sabotage any comic possibilities. Server 'Sellers' where he revitalizes his manic power and electric shocks are particularly deforatory; It seems too convincingly agonizing to be funny. <br /> <br /> A really really witty line, a bit slapstick by Burt Kwouk (Cato in PINK PANTHER movie) as one of Manchu's minions, and the music of Helen Mirren's fun music can not be wild to this mess. If anyone wants to understand why Peter Sellers considers a comedy genius, they will not learn anything at FIENDISH in DR. FU MANCHU.
