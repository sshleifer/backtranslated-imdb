This weak film shows that not even some of the best gollywood can salvage a true landfill deposit .. I could spend a lot of time describing everything that was bad about the effort, but that would require more time and I'm already wasting 91 minutes watching IT. <br /> <br /> Look at it now, after Brando's death, showing how tragic the life of one of our greatest actors has become. Donald Sutherland? Why? <br /> I have to fill out more lines to get that. I have to fill out more lines to get that. I have to fill out more lines to get that. <br /> Do not waste your time with this movie. I'm late doing something interesting. Bye.
