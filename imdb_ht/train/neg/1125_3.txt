I went to school with Jeremy Earl, so I heard of this film, I'm not really sure if he was in the theater at all. I do not remember the name. I've seen it, it's like one of those after school specialties. The act is OK, not great. The plot was kind of weak and the lines were beautiful corals. So the only comment I can give this movie is "Eh" I borrowed the movie from Jeremy, if I was in a movie rental location, this is one that I would walk past and after watching I would not recommend it to any past than middle school age. I've also noticed that many times when urban kids described, the jargon is overused or just outdated. Often I think what makes the characters incredible.
