Do not get me wrong, I suppose this movie should be stupid, I honestly do, I gave it an incredibly low standard to meet. The only reason I even saw was because there was a bunch of girls going (different stories for a different time). As I started watching I noticed something, this film was awful. Now there are two terrible types, Freddy vs. terrible Jason, where you and your friends sit and laugh with jokes about how horrible it is, and then there is a movie like this. The Cat in the Hat failed to create even a momentous interest in me. As I watched the first piece of it not only I was bored unreasonably, but I felt as if I was in some ways being raped by the horrendous of said movie. Mike Myers is virtually brilliant, I love most of her work, but something in this movie did not click. One of the things that the directors / producers / writers / whatevers changed was that they refused to use any of the colors of the original book (red, black, white) on any character but the cat. Maybe or not, they also refused to take any of the original (and I hate to use that word, but it fits) zaniness in the original. The book was like a Sunday ice cream, colorful and delicious, and the film was over as tough and tough to swallow as sawdust. <br /> <br /> Avoid this as a whore whore.
