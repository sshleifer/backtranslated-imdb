My head above says it all. Let me do it more clearly. If you've seen the BBC "Planet Earth", which I'm sure most of you have, then you will not like this movie too much. And I own all the discs in "Planet Earth" I saw the rating for this movie very high, and it's good to review it. I was excited to check it out. <br /> <br /> Alas, I went to the theater and the movie started, I saw it was a Disney movie and BBC production productions company and Discovery. When they first started the scenes on the Polar Bear, I recognized them in my DVDs at the home of "Planet Earth". The movie continues, it goes on and on, on me and my friends keep on recognizing the scenes were all from "Planet Earth". We were very pretty disappointed, as I think 90% of the footage is from "Planet Earth". I say 90%, because some of the scenes I did not recognize. I have a feeling that I simply did not remember them. So, ultimately what this film really is a compilation of different feet from the different discs of "Planet Earth", and a narration aimed at children. Yes, the narration is quite tricky. Let me give you an example. When the polar pubes are shown walking away from mother's mother, the narrator says "The polar trees are not like human kids .. They do not always listen to their mothers" (I do not remember the exact words, but this is how it is) so in a nutshell. This is condensed "Planet Earth" for kids!
