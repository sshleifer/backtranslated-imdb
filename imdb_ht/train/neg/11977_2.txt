Roy Rogers and companies try to bring "Sintown" back to life - it's a ghost city that can go boom if silver mines are successful. Andy Devine (as "cookies") slapsticks around. Jane Frazee (as Carol) lost a piece of his bitches to Mr. Rogers' sharpness. Foy Willing and the Riders in the Sage Violet stand-in (or, is that the song?) For A.W.O.L. Bob Nolan and his son pioneers. James Finlayson (from the Laurel and Hardy films) adds to the "slapstick" look at "Grand Canyon Trail". A loose floor board delivers comedy performance. Mr. Devine's gentleman is envious of his heels. There is energetic human performance, too - but the material is not great. <br /> <br /> ** Grand Canyon Trail (1948) William Witney ~ Roy Rogers, Jane Frazee, Andy Devine
