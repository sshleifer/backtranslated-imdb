On time to release this movie on DVD. I know some say WB hurried the release of this movie because of the movie Dreamgirls. But how can you quickly rush into a movie that has been in your catalog since 1976. <br /> <br /> I'm very disappointed with the DVD release of this movie, there is no special feature, no 5.1 DD sound . Come on WB, you can do better then this. Quality audio and photos on this movie need some reliable help. WB WB did not set time to watch for this movie because it is a black film and I have okay sales. They could keep the CD in the dose path there are not all the original CD songs there. <br /> I would recommend this DVD to buy. Yes, because it is a classic movie. But WB needs to add some more special features. Take notes from other group movies, Five Heat, or Temptation you can see just the performance, and the sound on both of them is great, much better than this DVD.
