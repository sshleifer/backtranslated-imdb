I picked up this movie with the intention of finding a bad movie movie. But I had no idea what I got myself to enter .. <br /> I started the movie and soon I was pulling in a world of pain and visual torture. <br /> I finally know what hell is like. Read this movie. For eternity. This film has no value. It did not even really have a draw. There were things going on in every scene, but there is no general explanation why anything happens. <br /> Instead of watching this movie I suggest that you are the nearest greener and olive oil and try and stuff like many bullets in it as you can. You will find that the result to be far more beautiful than this movie. <br /> <br /> Do not even look at it. Do not even see how bad it is. I beg you. If you look at it, then it means they have.
