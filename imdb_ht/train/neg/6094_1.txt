I was hugely convinced to write this review for a number of reasons: <br /> 1) This is, undoubtedly, the worst movie I've ever seen 2) Unless it gets more revised it will not be list all the times the worst movie list - which she deserves to be 3) I was a bit lucky - I paid five books for her. I saw it in the shop for 15 pounds. DO NOT DO IT FOR THIS FILM! You will be very upset 4) There are a lot of films out there in the horror genre that do not give a fair rating (in my opinion) and give this movie a rating that is higher than criminals <br /> Summary of conspiracy to: a guy with no friends meeting a tramp that promises the world - well, the magic ability to appear in everyone else as someone else. Our hero hurries turning into a young girl and joins the gangs - sitting on swing, baby-sitting. He killed them one by one until he was tracked and found by the police. <br /> <br /> Why is it so bad? To begin with the act is very pretty bad. Another person compared it to a school production. No, this is worse than any act I've seen on a school stage. <br /> I bought a number of these movies already banned from the company Vipco DVD and were not as disappointed as I was in this. Okay, the act is bad, but the movie fails to deliver in every other sense. What was the point of making this movie when there is no same gore! Okay, there is no gore. What else can a movie like this offer? Brazil? No, not even any titles! <br /> it's true this movie can have a certain charm of its unique naffness, but any potential buyer / watchman in this movie should be fairly advised that this film is, at best, worth just a salt from ten.
