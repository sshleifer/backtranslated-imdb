This must be accompanied by a special rating and warning: NOT RECOMMENDED FOR NORMAL. <br /> <br /> The mania of Daneliuc and the most dirty body functions come here a real nightmare. Also, it is obvious that the man is a misanthropic, he hated everybody - his country his people, his actors, his work. And this hatred made him blind and he forgot the profession he knew long ago. This so-called "movie" is just a hideous string of disgusting images, with no artistic value and no professional knowledge. It is an insult to good taste and good sense. Shame, shame, shame!
