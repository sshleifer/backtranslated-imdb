This film features Ben Chaplin as a bank employee bored in England who orders a mail order voucher from Russia, receives Nicole Kidman in the mail and gets more than he negotiates for air, surprise, it is not what it appears to be. The story is fairly predictable and Chaplin has suffered too much from the point where it gets somewhat annuities. Kidman is actually rather good in this role, making her character on the only thing in this exciting movie. GRADE: C
