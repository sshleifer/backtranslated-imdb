Snow White is in my opinion a bad movie about an artistic point of view. The draw is pretty much foreseeable, the characters are stereotypes, the correction is too exaggerated. Anyway, the film does not seem to have much artistic ambitions. <br /> <br /> Instead, I think this is something right to trade. Including a character in the French part of Switzerland (the actor is the leader of the band it is touring and in the movie - called the SENS UNIK band) seems aimed at a major audience. A German-Swiss film cinema would not be sold in the French - and vice versa. What really got on my nerves was placement to produce all over the movie. Sometines scenes are remembered by clips of clips! I also think that the topic of "young people taking drugs without any other purpose in life" is a wide spread of reality in Zurich. Therefore, it should be devised with more care. I hope Samir has had enough money and white snow, in order that his next movie will show its true artistic skills.
