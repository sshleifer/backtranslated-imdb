First of all I just meant that I love this show !!! But this episode ... This episode makes a mockery of the show all. <br /> I do not know what they tried to achieve with this episode but they successfully created the WORST episode of the whole series. <br /> There is no story line, everything is chaotic and the jokes ..... are crap. The way they tried to answer some of the remaining questions in the game. .... For example "how the furlings alike" does not create that stupid "already on ..." ...... is simply embarrassing. <br /> It's clear that the writers are running out of mind and that's really too bad.
