Governor (Maria Kraakman - Belgium / Netherlands 2005). The mousy Maria Kraakman plays Anna, a woman in her thirties, who finds out her husband (Fedja van Huet) is cheating on her but she does not dare to confront her. She suffers from avoiding any confrontation with human beings, her parents as well as her sister, so we have a main character in a feature film that does not do much at all. We barely know anything about his background or motivation. Just a woman who seems to be stuck in a blind eye, not only during this difficult episode of her life. It obviously suffers from something, but why are we at the hearing also suffered? <br /> I almost gave up on movies after seeing this unwatchable mess. These were a very dull and painful 90 minutes. Normally I try to avoid wasting energy on doing bad films. I'll take the beat and roll with the punches, but in this case a fair warning is in place. How did Earth Nanouk Leopold get funding (in large part of publicly funded money) for this turkey? Obviously, there was no script to speak. It might be rewarded by an ingenious cinema and cinematic idea or a cast and only a little more appealing. None regardless, just a concept vaguely defined, "I want to do something from a woman's point of view". The result is an insult rather than a tribute to a female perspective on life. <br /> To make things worse, there's not an interesting shot to be found in the entire movie. I can not think of a cast that could be sliced ​​this one up, but Johanna Ter Steege is a (small) light in the dark, if possible with the lack of this material. I'm trying to imagine how Leopold tried to direct Maria Kraakman: "Maria, look at the horizon, we'll film you for three minutes, just express sadness." A perfect healing for insomnia. Get a copy and watch this late at night, also guarantee putting you to sleep. <br /> <br /> Camera Obscura --- 1/10
