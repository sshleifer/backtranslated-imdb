I think they really let the quality of DVD production get away from them. I rented this DVD from 2 movie stores and the second time I finally got it to play on the 3rd DVD player I tried. Anyone who has this problem? It's really hard to give the movie an unpartial review after going into such a hassle to play it. For one, I never saw a Finnish horror movie before I was sort of bummed that the movie was done in English. Also since it never makes clear what is wrong with Sarah, she just came over as retarded and that's why I really just hoped that someone would shoot him in the face and make all these terrible things go away.
