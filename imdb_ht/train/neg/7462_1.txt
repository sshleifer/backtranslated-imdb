Directions must be the problem here. I recently heard John Cleese talking about working a bike for Fawlty Towers. He was supposed to attack his car with a branch. The first branch was too flimsy and not funny. The second branch was too stiff to be funny. The third was just flimsy enough to be funny. This sort of attention to the details of "Corky Romano". No matter how embarrassingly unfunny a bit funny was, it was not fixed, and was not left on the chairs room off. The one value I can find in this movie is as a study of a highly flawed movie that somehow escapes to the distribution without repair. <br /> I have scanned dozens of other reviews here. The number of reviews that praised this absolute waste in my suspected bolsters time is that some people are getting paid to promote titles. I can not understand how anyone 9 years old might like this title more than a 4, MAX. I mean, come on, 5 is average. I can not imagine anyone, even those who make money off of this, rating it as much as average. <br /> This makes my list of 10 worst movies of all time. And, hey, I actually love the three stooges and can even tolerate Ed Wood!
