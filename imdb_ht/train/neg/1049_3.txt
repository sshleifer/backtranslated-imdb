This movie has a very Broadway feel - the series, acting, 'the noise' - and yet that's all it has. Some 'sense' of a Broadway without the bang. The movie is slow-paced, the picture is disjointed, the song 'pops up' on you so that you suddenly remember it's a music. <br /> <br /> Intolerable: The Sinatra's fianc√© --- surely, the pitch and the accent of voice was needed. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Jean Simmons looks like Vivien Leigh in his Havana scene. It's the bone structure! How would I have killed Miss Leigh's role in Brando's challenge?
