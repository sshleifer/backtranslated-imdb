I saw this movie last night after many reviews from many sources. I would like to point out that if you are not ready to try and work out continuously who and what it all means you will hate this movie. <br /> I'm still struggling to understand the role of the actors in this movie, the movie jumping out of different stories and not allowing you to really scenario with any of their roles. <br /> <br /> For the political rafters and people interested in corruption in other governments world out of this movie is probably quite good, but in the movie movie this movie is awkward, very boring in place and you will leave the movie confused and annoyed by paying the entry fee. <br /> <br /> See it if you are ready to focus 100% on every minute details or your political interest. Do not see it, if you actually like to watch movie.
