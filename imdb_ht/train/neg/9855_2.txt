Let me start by saying I'm a fan of great fantasy. However, this film is not for me. Many distant arguments are trying to support this film claim that dragons possibly ever exist. The film mentions connections in different stories from different countries but neglected to investigate them better, which could give the film some credibility. The movie uses (beautiful!) CGI tells us a storyline story telling about a young dragon's life. This is combined with popular TV-show-CSI-style flash-forwards making it something scientific, which it is definitely not. In many cases arguments / clues are far-fetched. In some cases, clues used to display dragons possibly existed, or flying, or spit fire are simply invalid. To see this just make me get cramps in my toes. Even a fantasy film needs some degree of reality in it, but this one just does not have it. Bottom line: it's a documentary fantasy-CSI documentary, not worth seeing.
