What a bad movie, bad! I tried to look without quickly send ... That fails. After 30 minutes I stopped the movie, I went online to see how many minutes this disaster was. (Only 84 minutes, Whew!) It was a confusing, boring film. I do not think anyone can get knocked down by getting hit with a fluorescent bulb much less boned by one !! One funny thing is that I watch the "Killer Cut" version of the movie. The box boldly says "more blood!" "More Sex!" "More Terror than released in theaters!" Yikes! If this film was awful and all those claims I just asked how the lame "UN-cutter killer" was ??? If you want to see a great movie about the world of living and the world in view of dying any of the night in the dead dead series !!
