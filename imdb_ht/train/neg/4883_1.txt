During the cheap movie at the beginning of Ethel II's fat erection, I wondered if it was the same film on the cover. Unfortunately, it was. The story itself is mindlessly simple. Etel, a homicidal maniac and a food disorder, is released in a half home because of too much hospitalization. It is by far the most toughest list of residents while one man puts dead flies in another's soup. Ethel then teased by one of the half-staff housed with a chocolate bar after it hit the price measuring measures for eating the resident dogs. Ethel retaliates by strangling her with a wire nest on the stairs and then .... well, you get the idea. If this sounds like fun, it's not. This film was wrong with cheap and even worse action. Characters are so wooden when delivering the lines that should stand out in front of a cigar store. To make matters worse, half of the film consists of the first album of the Ethel movie, Crazy Criminals, which is little better. A very effective effort.
