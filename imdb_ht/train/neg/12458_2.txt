This movie movie is so simple and obvious that only a Texas high millionaire on smoke oil and whiskey would have a problem understanding it if someone called it around the Provencal Parking. In summary: The oil business is in cahoots and the Government (or Gummint if you prefer), the Gummint is in cahoots and the Middle East despot, and the CIA is a feasible peasant pool of double dealing-in- (insert word ) wants Toe any line that comes their way. The only people who get over are the ones that are good, like Mr Clooney ("Bob"). Oh, and terrorism is a result of the globalization that creates when multinational wicked people turn the world looking for a tasty or three control. This really fits in the profiles of well-heeled 9/11 authors of crime. <br /> In Syrian this easy tissue in half-truth politics and Hollywood holograms is head up in a reprehensible version of the history section that twists, turns and whirlwinds into the gloopy circles of their own insignificance until the poor viewer leaves alone read with the conclusion: <br /> <br /> 1. The "director" (good joke) should never be near a camera again <br /> <br /> 2. people like Clooney and Hurt ta can know how to act, but be sure to know how to choose a script <br /> <br /> 3. if you want to see a movie that deals with corruption in big business and state, go and see Claude The Chabrol "L'ivresse du duvoir", which is insightful, funny and brilliant acting. <br /> Empty, bankruptcy-host synthetic piffle sharpened from evening-damaged length.
