I do not know how to describe this movie. It's definitely one of the weird movies I've seen in a long time. It's very disturbing at times but also boring in other places. The scene of dental turtles is very elaborate and can attract anyone in Gore & Splatter. I found myself holding my teeth while some of the aforementioned scenes. The smart thing about the movie is that it plays with our fears and the dentist is therefore quite unsettling. The humor of the movie is somehow hidden and should not be recognized by everyone. But if you are a fan of strange and unusual and dancing entertainment driven to drown in this dirt is just the movie you were looking for. <br /> If you read the comment and feel somehow to attract this kind of entertainment, give it a try! <br /> Rating: 4/10 (maybe a little too weird for my taste)
