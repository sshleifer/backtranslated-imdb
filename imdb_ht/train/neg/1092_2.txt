Well, I would like good news about William Winckler in 2001, the "Double-D Avenger", is that he managed to unite three of Russ Meyer's seafarers - Kitten Natividad, Haji and Raven of the Croix - in one photo . (I can only assume that Lorna Maitland, Tura Satan and Babette Bardot took care of this week's shot ... or else managed to see a copy of the script in advance!) The bad news, though (and there are lots of it), that this movie - if it can even call it, shot straight into video - is a complete misfire, a total abortion, an out-and-out athmosphere, an absolute abomination, and truly one of the The worst picture I've ever seen. Look no further for the superhero lamest film ever made! The plot here, as it is, deals with Kitten takes over power after cutting off the unusual cockazilla plant in South America to cure her breast cancer (OI), and later fighting a trio of bikini dancer back to LA too bad that every guy tram jokes trot comes out completely (you should forgive the expression) flat, saying that there is zero current current in the movie at all (other than some old pictures of cats in the great day of his glory) , and that some cream creams and a paper-boulder bottle are the sum total of the special FX. Meyer gals here is briefly in the teeth / saggy of the chest and put it well, although Sheri Dawn Thomas, like Bobby Oobo Boobies (!), Managing, uh, stands out nicely. So why did I give this juvenile, unfunny, failed to embarrassment to a movie 2 star instead of 1? To be succinct: Joe Bob Briggs. Book-voices in the special features of the DVD I just look is absolutely hilarious, especially when it pulls out around 100 synonyms for the word "breast" of the 1,000 on its website "Canonical Hooters List." The man is a national treasure, and he manages to upgrade this skeet into a coaster statue disc!
