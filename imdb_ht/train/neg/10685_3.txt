Predictably, hackneyed & wrong writing. Unfortunately I was thinking of such an important cast should not be involved unless it has merit. I guess competition between actors is so intense these days (and will only get worse) that one can not pick and choose much more. Early on we gave an inkling that was instrumental in the assassination and we had it rammed down our throat ever since. The film was missing intrigue, which gave us little insight into the victim and only one possible motive for the murder. Some of the speeches were, frankly, embarrassing! It is difficult to believe that anyone would even consider, let alone commit, spending tens of millions of dollars doing this trick.
