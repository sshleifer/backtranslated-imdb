Lindsay Anderson has been a lot of European film makers, whereas David Lean, Ridley Scott and Alan Parker make spectacular scenes that involve Anderson's sophisticated visions of social and subtext, so much so the message often ends up taking on the entire movie Whole main function should entertain the audience <br /> <br /> What do you think of SI coming down to what you think of British movie makers. I'm very much in view of what movies would be a universal means (the best British movie made are people who try to emulate Hollywood in my opinion), if you want to send a message trying to express ponies, and I get the dated movie , pretense and too much in the 1960s. 1968 was summer love and years of student rebellion in France. You can imagine each left one left French adore this movie especially the climax. French new wave makers will also admire surrealism in some scenes but an international mainstream will flu, and many will fluently intensify it
