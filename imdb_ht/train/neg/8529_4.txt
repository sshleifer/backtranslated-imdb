What the MGM Boob thought it would be a good idea to put the Clark Gulf studly in the role of a Salvation Army Worker ?? Ironically enough, another nice star in the future, Cary Grant, also played a salary Salvation guy just two years later in the SHAT highly transferred to doing it wrong. I guess in hindsight it's pretty easy to see the craziness of those roles, but I always wonder who WHO thinks that Mr. Salvation Room is "HOT" and who can look at these superbly guys and see them as realistic representations at the parties they played. A long time ago, I used to work for a sister organization in the Salvation Army (Volunteers in America) and I never saw anyone who has studied the work (and including me, unfortunately). Perhaps I should have gotten a job with Salvation Army instead! <br /> So, for the very curious, this is a good movie to look out for, but for everyone else, it's poor writing, dialogue dialogue and harassing moralizing for a very slow movie.
