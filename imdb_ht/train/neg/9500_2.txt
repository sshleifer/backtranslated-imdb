This movie is really bad. The act is terrible terrible except Michael Ironside. I did not find the story. Richard Grieco is the only survivor after a battle between Mc-gang. He comes in a city and suddenly he chooses to fight the bad people who want Indian countries. In the cover he said he was an American himself who had come back home-town, and I did not hear it in the movie, if so it was not clear. <br /> <br /> Richard Grieco was one hell of a bad actor. Hard and ugly. She told her line as she too. And we would not talk about Sean Young, he was none of my favorite actors, but in this movie she plays an American woman who fell in love with Bolt (Grieco). It is terrible. <br /> When I rent it I choose between this and subterfuge with Amanda straw. I chose this one because of Michael Ironside was in the cast. Perhaps I should have taken Subterfuge. <br /> <br /> Do not see this unless you think Richard Grieco looks tough on a motorcycle and sunglasses. <br /> I'll soon uptade the list to cast because I have it at home. I wrote it after I saw the movie.
