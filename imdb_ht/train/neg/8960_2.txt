The only thing that often pops in my mind while writing this review is, I will never get this hour and back a half !!! to show that I'm not just blowing when, I'll compare the movie to the other movies of the cubic trilogy (cubes and hypercube)! Cub was not great but it was original and made up for some technical flaws! hypercube as an end to losing the advantage of originality but it came out looking pretty sharp and I liked it better than the cube (the story was the best)! but zero cubes in comparison to the previous ones really is not worth sh * t! a complete lack of good fx, a very f * ck * d up script and just plain old bad act does not combine well! example: all the while during the movie I thought it would be incredibly stupid if ... should happen and then it would happen, so it's not very original nor! My advice: Do not lose this hour and a half I lose !!!!!!!! oh and i hope this movie crash and burn !!!!!!!
