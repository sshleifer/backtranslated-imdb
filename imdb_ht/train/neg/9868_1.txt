I almost never commented on movies, but I saw the 5 glowing reviews of "this movie" and decided I was squeezing in with my own review. An instructor of mine received this film in the mail, mixed in with his Academy Screeners (AMPAS, aka the guys who voted on the Oscars), and was thus flooring and how terribly constructed this film was that he brought him to our class Demonstrate us how not to put together a movie. <br /> <br /> This movie has no draw, the scenes are horribly, horribly edited (often using photo-in-photo "photo" photo technique), and performance (particularly the lead , which even failed to act as a bad actress) for the most part, obnoxious. Someone really failed to understand the point of an introduction, namely, setting up the scheme. There is no setup! Half of the movie neither I nor the rest of the class knew that this movie was supposed to be over. The shot technique shot, which sets up some kind of murder, never addresses, and now that I think about it, were perhaps meant to be a flash-forward, with the rest of the movie being a rbits, but it cuts out that scene directly to the next without any indication as such. <br /> <br /> I could really go over and over. At least so much, this movie gives me renewed confidence in my own film-making ability.
