<br /> This movie (not a movie - clearly recorded on a cheap cam-corder) can be one of the biggest cinematic stink bombs in history. Beware: The packaging announces the flashlight as an erotic exploration of sex-addicted. The film is not an exploration of anything, and it is no more erotic than staring at one's own veris. The script is pointless and sharp, and all the trace elements that serve as segregation between sex scenes are supposed to be. However, even the sex scenes are lame ones lame. Except for the first, they are about three seconds long (then again, maybe my version was off) and comic overwrought. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a decent movie, you do not want this. If you are looking for a sex-flicking movie titler, you do not want this. Whatever the purpose of your life, desires, or perspectives, you do not want to watch this movie. How did Rosanna Arquette, Natashia Kinski, and Ed Begly act in this Stink Bomb is the mystery of the extreme.
