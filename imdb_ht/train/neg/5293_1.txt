I picked up this video after reading the text on the box, the story seemed good, and it was Keanu Reeves! But after 5 minutes of watching, I noticed how terrible his action was, he walked with talks so stupid the whole time, it's fake and not convinced. It does not end there, almost ALL characters to act so badly in ridiculous, only acceptable acting by Alan Boyce (David), but the guy committed suicide early on and you do not see it again, you never even know why it did it! Everything about this film is screaming low quality, I can not believe how such a thing gets released! I've been tempted to stop watching, in fact I did, halfway through it I decided to stop watching and turning things off, reaching the IMDB to check what the other thought was about it, i has commented zero (not surprising) so I decided to force myself to handle the pain and go back to her finish then come here to comment on it. The good thing will be (for me) was the theme of school-rock rock, the occasional guitar plays and songs part, but that's not worth it. <br /> <br /> Very bad acting and directing ... terrible movie.
