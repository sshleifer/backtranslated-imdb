"I'm Curious: Yellow" is a steam muscle and pretense. It does not matter which one's opinion is because this movie can hardly be taken seriously at any level. As for the claim that frontal male stripping is an NC-17 automatic, which is not true. I've seen R-rated films and male nudity. Granted, they only offer some views of past, but where are the R-rated movies and vulvas gaping and flapping lipsticks? Nowhere, because they do not exist. The same goes for people who can show: schlongs balance in the breeze, but not a clitoris in sight. And these indie cinematic pretense like the Brown Bunny, in which we are treated on the site of Vincent Gallo's johnson vibration, but not a track of pink visible on Chloe Sevigny. Before crying (or mean) "double-standard" in matters of stripping, mental obtuse should take into account one obviously obvious anatomic difference between men and women: no part of display when actresses appear naked, and even The thing can not be said to anyone. In fact, you generally will not see female genitals in an American movie in anything short of pornography or erotic stimulation. This alleged double-standard is less a double standard than a usually depressing ability to come to terms of culture and bowels in the women's bodies.
