Uma Thurman plays Sisi, a young woman with a gypsy spirit (and great deep) who crosses the hitchhikes, eventually finding her place among a group of peyote-enlightened cowgirls on a devoted hive to preserve the Whoping Cranop; Rain (bows) Phoenix is ​​the lesbian leader, Bonanza Jellybean, who falls in love with Sissy, thumb or not. Gus Van Center heads and adapts Tom Robbins' book, but satir does not have any primary target and just skitters all over the card, like Sissy (maybe its purpose, but it does not involve an audience). Notorious box-office flop did not hang much as it was ignored, and one could see why: it's a series of designs in search of a draw, and performance, touching direction and cinematography are all variable. Thurman is a wireless presentation along with the highway trying to get a ride, but this is a very nice place to put the kibosh on Phoenix's career. Writer Buck Henry (who did not write this, but maybe should have) to provide the most assured performance as the doctor who works on one of these thumbs. Two thumbs down.
