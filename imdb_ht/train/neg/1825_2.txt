I'm not sure. I just could not laugh at it. I had an open mind. I did not want a tight- ss on it. But I seriously just could not laugh at this movie. It was just not funny for me. Some parts it seemed like Ben Stiller and Jack Black tried too hard. Just because you put two very funny people together does not mean that this will make an excellent comedy. Some movies just should not do. This is one of them. Because he did many old jokes and the act was just stupid. I know, I know he's a comedy. Sort of at least. But I was just not impressed. I'm sorry, but I can not give anything below a two. And it's all I give. <br /> <br /> 2/10
