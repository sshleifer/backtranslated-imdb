Just a movie Jason Lee Regular, Some parts of the movie were funny. The luxurious movement is to live life on the corner I guess. These are the kind of films that I think 14 year old girls look at sleep party. It was a movie really. It is kind of one of those movies you have about in the ground back and look up all right now and then when something catches attention. I think Julia Stiles and Selma Blair are a good combination and would like to see them in a movie with a good story and draw. It's just kind of a boy to meet girls movie. This is that the perfect movie would show on Central Comedy. I am glad that I did not see this film in the theater, I would have been angry. But I guess that's why I did not see it in the theater.
