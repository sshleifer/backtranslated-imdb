This is the most fundamental sort of traditional ghost story, not even hosted by any major limitations not used in Irish places. If the great M.R James has ever come up with a thin story - by James in fact there is a story called "A Thin Ghost"? - it would not be bothered to have it published. <br /> <br /> Orson Welles looks at the peach ends as a favor of a brace of old friends, this movie producer. His presence and one movie industry in the joke earned this Oscar's will-o'-a-wisp nomination. This is yet more evidence, if there is more need, the Academy Awards have never been any warrant of merit.
