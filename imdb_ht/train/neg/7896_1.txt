Not sure why this movie seems to have gotten these reviews. While watching "Bang" a night on TV, I found myself bored by the meaningless, random scheme that happened on the screen. The whole movie seems nothing more than a mere exercise, artsy-fartsy self-indulgence on the part of the movie theater. The fact that the director / writer goes by one moniker not only strengthens this sense of pretense. <br /> <br /> Those interested in Indie flicks would be best looking for something better to write and to give me say, more fun than this complete waste of time.
