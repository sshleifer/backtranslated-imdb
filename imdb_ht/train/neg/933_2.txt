Undeveloped / unbelievable story line, (by the time I sort of figured out where it was gone, I no longer care) bad casting. (Come on ... William Macy as a man hit ???) Wrong wrong, (Do you ever see Tracey Ullman doing SO seriously?) (Should I take care of what happened the incompetent, Character Jan Ritter's inability?) bad script ... (Really, I'm not looking for a formula script but that's really horrible) the only good thing in it was the kid. Ten lines? It's OK if your comments are less than ten lines? Cum on - whose rules are people? Why can not I say that I must say in less than 10 lines ??? Is not that arbitrary? Why is not it OK to have less than 10 lines in comments?
