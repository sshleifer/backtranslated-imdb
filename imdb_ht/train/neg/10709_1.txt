I can not think of much to say about this movie. <br /> <br /> This was a terrible movie ... I did not even tell you what made me decide to see it. It has some kind of redemption that I do not even know where to begin. The plot was moved out of absolutely absurd plausibility. My whole body was tense throughout the movie because I could not wait for this horrible thing to be over and done. At the end of the movie, I found myself feeling overwhelmed. <br /> <br /> The correction was poor, the act was sub-par, and the storyline was weak. Francoise Robinson has been cast as a Native American, though it does not seem like a person of Native American Indians. <br /> If a movie will make this idiotic, it should be ridiculous stupid - at least in many ways. It was not. It was just pathetic.
