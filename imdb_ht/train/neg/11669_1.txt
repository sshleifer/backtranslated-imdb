I suppose it's nice and trendy to see the wonderful things in the sheer blank of a movie like this. With sometimes unmistakably many films of Hollywood, we can relax and enjoy a devastating scene of explosions, mobs, and one-piece sharks. Minimalism has its place, and it can be very effective when working properly. However, this movie is not one of those cases. Take the long scenes with no sad dialogue, sparse scenery. I assure you have to maintain a great meaning and insight, because the implicit message of hiding in bafflement. The act is poor ... hardship and pedestrians ... and features one of the worst screams of history (at the end of the movie, if you can sit at it in the end). The scenery is drab, and the sequel ends ridiculously long in the girl walking in the park park is as fun as having a tooth pull. I would call this anticlerical, but as the movie did not build in any sort of Bigger anything too ... not even in the scene "erotic" ... it would be true. I'm sure there was a work script during the filming, but with the amount of dialogue, I think it might have been written on a cocktail napkin. Basically, this movie offers nothing of interest or surprising ... there is no big story, no stunning clicks, no visual drama, no excitement. Apart from three or three fun moments, this movie is a waste of time. A boring and boring traumatic movie.
