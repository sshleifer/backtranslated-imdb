Based on the novel by Michael Chabon, the mysteries of Pittsburgh are about the young son of a notorious Gangster who spends his latest summer roaming roaming around with two friends. The year is 1983, and young Bechstein Art (Jon Foster) is on a crossroads. Completely opposed to his father's form, Art plans to become a stockbroker. Visually comprehensible and painful attempts to create beautiful hip indie movies, the whole movie feels like the director - with previous Dodgeball efforts was funny if outright commercial - is desperately indie indebtedness crediting by cobbling along aspect of other independent films, but subtracting it stars like Mena Suvari, Sienna Miller and Nick Nolte. Like many of the star-laden prime ministers at this year's Sundance, she felt like this was a secret studio-sponsored project worth noting the director to earn some indirect credit score - she failed in that respect and as a movie of her own its rights.
