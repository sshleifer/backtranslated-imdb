A lot of horror fans seem to love scarecrow, so I will not be very popular in saying that I found it to be rather boring. The idea behind it was interesting, but it seems to be a lot. I think the main problem is that it is all set in darkness. Sometimes horror films put in darkness can work (like Humongous), but Percussion is in darkness for the entire movie. A lot of times it's hard to know what's actually happening, and although some scavengers have escaped, most have difficult to see. If there was a little more lighting used, maybe it might have been better. There are not many films involving convertible assassins in my knowledge, apart from black night in the scarecrow, which is best. I would recommend that on scrutiny any day.
