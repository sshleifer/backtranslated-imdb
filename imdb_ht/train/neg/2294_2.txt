Poor Paul Mercurio. After landing Scott Hastings in Ballroom Strictly, the best movie of history, he managed to find himself doing a lot of garbage. None of the characters in this movie are very easy, or even hated, but Mercurio's lead is the sort of person you prefer to ignore - completely unloveable and he puts everything. The big mistake of costume design, that one.
