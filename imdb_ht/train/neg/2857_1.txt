I've seen many Sci-Fi Original Cinema ever since I started looking back in 2002 (My first was Sabretooth - which actually is one of the more fun Sci-Fi Channels features in my opinion). Their quality varies. Some of them are average, but decent (Sabretooth, dragon fighter, never called werewolf, marsh swamp), some are seriously ill, and then some are really awful. Planet Raptor lies in the letter. <br /> <br /> RAPTOR Planet, a loose sequel in the 2004 Sci-Fi Channel Raptor Island's original Channel, is an upset mess to look at a movie that has really bad acting and lazy script. The effects of the dinosaurs in life (a combination of puppetry and animatronics as well as CGI and stock stocks from Raptor Planet) are some of the worst effects I've seen in a low budget film. The weakest effects are even compelling. <br /> <br /> The plot involves bunch of commands that for some reason (I forget why) travel to a planet of alien dinosaurs. That's fine, dinosaurs are aliens. Dinosaur in the outer space. What's next, shark in space?!? The rest of the plot is simple. Throw the human being off and eat. From now on, we've come to expect this movie many dinosaurs and novels that are published, but this is the first dinosaur dinosaur movie I've seen where I actually came bored with all the dinosaur attacks. /> There are a few chuckles in it though. There is one scene that stands out from who is a man being munched by a Carnotaur (brought to life by stock stock from the original movie) that later seconds becomes a giant raptor. Also, a bit of Trivia, this is the scene where Steven Baur is shooting at his own scene from the movie first. <br /> While Raptor Island was not a good movie to start with, a chef is compared to its sequel. <br /> <br /> Believe me when I say, this is probably the worst film Syfy has ever been revealed. He darts near unwatchable.
