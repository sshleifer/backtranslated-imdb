Save the $ 8.97 you will spend on Walmart to buy this DVD and go see the real movie by Steven Spielberg. <br /> I'm a cinema, and being an avid fan of HG Wells, I bought this hope to sit and watch three hours of good entertainment. Instead, she took four days to finish watching this because I could not stop watching over 10 minutes at a time. It's terrible. <br /> There are reports that Timothy Hines had a $ 20 million budget for this production. Where did the heck go? Did he use most of it to buy a new home? Retirement Finance? Or what? Let me start with what's actually good about this movie. It remains true of the book and has some good performances in it. I can respect the actors who obviously tried to do this a good movie. But good performance has quickly become covered by terrible ... and I mean special terrible effects. Any new school film student can do a better job with the CGI. For me, most of it looked like action board "stop action" chart that was used rather than sophisticated CGI software that a $ 20 million project should be used. <br /> There is no excuse for the amateur post production that has been applied to this movie. My own partner and I sat down and recreated our version of the ferry scene using software that cost less than $ 1500.00 and within one day there were five minutes of the performers who looked better and more realist than what Hines create. I saw movies and budgets that are less than $ 2 million look better. Better. <br /> In my opinion, the special effects used in King Kong's original were more sophisticated and better than Hines' special effects in this film. In fact, I have a better appreciation for attacks in the killer tomatoes because of this movie. There is no excuse and technology today for a movie to look like a B-movie of 50 unless that was the intention, which should not have been with this particular project. <br /> A problem I've had with the DVD transfer was that the movie is tackling, another demonstration of amateur film-making. In general, I said that I produced a $ 45,000 project in 2003 with the best movies and special effects than this movie. /> <br /> I encourage anyone who appreciates good movie-making or who is a fan of WOTW to leave this movie on the shelf and watch the 50-foot female attack instead. It would be easier on the eyes.
