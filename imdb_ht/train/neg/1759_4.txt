This effort was like a glitzy TV movie ... I do not remember this ever being released into the theater ... If so, he must have died a quick death. Watching the DVD, in the comfort of our room, it was obvious this movie meant to be no more ... Ed Lauter an art critic and a greed of track? What a fun turn that must've been ... I have not seen Ed since the "long yard" ... Everyone else is very much acting by their numbers, led by Baldwin, except for Pompeo. She had zero charisma and seemed to be sleepwalking to reach most of the picture ... Pompeo's daughter had only one dimension ... she played every scene like a lovable little puppy ... smallest delivery line of any 3 year old I've seen again ... The Chase scene gave my wife and headaches ... too much quick-cut and angle-bashing ... If you're going to Shoot a chase scene in Barcelona, ​​you might want a few widespread shots to exploit the beauty of your series, right? The whole story was very implausible and far-fetched, but hey, we loved it better than "Aquatic life"
