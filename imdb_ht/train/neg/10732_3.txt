The Russian film, "4," follows the lives of three (by four) aliens who meet one night at a local bar. One is a musician, one of a frozen meat seller and a girl called. <br /> <br /> "4," I picked up, intends to show the dreariness and despair of life in post-Soviet Russia (characters have made their stories make their lives appear more interesting than they really are) The film is so incoherent and boring that I'm seriously skeptical that many people will be able to sit all the way through it. There seems to be a hint of films in which the Russian shadow government is up to some shadows behind the scenes - operating cloning facilities, selling decent-free freezer etc. - but the movie is so formless and incomprehensible that I have doubt anyone who can know what anybody's really up here. Despite decent acting and a few saving scenes, "4" is a two-hour long-term competition that should be avoided at all costs.
