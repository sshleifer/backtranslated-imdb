Mimicking its long film title to find ways to come close to the 90 'mark. The beautiful boxes here and all that made Hamer's production value a trademark, but Paris drowned in the fog is a sign of indulgent carelessness. The story is obvious and can be summed up in a dozen words so there comes nothing unexpected and nothing is worth more than 5% of your attention to be expected. <br /> <br /> The direction R is heavy as a direct transfer of play stage, the actors are especially stiff as lattice figures (this is a Hamer feature, only it sometimes best featured in the package whole). My conclusion: This film is trash, not worth the time I spend that evening. Eternal life is a boring problem and I should expect the men in charge of the Cinemath√®que program to know better.
