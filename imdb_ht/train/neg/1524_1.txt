Words fail me. This movie was very difficult to watch and in retrospect I really wanted I did not do it. Although I tried to sit through it until the credit ends I must admit I could not last for more than hours, so my opinion might be unfair. However, this movie would require the most impressive third end of the story of film-making in order for it to provide a review that is anything but greedy. Please do not look any part of this movie.
