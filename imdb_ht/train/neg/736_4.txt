Twenty years ago, five-year-old boy Michael Hawthorne witnessed his father killing his mother with an ax in an empty road and committed suicide later. In those days, Michael (Gordon Currie) invited his girlfriend Peg (Stacy Grant) with her best friend Chris (Myc Agnew), Jennifer (Emmanuelle Vaugier), Lisa Ann (Kelly Benson), Ned (Brendon Beiser), Mitch Maldive (Phillip Rhys) and Trish (Rachel Hayward) are spending Halloween in the country with his grandparents in the fields. He asked his friends to wear costumes that would represent the biggest scared of the whole world, along with his friends Crow friends (Byron Chief Moon), they would make an ancient Indian celebrations using Morty's carved egu (Jon Fedele) who would eliminate their fears forever. The greatest fear of Michael is to become a serious assassin like his father, but something went wrong and mortally came to his father, killing his friends. <br /> <br /> The "Fear: Resurrection" is a frustrating and freemaking movie that uses the interesting concept to eliminate the greatest intimate fear of each friend before it grows, but in a movie simply full of praise . Some exaggerated performances, such as for example Mrs. Betsy Palmer; Others are very weak, but overall the act is a good thing. Unfortunately there is no explanation why the execution is carried live; Further, despite being surrounded by close friends, the band does not feel pain or sorrow when each one of them dies. The low-march along more than fifty minutes could be used to build a better dramatic situation. At the very end, Michael shows a charm that his dad was interested that I had not noticed about the story. I do not know whether the previous reference was modified in the DVD released in Brazil and 87 minutes running time. Special effects are very reasonable for a B-film. My vote is four. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Fear 2: A Day at Halloween" ("Fear 2: One Night of Halloween")
