(aka: Trinity is still my name) This sequence seems to have capitalized on the success of the European box office-by calling me Trinity, only this time Joseph E. Levine and future-embassy photos wanted to capitalize on it's America as well. Too bad they did not get too far since the pictures Hill / Spencer has only had marginal success here in the U.S., and this largely boring, drawn-out movie does not help it out any. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Trinity and Banbino swearing for dead dad (Harry Carey Jr. They later participate in trafficking weapons that skip weapons out of a monastery, and mistakenly think they are a pair of federal agents. It all winds fall flat in spite of a couple of funny scenes, especially the one where Trinity and Bambino are in a fancy French restaurant and do not know how to carry them. And the scenes with the four sharks were humorous as well. <br /> <br /> Music in title singing titles by Gene Roman sounds like a beautiful Bobby Goldsboro-like early 70s pop songs while the music signals pour into the movie are pretty good. Not sure if I want to buy the CD band in it, but there are some others who can. The film might have had a half hour whacked off of it and would not drag on for long. It looks like a lot of scenery is being mixed up here. In fact, I lose interest in it on 2 / 3rd of the way. The DVD is also awful, with a constant hum to the belt and a poor print that looks like it should be sent to that big scrap of pills in the sky. <br /> A great step down from the movie before. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10
