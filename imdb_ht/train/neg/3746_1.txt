As hard as it is for me to believe, and all the terrible reality show has over the past few years, this one has taken over the top spot for a worst again. I always wonder if this was actually just a parasite made by the SCTV gang. If Andy Kaufmann was still alive I would assure he was behind this. Is a band band band any less than having INXS doing such a shame like this? The situation is simple and mental. Hearing a lot of karaoke rejected to become the new lead singer at INXS, takes place at Michael Hutchence (who committed suicide in 1997). Eight years and no hit later, the band committed the ultimate act of patheticness by subject to auditioning a bunch of talentless wannabes to be the lead lead singer of a band that is 20 years old its prime. So they traced all these horrible musicians (I thought American Idol was part of doozies) who made athletic rides in just about every classic (and predictable) song rock imaginable. Then they cut off the INXS band members who seriously discussed the merits of each of these candidates. You could see the best (and more original) stone performers in just about any night club in any city in the world. It has all the usual components over yet in every other reality show. Among the participants, linguistic interviews, army hosts / emcee, blame "judging" of performances, and lamewinners are booting to a participant at the end of each show. Do these shows get any more predictable? It's clearly an advertising cascade on the part of the group; a last gasp in the hope of recindling losing limbs before they finally buried it in oblivion. Michael Hutchence, if he had any little of dignity when alive, had to roll over to his grave. Not that INXS was a big band, but I had no idea they were this pathetic. If the INXS of all representatives of what rock and roll come, this show should be the final proof that stone and roll is once for all, dead.
