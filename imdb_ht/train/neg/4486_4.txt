What the hell was all about? I saw the Matrix and was amazed. It was the most spectacular movie ever done. What ever owned the Wachowski brothers makes this movie is beyond me. <br /> There is no scheme, you can not argue with that. Basically all this film had a charge to talk, and not to get me wrong, I have no problem with talky film, but all the talk in the reloaded matrix was a freeware load of drivvle. Then there would be a battle sequence that lasted too long ago, then more useless to drivvle, then another battle scene lasting too long and it all built up to the largest anti-climate ever. A little crumb dumpling speaks a burden of incomprehensible bull for 20 minutes. <br /> Also, Keanu Reeves gives her worst performance again. I knew he was not a good actor but this was beyond a joke. If you watch his movie in the order he was in them it would seem he got worse still as they go along. God knows what his performance is like in something to God! Keanu Reeves: The only wild stick ever to become an actor. After the lovely first movie this came as a massive discipline. If you have not previously seen the movie first I suggest you watch it, but do not waste your time with this batter completely in turd.
