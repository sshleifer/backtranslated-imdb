I saw an early screening of this movie in New York and I, along with my friends and pretty much the audience all, were very disappointed. The movie was not so bad it was good; He was as thin as a snake-biting victim. Samual L. Jackson looked amazingly tired of most of her and the Snake effect was lame. He reminds me of one of SciFi's movies, except the cheese in this movie was not funny or even camp. It all seemed torn, flat, and eventually formulaic. I'm shocked to say that I actually thought Anaconda was more fun. It's easy to understand that SOAP has realized it in a s * piece and plays with it, but that the movie fails to embark on is a script that has any suspension effects. It's the worst kind of lame film: it's happy.
