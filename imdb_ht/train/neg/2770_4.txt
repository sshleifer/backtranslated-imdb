Hollywood Hotel was the latest music video by Busby Berkeley headed for Warner Bros. Her direct style has changed or evolved to point out that this film has no signature shots or large production numbers and thousands of extras. In recent years some of the thirty, swing-style big bands have recorded the biggest hit in the popular year. The Swing era, also known as The Big Band Era, was dated from 1935 to 1944 or 1939 to 1949. Although it is impossible to exactly point out the moment the Swing era began, Benny Goodman's commitment to the Palomar salon in Los Angeles In the late summer of 1935 was certainly one of the early-swing clues entered the awareness of America's mainstream gene. When Goodman featured his swing rather than music dance music society he played, young people at the audience went wild. That was the beginning, but since radio, live concerts and speeches were the main methods available to spread the phenomena, it took some time before swinging made inspire enough to produce great hits that showed up on board they pop. In Hollywood Hotel, the appearance of Benny Goodman and his Orchestra and Raymond Paige and his Orchestra in the film indicated that the film industry was ready to capitalize on the change of music tasting (the film was in production only a year and a half or so after commitment to Palmer's Goodman's Ballroom). There is an interesting moment of music here and there in Hollywood Hotel, but except for Benny Goodman and Orchestra "Sing, Sing, Sing," there is not much to congratulate. Otherwise, the most interesting music sequences are the opening of the "Hooray for Hollywood" parade and "That's a lesson in you" production numbers at the drive-in restaurant. The film is most interesting to see and hear Benny Goodman and play her orchestra with Dick Powell and Frances Langford songs.
