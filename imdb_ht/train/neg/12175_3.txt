Why Review Cinema Good When You Can Review "Trancers II?" <br /> Ooh, this movie is the lame consonant. I can just throw the dropping and driving crew at L.A. with a camcorder, hurling the extra monster comic make-up of poor, suffering Tim Thomerson. Family stars are actually turning up to play cameras, probably because Full Moon could not pay "real" expenses. The lightweight effect, blame, and a voluntary script would take the eens to tackle all the nodes - this must be classic installers! <br /> But ... and again ... she rules. This is the same thing I say about "Tranquents IV." I say it because it's true. What can be beat watching an old guy in a coat of clothes mowing down zombies, then busting out and angry like, "Do not worry ladies, they're bio-degradable"? Well, many of these things might be better, but anyway this is always good. <br /> <br /> Only significant reservation is Megan Ward, who really stinks up the joint. It's a disgusting rival for Helen Hunt's character - they're both young pieces of eye candy, and it would have been more effective if they actually contrasted a bit more. Well, you can not have everything. At least the wonderful tracing device in the "second time watch" is back in place, and we had more of Hap Ashby, the least-convinced athlete in the history of cinema (oh, wait a minute - he had a rivals it's the form of David Ogden Steirs of "Creator"). <br /> I have not seen this recently, but I seem to remember that Martine Beswick runs away twice during the final battle. Hail for continuous disgusting! Just one of the highlights of this fine film.
