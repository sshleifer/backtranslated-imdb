My comments may be a bit of a spoiler, so it's worth. Stop now if you care enough ... <br /> <br /> Saving Grace should have titled "A paper-thin excuse for British old women to get high on-screen." This movie is dumb. The occasional music is an inconvenience as it is obvious, Melody Hacked that sporadically pop up to comment on the narrative ("Heavenly Spirit," for example - Oh, I get it!) This is basically a Cheech and Chong movie made credible by its English estodgy setting and overwhelming power Brenda Blethyn has hurt emotions over a hearing using her own voice. I could literally hear the stories on the High Times magazine receiving the jollies about the enormous "buds" that litter this picture. Worst scene? Easy. Brenda attempts to trash her illegal goods on the streets of London in a blaring white-suit dress. Not funny. Not original. Not interesting. Not a good movie. The 7.2 rating is the result of the over-vote zenotes. Do not waste your time ...
