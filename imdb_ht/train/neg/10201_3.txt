This is a funny "perfect crime" thriller. A perfect crime executed by the police investigation officer, ignoring all the clues, immediately knowing who is guilty. The audience is required to wait for all the film for the culprit to be kept. The result is like every single episode of "Columbo" or "murder he wrote". The director himself refers to the hack story by demonstrating the police officer watching an episode of Matlock! This story is barely full 90 minutes but the director insists on using all 120 minutes completed with each cliche in the book. Skip this one, you do not miss anything.
