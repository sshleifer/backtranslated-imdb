I was fascinated as how genuinely bad this movie was. Is the viewer supposed to learn something, or think about anything here? What was up with the pumpkins? Should I be impressed with the motel vaccine? Is it troubles that there are some garbage bags on a rooftop across the street in a hotel? Why the unlucky narrator mocks people to read interviews (it is so obvious that he edited out the really informative parts of his interview to struggle to struggle). The best part of the film was the interview with the film teacher who tells us how bad this movie will be before it ends. <br /> I'm really surprised. I believe the creator is struggling to become an intellectual or trying to impress the intellectual community.
