The over-warming plot of "Bonjour sadness" is taken in a first juvenile novel by Francoise Sagan, who became a better seller, though God knows why. For the youth want to get rid of a potential step-parent it can have a certain appeal. Not to be taken in the fact that David Niven plays playboy dad and Deborah Kerr's stage-mom-in-the-prospect. Unfortunately, too much receipt of the fragile shoulders Jean Seberg. It's nice and easy to accomplish the image of a spoiled teenager. The problem is that it can hit but it can not act. Anyone who saw him as Joan of Arc in St Otto Preminger's first film - Seberg - knows he was incapable of 19 to bring a movie. This film, also by Preminger, fulfills the "promise" of the first. It was his second film; it was now 20. What is Preminger thinking? What is Niven and Kerr able to compensate for Seberg's lack of ability to act? Not a chance? Seberg's character is in the center of the story and, even if it is, convinced even though it can be physically as a 17 year old, he can not meet the emotional demands of the role. I do not know if he ever became a successful actress in his short life because he did not have an impact on my consciousness in his later pictures. But anyone who thinks this movie is better than mediocre needs a tasting check. In spite of Niven and Kerr, this is a juvenile story that is executed in juvenile fashion by a beautiful young girl who seriously needs to act.
