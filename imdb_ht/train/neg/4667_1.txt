Viciously cluttered, drawn less, incredibly mind-numbing garbage. Not even close to Greenaway's best work. Avoid all costs! <br /> <br /> Effect 'screen split screen' makes nothing more than confusing, the movie is very dark for many time and the 'artistic' composition of images is firefighters in the extreme. <br /> There is absolutely nothing to recommend on this movie; Even the nudity is incredibly unerotic, which sees it full of a large part of the movie soon become very boring. <br /> <br /> Plus, how can anyone say that the act of Ewen MacGregor is brilliant is beyond me. He has shown more capabilities in the Star Wars series, and he says something. <br /> I was not so impressed with a movie since I saw 'Darby O'Gill and the Little People'!
