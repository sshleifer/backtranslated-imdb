Well, this movie started out funny but quickly deteriorated. I thought it would be more 'adult oriented' humor based on the first few moments but then the movie changed into a bad make-up-Disney Channel style mode, especially a go-kart racing scene that was incredibly long. Alan De La Garza is gorgeous but has a really false Italian accent. The movie looks and sounds very independent and low budget. There was one very nice moment that I would just call the serenading scene but in general this one was a yawner. The streets are very few and far between. Surprise the end for "Mr. Fix It" so ridiculous it left me crazy more than anything else. Would be worth a look if you can catch it for free or TV, but do not waste money you buy or rent this movie.
