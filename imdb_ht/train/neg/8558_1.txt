This film was absolutely awful, I even feel comfortable calling it a movie. It's the film "mumblecore" typical, with zero plots and a bunch of wines without green smile stumbling around trying to "figure out things". I tried to give mumblecore a chance, but allow honest it just awful. <br /> I'm not from sync and movies, I appreciate Dogme95 movie, Idioterne is one of my favorite movie ever. So I do not mind if a movie is cheaply made as long as there are some (any) substance. Everything in this movie is to seize, act, write (or it's all etc.), the direction, but most of all, above all else, the camera work was just plain and simple nonsense. The camera was never anywhere logical, there was no consistency. I got to admit that being a guy I had heard had stripped of that movie so I thought myself well though its terrible at least have to nodding (yes i know, i'm a jerk). Well, thanks to the u camera work you never really get to see anything, and the things you see, TRUST ME - you do not want to see. This movie made me want to vomit on many levels. The dialogue made me want to vomit, cameras-the work made me want to vomit, but especially the idea that this film was praised by some legitimate criticism, well now that more than anything makes me want to vomit.
