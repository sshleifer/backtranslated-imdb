This film is rated a classic about feelings not about any kind of movie-making. It moves from easy to the incredible, from the unrealistic to the comic. The incredible plot revolves around an attempt by two British soldiers with a Hindu gofer to rescue a third soldier who was captured by Indian insurgents. At the later stage we see a full regiment of drums and water walking in an ambush. In the British army, a sergeant does not order to make a relief attempt, and if you get past, he does not try it with one other soldier and an American servant when there is a full regiment in hand. The Indian incidences are so incredibly inept it is ridiculous ... there are hundreds of them but they can not keep the prisoners or kill the rescuers, of course not. At one point we see the British soldiers sending blocks of stone down from the cascades of the insurants, who are scattered around the hill in ambush ... one would have an eggplant for a brain thinking that would do any damage. After Cary Grant as the prisoner saved fire, he lies on the floating floor around the boy's water ... hardly the actions of a person shot at the back. The brave water boy runs a bugle (from nowhere) in the sound of the alarm ... this does not stand high on a wall so he can see and shot by the bad guys, and we shed a water that he keep trying to sound more notes as it is repeated shot and the bugle call breaks up in weak squawks ... instead of blowing the bugle while hiding behind cover as anybody and half a brain would do. This stage was meritorious parodied in comic strips. If they wanted to make a comedy comedy keaton, they would have to hire Keaton and do it better.
