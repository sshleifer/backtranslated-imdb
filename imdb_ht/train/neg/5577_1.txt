Somehow they summed up the 60, ten years that radically changed our country, within four hours. And what a painful four hour it was. They have trivilized great events with these and "claiming" it was about two more generations to barely see the African-American family. If I were NBC I would be disappointed and embarrassed for oning these trash. What was fun was this happy-go-lucky family you saw at the beginning of many being tortured in many ways but managed to attend every 60 major events in the country. And the second family was like a non-factor. They may be devoted to five or six total scenes of this family. That poor son ... Please NBC, do not make any movie about any other era .... let that PBS and the History Channel
