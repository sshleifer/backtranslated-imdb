If you made a genre flick of the late 80s, you basically had a 50/50 chance it would either be placed under water or in a prison (unfortunately, we never got a junk underwater reputation). Framing Mafia boss Moretti (Anthony Franciosa), Derek Keillor (Dennis Cole) ends up on death row, right along with franc Frank Frank (Frank Sarcinello Jr). But that's the least of Derek's problems as the rogue government agent (with stooly mobs) Col. Burgess (John Saxon, who also directs) is using the prison as a test ground for a new superiority. This is only Saxon's cops directed during his Storied career. For a guy who worked with tons of directors, he appeared to only pick up any advice from being the cheap-to-Italian. Sure, it is low budget, but this can not be undertaken staggered, shotguns, or sloppy displays in the first 15 minutes. His credit, Saxon made it a little gory and it works in a hilarious naked scene (our lead falls asleep during a prison riot only to fantasize about a female scientist). Cole, who looks like a more rugged John-Michael Vincent, is decent as the stoic lead and Franciosa - sporting a really bad carpet - giving it all as a classy builder. The end takes place in Marty McKee's favorite place, Bronson Canyon. Retromedia release on DVD like HOUSE DEATH HOUSE.
