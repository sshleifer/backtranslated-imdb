Is there something worse than a comedy movie that misses humor? The answer is yes; one that fails to generate any interest throughout the picture. The first is not too bad - a voracious man before an illegal business - but this is a potboiler with a poor script and scenario and just does not work. <br /> <br /> Does this consider a good 'B' in 1942? Hard to imagine. The only positive aspect of the picture is the cast, which has several well-known figures from the '30 and the '40, including Warren Hymer, Vince Barnett and Robert Armstrong (I still reject Richard Cromwell as the weak who received Gary Cooper killed in "Live a Bengal Lancer", so I did not count it). <br /> <br /> Can not recommend this one and give it a rating of 3 - if you have a choice, find a root channel.
