Muslim man-barely in the jungles in Africa is hunted by an opportunistic expedition team; The daughter of the team leader found him first. Many ballyhooed versions of Tarzan history have a good output but are disabled by single-handedly the worst direction of a movie I've ever seen. John Derek is inferior to inspiration beyond cheesy motion movement movements and vice-to-boo glimpses in the body of Bo Derek's wife; she has so much talent behind the camera as Ed Wood. Trying for language-in-purity sex, Dereks are lacking fit, speed, time and taste. They have a sense of self paradox and bravura abandon (they send caution to the winds), but after a promising opening it all goes to hell. Miles O'Keeffe (which possibly had marble in his mouth the whole time) has the title role, but plays John E. Derek's third book and Bo Derek's sense of independence. * from ****
