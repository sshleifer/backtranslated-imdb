I saw the best movies cinema movies in my time, this one however, took the cake. More comedies than horrors, "Full Moon High" put "c" in cheese-fest. Quality stars in this movie are not bad. Just the way he did just send to roll down. Adam Arkin plays Tony, a football player of all American football in the 50's who ended up aging due to a werewolf bite in Transylvania. The most annoying part of the movie was the violin player. He drove everyone batty! Ed McMahon plays his ultra-conservative dad who met his own shot. Father Alan's father plays a sharp look that does not seem to be the top of his game. After all these years Tony seems to be very out of place due to the attack, and then he will get the chance to catch in his state. More than bloodshed, this film is just a start of the 80's, "Teen Wolf" was an improvement in this! 1 out of 5 stars.
