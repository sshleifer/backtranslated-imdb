No wonder this movie has never seen the light of day. The time of the release was terrible. The Gong show was already "flying the shark" by the time the movie was out, so who would pay just money to see a few of the clips sounding from the original run of the show? And the shows they are just a little bit of this tacky, 90-minute noise by Chuck Barris about how hard his life was like the host of the show. Did he really expect we would feel sorry for him and his life messed-up millionaire? Is he really thinking that we wanted to know about his life? (Obviously, since he later wrote his unusual autobiography about his career as a CIA operation.) Did he think the gag has everyone, everywhere audition to stay cool for 90 minutes? Or the executive network hounding him at every turn? This can be worked as a draw for a 30-minute sitcom episode, but not as a full-length movie. However, it was nice to see Rip Taylor, Gene Gene, and the Comic yet (although the movie "Spicy," included only the most vulnerable routine). And as someone else pointed out, this is the first part of Phil Hartman's film (even if it lasts only a minute). Note that his name is HARTMANN spelled into the credits, which is the name he was born with. You can not miss its voice and facial expressions, though it's very thin and smaller than in the SNL days. Ed Molinaro (Hill Street Blues) also has a small part; one of her first after leaving the soap world.
