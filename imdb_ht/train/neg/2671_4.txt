** WHO IS BEHAVIOR ** <br /> <br /> Mostly the topless heroine delivers another beautiful babe with her dad (a unique teacher whose action pith breaks into one shot and the whole of the next) from a mother-eating, dime-store mummy and nasty Nazis out - what else? - Build a Fourth Reich. Misty's costumes, like those of some other wins, become skimpier as the movie rolls over. The last portion of the movie is devoted to lesbian action; This foot actually gets real boring, real fast, telling more about the creatures behind the camera than the curvaceous creatures in front of it. MISTY becomes its nominal plot from the first and fast way, then divides attention to stripping and soft-core sex. This made MUMMY RAIDER a throwback in movies made in the 1960s by men such as Stan Borden, David F. Friedman and Harry Novak. Just think: if this work-work has been cranked out four decades ago, it would have been playing for years on 42nd Street along with WHAM BAM ASK SPACEMAN and KISS ME QUICK. As it is, MISTY MUNDAE MUMMY RAIDER has gone straight to home video. Grab you, quick, before it goes out of print.
