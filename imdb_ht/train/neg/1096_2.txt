While some training scenes were realistic, too many of them showed military instructors as ex-Nazi qualities. Obviously, the screen writer was either anti-military or wrote a movie for that audience. <br /> I am a veterinarian veterinarian, and, even during that period, military instructors who behaved in the manner of some of those would probably still serve time in military prison. I really love the scene where the "hero" and his friends (both private) are sitting in the captain's office, smoking cigarettes and talking and cussing with the Captain as if they were friends. This sort of thing that never happened in training or in a formal situation, as was the purpose of the scene. At the end I asked myself, "What was this movie about?" as it seemed to wander around the place with no focus except "I hate all authority." Thank God I received it from the library and did not pay it rent.
