This is not horror, as the first part was: This is ("culture") light and funny entertainment. As of the very end, the action starts right away with any explanation. But there is holiness, so I do not complain. And real boobs are. If I understand correctly, these are quite rare today among the young girls in the US A. That brings to my mind the fact that the main actress here is Pamela "Bruce's sister" Springsteen. thought without the first movie, so I compared this to it. Again, there are too little clothing (especially pants) and funny hair, it's not hard to say what this decade movie has done in. Again, there are really strange characters, this time even more visible to the "patologists". Especially staff in the camp. It's like some mental summer camp rehab. The older people: Most of the actors must be at least 25, but I think they're supposed to be 16 or something. Some "methods" used by Dyke are quite unpleasant. Actually this movie does not have much in common with the first part, and this is worse than it in every way.
