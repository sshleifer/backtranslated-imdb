This movie is scarce. Best set, it's strange "freakin '." I could give you a scheme summary, or some analysis unit density, but I would consider it a waste of time. Everyone needs to know about this movie are two young sisters, one incestuous relationship, homicide, post mortem mutilation, and a really disturbing warning. At the end of the film you feel like you need to take a shower to wash the filter in your head, but not in a great way as after "Pulp Fiction" or "Fight Club". It's like you're a teenager (or high school that I am still a teenager) and they just do something to you: wish you did not do, and B: hope for the good Heaven and Earth that parents you never find out about. And nobody likes it. My counselor is that rather than defiling your mind and looking at pieces of violence philosophers, just going to waste your time on something a little less horrible and looking at "Kazaam" (yes, I'd rather see "Kazaam "passing" girl violence "read to her what you want).
