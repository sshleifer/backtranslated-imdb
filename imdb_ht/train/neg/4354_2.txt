This show is terrible. There is no comedy, no scheme has no good character. America or blind gives the award of real shows. I hate this show with 30 rocks. Honestly I'm so happy to cancel this show. thank you CBS. Keeping two and a half men, holding Christine, keeps the commitment commitment to keeping up with how I meet your mother who really is not funny, but a lot funnier than that. This show is a chilling off of friends. and the director so ok. but keep this show away and never bring it back. never ever. The only reason I did not give it a rating 1 is because it keeps awake me instead of sleeping. These types of movies or TVs show that I give one. The only reason I was always awake was because of laughing at hearing and I was looking forward to the next show. I really want to show this was funny regret but my opinion stupid. very stupid. I do not see why everyone loves it. my opinion again. but I also found great bang theory of stupidity. my bad smart. Bye the bye class now I have a smile and it does not come from watching your show.
