Justification for what happened in his movie in terms of distributors and directors, drunks and receptionists to make writing script aside, let's just take this movie as it offers, without strange explanations. <br /> <br /> This movie is terrible. Straight up craptastic. Instead of rehash what can serve as a plot, I'll run a highlight reel at some curious points that make me scratch myself. A class (of 5) takes a field trip for a history class in the middle of friggin 'nowhere to Ireland. Students may be Canadian or American, it is difficult to say. That he was filmed in a Canadian forest rather than Ireland is rather obvious as well. A student does not seem to know about history and is basically "mute" character from a number of movie donkey 80's, except when it's Randy's channel out loud. A character can be Chris Klein's cascade. She has a girlfriend who probably gets killed, but she never really settles if it's true. A character is bitten and removed from his classmates ... just ... kuz ... and then there's a blonde girl. Yay blonde girl. <br /> <br /> Ireland has a population of 2. They have cousins. Gary, who is clearly the same age or younger than the rest of the cast, is called "guys" more than once. It's very ominous and wearing an embroidery cap. His cousin is a rotten porn star with the Irish worst accent of catching film in my life and most likely beyond. <br /> <br /> Spicy Ireland features many Canadian rainforest and sunny areas with 2 ducks that appear more than once in cut scenes. <br /> <br /> The producers received a discount on fake volume entry. Good for them. <br /> <br /> Unbeknownst me, horribly inbred phenomenon has access to branding new hunting knife. Maybe there are some outdoorsman outfits that are close to a blind clerk and the working-sulfur working enrollment. <br /> <br /> Also, you do not recognize me if you are inbreed for about 600 years, as the story leads us to believe that happened, or end up being a bit lumpy, but amazingly enough and fairly strong. Genetics are a wonderful game of crap. <br /> <br /> There may be or may not be more than one wild one in this movie. The references are made to "them" and we see shadow, but only one odd look dude is ever seen. But when one odd looking dude is finally killed, apparently all the dangers pass. I ran with my initial assumption that no one thought to equip a second man in full make up, so they just used the one. That's what it looks like on screen, anyway. Richard Grieco should be disappointed. <br /> <br /> Also in note, aside from these bright new knives, inexperienced phenomena have access to some nice leather gear, as once Richard Grieco cuts his obligations, there are even ready for The next peanut that gets tied ... who also at night, because the chains give you enough slack in just to defeat them, ask one why they even bother tied anyone. <br /> A dead body in a shack will be maggot-dog food after which I guess is about 2 hours past. Tell dead bodies will also have glasses when no characters have been placed. Kirye. Jenna Jameson appears for any reason from left stages, chats for 2 minutes, missing steps left. In the midst of a jungle forest. This is not strange, as Gary can also pop out of nowhere, which is also known as all that exists in television countries on the screen. Jameson died sadly and somehow his clothes disappear as I expected that this film would not suck the wind. <br /> I offer a special shake of the character "Zederbread", the poor girl who was used by the phenomena for months (or perhaps years) for breeding purposes. The poor girl who still has eye shadow on camera emotions and all the passion and conviction of a chihuahua stuffed. <br /> <br /> The end of this movie has clearly been slashed on by a drink or someone with a bad mental disability that has been cultivating and encouraging and drinking too much gasoline over the years. Apparently this was not just crap crap I found on the late film network at night, apparently people heard and even followed this movie in his production. How sad for you all. I have nothing more to say. May God be gracious to us all.
