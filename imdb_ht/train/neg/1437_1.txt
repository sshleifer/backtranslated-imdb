I miss the first 10 minutes of the film, but I do not think it will look at it from the beginning, it made no difference. I found the movie very boring and disappointed with the act. I remember Patrick Swayze and some of the other actors (Roy Marsden, for example) in exceptional roles but they are all disappointed here because of a very weak script. "Solomon Salmon's Room" ... very short part of the film inside the "Mines" was about as exciting as watching dry paintings and I doubt that even a pre-school kid would have been spelled-bound to watch the battle of the "warriors". The film was all reminiscent of a cheap American TV series. Give me Indiana Jones any day!
