This film begins with an ordinary funeral ... and he insisted on this ordinary funeral feeling that I lost interest in 5 minutes of watching, and started jumping scenes. It seems to me anyone who made this film affluent to the limit of becoming trapped in a permanent morbid vision, can contemplate anything else, but death and destruction. Well, I'm not one of the black kids from Southpark, I want a movie in 10 minutes to get me well in an interesting story, I will not sit and watch 10 minutes of nothing but preparation for a funeral My grandmother over her last year was captivated by burial, maybe she might have loved this "movie".
