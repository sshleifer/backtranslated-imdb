I actually saw this movie in the theater back to its original release. It was painful to watch Peter Sellers embarrass him so badly. The story was incredibly lame and hard to follow, and the finish was ridiculous. It was just sad to see how the warriors were falling. I will not say that I'm a big fan of Sellers Sellers, but I did enjoy the Pink Pantheare series and I felt that he had given a strong performance of being there. But this movie should never be born. From what I was reading, he chased this film product against the advice of the people around him. Fine, but that still does not excuse the studio actually releasing the movie.
