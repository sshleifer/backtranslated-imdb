This was in short a terrible disappointment. Not far from the worst adaptation of one of my dear novels. The dialogue was horribly clumsy; I could feel no sense behind the words expressing the characters. The lines were delivered too quickly and felt rather out of place. They could just as well be cited by status. Chemistry between George C. Scott and Susannah York was non-existent and looked at an American Rochester feeling weird. He could at least try to make a British accent. I love George C. Scott as an actor, but this simply did not work. I felt like I was watching from Jane Eyre, where the main pieces of the story were randomly joined together without any consideration of the flow of the story. The scenery and music were all very nice, but I could feel any of the passion and love that is supposed to be between Jane and Rochester and the movie left me totally unmoved. <br /> <br /> If you want to see a good version of Jane Eyre I suggest you watch the BBC BBC version and Timothy Dalton and Zelah Clarke or versions in 1997 with Ciar√°n Hinds and Samantha Morton. Now, these two are brilliant adaptations.
