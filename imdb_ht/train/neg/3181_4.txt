This movie was not done by the fans. Most of the great moments that fans are looking forward to in the half-hour Tommy Medley are simply missed or glossed on: At Christmas, they did not show Daltry's cry after the line "Tommy does not know that day it is .. ", showed nearly * no Townsend guitar shots in Pinball Wizard, had crowds vaccine overtime during the best moments of jumping to the ice, and worst of all, in the second half We will not take it (Listening to you), stolen from almost every shot of Pete's flamed guitar. Huge fragments of the film were shot in back to the group. It's a very frustrating movie to watch, and not to deliver their goods. I do not know if Murry Lerner's director is just not a fan, or worse, for at least if he * is * a fan and this is all * eight * cameras can be delivered for him. In its credit, there are some rare numbers before Tommy, as well as some fairies, which are very well shot, and sometimes the correction is brilliant. This would be enough to make some happy viewers, as long as you're not predicted Tommy. Sound in general was the mediocre of transmission I looked at DirecTV; It can be different on video or DVD.
