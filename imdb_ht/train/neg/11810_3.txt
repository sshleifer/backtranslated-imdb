I noticed with some entertainment that in the end credit, the Detroit PD thanked for their involvement. The police chief even has a single talk line playing himself (and boy, you can say he can not act). The reason for the entertainment is that in this movie police shot first and ask questions later. It is not PR, I would think a police force would want. In addition, this is your standard bottle and movie thief dressing for the '70 with a racial angle. Alex Rocco is given an unbearable role in a cop who can not get ahead and is sealed with a sick mental wife. It makes up for this not hanging from the local whoreehouse. Hari Rhodes is her partner destroys her with a groovy wardrobe and loves chase after suspicion while wearing a trenchcoat. The film moves together until the penultimate shotgun makes absolutely no sense (why people are guilty only in a robbery, taking on a whole police force?). Not only do we see a shooting but since there are four bad guys, we get to see cards. Then there is a finite twist that supposed to leave a guess what really would happen but only let me think how stupid it was. Seeing that Arthur Marks's director was also behind the "Friday Foster" and "Bucktown" braindead, I should not be surprised.
