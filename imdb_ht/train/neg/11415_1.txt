Well, AWFUL is just the first name. This film is a cliche-ridden piece of junk. A high school comedy setup in a military training camp. I'm sorry I gave this star 1 that he did not deserve. <br /> <br /> This can be storage container: <br /> <br /> Just about everything is totally forced, compelling and unrealistic. The HEPO (military police) will not come to you if you do not make your appearance, especially not on your wedding day. The actors were very embarrassed during this stage, because the scene did not work as it was so very easy. You can feel it in the voices. Even if they were not like bad actors, they would not be able to save the scene. <br /> <br /> Next guy has to exercise his wedding suit. No, there was no time to get her a uniform first. Man, this is great movie! I will remember this scene for the rest of my life. <br /> There are also girls in the camp - interesting - one of'em even a model, though not so great - and the actress baddest I've ever seen. I doubt Hollywood would let her say one line in a B movie B. <br /> <br /> Okay girl in the military! Now this will be fun. The girls are even placed on the same floor, so we can sneak into the rooms at night! In fact they should be placed in a different building a mile quarter away, separated by two fences and wires. <br /> <br /> There are available tanks that we can use for a fun ride in our spare time, in which we have a lot. No, tanks are not locked, and the keys are ignition elements. No one will notice the sound engine, especially by night. There are a variety of sex scenes and references to all of them under the lane line. We need these so the Germans obsessed will love the movie as well. Switzerland is too little a market for any feature film. Well done! <br /> A sex scene takes place in the kitchen. Surely, none of these facilities are ever closed. The routine machines are as poor as they can get. <br /> At the end of the brainless flick, the mafia hits the people on the revenge on the poor guy trying to shoot him! Because she left her fianc√©! Make sure I buy that, the Italians are in this way - a lot of jealous (not). <br /> <br /> The bad guys try to do this in the open day and two dozen witnesses. Not at night in a dark alley. Again, military training grounds (where live and live ammunition) are open to the public, anyone can freely drive or walk around. There is no such thing as guard or fence. <br /> <br /> The title is however prevented by the good captain promptly launching a rocket in Italian cars. The explosion hit the guys striking and angry at the feet. No one in 40 feet distance is bad when the car blows smithereens. It's a comedy, remember. <br /> <br /> Well. It's a comedy, I got that, and I can live with that. No realism is needed. Creators can easily find ways with this if it is hilariously, split, funny or fun, interesting, challenging. Unfortunately it's not one of these people. It's just embarrassing. A rip-off from brainless American comedies. The latter is at least professionally, with no amateur actors. It is very boring and predictable, a waste of time and energy, especially of people sitting in the entire movie as I unfortunately did. Be cautious.
