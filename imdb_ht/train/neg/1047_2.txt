Someone will have to explain to me why each film that features poor people and adopting a pseudo-fearless look is somehow seen as "realistic" by some people. <br /> I did not see anything realistic about the characters (although the actors did their best and really bad parts) or their situation. Instead, I saw a forced, self-conscious effort in being "ass," "bravest" and "down and dirty". <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, it takes a lot more than hands-holding the camera without rhyme or reason and frees the movie light to achieve any of the above qualities in any significant way. It is a sad addition to the state of independent film distribution that the only movies that see inside of a movie theater are nowadays all carbon dioxide, and bad cinematography, non-existent cameras and a lot of swearing efforts than themselves as "Art". <br /> It is little amazing that films such as "in the bedroom" or "About Schmidt" found these waves. I found them flowing with much average, but compared to the actual killings of independent clones such as "increased Vargas victory" are downright brilliant and inspiring. A few years ago saw an "independent" film meant that you would seem to treat some originality with a lot of energy and care, and perhaps a few technical glitches caused by low budget, nowadays, meaning that The chances are you will find another by-number, let's-to-camera-around-for-two-hour attempts to assign lack of taste to independent distributors. And of course all that character and situation are completely real and flawless. <br /> <br /> Is it any surprise that the independent market has less and fewer surviving companies? Not at all when you see films like Poze Victor Vargas who do nothing but copy the worst of the previous films.
