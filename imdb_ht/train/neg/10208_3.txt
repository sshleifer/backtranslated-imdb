There is something frustrating about watching a movie like 'Kill by Numers' because somewhere inside that Hollywood formula is a good movie trying to pop out. However, by the time credit is rolling, no saving it. The whole thing is pretty much blown by the "cop side" of the story, where Sandra Bullock and Ben Chaplin detective characters in the melting detective in an awkward sexual affair become more and more trivialized again in the movie going on. Although Bullock is strong in its role, it's not enough to save the substandard and lazy script. Talent Ben Chaplin is wasted in a pleading role (she did earlier earlier in the year of the girl's girlfriend's birthday), as well as Chris Penn, who has such a great bitterness that you feel sorry for a talent like him. Anyway, the plot really is not even a factor in this movie at all. Two teen assassins played by Ryan Gosling and Michael Pitt are the only real reason to see this movie. The talents and chemistry work very well and play off at each other very well. It's too bad they were not in a better all-around movie. Barbro Schroeder is way too safe here for such a seasonal cinema. Under Line: it's worth a rent if you're a genre fan, but everyone else lives a true life without ever seeing it, except perhaps on TV networks and commercial trading practices.
