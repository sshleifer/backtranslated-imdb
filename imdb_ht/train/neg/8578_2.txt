One of the silliest movies in the 1940s, an entertaining home theater comedy and music starring Kay Kyser. Kyer, orchestra leader and radio-star (with college forever goof-off college), was the sort of precursor to Spike Jones, hamming it up for his guests and backing up unwillingly by his happy joys of musicians. He was hired to play a birthday party in a gloomy mansion, the type of poison imported from Africa to framed and hanging on the wall. The Shindig is busy with a creepy judge, a scary teacher, an ominous Swami, many giggly women, and enough bad jokes to complete three photos by Bob Hope. The songs (by Jimmy McHugh and Johnny Mercer) are nothing to praise, and neither is Kyser more confident, yukking it with elbows-in-cube materials that turn 1940 back ten years. * from ****
