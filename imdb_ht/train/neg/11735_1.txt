This movie made me really crazy because the main characters or all the characters have a south accent. I lived in Iowa for 29 years and I know that people do not have a southern accent here. This film is about a guy who does meth and I do not know the real plot or what the movie is supposed to be on. It has some very graphic use of drugs in it and it is really insulting to see those people use methods like it was sugar. I lost my brother for me and this movie made me sick in my stomach because she glamorized the drug. The movie makes it look cool to use the drug but I was happy at the end when the guy almost made it through the state line. I also know that most women who experience a traumatic rape do not want to love their boyfriends or husbands the next day. The movie is just wrong in every direction. I would suggest the "Basketball journals" if I went to suggest a movie about drugs.
