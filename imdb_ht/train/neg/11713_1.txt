Just a warning ... This is the worst movie I've seen in years ... I could not watch it by the end ... It's a pure lump of time ... I really feel sorry for Snipes that he ended up in such a movie. There is really not much to say about it. Terrible act, incredibly bad lines, stories, everything. The only reason I would recommend you to watch this movie is if you really want to see how a movie should not be. Just tell you one scene: the police are searching Snipes, and they surround the building with helicopters and cars, they shoot around the building, but they are still whispers so Snipes does not suspect something.
