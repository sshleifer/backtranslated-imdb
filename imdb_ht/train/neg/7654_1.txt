I remember it all horrible, terrible reviews for this movie when it came out. I mean to go see how horrible it was but it came from the theater in three weeks. The only other movie managed by Gigli. <br /> <br /> When the movie came out on DVD, I bought it to see how horrible it was. I could not think of the absolute awful sensation that this movie got was possible. After seeing it, I can understand. <br /> <br /> The first, let me say that this movie is not without some cool shots. There's a nice shot at the start showing a bullet fired from inside the gun, which I thought was clean. And the way the monsters in this movie are sort of cool look; but it gets old after the first time you see it. <br /> Let me start with the worst thing in this film: Tara Reid. If evil act was a sin, then hell would have been looking for Tara Reid right out since she's unbelievably awful in this movie she's unlucky. And in all roles, she plays a curator. Now, if she plays a mute, blank-headed sex game then maybe I might be forgiving her for how she treated her character. Apparently, Uwe Boll did not realize that, although it seemed to think that if he took his shirt to the movie, people would see it. He just did not realize that making him doing this in the middle of the movie at the moment she's just made the movie even more hilariously bad. And is that a Mexican song or something during the scene of popping out? I could not say. <br /> <br /> Which brings me to my next complaint: Uwe Boll shows off some of the worst guys you'll ever see in a movie. I mean, I would give the home of a deceased F (and I only do this for very few movies), but HotD would score at least a B compared to this piece up on junk. The movie starts off with a very, very long narration that causes immediate confusion (and it's not a horrible narrator) and in there, off really, really dumb. There is this point where Slater and Reid are looking around a building that has been destroyed with the blackens screen outside. When it comes back, Slater and Reid are shot everywhere and suddenly, there is a whole army together. Huh? <br /> <br /> And someone did not bother checking these mistakes in this movie. At one point, a team breaks into glass, but breaks the glass before touching it. Tara Reid's earrings change color from one scene and after Slater goes away from a dead comrade, you can see it begins to rise. <br /> As for the story ... I really lost. Something about an old tribe divulges darkness with someone "opens the way" or something with all the evil monsters pop out. It's just an excuse to have a lot of gun scenes (the technology is so advanced here that no character ever needs reload in this movie) that finds, simply, boring. <br /> I bought this movie hoping to laugh at how incredibly stupid it was. I did not laugh, but I still think it's stupid. Very, very, very stupid.
