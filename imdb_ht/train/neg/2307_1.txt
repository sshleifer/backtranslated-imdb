I was true in my consideration for Mr Glover and Mrs. Goldberg. I watched the movie all with my family and friends. I have no idea what the film was about. After much discussion, we all agreed that this was not one of the best efforts. <br /> It does not hang along pretty well. It's too late, and there is little comedy. I'm disappointed. It could be better. <br /> I waited months to see this film based on the liner notes. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your money unless you are a completist and just want to see all Mr. Glover's films and Ms. Goldberg. <br /> It was a poor way to spend an evening.
