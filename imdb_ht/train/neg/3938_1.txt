Not even Timothy Hutton or David Duchovny could save this dead fish into a movie. For starters, the script was definitely written to be made in a B-movie, but somehow Duchovny (looking for a star car elevated itself from TV) and Hutton (looking for "two" to a "one- the punch "he hoped to define his career after" ordinary people ") was attached to the picture. Cheesy lines, great bad towels from the stage scene (Come on - using wet towels after 12th grade telecommunications class?), And the old bad mournful acting film sink. Even Duchovny is not the immune to acting acts that are the movie. Only Timothy Hutton rises above the material at all. I must admit Duchovny's pain as he read the lines that voice-off. While I found myself laughing when I was sure the director wanted me to feel scared, nothing prepared me for the lock line in Duchonvey's voice: "If you ever need a doctor, be sure to call 911. " If only the studio was called 911, this dog in a motion picture is never done. Avoid all costs. <br /> <br />
