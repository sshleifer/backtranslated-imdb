Great west I hear you all say! Brilliant first effort! Well, I'm not sure what movie you all look but it must have been one different to the one I've seen. Great western or true good movie of any genre has the character you can trust in and this movie was no! The act was poor to say the least and I could not care less about any of the characters, making the film all pointless. The story was too great for the musicians and maybe they should try their hand at making a straightforward TV rubbing budget as you see on the "FACT OR FICTION" program of sci-fi. you are looking for a good movie, a big west or even just an enjoyable hour and a half, please look elsewhere.
