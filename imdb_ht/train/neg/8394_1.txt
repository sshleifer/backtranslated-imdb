Officially this is a Z-class screen DTV. <br /> But with lines like: <br /> <br /> "It's easy to die, I have, many times" <br /> <br /> and <br /> <br /> "Why do you read the book? " "Because it makes the plot more interesting" <br /> <br /> and <br /> <br /> "You've made your way to here, now you can make your way out again!" (after he drives a man in the basement) <br /> <br /> (and take a list of these chants) <br /> - it's not clear what this film was doing in era It's known for post-structuralism, is actually over, or if it's just a bad movie. The act is atrocious, but some actors I know, so they are hamming it up? <br /> An old house, obviously off with a contemporary home, is the site of mourning. A (bad) movie is made in the grounds and the story replays again.
