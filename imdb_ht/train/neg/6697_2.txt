Cold shot-anxious drive-revenge seeking truck driver & obsessive control of disease "my anger father when I was 12" handcuffs carry, all latex put prostitutes is just a few of the characters you will be presenting in this The complete shame on a movie that can be easily seen on any Cable TV station (IE: Skinemax) at 4am on Sunday nights. (Yes, I know that it was an entire sentence, but to do with my people; this is a long-winded review for a short film short). <br /> Filmed in "Somewhere" Canada, and almost There is no budget, this scheme shows freak is trite, the police in it obviously never heard of the "State Jurisdiction" because they end up chasing both Miya (Hookers) and Trent (Idiotic, Anal Retentive, Generic, Insecure College Student) all across the United States (and I thought only the FBI could do that). The camera is unstable, the sex scenes are mediocrity and the acting is so bad it could actually cause flattened unwanted acids in movies like "Ishtar" and "Leonard Part 6". <br /> <br /> As far as the skin scene goes (which is the only reason to rent this movie, do not even think of buying it) have two of them. The first is the one worth to look even though that is the scene of Dominatrix Sex and Kari Salin and ____ (insert unknown actor here, it obviously does nothing else worth noting) in a calm, disgusting motel room (the type with the droplet flow that drops, and the car soda out there with only blue tonic water left in it). It's all S & M (rise crops, handcuffs, hot waxes, and licking panties) folks and in the end, it gets left in a motel room, with no money and cops waiting at her door (this goes show you guys, do not leave a tie your hooker up in a "mid-in-nowhere" motel room). Unfortunately, Kari does not show any skin worth remembering, and that alone can cause deep traumatic experience for some guys, so that's definitely a downer towards this flicker. <br /> As for ending, * Snicker * Snicker * I know you probably would not mind if I revealed it to you but I do not want you to spend your money earning money for one. All in all I give it a 1/5 for action, a 3/5 for skin (See last paragraph) and a 0/0 for acting, character development or intrusive scheme torsion. <br /> - Laughing Man
