I read comments about this being the best Chinese movie ever. Maybe if the only Chinese cinema you've seen with no long, drawn-out dialogue far away from stares and silences, and hack correction, then you're spotting on .. Completing story-line? Diman. Try young and amateur. Exquisite humor and haunting memory? Diman. Try to flat-out boring and trite. <br /> <br /> This was terrible. I could not wait for it to be over. Particularly when the best line of film is composed of "How are you? I'm fine. Are you sure?" Wow! What is the depth of character. I guess the smoking cigar permanently was supposed to speak for them. As a great fan of Chinese, Japanese and Korean films, I was totally disappointed in this. Even the Holy Ghost's Holy Spirit "The Road of Life" was much better than that.
