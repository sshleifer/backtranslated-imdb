This is a terrible rumor of a marginal, but well-liked, movie from the early 70's. I saw the original at least 6 times. The 1997 version is a 20 minute movie 'stacked' in 2 hours or whatever the exit is. Cheesy storyline, which by the way, is completely different than the original. The big government involvement was far away. There is no flow from one stage to the next. In the original you can go to a beer or hit the toilet and still hold. <br /> It only takes a few hours movie time to change the oil pan on the car. It takes several times longer than that in real life. Mr. Car notices this thing. Also, foolish or foolish who chose to cancel a 1968 Charger and abuse a 1970 Challenger should be shot in the heel and a bullet bullet. The reality is not 'people cars' is painfully evident, and pass they will not mourn. <br /> <br /> The actors lacked any emotions, everything was cut and withered. One step above a monotone. A barmitzvah is much more interesting and energetic. <br /> <br /> Last but surely not least, the radio DJ made the statement that the Challenger hit the bulldozers in 180 or 185 (??). This is total waste. Can you say aerodynamics, or lack thereof? Hahaha !! This movie is a joke. Do not waste your time watching this one.
