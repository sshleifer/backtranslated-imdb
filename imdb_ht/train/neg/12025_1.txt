This movie was on the Romance Canal, and I thought it could be a 80's jump movie that would be enjoyable on some levels, so my brother and I looked at him. Boy Made It Suck. Boy gets crushed on girl - correction, * her dream * -girl (apparently there is a difference; and I'm surprised to realize she was her dream girl - she's been struck with her from over 30 feet away. Guess that just goes to show the power of girl-dreams), boy ends up masquerading as a girl to be near dream-girl (creative in the sense that it's a far-out but un-creative idea in the sense that there are probably better solutions one might think up), incessant situations, a match is made (all of which take turns to take place late late at night - either the place was somehow responsible for this odd lighting, or the actors had to wait until they were cut off on their day-to-go to the series; I suspect the letter). Very cleverly done, very pathetic. It's almost never even fun * accidentally *, so there really has nothing to deliver. Unless you are interested in seeing Chad Lowe's early days before he finally got his piece of pie and his role as HIV-positive gay guy on the series "Life Go On," or Gail O'Grady on NYPD Blue and probably came to the bottom of Dennis Franz's buttocks). But these motives are easy - I say "systematic disruption in their essence" would be a more justified goal. I am surprised I look at all these things. I guess it's the kind of stuff where, the half, you find yourself * still * watching due to some morbid, self-flagellistic inside-trouble, and thinking you might as well finish it so you can tell your friends and family that you actually sit in such a horrible movie, over the chance-that it will garner you some sympathy for the state of doubt in your mental health. Can * you * take the challenge?
