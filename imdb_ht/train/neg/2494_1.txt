What a joke. I watch it on Channel 1 and I think it's looking to paint paint is more fun. What happened to Caspar Van Dien who got him roped in this nightmare. Terrible acting, very drawn boring and horrible directions. It's so terrible, it's funny. It is supposed to be full of suspicions, but it's more a comedy. If you want to see terrible acting, write ridiculous script writing and sub-parity scheme, check out this movie. If I was Van Dien, I would not only ask for 10% from my agent but burn the bata in the process. What a turkey. It does not even fit to be on STD 3K! It would be a good movie to heal your insomnia. I especially love the party where Van Dien is thrown out and then make it back in just a few minutes! I can only imagine that this was written by non-union writers to take advantage of the writer's strike. What a horrible movie !!!
