WARNING: I advise anyone who has not seen the movie yet by reading this comment. Although I have not seen them all, Hamilton's sure to deliver a lowsy piece of entertainment, which he did not entertain me at all !!!! I thought that in common with the semi-fick act, plotting plot, and the twist at the end of the film, which was very delayed, this movie sucked !!! Okay, so supposedly these are people who eat others. YEAH ... notice I told people not people, not because they are not people, or wait I think they are, oh wait, they have not said you !!!! ! So, okay, are these cannibals, or are imbreds, or what they are !!!! I mean, maybe they're just "stuff" that came here to see what people like or like, are cannibals that have eaten the people for a long time now, or maybe this movie was HHOORRIIBBLLEE !! Which is known so if you think Hamiltons are good, I ask you, why, why, why, why it was so scary because I was just flatten out awful press A big BOOOOOO for the Hamiltons !!! Go to the Gravedancers, Dan & Nail, or Borderland for a piece of entertainment !!!!!
