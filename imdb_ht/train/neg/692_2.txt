One of the crowds in slashers that appeared in the early eighties, Pranks is remarkable only for an early performance by Daphne Zuniga (Sure thing, flying to 2); Her character dies early, and the rest of the movie is totally forgettable. During the Christmas break, a group of students volunteered to clear a college building convicted of its furniture. A crazy killer, however, launches a barrier to work by methodically bothering the youth one by one in a variety of ways. <br /> <br /> Exploit every cut 'n cut in the book, director Jeffrey Obrow delivers a tiring and unexciting horror that has been my prayer for the characters to die, so I can get on with watching something more refreshing. The majority of the deaths (which, let's face it, is why we generally watch this kind of movie) are short and not spoiled; Only the truly grisly imagery comes right in the end when the victims of the victims are discovered by the surviving survivor (there is one better not to divert the corpse ... the film could be made and more). In the last minute, the movie saved itself from the shame of getting the lowest score possible but I did not have a nice downbeat unfinished, but this really is one for completing slasher only.
