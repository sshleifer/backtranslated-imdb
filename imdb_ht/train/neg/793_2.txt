I did not know how should this movie be missed, since it was so bad it was actually pretty funny. I'm not a gackt fan by any means, though it's talented, despite the weird psedon that sounds like a cat coughing up a hairball. I still think Hyde was talented though, Faith is an interesting album. <br /> But on topics here as folks. This film is ridiculous. It's so over the head and nonsensical it's almost like a funny imitation of supernatural action films. <br /> <br /> The movie has almost no draw here, except it's just about vampires and gangster friends. In a way, this movie almost reminded me of Spider-Man 3, and how there were too many ideas, which resulted in not enough time to pay attention to one of them. <br /> <br /> The scene of action was mocking. Quickly edited, almost difficult to understand, and this choreography, so moveable is bad. Though Hyde looks very stylish during the scene scene, but this is just this movie of redemption. I'm a soloist for good movies, but the action was typically done. Even if the final shooting was OK and emphasized this movie otherwise depression. <br /> It holds jumping between jerk, not a good thing. He wants to make a drama, or a flick of action, or a horror, or a romance ... what the hell. <br /> <br /> If this review will make you angry, why? Is it because Gackt and Hyde are your love? Do not Dig Yourself, This MOVIE IS BAD.
