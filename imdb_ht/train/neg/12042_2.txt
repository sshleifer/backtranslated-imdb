To confess there is an imagination on Brad Pitt is a very difficult admission for a heterosexual doing. But what can I tell you? Perhaps that's the most popular thing that everyone is talking about and making a star a star. He crossed this barrier. It pulls you into sensual and emotional gender. Brando had it in shades, Montgomery Clift, Gary Cooper, James Dean and the last time, Tom Cruise, Jude Law, Johnny Depp, Ewan McGregor and Billy Crudup. Women fall in love with Garbo, Dietrich, Katharine and Audrey Hepburn, Grace Kelly, Marilyn Monroe, Julie Christie, Charlotte Rampling, Meryl Streep, Vanessa Redgrave, Julia Roberts and very very recently Natalie Portman. But Brad Pitt was, only, redefining the concept. It is the only reason to go out, get into the car, get parking, buy a ticket, popcorn and get to a theater to see "Troy" If you liked spice in the style of "The Darling Darling" can enjoy this. But if you do not, go all the same, we want to keep Brad Pitt in business.
