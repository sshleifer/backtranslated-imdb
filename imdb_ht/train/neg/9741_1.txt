(Actor) The really memorable part of this little dull rather dull mat and brush in British cuisine is Henna Steiner's rinse, one of the worst works ever. That, with the very beautiful caterpillar eyebrows on the old evil dude who was trying to steal Steiner's invention. MST3K does an admirable job of making a boring and boring funny movie. I particularly like it when Crow kills Mike and 'touches it to death', and when he revives it in the theater, Mike yells "Guy, I die, I has seen eternal truth and beauty! oh, it's this movie ... "That would be a disappointment, having returned from the afterlife to watch the rest of the projected man. The film could make a fortune sold as a sleep assistant. Some of the puns of the movie were cruel: police inspector - "electroococcus!" Crow- "shocking, is not it?" police inspector- "This is good, all right" Tom Servo- "Very low, right down the floor!" police inspector- "Can I get over?" Tom Servo- "He's been dead, but striking yourself out" MST3K is definitely the only way to watch this snoozer.
