I personally liked the "prophecy" in 1995. Christopher Walken was, as always, great, and even though the film was not impeccable, he was a movie theater and very original movie / fantasy that entertained incredibly. This inferior 1998 end is always worth seeing, but mostly due to Walken. Walken is one of the greatest actors around, in my opinion, and is once again outstanding in the role of the fall of Archangels Gabriel, whom he plays for the second time here. Again, the war between fallen and faithful Angels is brought to the earth. Gabriel returns in order to prevent the birth of a child, namely the child of Daniel the Angel (Russel Wong) and the human woman Valerie (Jennifer Beals). This child could once be the factor to determine the celestial war ... As I said above, Christopher Walken is once again excellent as Gabriel. In addition to Gabriel, however, "The Prophet II" sadly also includes a bunch of annoying annoying characters. Character of Valerie was annoying enough, and Danayel annoyed me even more. The biggest pain in the ass, however, was the character of Izzy (played by Brittany Murphy), a suicide girl who would not close. Still, Walken's performance is not just the quality of the film purchase. The entire movie is quite sad, and well-shot in dark colors, which contributes greatly to the atmosphere. Gabriel's resurrection scene at the beginning is extraordinarily quite impressive, and one of the coolest moments of any of the "Prophecies" films. "The Prophet II" is nevertheless weaker in the three "prophecies" films and Walken. Definitely a one-man-show Christopher Walken, fun, but nothing beyond that.
