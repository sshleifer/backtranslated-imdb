Terrible film was made on a budget of $ 9.99. Very obvious miniature sets use, poor acting and a terrible storyline about aliens who use abandoned meat from a butcher shop like space for spaceship. The film has some blood (not enough to disturb) with a character and an egibe replacing one of his hands. (Yes you read correctly.) <br /> <br /> A saving save was a song made in the "talent show" (how is that for iWoni?) Not a lot of new punk / new pinks that I think were called " I'm a "Missile Driver" other than this, it's not worth your time, not even on a "so bad at good" level. Look if you are in movie film film but anyone else should Steer clear. <br /> <br /> Rating: 1 out of 10
