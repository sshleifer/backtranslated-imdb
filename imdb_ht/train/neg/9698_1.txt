There are a lot of very talented movies / actors in Germany right now. None of them are associated with this "movie". <br /> <br /> Why in the world of producers actually invest money in something like this? You could have 10 good films and this garbage budget! It's not fun to have seven old men running around like a nose, pretending to be funny. What's funny though is that the movie producer (who's going to be the oldest guy in the bunch) is playing the YOUNGEST dwarf. The film is full of moments that shout for captions saying "You're supposed to laugh right now!". It's hard to believe that this crap is supposed to be a comedy. Many people actually got up and left the movie 30 minutes into the movie. I should do the same thing instead of wasting my time ... <br /> <br /> Pain!
