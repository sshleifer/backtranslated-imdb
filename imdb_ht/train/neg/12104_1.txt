Bill Maher's religious beliefs are not an attack on organized religion. It's an attack on Christianity and Islam. Apart from the ridicule of a bunch of rabbits inventing flying cars to get around the Sabbath, it really does not attack Judaism and looks ashamed when a Master actually challenges the existence of the State of Israel. If Bill Maher followed his hypothesis to conclude his logic, he would realize that the very creation of Israel in the territories of Palestine is based on the so-called 'holy books' of organized religion. This is the full proof of the lack of objectivity or the focus of the creation of this film. <br /> I find it really hard to believe that the man is atheist or even all that is intelligent. Anyone can go to a religious person and laugh at them and call them stupid for their beliefs, but what do you have to offer them in return? Nowhere does he actually tell them why he thinks they're stupid. What makes his "rational" person in the room? In a way it reflects how it really is not and in the process ends up just as stupid as such. If you want to watch a good movie / documentary about the current evil of religion and how religions can actually be detrimental to human civilization, see Richard Dawkins' Root of All Wrong? '. It's a brilliant looking documentary, clearly explaining what it is expected to achieve and how. <br /> <br /> Bill Maher's rules are not funny, poses no interesting questions or gives no insight into content controversy. It seems to be the rantements and ravings of an old man insisting with his Catholic education. I almost feel sorry for her.
