After "Central City" loses its boss to murder, Robert Armstrong's partner-in-crime (as "Doc" Rogers) decides to take radical measures to preserve continuous criminals, recruiting the mobster maloist son Richard Cromwell (as Edward "Baby Face" Morgan), in running family business. Mr. Nichif Cromwell was taken to the city, and was installed as his father's "Acme Protection Agency" President, a front for gangsters. While Cromwell sells insurances to sell insurance, his "employee" runs an extortion operation. Cromwell fell to the handsome client Mary Carlisle (like Virginia Clark); and, the duo found themselves in great danger ?? "Baby Face Morgan" captures Star Cromwell and Ms. Carlisle near the end of their "movie" promises. It's a quick, light, and harmless little crime drama. <br /> <br /> **** Baby Face Morgan (1942) Arthur Dreifuss ~ Richard Cromwell, Mari Carlisle, Robert Armstrong
