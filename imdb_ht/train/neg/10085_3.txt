Why do all cinemas ever tithe like anemic? "An unexpected love" - ​​oh, how provocative !! "Many things I know" would be best. The film has nothing special. Real people do not really speak like these characters do and the situations are really fading. The straight woman that "turns" lesbian seemed more butch than the lesbian character. If you want to watch two hot girls kissing in a very secret fashion, you might enjoy this. Although it seems like it was written by someone who does not really get out of the world to observe people. Why did I waste my time writing about it?
