Quirky, Independent, Theater, Christian Slater - these are all ads that have made me look forward to spending an hour or so "discovering" a jewelry in a movie. Boy, I was disappointed. Julian Po never gets on her head. The film is self-conscious. I found myself unable to stop unbelieving at the same time. Existence, obviously the theater, obviously theater act, the late, obviously led theater - well, you get the idea. <br /> <br /> Alegories do not need to be released sledge hammer style. And it's hard to feel so much at anything for Julian Po because we never know a lot about it. The ridiculous girlfriend, the annoying citizens, the clergy people, the bratty kids - why would anyone, particularly anyone who has an long lifetime ambition to go to the sea (Slater's character), decided to stay in a place where participation ?
