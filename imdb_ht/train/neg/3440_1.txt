Never watch this movie ... it is the biggest pile of SH * I've ever come across in my whole life. and what says something. Acting, the scenario and filming were absolutely terrifying this is the bad movie in the world !!! seriously does not even give you a hit view as it cost my 99pm from sainsburys and it was only done in 2005? hahaha this movie is like a cheap college movie you can even see the camera in the corner of the screen .... although if you really want to watch it you have to watch the "scary scene shark" ... maybe piece of pies good in the act I saw in my life ... ha ha. I mean seriously this is the biggest garbage of 2 1/2 hours EVER !!
