Priyadarshan / Paresh Rawal Combo was golden before with the likes of HERA PHERI and HUNGAMA so I went into the movie (in a multiplex American) with high hopes, especially after the Slick promos. Unfortunately, as HULCHUL before her, this film was a great disappointment. <br /> <br /> As others commented, the premise of the movie, which was already stingy to begin with, just came up and on without any development or more stratification. After a while, you just want the movie in the end so you can go home (if I was looking at this home, it would be easier to cut my losses). Akshay Kumar's performance is the best average and John Abrahams should not try to make comedy again. The comedy aspects of the movie in general were beautiful weeks. I only remember giggling like twice the entire movie. Definitely there is no street stomach beach that burns me in HERA PEACE or even to a lesser extent at AWARA PAAGAL DEVANA. Paresh Rawal has had a few of her expected time classics, but in general, because her role and character have not given many rooms to grow, she did not make much of an impact in this movie. Dhupia, who made only an appearance in the movie, was pleased to look at while she was on the screen. And some of the songs are fun. Especially the opening and closing vocals of ADA and my baby KISS, respectively. Otherwise, you're better off than just about this movie.
