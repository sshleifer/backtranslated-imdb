I saw it. It is not "good", but interesting in a understated way. The boys in it are quite natural but ................ graphics / free final stage of rape gang is repetitive and-oh the answer is the instructive arbitration of the second war The world war is offensive in the way it tries to compare real terror with this misogynistic compression. Real arthritis is real- this movie is just atrocious. However, the film has a look that can draw you in. But it seems to me that the "New Emperor's clothing", but in fact in reverse. The film looks good, but the direction, story, content and final feel you take away this movie is empty. If a feeling can be empty-that's it.
