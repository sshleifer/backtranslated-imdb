Forget 9 plans, this is the ultimate fiasco, a costume drama, unusually directed, scripted, acting, etc. This film based on Isabel Allende's novel is not-so-good. I hate Meryl Streep and Antonio Banderas (in non-Hispanic films), with the other actors, including Winona, my favorite actress and Jeremy Irons try hard to get on like a terrible script. Many errors (like, for example, since it's snow in Xmas in Chile?) And very cruel, with tons of wrong called "realism magic", this means out as the worst movie ever . It totally sucks !!!
