Three years ago, Rachel (Therese Fretwell) was born in the lake with her friends when her brother dropped out of a boat and extorted. Rachel's friends think it is time to stop beating himself up and taking blame for something he had no control over. So take the mix with something to grind and head back to the same lake that was in Rachel's constant nightmare. As expected, the blood has already begun when two of their friends are splattered before the same title of the feast. This film has the feeling of a high school where everyone has forgotten the lines and 'wings' ... very seriously! Writer Marcos Gabriel gave himself the role of meatier as Rachel's companion Leo. Outside of Fretwell and Gabriel have some nice lame acting with a few characters you would like to choke the crap out of them before they get 'off'. Give attention to a few more players who had the nerve displayed: Erin Gallagher, Andrew Williams, Jasmine Trice and Derek Nieves. This is one memorial day you would not mind missing.
