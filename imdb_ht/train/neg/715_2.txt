This sounded like a really interesting movie from the presentation. Nazi, Occult, government conspiracy. I was expecting a low budget Nazi version of the DaVinci Code or Boys from Brazil or even Shockwaves. Instead you find something quite different, more psychological, more something like David Lynch. That was actually a plus. But the way the story is said is just awful. <br /> <br /> Part of the problem is the casting. Andrienne Barbeau's character begins in moving them a bit shy and scary. He just does not do well, even at his age, though he certainly tried. The actor dropping as the son apparently thought this was a comedy. Most of the other actors also seemed to have thought this was a moviey movie, or at least acting like it, rather than merely being original. The only one I thought was really well was the daughter of Siri Baruc. Another big part is the rhythm. It starts very slowly. So slowly you might be tempted to turn it around. But then it becomes compelling for a while when you get the daughter's suicide and the consequence. But shortly thereafter, it all became a mess. Some of this was on purpose, but many of it were just unusually confusing, monotonous, and poorly focused. <br /> <br /> The real problem is simply not a nice movie to watch. It's slow, dull, none of the characters are unmatched. Abuze in imagery and lay. Some movies you see characters get tortured. In that, it's the viewer that does. It has some creepy moments, most notably the Nazi creepy paintings and credits, but the rest of the movie is mostly just tiring.
