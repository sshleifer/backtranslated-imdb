Although I enjoyed Bing Crosby in other movies, I found this movie to be particularly grateful. Maybe because I'm from a different era and a different country, but I find Crosby's continuous references to the nice Old USA beautiful first, trite after a while and then finally annoying. Do not get me wrong - I'm not anti-American too - but it seemed that the English could not have any rights and / or need this brave, oh so smart American visitors are showing the way. It's a "fish out of water" story, but unlike most movies this sort, this time it's the "fish" with the upper hand. To be fair to both myself and the movie, I watched her a few times spaced over a few years and get the same impression every time. <br /> (I saw another Crosby movie last night - the Emperor Waltz - and that, too, produces the same reaction of me. And to my surprise even my wife - who for what's worth the American - found in "face" the attitude of American Crosby to be disappointing.One too many references to Teddy Roosevelt, as he put it.) As for the site of the film, it's unique enough for its day and cast in support is of course very good. The landscape and the music are also good, as are the great costumes - although I agree with a review before that the wig on William Bendix looks surprised (pictures Moe in the three stooges). for me this would be a more enjoyable picture without the attitude of Bing Crosby but because it is in virtually every shot it is very difficult to sit in this movie.
