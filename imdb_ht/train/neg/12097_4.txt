I did not really expect so much when I went to see it. After Mst3king emails from JasonX and some friends though, I was hoping for a similar experience here. Unfortunately the movie has taken itself too seriously. Am I concerned about Jason's problems? I'm sorry no. There is a Ft13th vegetable film covering that anyway. At that time at the end of the day, it is an undead serial killer, I just will not find that sympathetic. Freddy was by far the most interesting aspect of the film and hallucinations and what not, but unfortunately were few and far between and at the end of the movie, he was degenerate into a bad episode of celebrities deathmatch ... only not funny. <br /> <br />
