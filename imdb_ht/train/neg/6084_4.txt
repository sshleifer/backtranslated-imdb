It is possible that someone named Sledge might have done irreparable damage to the chairs room floor. Perhaps somebody is asking a cutter director one day, but I seriously doubt it. James Garner decided the money on the Western Spaghetti Market and in doing so brought a lot of Americans on filling the cast out. Like John Weaver, Claude Akins, John Marley. And of course we have Vic Morrow who both wrote and directed this movie. <br /> <br /> Garner always gets cast as horrendous because it is so darn good in the plays. But she played seriously and did it well in such movies as Children and Time in the Armor. It can and has broken away from its stereotype normally successfully. But someone called Sledge can not count as one of his successes. He has the title role as Luther sledge notoriously crushed with a great price on his head. After Tony Young's partner died in a saloon and Garner took appropriate Eastwood measures, he was followed by the saloon by John Marley. <br /> <br /> The Marley spent time in the nearby territorial prison and it looks as though the gold shipments placed under lock and keys have on a rest stop for how to transport the stuff on a regular run. Garner gets her gang together for an heist. <br /> Here's where the movie goes totally to the wall. Usually heist films show the protagonists go through a lot of methodological planning. Certainly that was the case of the war wagon with some other reviews cited. But in one Garner this decided to break into the prison as a prisoner of fake US Marshal Dennis Weaver and caused a jailbreak at which time gold will be robbed. <br /> <br /> That was just too much swallow. If you take the gold was easy this should be a long time before. But I'm going to tell people who love the blood and bowels of western Italy, while prison breaks have enough for three cinemas. That's not all, of course the bans fall out and we have another gurney farm before the movie ends. But by this time the whole movie has lost a lot of connotation. The singer movie great Thian Allan Jones listed in the credits. But for my life I can not get it into the movie. Maybe a chorus of donkeys serenade might make this better. <br /> <br /> Could not hurt any.
