I could not give this movie a bad rating or bad reviews for two reasons: Robin Williams and Toni Collete. The film has the potential of being a thriller and there are some slight disturbing elements that leak the psychological that something the movie could focus a little over. Robin Williams plays Gabriel Noon, a story story nightjay story that will go into personal matter: his lover will move out and Gabriel will have what looks like a case of the racquet block. One day she receives a story written by an 14-year-old boy named Pete Boland (Rory Culkin). Talk about the story of her life and abuse she suffered from her parents. He lives with mother adopting it with social worker, Donna Boland (Toni Collette). Gabriel is captivating and starting a friendship with Pete, but things seem strange when Gabriel attempts to meet him and discovering the possibility that Pete Boland may not even exist. I will not go into detail because I do not want to spoil the movie, but I'll tell you this: it is quite predictable. The fascinating atmosphere of telling a story with good performance at Robin Williams and Toni Collette, whom I thought is the key feature film. Collette is without question one of the most talented and beautiful actresses. His ability to tap into the psyche and the personality of the characters it shows is very puzzling and I hope to see it has an Oscar (Hell, I think it might pull on getting a better support actress for this one if the script was a little better). The film starts off as a psychological thriller, but one predictable one. If you are curious about the movie's end and twists, then see the movie otherwise I would rent another predictable thriller called "Hide and Seek".
