This movie is so, so is so horrible, that it makes angels lose their wings. Shaq tried to make other crossings, such as his work at Shaq-Fu for the NES and many of his unbearable Rap albums, and later, serving in the epic film making the movie Steel. There's not one good thing to be said about this movie. I've seen it a lot of times when I was very young, but I must have been a fool person then, because this film takes everything that is enjoyable on film and tears apart. It's fun to mock. I saw it on the Disney Channel shortly back and spent a few minutes doing this. Although, once the thrill of mocking it is done, you always become overwhelmed by its terribleness. <br /> <br /> If you see it on TV, try this: consider, as you watch the movie, remove from it all the scenes that Shaq uses his magic genius power. If you do, he gets like a movie about a pedophile chasing a kid and reminds him to seduce him. That's kind of funny, and disturbing. A terrible example of film. Not, unless you're mocking, watch this movie.
