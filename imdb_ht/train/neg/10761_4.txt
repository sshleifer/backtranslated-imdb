This movie was a mess. It had absolute worst correction I've ever seen. It was almost like the end of a scene the writer wanted to go to commercial, and the cinema added a second of black screens to accomplish dream writers. <br /> Under the dirty and edgy direction, there was a glaze of something good. A good idea, a compelling spark. But somewhere he goes wrong. <br /> The story is about a quasi-psychic priest who tries to solve a string of murder. The hardest thing to bite is Richard Grieco as a priest. Well the party does not call for him to be a good priest and succeeds well. The second problem is Dennis Hopper as the bad guy is bad. He always plays the bad guy. Very hum. <br /> Oh, a thought happened to me that perhaps all the haze, horrific editing and disconnecting sketch was trying to add a sense of confusion to the character (Grieko) experienced. And just proved that it was flawless to roll the creditors creditors. Not a good sign for any movie. <br /> <br />
