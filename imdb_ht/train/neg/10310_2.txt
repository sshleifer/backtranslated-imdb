Lorenzo Lamas star as some kind of CIA agent, who captures some exotic beauty named Alexa, kidnaps her daughter and forces her to fight her former boss. O.J Simpson is also on board providing a grip of acting credibility for the ensemble not so talented. I must admit I'm not a fan of Lorenzo Lamas, or his movies. He feels. However, when compared with Kinmont, O.J Simpson and Lamas' comatose wife, Lamas looks like ah, Jean-Claude Van Damme. I just saw the CIA because they were interested in renewing the OJJ Simpson trial, you see, because if your parents had cable and extra channels, you could not escape this movie. In 1994 you could go to an Amish community and some morons would have this on their portable TV. The film itself is a collection of sexual action sequences and should be intruding although the shock value of O.J Simpson jumps after fireballs and exchanges would be one material to give some unintentional humor. Also where did Bobby Knight and Kobe Bryant do this a classic full camp? <br /> <br /> * from 4- (bad)
