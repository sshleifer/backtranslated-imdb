By 1941 Columbia was a full-fledged studio and could produce a film and even the Polish technique as MGM, Paramount or Warners. This is the best thing that could be said about Adam's "four sons," a lead soap opera and almost bogus performing performance by Ingrid Bergman (top-first-time billing in an American movie) and Warner Baxter. Bergman plays a French woman (that was the era of which Hollywood thought an alien accent was as good as another) was hired as governor of Baxter's son and stayed on (with one interruption caused by the stock injury -mach in 1907) until the boys are old men serving in the First World War. Just about everyone in the movie is so goody-good it's a relief when Susan Hayward as the villainess enters the Midway? she is the only person to look at the movie even though she was clearly channeling Bette Davis and Vivien Leigh; it's also the first in her long succession to the role of alcohol ?? but the script remains sacred and the end is absolutely hindered. No wonder Bergman has turned into the same "Scheme of Decision" scheme four years later.
