The plot and the characters are ridiculous and barely skilled as "plot" and "character". The biggest problem is the fact that everything is black, out-of-focus, and disturbing. The fact that Fulci full movie and steam do not help. On the other hand, the whole thing is completely scarce and fraught with sex and violence. Inconsistencies are very fun, one of the main characters says he has no friends, yet he snatches on the new guy in a minute of screen time, and has a whole gaggle of women on the side. Even if it shows anti-social trends it's not randomly set an arrow to some poor b ***** d that's just her own business idea! Images of blood or flowing gurus are getting more attention than the characters, but what you want from Fulci. Maybe it ruined his career, but he was not really more stupid than zombie. Worth a location if you love floating Italian flicks or are desperate for swords and sorcery or something rare. How do you sleep in someone getting sucked into a 2 feet hole from yourself and screaming for help?
