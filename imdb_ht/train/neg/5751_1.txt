The film must be shot in a day, there are scenes where you can see the camera reflections and its red tips, even the green light landscape that mixes with the actors !!! The plot and their lines are really awful without even slighter inspiration (at least as a movie genre film) .All that has happened to Poe in the movie, has a deep and infinite approach. The movie is full of climbs and no typing. If you want to watch a funny movie b-for a relaxing evening with friends then go for it you will enjoy it (as I did), but no how to take this movie seriously!
