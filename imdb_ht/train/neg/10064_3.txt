The movie Pok√©mon was a horrible movie. Unlike the first one, this is not a good movie at all. The graphics were decent but the story was flat and no real drama built up in it. In one of the first interactions between characters were decent. The subtraction of Brock with the addition of tracey was bad. Tracey really does not have much to say or do, and unlike brock offers no comforters. The only good points are you get to see misty actually get jellyfish on Ash, and it's early brooding about being called girlfriend. Overall this film is not worth renting with the short film before doing nothing for my wife or my wife. and we consider ourselves pokemon fans.oh well, maybe the next one will be best
