Garbage in time is a completely necessary remake of a big movie. Nothing new or original has been added other than Perry's effects, which are of marginal interest. She lacks the feeling of documentary in the first movie and the raw emergency that made it so effective. Also lacking is the sharp Quincy Jones band that adds to many of the original films. I can not understand any high ratings for this at all. It's very bad. Why anyone loses time or money crap like this and why have I wasted time watching it?
