For starters, I would like to say that I'm a fan of the American Pie series. Though the 'naked mile' and this one are the worst, this one seems to be falling in the whole series. <br /> <br /> First of all, the best part of the movie was that it was an American movie act, which is always appreciated. However, there are tons of bad things said about this movie. First of all, the story has a very 'agile' structure structure. First, there is the introduction of the characters, then the commitment of the beta home and finally the Greek Olympiad. Each of which has exactly 25 minutes in length. Apart from the overall array of the draw, there is little no character development, which makes a double whammy in a bad plot. <br /> <br /> In addition, I deeply overlook the stereotype of this movie. That is, showing the jocks as the men are very cool, just-thinking-about-sex, and expressly showing the geeks as inferior. Also, it shows women only as sexual objects, and men only want to treat brunks as sexual objects. <br /> <br /> Apart from that, the act was also poor. And maybe the exception of Steve Talley. <br /> So, in the end, a generally surprised movie, if viewed from a critical point of view. If you see in a teenage viewpoint, I guess it's best, but this movie is rated 18+ in most countries, so it should not really be seen by miners.
