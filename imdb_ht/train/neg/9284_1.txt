Man, even Plan 9 Exterior space is better than this movie. This flicker film does not have enough scheme for half an hour, but they managed to extend it to an eternity of more than an hour. Jet Li and Corey Yuen are very good, especially in those exaggerated battle scenes, but things like legend in Fong Sai Yuk are better than this regret that might be best left unmade.
