Interesting? Diman. The 'scientific evidence' film provides for its points (which is fundamental to the Jews being a cancerous) so stupid and lame, it's almost ridiculous (if we did not know what happened in that era) . / Important? Nah. I can not imagine German (even at this time serious) would like or believe this movie. Compare it to the Riefenstahl Triumf des Willens. Now that my movie was impressed with. This is just unusual waste. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < . In the eyes of these movie-makers, only an uninhabited idea can do that. Uh-huh. Did not know I was Hitler's favorite movie, right? <br /> No, it's just plain STUPID. Even for Nazi propaganda genre. 2/10.
