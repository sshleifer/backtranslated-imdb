There are some good things about the movie. The music and movies are great. Alex Wilson is warm and gives a great performance. Ryan Bauer is also warm. The production was very likely to have been cast because they really gave production value to the movie. Jonny Vincent (Sean) and a lot of the boys in the movie who are not talking are nice too. Why is not the actress playing Amy listed in the credits? Brandon Alexander gives a great performance as Pink Clitarissa. <br /> <br /> The worse thing about the film is probably the star James Townsend. It can not act. It's also very scrawny, not nice to look at all. Its arms like spaghetti. It's disgusting. They have no muscle tone at all. It's no wonder he made his own movie and threw himself into it. No one would throw it into anything. <br /> James Townsend is not credible as someone who would even have a girlfriend because he acts so gay. They should have cast someone else as the lead if they wanted the best thing for the movie. Then again, maybe he just wants to use this movie as a car to launch a career in soft-core pornography, definitely not real act because it would take some lessons to act. Plus, anyone who makes pornography is the Hollywood index. The most ridiculous thing about the movie is probably to drop off in a time-skinned Latina as Devon's mother. Sonja Fisher does not seem to be an actress at all. All of this, this movie is soft-core pornography and not much better than anything you'd ever seen on Skinemax. I think that even Alex Wilson, probably the best thing about this movie, is embarrassed by it and does not want to be associated with it. There is no photo on his IMDb page and nothing else listed, so Alex Wilson is probably a decent step name. Plus, I ran into him in West Hollywood once a day and when I mentioned this movie, he just turned around and walked away. I understand. If I worked on this movie, I should be embarrassed and would not want to be associated with it either.
