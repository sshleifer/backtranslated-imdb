To be honest as possible, the Devil plays (or the veil of blood or Vampire Ecstasy or the curse of Black Sisters or ????) is a complete makeup. The movie has a good quote behind it ?? The resurrection of a long vampire killed in the body of a descent of help and assistance in a group of women dressed in black ?? but the execution is terrible. There are great, long moments of time when screen literally nothing happens. Character just stands up and nothing to do. There are no mysteries, no suspicions, and no draw point to care about. The act is simply abusive. Most of the act involves a group of middle-aged women dancing naked while staring at the camera. They do this repeatedly. And what little sketch has seems to be designed to get more of those less attractive than naked women in order to join in their dancing. While it's not as bad or pointless as the dance or the plot of something like the orgy of the Dead, it comes close.
