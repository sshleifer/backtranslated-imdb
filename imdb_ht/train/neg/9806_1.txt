I can not for my life explain the popularity of children's TV shows, power guard is all over. <br /> I never understood why unsuspecting children liked this show in the first place, since the characters seem idiotic and not worth caring for them too. <br /> <br /> The costumes look completely atrocious, such as multi-colored spandex that people wear to go to the gym. <br /> <br /> What exactly is this aim to show anyways, but for kids to learn how to fight to solve their problems? What to lift and cut the terrible hairs, and clothes this show anyway? Not to mention this show still playing on cable TVs, just to make money for teaching kids how to fight each other when they do not agree on a problem. It's not as gullible as children in the 1990s were watching this show. <br /> Oh, and what went up with the erotic era tension between the red and green guards anyway?
