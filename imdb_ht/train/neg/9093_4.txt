I saw this film today for the first time and I have never heard of it before, probably because it's poor message. <br /> <br /> First of all, directing itself is quite good, the actors played well with the CGI (not a fan of CGI) is magnificent. But alone does not make a movie. No story at all, no message behind beautiful talent exploited. <br /> Or do I have to remind people, the art of a director is not just your vision, but they know how to tell a story. And this is what's missing all 7 minutes. <br /> There for a simple 4 rating.
