This movie is a 90 minute Ramones concert and short periods of stupidity and absolute boredom. What kind of high school is anyway? <br /> <br /> Unless you're a great Ramones fan, DO NOT and I repeat your waste time as I did. This is absolutely unwatchable from start to finish. This film should be called Ramone Fever. Everyone looks like they are in this movie. There is not a draw to be found in this movie flick. As far as teenage comedy goes, you are scratching the bottom of the barrel with this one.
