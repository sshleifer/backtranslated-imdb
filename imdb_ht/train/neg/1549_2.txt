While Leon is beautiful on SNL, it's just about for a minute. Like most SNL skits-to-movies, this one can not fill 90 minutes. It has some nice moments (these you have seen in the trailer) but the actors are widely wasted. Tim Meadows does his best, but the draw just does not have much high points. Does Farrell have a small part. Farrell can be the funniest man ... but not in this film. What a shame.
