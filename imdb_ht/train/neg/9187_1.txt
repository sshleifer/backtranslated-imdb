I watched some very poor films in the past, but the hell they thought when they made this movie. The production crew has turned into zombies when they came up with the idea of ​​doing it, because you make sure to be dead brain to get any fun of it. <br /> I'm a fan of most genres and enjoy "shooting 'em up" games, but merging the Daft scenes from the game just made this ridiculous and unwatchable. <br /> <br /> As most have already said, there was hardly any script and act of weakness. I will not waste my time describing it. <br /> Anyone who this movie rate above 4 has to be part of the production company or Sega, or else they have a very genuine concept of entertainment. > <br /> I must say, I was more annoyed with the video shop, who gave this a thumb up, which led me to rent it. Thank God I had a second movie to watch for restoring some of my faith in film. <br /> <br /> Funny comic book guys would be good if he said "Worst movie ever"!
