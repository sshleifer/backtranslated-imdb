The film has some easy aspects. Maybe too much for my taste. It felt as if the writer / director was desperately trying to get us to feel the inner conflict of all his characters. Not once, a few times ... but ever. <br /> <br /> This is the work of TV, not movies. <br /> <br /> Where the train station was well selected and I enjoyed Sascha Horler's performance as a friend. <br /> I feel like Justine Clarke's performance. His reaction to stuff was felt forced, as if the director was trying to vocalize the themes of the movie in his protagonist expression. I also can not believe that a director can make Daniela Farinacci beautiful in an incredible presence. <br /> I can not understand the choice of pop music to slip over the whole sequence. This is a lazy device, especially where the pop music comes from any diets where in the movie and / or where the lyrics of the song feel embarrassingly reliable. <br /> <br /> That said, there is a breeze quality on the film that recalls the Australian heat and local attitudes and originality. It creates an atmosphere of heat and sun. Especially with the use of wonderful animation sequences that delivers the movie from full mediocrats, infusions and passion and charm but crafted. I'm curious why the dialogue feels too much work. "Who knows if there's a god like some guys sitting up in the sky telling us what to do" or whatever line was. <br /> <br /> Perhaps one of the most embarrassing moments was the friend to return home from cricket and a bunch of flowers to declare his wife "I give up smoking." A commercial anti-smoking? An TAC ad with some tastier animation? I had to leave the movie in the 50-minute mark - it was all too much.
