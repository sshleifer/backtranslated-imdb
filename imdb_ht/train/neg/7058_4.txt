I came to NEW PORT SOUTH to expect a surrogate film on the Columbine school massacre similar to the GUS Van Center's ELEPHANT and certainly the Summary of TV guide stating that a student rebel corporation has given me this impression but that's is a very boring movie where little happens so consider yourself warned <br /> The story is about Maddox, a Chicago high school student who decides to strike back into what he perceives to be an authoritarian regime. The biggest problem is that the character is underwritten with the actor who plays it Blake Shields is able to embellish any script deficiency. You have feelings of bowels that Maddox should have the charisma of evil in Hitler, Saddam or Bin Laden but it never comes across anything more than a pesky teenager tricks and it's impossible to believe he can assemble any follower. The subtext reverses only one manipulative authoritarian regime only by replacing it with another manipulative regime is too obvious that means NEW PORT SOUTH is an entirely compelling drama that is not worth going from the way you see
