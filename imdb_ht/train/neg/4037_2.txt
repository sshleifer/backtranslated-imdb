I have no idea what the producers of the Shield are trying to do, but the result is for itself: The Shield is practically unwatchable. <br /> <br /> Supposedly the performance on the shield is great ... <br /> <br /> In fact, the show is so badly combined that you can not even really see their performance. For example, the correction is cut off from the reaction shots before they have full impact. <br /> I do not know why intellectuals do, but it depicts the show of emotional impact. <br /> I'll give Shield a point for ambition in its subjects, but that's pretty much all I can give it. <br /> It's a shame to see a number of gift garbage gift givers on something so strange to seriously filmed.
