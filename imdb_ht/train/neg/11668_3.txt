There are beautiful flowering landscape shots. Writers put shaved mouths on the actors' mouths. And younger actors show this would be funny. 'Art shall be mankind's humanity or BS it.' Not so because the art of all these people is also shaming humanity and expressing the dark side. Lead character even says those who do not drink hid by the shadow. Bad, he lived in darkness and repressed his dark side by drinking and being one dimension by expanding his horizons and something more than landscapes. There was not an organism evenly at work, nor the expression of his pain. All the artist has limited himself to cents in a dozen scenery. Discussions between the school's classroom characters, trite things still give character to one upper but the wanted writer. I tried to love it after reading all the first wow reviews about here. I had to dig deep to see what I agreed to. I calculated the great comments from people connected to the movie. I moved only once towards the end. The kid was too passive. The scenery was beautiful and the ridiculous music. Just my opinion but nowhere to show me.
