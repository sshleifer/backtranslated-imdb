Charlotte's dangerous beauty and lethal envoy makes movie much cooler than it should be otherwise.The story is so poor and Charlotte's death is dying in such a crazy way, that you wonder if that's the end of the thought of this movie. I hope one can say that an alternative finish exists, but I fear it is not. As for the rest of the cst, well I would say they simply did not act very well; although the blame should be placed on the poor script. This movie reminds me of Rush Hour 2 where Zhang Ziyi died in absurd style, since he was the only one who stole the show during the whole movie. I could give this movie 2/5
