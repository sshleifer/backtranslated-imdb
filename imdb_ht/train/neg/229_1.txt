They took this on IFC yesterday, and they can not believe the positive reviews! Was I the only one who thought these "ladies" were anything but? Kate said Jed he could get fired because he was supposed to be a pillar in the community, but put it for him! Then they suddenly decide they're in love? And it's so devastating about her death, she does not go to her funeral, much less, tell her family the "good news"! By the way, how does an American get to be the headmistress of a British inappropriate school? Janine should have been stepping up the force for her invincible abuse of power, but nothing happens! And he winds up tackling his way into questioning! And the less said about Molly, the better! As for the Janine and Molly's guilty feeling about Jed, please! It's Punk's own damon fault she's back in roadkill! Where's the guilt of poor Gerald, who gets puked over? If only I could do the same in the bosoms behind this "movie"!
