In the case of half of this film the movie looks unusual to familiarize, it means you look too much way to this Italian gypsy-crap crap! To see, the notorious Demigod Lucio Fulci did not only produce this film, he also took the liberty of re-utilizing the most silly sequences killed in his own (and easier to track) "Cat's Brain ". The opening stage previously, in which a brutally unpopular whore is featured in an ax, features of Fulci's later film and makes a handful of killings and sleazy moments. The "Massacre" Andrea Bianchi has failed miserably as a giallo, since the search for the sadistic killer among a movie-team shooting a horror movie is all but compelling and thrilling, but it's still good entertainment if you're in cheap 'n garbage hazardous waste. The incoherent script introduces a whole bunch of reputable characters that are full of potential menus, but none of Biachi's red heria comes with them is possible and you can point out the killer almost immediately. Whatever remaining to enjoy is the really misogynous make-up effects and the hilariously awesome performing performance of cast into ensembles. Whenever there is no bloodshed on screen, such as between the first and second killers, "massacre" is a slow and almost intolerable dialogue with its innovation and photography quite aroused. Fortunately in the second half, women are getting nailed on fences and men were briefly repeated with rusty spikes. The music is crap and used in where filming is very inimagable. My advice should skip this puppy and go straight to the aforementioned "cat in the brain". One features all the great moments of "massacre", and then some.
