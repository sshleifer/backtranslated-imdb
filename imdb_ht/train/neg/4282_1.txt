I simply cant understand why all such relics from the Ceausescu era refuse to let go. One can clearly see how frustrated they were during the censorship order that prevented them from displaying their cinemas, and now they imagined their great deal of artistic arts-fartsy freedom so filling the screen with flawed people, , vomiting, swearing, and any other horrible kind of imaginable. SA A PA CINEMA, FRIENDS AND BAGAY! This is suddenly visual pervertion. Forget about Bunuels Chien Andalou, on David Lynch, on Forman and neorealism and other movie makers who could work with an aesthetics of lewd. Those who have mastered their work - well, you do not! Do us a favor, all of you Daneliucs and Nicolaescus and Saizescus and Muresans and Marinescus and Margineanus and other old-timers, and let us alone! Its little time to see some Romanian on screen, enough with your immature terribilism! You are not director, you are ILLITERATE !!!
