The show is average. It does not make me laugh particularly. However, I think Courtney really brought her down. It does not look natural. It has three ways to speak, all robotic. He speaks slowly (with no intonation), he speaks normally (with no intonation), or does the thing in which he starts talking normally, and he begins to call gradually. However, calling it is like "let's pretend I'm crying loudly because I should not be too loud about the series." <br /> It is always aware of himself that this beautiful actress does this funny thing. It's annoying. You can not really find her personality, because it does not really produce emotions, and it's not upset. She had this husband, who is doing all this stupid, and there is no reaction from it. Very dry and plain acting.
