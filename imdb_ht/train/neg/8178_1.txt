Have you ever sat watching a movie when 20 or 30 minutes have gone and suddenly you realize that you've actually seen the movie before? This happened to me with the "Young Graduates". The coverage of the video box, if you can find the video, is very misleading. I would swear that the two women on the cover are not even in the movie. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I've either made a decade too late to appreciate the finer points in this movie or ... it's simply junk sense. I'm strongly leaning toward the letter but I guess some have developed a connection to this movie. <br /> <br /> Hmm ... draw. A draw. Let's see ... there must be a plot around here somewhere. No, I can not find it. It's pretty nice about some senior high school acting dopey and making drugs and speaking in a language that has become outdated for decades ago. One of the female students has a break on his teacher. The teacher has a frigid wife (whom she really refers to as an iceberg) so she is receptive to the girl's progress. There's a lot of driving around with inovan dialing and plenty of dancing. Our chat, BooBoo, has been transferred by high school children to dance. He looked with amazing intensity as the dancers girated and shook on the dance floor. It is good to see that at least one species has found something interesting in this way. 1/10
