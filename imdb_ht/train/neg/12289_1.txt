I'm sick of the movie that sounds entertaining in a one-line synopsis then ends up being equal to what you would find in the center of a compost pile. <br /> <br /> Who knows: "magic" might have sounded interesting at a pitch in the studios, even with a "big cast cast" (like Blair and Hasselhoff - wink-wink, nudge-nudge) with the love of bulging at Hildegard Knef (I duno, some women ...). <br /> But on film, it just falls apart faster than a paper-wrapping sculpture in a rainy storm. It seems that the unfortunate ones are trapped in an island castle in the eastern coastline, and one of them (a woman, I would guess) is being targeted by a satan carrying the child in hell while others are off grotesque, fluttering ways. <br /> Okay, right there you have a cross section of the cemetery from the "Exorcist", "The Ommen", "The Little Little Indians" and a few other smaller movies of Satanic-worshipers-Courier-Amok lines. None of it is very fun and for the most part, you will master your way from the stage scene until it's over. <br /> No, not even Linda Blair and David Hasselhoff help many things. They're just about to pick up a check and do not seem very intent on giving it "all". From viewing her, Hasselhoff probably wants to get back on the stick with Pam Anderson (and who can blame her?) And Linda ... well, who knows; a celebrity PETA benefit or pro-am golf tour or whatever it is in nowadays. <br /> And the turtle scene! Ecchhhh. You will see people get their mouths sewn shut, hanging inside roaring fireplaces, blackened by trees during a violent storm, the vessels burst out of the strokes, etc., etc. Sheesh, and I thought "the brand of the devil" was that The most sadistic movie I would see .... <br /> <br /> Do not worry. It's not worth your time. I can not believe I told you as much as I did. If you look at it, just see if you can count the clicks. And yes, Blair gets owned, as if you did not see down Main Street followed by a lot of markets. "Witchery" - these witches will give you itching.
