What a shame! I checked this out hope that it would be an unknown James Garner gem and what a stinker it turned out to be! The quality of the product was good, but the draw was endlessly lame and I can honestly say that I'm only an older couple of hours and a lot of dumber right now. The movie really had no kind of rachites and if this kind of stuff caught out, it would give Hallmark a bad name. For those of you who insist on knowing what it was about, it's about nothing, and in that case, it's not a good thing. We are victims of looking at an old woman who is one of the dumbest creatures ever to roam the earth, who happens to marry with a real love that is probably the only living person that could be set up with him '. He dragged him into a mess after another, getting him into one nasty situation after another, and proud of himself ever. Then the movie ends. What a relief was! Not worth the time it would take to watch it, so make yourself a favor and skip this one, you'll be glad you did if you knew how bad this one really is.
