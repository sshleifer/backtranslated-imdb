(NOTE: I thought I should only one write what I did below, but I see the others here agree. I guess it was pretty obvious - this was overdoing the bit of bait-to-chat. Anything here is what I wrote :) <br /> <br /> The owners have left on vacation for two weeks - a trip to California - leaving the cattle (Sylvester) all alone and close to home la. That means there is no milk, but the cat, in his relief, finds a bunch of tones in boxes. However, in his dismay, he can not find the box. <br /> It looks out the little mouse in the house to have it ... and cook the cat with it. This is a significant rodent that keeps bother Sylvester and the box and then yanking it to the last second. Sylvester tries everything possible to open the tones but can not do it. <br /> <br /> This is a frustrating story, and why to make the sadistic mouse the "good guy" is beyond me. It's like some of the Tom & Jerry cartoons where poor Tom always gets the worst of it though many times the mouse starts to start the controversy!
