We are not in the fairy tale of the nude emperor. We can confess the truth of what we see, without stupid, confessed, that this show is in many aspects just incomprehensible and that it is clear that many of it created from pure intuition without real concept. Well, obviously many people like these things. I do not. I prefer to think and plan show. And I also confess, the show is more serious for my taste and boring ... These are love and drug history ... There are so many interesting soaps and lots of suspense (Dallas example), but Twin Peaks can not catch my attention. I do not care about these people, except Cooper and Gordon Cole.
