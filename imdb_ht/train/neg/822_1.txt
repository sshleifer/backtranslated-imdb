There are really two sections in this movie. Firstly there is the mockery prologue of the film that is so hysterical and cornball that it would almost feel appropriate that the 'Simpsons' Troy McClure should make the narration. <br /> Then the rest of the movie starts (starting with a title song that really does not fit in with the rest of the movie) which, while technically OK, is killed by a wavy, consistent and compelling draw and not just worthwhile character, but characters that make no sense. <br /> This is especially so with Mickey Rooney's Spiventa, who was supposedly on the plot and part of the 'organization' the whole time again what would happen had Hackman made the seemingly arbitrary decision to take it together when break out? In that case it would have been a totally useless and necessary character, which in the end it still is. <br /> <br /> The general problem of the film is that it's totally unwilling to put any detail on who or what is behind this scheme. It is as if the filmmakers did not have the courage to say that a particular section of society could create such an organization and instead dwell on the hope that a lack of explanation would suffice and the audience would form their own conclusions. br /> <br /> Put simply, the movie fails on all levels.
