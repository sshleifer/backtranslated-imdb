This movie was terrible in the worst way: you just did not care. You did not care what happened in the draw; you did not care about the characters. Everyone was devoid of heart. I ended up walking over a 45 minutes in it because I simply did not want to suggest my mind to read any more. There are many sex in the movie. Sex can be okay; He can even make the movie (hence the karma sutra) but the sex here was not nice or sexy. It was just ugly. Do not see this movie.
