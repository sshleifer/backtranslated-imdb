Robert Altman's resilience, New-fangled West from Edmund Naughton's book "McCabe" has neglected at its release time, but in the past years has garnered a sterling criticism. Aside from a boom-city scenario complimentary conviction, the characters here do not deserve much interest, and the picture looks (intentionally) brackish and unappealing. Bearded Warren Beatty plays a turn-of-the-century entrepreneur who is resolved to fight neighborhood communities in nowhere and helps organize the first brothel; Once the profits begin to come in, Beatty is naturally ominous by hard cities that want a part of the action. Altman creates a solemn atmosphere, wine for the film that gives the audience a certain sense of time and place, but the action in this little city is sorry to limit - most of the story are made up of vines - with Altman's rhythms is deliberately slow. There is hardly a statement made (just the opposite, in fact) and the curtain actors staring at each other without much on their minds. It's a self-beat picture, and yet, in an altogether-original way, it wears down with pride. ** from ****
