From Director of Barbet Schroder (Reverse of Fortune), I think I've seen a bit of this in my Study Media class, and I recognize the leading actress, so I tried it, despite the rating by the critics . Basically cool kid Richard Haywood (Ryan Gosling Half Nelson) and Justin Pendleton team (Michael Pitt Bully) team kill a random girl to challenge themselves and see if they can go with it without the police to get them. Investigating the murder is detective bond 'The Hyena' Mayweather (Sandra Bullock) and new partner Sam Kennedy (Ben Chaplin), who are very baffled by evidence found on the scene, e.g. which does not relate to hair. The plan does not seem to be completely going well because Cassie and Sam do quickly have Richard or Justin as suspicious, it's just a matter of whether they can be the officers. Also begins Agnes Bruckner as Lisa Mills, Chris Penn as Ray Pen, R.D. Call as Captain Rod Cody and Tom Verica as Asst. D.A. Al Swanson. I can now see the same concept as Sir Alfred Hitchcock's code and the murder for something challenging, but this movie makes it in a very funny way, and not even a good reasonable Bullock can save it from being mat and predictable. Adequate Yearly!
