Body Slam (1987) is a horrible film out there. The low budget rex, the direction is pedestrian (at best) and the writing and acting are lame. But if you are in old school struggles (about 1970 to mid-80) then you'll be much more entertained than the average viewer. I have to warn you, this movie feels on ice. I gave her a two because I felt like being generous. This turkey was "directed" by suppressing Master Hal Needham. The stars are Roddy Piper, the Tonga Kid with a bunch of writers rubbing with actor c-lis (Dirk Benedict). Summarizing this "film" is about a developer who wants to combine "rock hair" and wrestling. But others do not want him to succeed. There are more but I do not want to SPOIL it for you. If you can stomach the bad act and storyline story, there is a few surprises near the end for hard-lite fan fans. I would not recommend this to my worst enemies (and I mean it).
