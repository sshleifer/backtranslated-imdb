I'm a big fan of Steag Seagal. Hell, I probably do as much as it does though I do not have the credible in the frizzy-mullet-ponytail sports street. Having declared my own bitterness and affection for America's heartfelt cooperation with screen heroes, it is with a heavy heart that I must declare this to be his worst movie ever. I'm not sure he could make a movie any worse than that. <br /> In her defense the biggest problems and this film seems to reach post-production. It's painfully obvious that this film was supposed to have a different storyline. This results in voiceovers voiceovers in which Steve's voice is not nearly synchronized with that of the armed voice. The correction is pisspoor and in general this starts bad, gets even worse, and in the end you will wish you had rewatched the Da Vinci Code instead. Yes, it's bad. <br /> And I do not know what to expect from Steve. My friend always laughs at me to listen to his CD. Is it my time to start checking out some of Damme's direct winds in DVD nutty logs? If you are tempted to watch this movie, rip your eyeballs out and paste them down the toilet. A life of darkness is better than 89 minutes in this.
