I wasted my time and showed this a chance. This has to be one of the worst new shows. If a premium was given to show that this sucker should sweep the category. The act is poor with the comparable story line. Now dinosaur was a bit strange but at least it was fun. This shows lasting three seasons and finally scratched. This new show, based on an advertising insurance company, is not funny and really nothing goes for it. It is possible for the original ads and the amount of time they were, and always, repeatedly is wrong with this show. It just got TV and already we are tired of seeing the characters "caveman".
