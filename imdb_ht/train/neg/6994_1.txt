When I went and saw this movie, I had great expectations. But I was so bad. This movie was exactly like all other horror movies. It's a virus, zombie etc. Exactly as Resident Evil and many, many other movies. But the difference with this, and other movies, is that the story is very week. It's bad actors and boring music. The picture is OK but the rest is crap total. Do not see this film "movie", go and see the Ring 2 or any other movie in the most of a story. I hope they will stop making horror movies with a virus and the virus spread and make people zombies. We've seen enough of it. The only good thing in the movie is when they stand in a roof and famous shoot, infected celebrities.
