It's not my fault. My girlfriend made me look at her. <br /> <br /> There is nothing positive to say about this movie. There have been many years an idea that Madonna can act but it can not. There was an idea for years that Guy Ritchie is a great director but it is only substandard. An embarrassment all round. <br /> <br />
