The soul of an ancient mummy is transferred to one of his followers so that he could punish all who are involved in the wilderness of his grave. Transferring the soul to the young man's age at a tremendous speed until it even looks like a mummy. One by one, the blood is drained from people involved in the dig. <br /> <br /> In order to be as short as possible, Pharaoh's curse is the subtle affair. While the film presents a few good, original ideas (without mummy sucking, soul transfer, stimulating make-up effects, candy arms, etc.) and a few atmospheric moments, the direction and pace are the very definition of plodding. To make matters even worse, the first 15 in the movie relatively short 66 minutes exe is comprised of nothing more than padding. I usually go for these slow film moving mummies, but Pharaoh's cursing tests test my same patient. The cast helps very little. With one exception (Ziva Rodann is the only bright spot? Want the movie to focus more on her mysterious character), the cast is as dull as the scenario. Finally, I do not know the idea he's wearing the mummy-looking maid of what appears to pajamas, but it's a ridiculous, look ridiculous for a beast that is supposed to break into the audience. /> Despite my comments mostly negative about Pharaoh's cursing, I'll rate it a 4/10. Not a good rating to be assured, but generous to provide all the problems I have with the movie.
