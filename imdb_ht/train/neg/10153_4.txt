SLASHERS (2 out of 5 stars) <br /> Not really a pretty good movie ... but I did like the idea behind it ... and the filmmakers made it look pretty good to consider the small budget they worked with. The film is officially an "episode" in a Japanese reality show show that sends several competitors to a sealed "hazardous area" and has three suits of ramps sent after they are killed. The Survivor, if there is one, wins fame and fortune ... everyone else just winds up dead. The main disadvantage of this film is that the act is very bad. None of the "real" people seem real to all. The actors playing the assassins are kind of entertainment ... because they showed cheesy and caricatures on-top of popular movie films of modern films ... and is exactly how should they do if this was an actual show. The movie pretends to be all in one take ... there is a cameraman who follows the contestants around the "danger zone" and everything to see from the point of view of his camera ... but the lights keep flickering on them and over constantly (hide the "cuts" from one take another, I would imagine).
