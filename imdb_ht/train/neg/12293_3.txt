This only gets bashed because it stars David Hasselhoff. Well, then let me hit him to. Compared with the garbage called horror comes out nowadays, this movie is not too bad. It was Leslie Cumming's beautiful. It is super hot, but it can not speak very well. There is a big scene with him when it is supernaturally violated. It shows in her beautiful body. Linda Blair does not do anything here as well as Hasselhoff. 3/10
