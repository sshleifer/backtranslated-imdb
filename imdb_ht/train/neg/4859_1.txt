You were forced to admire Todd's director for his dedication, and enthusiasm when he came to film-making: between 1985 and 2000, he made a mammoth 34 movie. Unfortunately, if zombie bloodbath zombie is nothing to go through, they're probably all crap (and a quick look at IMDb ratings seem to verify my priceless). <br /> <br /> Part 3 sees a group of reckless students getting detention a little more than usual after being attacked by hordes of dead living, who have escaped from a self-secrecy-based host base directly under the schools. Working in an obnoxious script by Brian Eklund (which relies heavily on the liberal use of the F-Bomb) Sheets again delivered another embarrassingly unfriendly effort to introduce some of the top-numbingly awesome performances from his talent-free cast, hideous visual effects (some CGI crap and looks like front of a giant craft space box) and her trademark shore (Men's box pulled out under his victim's clothing). Characters run for their lives, and convincing those stunned innings, Armageddon's zombies end up with a time-traveling / paradox-ending that forces viewers to re-look at several minutes of torture from the beginning of the movie. Honestly ... once was enough, Mr. Sheets ?? what do we do to deserve to have it look again?
