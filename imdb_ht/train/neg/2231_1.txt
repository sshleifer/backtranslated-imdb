All I can say after watching Snitch'd is to stop Mr. Cahill. It is painfully clear you have no understanding of what you are doing on movie. If you insist on making movies on gangsters I encourage you to do research. It's funny to watch movies with absurd gangbang that even sounds more absurd when they speak. <br /> I laugh at the party when Mr. Cahill goes to a school with only 3 students and the amount kicks the authors of Kung Fu fashion. This film was difficult as a special school after. Who had the idea of ​​having torn hats saying where a particular gangbanger came from. I suspect real gangbang by wearing hat belts have gang. It should be stupid to consider new laws that add length to a prison term if someone is gang related. Snitch'd is the gangbang movie at WORK ever made.
