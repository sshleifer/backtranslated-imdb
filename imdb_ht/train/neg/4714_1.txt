I want to seriously give this piece to a zero garbage, unfortunately, no, so I gave it a 1 just to warn you about how stupid this impostor of a cartoon really is! Characters seem to be drawn by pre-school, no, wait, I've seen pre-school doing better! I prefer "Missing in Flapjack" this terrible excuse for a cartoon! I probably say what others have said, two words: RIP OFF !! Remember that the Dexter Lab's episode when they ran away-karts down that volcano? Yes, Mister Fellows even grabbed this idea and failed! They even tear off Shadow Shadow in that one episode of Pokemon parody! (It's even cash in on that franchise!) That a character is a cheap rip off of Mandark from the Dexter's Lab! Mister Fellows need to be sued for legal infringement for crap !! Everyone has their own opinions, but those of us who love Johnny (RIP-OFF) Test, you just lie. Make yourself a favor, change the channel then RIP Off will try to shame your screen!
