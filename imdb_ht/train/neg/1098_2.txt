I got this movie at $ 5 in Walmart. I would not recommend watching this move. I might give it to one of my friends if I'm upset about them and want them to suffer for 2 hours. <br /> I watched the cover and skim of the summary and thought it was a movie war. I wish I would know how boring this film would do before turning it on. It was my mistake that something was going to happen in this movie. It's just about a group of people going from one camp to another. Circle exercises are treating soldiers very seriously and the main character is trying to help people get out of battle in Vietnam. Okay, here is my annoyance on this movie: For me, this movie is slow and hard to look. It was just one of those movies that you put in and clinging to watching because you want to turn it into your hands hanging on in a hurry of hope that it might pick up towards the end. It does not. After the film was over me behind it behind T.V. because I was upset that I wasted almost 2 hours in my life watching it, and another 10 minutes wrote the review warning people about it.
