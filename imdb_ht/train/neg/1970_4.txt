Watching this movie for the action is rather a waste of time, because the figures on the boats act better than the people. It's a pity that Anthony Quinn could not convince anyone else to leave him direct any other movie after that turkey. But it is full of entertainment value, since Yul Brynner has hair, Lorne Greene shows a compelling French accent, and the rest of the big names on the comic-book fashionable.
