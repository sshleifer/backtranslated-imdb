I cant help her but I seem to love films that are meant to be scared and are just plain bad. I was personally listed in my own 10 worst movies right under the abyss of the abyss! Watch this movie and make a laugh just do not expect to see any academy awards. More likely to understand the movie itself. At all honesty though I've seen much worse than that. Plus some maniac round cruises wiped out the same people who just died is that incredible that it happened to be original. I think its one of those love or hate movies. You can make yourself selfish it's awful but it pulls it in somehow why I love it
