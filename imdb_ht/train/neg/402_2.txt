To describe this movie as waste is unfair. At least root garbage can be a fun absorb. This movie was neither absorbed nor fun. Kevin Bacon may act superbly giving the chance, so no doubt an IRS bill has been resolved when he agrees with this long-term scenario. The mad scientist history of 'Hollow Man' has said before, said best, and they said without resorting to many ludicrously expensive special effects .. Most of the special effects seem to be built around the transparent anatomic doll Men, women and dogs you could buy in the early sixties. In the UK they have been marketed as 'the transparent man (/ woman / dog)' which is perhaps the title of this movie. <br /> <br /> Intelligent special effects, long-term script, non-existent trace. <br /> <br />
