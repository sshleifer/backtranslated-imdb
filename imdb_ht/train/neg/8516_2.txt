Last week, I took a look at the Nielsen weekly assessments, and had Veronica Mars, supposedly "the best show you are not watching" .You are good that you are not watching it. It reveals twice and has ranked 147 and 145 out of 147. <br /> <br /> Translation: This is the lowest-rated show on any national network on broadcast ... and worth it. I tried to watch her a couple of times because of all the press covering her iping as a "big" show, a "realistic look" of life and all those nonsense. The fact was otherwise. Veronica Mars is a do. It is as unrealistic as it gets, and it's rich worthy to be canceled. <br /> <br /> The only mystery is why CW felt obliged to put on its inaugural schedule read in the lower-rated display of memory, after two years of continued commercial and artistic failures.
