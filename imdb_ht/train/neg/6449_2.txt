Imagine the great chill with a throw of twenty-somethings whose characters are all unnecessary, and an iguana-like man-lingerie pursues them around and you have an idea of ​​this crap here. On the positive side, the movie does not skimp on showing the monster. There are no peek-a-boo shots, or night scenes where you have to imagine what it looks like; it is right out there. Unfortunately, design and construction are not inspired. A little bit of mystery can be helped. Mind you, I've seen far worse, but if you're going to have it out on full display for a lot of flick the movie, your best dog looks good damn. <br /> <br /> Spoiler front !!! <br /> Oh, and have a twisted finish that involves the alleged death of the dead who makes absolutely no sense too. This has no surprise to write in the layers of the script. As for the act; Well let's just say it was not bad, but I do not expect we'll see many of these kids in the future cinema outings. <br /> <br /> Gore Corporation: 2 out of 5; Coconut stripping: 1 out of 5; Intelligence quotient: negligible
