If the crew behind "Zombie Chronicles" ever read this, here's some guys tips: <br /> <br /> 1. In a movie "Finishing Finish" -type, it's not a good idea to put close- ups of all dead in the movie in the opening credits. That tends to break the torsion, y'know ...? <br /> <br /> 2. I know this product on a shoestring and - to be fair - you have worked miraculous with your budget, but please hire people who can actually act. Or at least, walk, talk and gesture at the same time. Joe Haggerty, I'm looking for you ... <br /> <br /> 3. If you're going to put part in your movie in the past, just do this if you have accessory and costume at the time. Trendy faults are supposed to be a surprise. Sure, we do not want twists that make no sense, but signposting "reveal" as soon as you present a character? This is not a great idea. <br /> Kudos guys to try, but at all honesty, I prefer they did not ... <br /> Only for zombie completists.
