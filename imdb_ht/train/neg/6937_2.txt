The latest Adman-turned-smoker topic is trying to tackle corporate venture (ad) venture is quite an old-old topic of discussion by almost any cultural-timeless romance (pun intended). However, the exploration (and exploitation for Desi ods) falls suddenly short as the usual flavors of 'pepper, spice and sugar' go up to the usual masala mix of b / g notes, dialogues, dances, dramas, etc. creating a nice-looking package and not much inside. In the first 40 minutes of the movie, the kitchen scene was repeated at least 8-9 times. Repeat further follow thru-out film (after all the character to lead a cook). But it lies the problemos - no history! Hah, not surprising. Someone forgot to write a script. Amitabh puts in a Cheeny Jyada (more) over-acting amount. Really when is this guy ever quit? How many 60-somethings are set around like that even when teased by a nubile 30-something ??? Timeless mind yes, but surely what's on the not-so-ageless bod? And salt? Sorry, soul? Really good act by Paresh Rawal who has only the tender role of the movie. The principal lacks any sense of realism getting all caught up in his new-fangled discovery in a new warm idea. No place we present with any real-life problems or problems like a pair might face, other than actually married, which is just the initial obstacle. The subtraction of a kid and cancer (first love of the boy) goes nowhere and all the little bit of poignancy this otherwise insipid presentation would evoke rapidly kill along with the girl's character. <br /> <br /> Anyway, nice try but not quite there yet.
