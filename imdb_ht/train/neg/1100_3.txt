Since most revisions of this film are in recent years have seen the decade I would like to add one more recent, the open and foot cast of B-17 in Germany bombers, the film's films Wask's Wask's Werner's captain with his assistant characters running to cover while making their way to Fuker Hitler bunker, once inside, they are debriefed by staff bunker staff, then the cut of one of many conference scenes and Albin Skoda gives a decent impression In Adolf Hitler assembled his officers at "Ultimate Victory" while Werner's character showed as slowly coming to realize Deniz Bunker's being held in a fantasy world-some non-bunker events to show, the most notable were the flood in the subway system to prevent an advanced Russian into a minor subplot involving a young member of the Flak's unit and his family's difficulty surviving-this film suffers from a number of inaccuracies in detail that a German film made only 10 years after WW2 should not be included; The actress shows Goebbels (Willy Krause) wearing uniform uniforms like Hitler, including heroes-Goebbels wearing a brown Nazi uniformed party and swastika brawl- "SS" soldier set German camouflage army, the well-documented scene of Hitler granting the cross to the boy at Hitler Youth to show as he took place inside the bunker (he was doing out in the yard) and finally, Hitler's suicide gun is clearly portrayed as a brilliant 1922 Browning pattern-most disagree It was a Walther PPK-some bit of act also seems completely incorrect and the dance dancing scene near the end of the film being remarkable, this bit is shown as a cabaret skit, and a wounded intoxicated soldier (his arms 'in a race) maniacally goose-treating music while a nurse performs a congestive striptease / belly dancing, all by candle ... this is actually the most embarrassing to look-the most incredible look when Werner's Captain Wust has a self-hearing He and Hitler Skoda show Hitler jumping on a bench, drug and misery rious, when Werner's character starts in his quest, Hitler begins the wearing of a SS Guard who's the mortal Werner character in the back with a shotgun-this fabricated scene is not based on any historical historical - character -Werner then spread off to die in an antireuse while Hitler prepared to finish his own, leaving us leaving Hitler to his staff to show but the suicide is on the second screen in the final of the movie show Hitler's funeral pyra smoke slowly formed in a ghost image of deceased figures Oskar Werner / Hauptmann Wust-this movie is much more algorithm than historic and anyone interested in this period would do better to check out the movie Most recent as 1973 noted "Hitler: The Last 10 Days" or German movie "Downfall" if they want a more accurate accounting in this dramatic story, the latest two films are based on the first witnesses, and " Hitler: The last 10 days "Bein G was compiled by Gerhard Boldt's autobiography as an employer officer and the Bunker of Fuehrer and "Downfall" by Hitler's recruitment secretary, the screenplay for "The Last Act" was taken by the judge Judge American Nuremberg judge Michael Musmanno's "Ten Days of Death", which is more a compilation of the event (many obviously reliable) than witness stories - it is surprising that against Hugh Trevor Roper, "the last day of Hitler" has never been made in a movie.
