great mystery, but the movie goes down from the hill. The beginning is promising and a car crash with a woman and her daughter were burning alive in front of a police officer, Edward. She is traumatized about this and sees popping pills. A mysterious letter turns out to be an old girlfriend asking for help finding her missing daughter. So Ed travels to an island community in mostly women. They do not like foreigners. A lot of filler is and Ed is shown looking around town for the girl. This was the movie too long. It ultimately gets a little better toward the end when we learn from the crazy rituals of the woman and finally in the disaster plan in store for Edward. <br /> <br /> Overall, not a well-written story and too long. <br /> <br /> FINAL VERDICT: I would skip this.
