Welcome to a bad ghost story and somebody's nightmare. This horror story finds a newly married husband (John Hudson) and wife (Peggy Weber) haunted by the memory of his previous wife and screaming the skulls found in all the castles and pond pond. Is the husband really trying to drive her already anxious bride? Or is it learning to challenge the Mickey Mouse (Alex Nicol) who has taken care of the castle since the death of the original mistress of the house? This budget supreme budget film has a history line that keeps you involved all the way the final. Special effects are very bad even in 1958 standard. I swear at cramps times in screaming so many as it should be in a movie Godzilla. Also in the cast as Snow Reverend is character actor Russ Conway. By the way ... The Secret Garden (Nicol) is the movie director. You can catch this as part of the Monsterfest AMC.
