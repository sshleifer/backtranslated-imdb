This movie sells for one dollar at Wal-Mart on a DVD and so I do not feel like I'm losing anything to watch this movie, except my time. Loved the act of Tom Hanks, (Robbie Wheeling), who was very young looking and gave an outstanding performance considering it was a horrible script. The story is about college students who decided to play the game Maz & monsters, only in a very realistic setting. Robbie Wheeling had problems in the past playing this game in other colleges and is advised by his parents to leave the game alone and get good scores. Robbie meets a very beautiful galloon and has a romantic fling with her and once she starts playing the game, she stops doing her love and acts like a monk. Some scenes from the film have been run through the former World Trade Center and also on the observation floor and roof area. It is rather sad to see this part of the movie where many human beings have died because of evil in the world. This is not a very good movie, except for Tom Hanks trying to keep the movie above the sinking level of entertainment.
