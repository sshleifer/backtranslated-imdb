'Metamoprhis' is the story of a superbly youthful, revered, local college scientist, is under investigation of the college financial institution. This forced her to take shortcuts in typical malicious-Hollywood melodramatic fashion. <br /> <br /> First I thought after that movie conclusion was this. "Not good, but not bad, for eight or mid-day." Of course, I then realized that he did in 1990, which almost launched it down to a '4', but decided to keep it in the '5' mediocre that he is. <br /> <br /> 'Metamorphis' does on a few occasions, seems like a good movie desperately trying to get out. The act, while not stellar, is especially competent. You can even see occasional glaciers in a modest way. Gathering is a major problem with the movie. After thinking I was watching for ninety minutes, I realized I would only watch an hour. Special effects are not stellar, but the director seems to be especially competent enough to work around this weakness. Lead, a mildly charisma that looks like a blended channel in Tom Cruise and Christopher Reeves, reminds me especially of Matt Dillon's character of 'wild things'. The girl heroine does an OK job, but does not distinguish herself in anyway. There's a 'naughty girl' here, and the actress does what she can with it, but it does not seem like much. There is a child actor that the director can not decide whether he is morose, happy or just weird. <br /> <br /> Rally, as I said, is the worst issue with this movie, until a final battle with the bad guy who would make a Ranger Power Ranger. It is rare and inexplicable, until the final stage is supposed to be dramatic but simply hilarious, saturated with every bad and overacting badge that can compress in about thirty seconds. <br /> A decent one-time look at the 'Factory Mill Mill Factory Factory 50'. There is nothing that will bring you back, and nothing to buy on its own.
