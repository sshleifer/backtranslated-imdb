Well probably the worst movie I've ever seen. When did Hollywood ever make a successful film that attacked Republicans? Why not learn. The chic Dixie does not have. These Lefties live in their own elite bottles interacting among themselves; Undoubtedly the fact that most of America is more right than that. <br /> <br /> The best productions of Hollywood are not partisan and are rarely political at all. <br /> <br /> Imitation of the Akroyd Dan in Cheney was bad. <br /> I would have thought Cussack could have landed better movies. <br /> It was not funny.
