My family and I checked the night before night. And as bad as Underdog is (four years old I loved it), Rod Rod makes it look like Oscar deserves material. The only thing that could save this movie was whether Evel himself was out of the Samberg retirement slap in the face of making this movie. I will admit however, that the band was good. I was not sure if the movie was set in the 80's, but with the majority of the music coming from Europe? What knows. If I were you, I would take a pass. And just stay at home and watch the test model on your local TV station. Or if you are dying on watching this, people under the influence can enjoy it.
