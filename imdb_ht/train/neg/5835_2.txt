Ah WINTER killed, based on the novel by Richard Condon who deals with a plot that killed the president of the United States 20 years ago. I knew Kondon also wrote the CANDIDATE MANCHURI who faced with a similar theme and was looking forward to seeing a smart thriller <br /> <br /> winter kills leave me cold. It's not a thriller - It's a piece of crap worthless, perhaps the worst movie I've seen this month and my boy saw a lot of bad movies in June. The problem lies in both the direction and the script and sees as William Richert was responsible for both then he should have been blaming entirely for this unfunny elf <br /> There are two bad things with this movie . The first is the way everything is presented in a totally high way. It's not as OTT as saying something like James Bond film with David Niven and Peter Sellers but everything has an important corner of it and the actor completely mugging their performance. This would be justified if there were entertainment values ​​in the movie but no. As a satire it is very funny, so silly that it gets almost unwatchable. Secondly, the scenes seem to have been cut off so much that they are desperate. Take for example a scene where the hero confronted a looping militant leader called Dawson. Dawson tells the hero he has 30 seconds to start then cut off the hero being on board an airplane. The scenes begin with ending with no rhymes or reasons. <br /> A movie itself is a tense to sit down
