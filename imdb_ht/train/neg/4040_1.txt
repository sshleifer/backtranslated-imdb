I consider myself to be a bit of a snob when it comes to everything and although the experience of cinemas is much more suited to explosions than secondary dramas, I can be very attracted to film, too. Art films, however, are better than King Kong. I probably would give Kong two stars, doubling this movie. <br /> <br /> I guess is that people got excited about this because it was almost identical to the style that you can see in a play. For the less-smart-buff art, a movie that looks like a game is 'great art'. <br /> <br /> This movie, however, was useless. so she counted on high dramas. The only drama in this movie was whether the cat would drop the roof or not. So, deep and meaningful dialogue, then? No. Great acting? Dabitid. They should be too fair: Some of the scenery was interesting, though: Communist flats, city vistas (Petersburg?) And Soviet trams are still in service.
