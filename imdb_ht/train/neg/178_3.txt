This movie was made-for-TV, so taking this into account, I will not rip it as hard as I would be a feature film. The script is sub-par, but it succeeds in being lightly humorous in spots, whether it means to be or not. The act is mostly over-the-top, but this is true for many budgetary movies. <br /> <br /> The aspect of this movie I really hated, though, was that 90-95% of it is shot on film but in random places there will be 5-10 seconds of shot video. You can say because there is less contrast, the colors are less vivid, and the foot is clearly 30 frames per second instead of 24 movie films every second. I'm not sure if perhaps these scenes were to be shot later and at that time they did not have the money to shoot on film (I suppose this is why, anyway), but it is disoriented and really makes the movie look shoddier than she looked .. Anyway, I was definitely seeing worst movies, but I definitely would not say I enjoyed this movie and I can not recommend anyone to see it.
