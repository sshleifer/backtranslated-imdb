Well, I rented this movie and found out he realllllllly sucks. It is about this family and the miss and even the stupid fights of the family, then the cool son comes with his stupid camera, he likes taking a picture of damaged buildings and strange things with strange films, and Then he asks his father to take him on a side trip and simply agree, etc. etc etc ... They go to this city that no one knows it exists (blah blah blah) And the most annoying thing is that the movie ends and yet you do not understand what is PHOTO MOVIE !!!! I've seen many movie films but that was the worst, Honestly it does not have a description at all and I wish I did not see it.
