I had to write a review of this movie after reading another comment saying that Sidney Poitier's best film is. Poiier has just returned from more than a decade of rest in acting films and he is clearly criticized here. 11 of her films mentioned in Wikipedia and they do not include this. 5 of her films on AFI's list of top 100 inspired movies, again, not included. Berenger and Poitier, tubers and town slickers set out to hunt down a dangerous psychopath before crossing the border in Canada. Some of the attempts at comedy in this film clearly weakened and Berenger and Poitier's bonds were cringeworthy and awkward (not helped by a completely completely script). Kirstie Alley (as the hostage) was underused, and almost entirely ignored when she was on the screen. Some attempts at suspension have been made, for example when you are attempting to try and guess that at 5 people on a fishing trip is the murderer (all of them are typ-cast bandits). I understand that this is all the appeal of most fans out there. I guessed who was known and I did not really try hard. <br /> <br /> If you're a Berenger fan, watch the Shooter (1993), you even get to see Billy Zane strutting her stuff. It is best. All in all I would shoot to kill 3/10. It's not mad, and it's just too right for me.
