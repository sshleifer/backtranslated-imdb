WARNING: PEOPLE ACTIVITY (not that you should take care of .. Also, sorry for the caps.) <br /> Starting with a dramatic voice that's all the more annoying to talk nonsense, it goes on with bloody stories sense and drama are not needed. This is seriously but accurately laid. <br /> We know space travel is a risky venture. There is a complicated system that has great potential for malfunction, radiation, symptoms related to stress etc., and unexpected things are bound to becoming widely unknown. They knew things could go wrong. In fact, things went wrong. She calls learning. Granted, Appollo 11 was not safe in today's standards and there was immense political pressure, but the overall performance of the technology of the mission was impressive. <br /> <br /> Different errors / comments I did not even look up: <br /> <br /> 1) Nixon prepared a speech in case something went wrong. Well duh. That's what I would have done. It was the tip of a propaganda war, after all. <br /> 2) NASA gives green light despite the fact that Appollo 11 will probably blow up. (This is "only" implicit, though.) Yeah, that's why they let people and press the look of almost real-time. <br /> 3) The expulsion capsule would not work. Like it did not work the time a chimp was in it. The one who survived? It was a launch launch and the rocket exploded, the capsule accelerated away and landed with a parachute. Having a video of it, you can probably find it on YouTube or at least watch it somewhere. <br /> 4) An interviewed guy says an explosion would wipe out a fair part of Florida. I can only assume it meant a hyperbole, 'cause if not, I'm just aghast how it could get it so wrong. <br /> 5) The technology then was primitive compared to today's standards. Currently, relatively primitive software and hardware are used even today, the reason for it should not be crashed. It even gets worse for spacecraft, because computers must be built into relatively large components that are not sensitive to radiation. (And the craft itself must be pilotable manually anyway, so a complex steering system like the B2 would not do.) What's with the fact that they were using "TV screen" rather than "computer screen" ? It's the same damn technology. Currently TV monitors have been and are produced with a higher definition. 6) "If this object was not part of the rocket, it could be one thing." We see this place going. Apart from the fact that the statement is wrong, who says he was not a rocket party? At least one interview clears that if something is flying and you do not know what it is, it's by definition of an unidentified flying object. <br /> 7) The voice-on as well as some misquotes make it seem as if the landing radiation landers was actually its hull. Which would make it slim than a space suit. <br /> 8) Neil Armstrong near death during a practical flight is my feet being appreciated; I did not see it before. As I said, any piece of technology manifested can go wrong, especially if it has not been tested enough on account of being, you know, unprecedented. <br /> 9) Differences in the trajectory of down the lander (due to irregularities in the dances of the moon) were in no time acutely threatening life. Neither was "fifteen seconds left gas", which, in fact, "fifteen seconds of gas left before they have been aborting the mission and returning to the order module." <br /> <br /> 10) A "catastrophic chain of events" usually results from disaster. I really do not know how to put it anymore. This, however, is an example example of the talk used. <br /> 11) There is a short sequence of one of the astronauts walking and jumping around harsh as a gleeful kid, followed by voice-over to tell us the reason for this unusual behavior "can now will appear ". Turning out, she walked and jumped around harsh as a gleeful kid. Hilarious stuff. <br /> 12) He mentioned that during re-entry, all contact was lost. This is a perfectly natural phenomenon and it was as well known at the time as it's impossible to circumvent and contemporary technology. Again, this gravity is implicit, but very deliberate. 13) Never was a lost shuttle in space itself, while voice-on featuring this "reality" as proof that Appollo 11 was a pile of crap. Appollo 13 was a near-loss, but the real disasters happened during liftoff and re-entry, respectively. In any case, compared to rocket satin shuttle is somehow ... well, okay, just plain stuff. Even ignoring that, the successful craft mission seems to have not been deemed to be the audience interest. <br /> <br /> 14) What is the hell up with the UFO? Even in the context of the film, it makes no sense. Unless you assume it was made for entertainment purposes, aimed at a specific audience (which seems to include people and the future of no understanding of either history, science, or rhetoric). Even the point in the film is a bit obscure. Catch-phrases such as "Cover Up To Now", "Publicly Revealed Here for the First Time", come, but the film does not put any blame or offer a lesson or anything, which could be expected in such a film emotionally done. In the good old tradition of sensationalism, there are many interviews with recording fragments that are often out of context or with those we do not know anything about except "NASA scientists". Wow, so the astronauts were very nervous before the endeavor? Fancy This. What does this have to do with points in the movie again? Oh yes, that point. In summary, in addition to being either voluntarily or incompetent incorrect, it's not just fun. And believe me, I'm a guy who enjoys his discouraging documentary; This movie is not funny, witty, picturesque, it's nothing.
