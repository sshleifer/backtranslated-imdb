Well where do I start my story? I went to this movie tonight and a few friends did not know more than the actors who were in it, and that he was supposed to be a horror movie. <br /> Well, I figured out in the first 20 minutes, what a poor decision I made going out to see this movie. The draw was crap, and so was the script. The lines were terrible to the point that the audience was laughing hysteria. <br /> <br /> The throw could not be more plastic looking. Even some of the scenes seemed like they should have been doing much faster ... as they dragged on for no particular reason. Very poor correction. <br /> All of this movie was a giant waste of time and money. Boo.
