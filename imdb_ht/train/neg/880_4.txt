Kanin Garson wrote and directed this look at Las Vegas's "modern day" and the difference between generations, its first directive efforts since the 1940s! David Janssen is a bit sick as a large-shot casino owner meeting with his son (Robert Drivas, who looks deconcertingly like a bigger Jason Bateman). Janssen approaches each scene similarly: defensive, with a chip on his shoulder. Playing this cool and laid-back role will be asking too much from Janssen, which barks in everyone like a laid-back housewife (she even chops out Rick Rickles and makes him cry!). Her son, a ne'er-do-well in search of his own identity, commenting hip about how young people look down on Vegas (giving them another ten years), and his annoyance in Father's form causes friction . Brenda Vaccaro is beautiful as a self-conscious secretary and Edy Willaims has a bit fun as a showgirl at an audition. Unfortunately, "where it's in" there is not much to go for it other than the now ruminant dates of ethics between adults and children, some T & A shots and amusingly jaded satirical bits on the high world of The advantage of gambling - most of which was covered by now, nauseum announcement. ** from ****
