Well well. As John Carpenter's seasonal season of "Masters of Horror" was, this is the opposite of complete. He certainly proved he was still a master of horror and "Burns Cigarette" but "Pro-Life" is perhaps the worst I've seen from him. It's stupid, totally devoid of creepy atmosphere and tension and he undergoes it welcomed, despite the less-than-an hour run time. The script is nonsense, the characters are irritable and un-appealing and the conclusion is beyond absurd. <br /> And for those suckers who actually bought the DVD (one of them being me); Did you see how Carpenter describes the film? She is really proud of her and speaks of her as her best work for a long time, and she praises the script. And in the next track, where he noticed an obvious vice up that made it to the final cut, he just said he did not feel it essential to correct the mistake and he just left it there. I fear the old master completely loses his touch. I sincerely hope I prove wrong. <br /> I want to leave on a positive note and mention that the animal effects are scary, though. Technically speaking, this film is top notch, with rapid lighting effect and effect.
