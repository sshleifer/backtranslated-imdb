I'm not going to argue with anyone who pronounces this movie exemplary, such as January's performance, but please check out it, if you are not already, in the AMC series Men's Series AMC series series, it starts to excellently , as it is the whole cast. I'll be charitable to assume it took on the role of "Taboo" strictly for the money and, to accomplish that a quiet mess he was going to do, back to a minimal job acting to avoid hunger . know if this case, but I (now) know to ensure that it can act. <br /> At first, watching "Taboo," I was convinced her flat delivery was a clever choice that would later give rise to some significant revelations about her character or the plot. There are no such chances .There are hard to believe The director did not suggest at least once that changed expression for 17 successive scenes could cause lockjaw. The performance of her "Mad Men" comes as a character that, at least in its early appearances, is very suppressed, reserved, endowed with self, and rather colorless, not unlike its "Taboo" role. But as the TV series progressed, it started to flower in a roundtable roundtable-60 wozebread rhythm. Can not wait to see where to take his character in the 2nd quarter. For the sum, avoid "Taboo" like curtains, but definitely check out "Mad Men."
