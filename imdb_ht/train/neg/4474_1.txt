garbage in my life, .... the director should be embarrassed. Why do people feel they need to make movies without meaning for me? when she died in the end she made me laugh. I changed the channel many times throughout the film because I was embarrassed to watch these poor acting. Expect that the guy who played Heath never gets work again. On top of that I hope the director never gets another movie, and his check has taken back for this crap. {.02 from 10}
