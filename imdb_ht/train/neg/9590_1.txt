This movie is based on a novel recording 1950. <br /> <br /> Journalist Colin McInnes wrote three series "London novels": "Absolute Beginners", "City Pearl" and "Mr Love and Justice". I read all three. The first two are excellent. The last, perhaps an experiment that did not come there. But McInnes's work is very acclaimed; and that's why. This music is the ultimate novelist's nightmare - to see the fruits of one's head turned into a glitzy, seriously, acting, sophisticated one-dimensional exquisite of a film that says it captures the spirit of 1950, and do nothing of the sort. Good luck Colin McInnes was not alive to witness it.
