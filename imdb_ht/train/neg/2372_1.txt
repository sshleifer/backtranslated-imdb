Unimaginably stupid, redundant and humiliating closure of the "Nightmare on Elm Street" -Series! Part 6 is so incompetent that it looks like Rachel Talalay's director intentionally wanted to turn the first Wes Craven into a great and unlucky joke. This is not just the worst entry into the legendary "Elm Street"; It's also one of the most embarrassing horror movies ever to do with it outright fans of fans in the genre! The story is mute, the characters are ridiculous, the structure is all nourishing and ?? most of all? The special and visual effects resemble that of a cartoon Tom & Jerry. The sequences in which Freddy Krueger murdered its victims endless and very refreshing. Should we be petrified when Freddy released Breckin Meyer into a video game-character and pogo-sticked him in the walls of a house? The story takes us back to Springwood and it appears that Freddy all of a sudden has a middle-aged daughter. You would think it would be mentioned in one of his previous adventures, but no ?? There are only one surviving person in Springwood and Krueger to use him to get in touch with the loss of his childhood. Another reason that this final installment is terrible is the completely logical structure. John Doe-The boy introduced as the leading character but then all of a sudden he died and the plot continues to turn on two adults! How about that: Freddy Krueger, who has spent five films killing nothing but teenagers, eventually beaten by two adult-wearing 3D-glasses! Such sort of breaks all sense, does not it? As far as I'm concerned, "Nightmare on Elm Street" has always been a setback, but even now, even the weakest entries have at least some elements reincarnated. "Freddy's death", however, is simply freelance and nobody should waste his precious time watching it.
