This is just a terrible 'comedy' - it's really a bad movie. There is no funny element. no jokes are funny. I do not know how some people can claim this short participation film can be 'smartest' or 'quality'. Perhaps this movie is the only one that you see you can claim by this fee. but I've seen thousands of best films: namely leonard party six (now this funny)! I do not know how the fees are considered eligible to be listed on the Internet movie database: it's more like a home video than a current movie. <br /> <br /> jokes aside, just skip this movie. A root canal is more enjoyable than this cliche-rejected unfunny material.
