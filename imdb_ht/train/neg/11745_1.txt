The fact that I do not like the music is a very personal opinion, the historic autographs are not. I realize that it is an opera and not a documentary, but some important aspects are missing, especiallly if others are lying because of it. Abbu Abbas was the master of this operation, which was scene and reorganized due to discovery on the shiph board, in order to free 50 terrorists from Israeli prisons, one of which was Samir Kuntar, a crowded terrorist The story you can find is not searching for "klinghoffer samir kuntar" on Google. Abbu Abbas was responsible for many other terrorist operations, though he never joined Achilles Lauro. Ben Laden never kicked on the plane hit the WTC, did he? <br /> <br /> *** Possible spoilers *** <br /> <br /> The film almost excuses action terrorists and reactions because of their horrors might have lived, always accentuate and exaggerate how much Israeli did hurt. However, they never show that Palestinians have never been the Israelites. The movie uses the images (good habits) of Sabra and Chatila horror, and nothing says, understanding the belief that Israel was responsible, without ever mentioning that it was a Syrian army Lebanese who drove massacre. <br /> <br /> The act was generally very bad, but I guess this can be expected of opera singers? <br /> <br /> On another note I'm shocked at how one can excuse terrorist killers in hostage because of the hostages trying to stir 400 innocent hostages against armed terrorists, and adding that the person should not consider sympathetic because he is a zionist supporter. Imagine how unsympathetic his wife was, spitting on the terrorists who shot her husband and threw himself into the sea. I hope that no one in the world is as cruel as it is (wink wink)
