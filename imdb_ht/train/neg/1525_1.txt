I watched this a weekend afternoon as there was simply nothing else about, it would be more fun to melt at my feet and probably less painful. I encourage anyone to watch this just to see how turgidly awful a movie can, surely it was deliberate. I cringed through all useless humorous attempts carried out as a toddler, unrehearsed, seriously executing way beyond belief. This is the movie that makes Spiceworld look like Goodfellas, my thinking is exaggerated? Well give it a look and feel again. Dreadful, utterly obnoxious. If this was not a prank then the director and anyone else responsible for this would be removed and promptly after being forced to watch this movie again.
