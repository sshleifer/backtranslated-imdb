This is a bad movie masquerading as a mockumentary. Documentary documentary film makers have almost time screen time and dialogue as any other character. That completely destroyed any "documentary feeling" that they might want to create. <br /> The fact that the movie is not actually a mockumentary is the smallest of its problems. The movie is not funny. The movie is not sexy. The movie has nothing to perplexible to say about the porn business. It's not even particularly dirty. While having sex simulation, the amount of stripping is moderate for a R rated film. One day, someone is doing a good mockumentary on the porn industry. This is not it.
