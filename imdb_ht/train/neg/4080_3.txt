This looks like one of those movies that we think we would like, but I did not. It seemed to be trying ways too hard to be 'artsy'. All flash, with no content. She has some nice scenes, and any one of them is beautiful to look, but they are rampaged and it becomes a job that really sit in it. I rent this because of the glowing reviews on the video card, and the fact that I'm a big fan of Shakespeare, but I was very disappointed. I just found it a bit firefighter and, at times, boring.
