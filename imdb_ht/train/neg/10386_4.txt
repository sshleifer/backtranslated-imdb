This could be interesting ?? a Japan-series home stories haunted from the opinion of a newly installed American family ?? but fell flat due to a over-simplified treatment and unnecessaryness of both cast and director. The film suffers from the same problem I often encounter with modern popular revival of authentic fare, ie the fact that the demons demonstrate themselves to be evil for no real reason other than that expect them! Moreover, it does not save much from the crisis department ?? a giant crab attack is simply funny? as, generally, ghosts live a specific character and cause it or he acts in a totally uncharacteristic way, such as Susan George seduced the diplomat / friend-of-the-family-Doug McClure and Edward Albert force his daughter a bowl in soup! <br /> At one point, an old monster turns into the house to warn Albert to the danger if they stay there ?? Eventually, he called on local exorcise. However, history is tied to repeating itself and tragedy is the only result of the tension situation hardly created ?? leading to a more violent, yet unintentional comic in which Albert and McClure, owned by the evil spirits of Japanese predecessors, engage in an impromptu karate duel of the death! At the end of the day, this causes a time-hunter insensitive ?? tolerated in just 88 minutes but, in no way, essential look.
