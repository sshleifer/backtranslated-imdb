The story idea behind the lost MISSILE is not bad at all, but unfortunately the story finds a bit dull towards the middle and the overuse of stock footage as well as the special effects of this poor film flow at the sub-par. /> <br /> The movie starts with a title missile towards the Earth. In a panic because it's about to hit the Earth, the Soviets managed to divert the object. This is not necessarily good, however, as this seemingly safe craft has a steam trail that destroys everything in its path and the ship is now in a low orbit on the planet. In other words, with every passing it, a swath of death follows - one that could potentially kill us all !! So it's up to the good scientists in the U.S. (led by Robert Loggia very young and hardly recognized) to formulate and plan to save us - and especially save New York on its immediate flight flight! Unfortunately, they can not save Ottawa (I've never been there, so I can not tell whether this is a big loss), but thanks to the good old Americans know how, they can eventually destroy this president mayhem !! <br /> So, as you can see, the story story is not bad and rather original. But many old clips of fighter aircraft and guys including Rada Scarlet have become a bit old and it looks like padding. In general, a movie that is decent but hardly inspired that extreme fans of the genre can love - all else, seeing it at your own risk.
