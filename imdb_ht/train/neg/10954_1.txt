If there was a 0 rating star I would gladly drop it out of this absolutely absolutely terrible trash. The fact that the current resume is perfectly fine and that if it was different it could be brilliant just to make it worse. The basic task of blocking up a group of people in an experimental room is fine but WHAT THE EXPERIENCE? All I see is a bunch of clinical surfers and blonde discuss music and culture I do not know or want to know about ... The challenges are pathetic and unusual. The whole point of reality TV is to show reality. If you set a 'challenge' not to play with exchanged accessories in foods and elements stereotyped elements of 'Friday night games'. make them a real challenge. And how to earn 'money' prices, this fine, if they actually handle it! These people are black. If only they would do the best show, the current idea would be glorious. But that will not happen!
