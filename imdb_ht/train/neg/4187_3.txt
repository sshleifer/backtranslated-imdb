A film written by Neil Young writes, "Greendale" is little more than a minute-minute music video of a doxen or so in the songwriter's work. In place of the dialogue, the film depends only on the lyrics of Young, which has many shoots and social slogans, to say "the story" while actors act out the scenes. <br /> Give the atheist performance and the darling charm of the picture, the effect is the equivalent of Young blowing up some of his own home movies and releasing them for public consumption. Although there is alleged a "story" running in the movie, we really have no idea what will be about thanks especially to the unpolished look of the movie, the lack of dialogue and the ineptitude of the act. Everything we find for eight or seven minutes is a bunch of hippies aging cavorting silently in an incoherent narrative while Young's songs play endlessly on the belt. The whole thing turns into an exhausting exercise of self-indulgentness. "Greendale" gives Off-Hollywood, budgetary film-making a bad name.
