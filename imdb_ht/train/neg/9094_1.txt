Well, let me break it down for you guys ... it's horror! <br /> <br /> If Roger Kumble has done such a fun job on the first intentions of the wicked, why he did such an evil job. I'm sorry but this film is stupid, indeed it might have been improved if its series was ever revealed, but allowed to be realistic ... this movie a crock! A lot of bad acting * NOTE The shower show * "kiss cousin" ?????? What kind of line is that? "Wet air slipery" ?????????? Can we say DUH-M! This film has effort, I'll give you that, but it was too stupid! They even tried to make it funny by giving the homeless homeless people home accents that actually ... There is no craze! It was sad. Not to mention that they did all in this one look Absolutely no such as the original cast. It's as if they were doing different look at goals or something! I love watching it when I really really board that does not happen occasionally. For those of you who love it ... Well, what did you think? Can you possibly choose this movie on the other one that has great acting with Sarah Michelle Gellar's fabulous? A movie is gold if she has Sarah Michelle Gellar in her, DUH! But this movie is not, there is no offense Amy Adams. Oh yeah since when has a heart ?? UGH!
