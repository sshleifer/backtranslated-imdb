Semana Santa is jaw-droppingly bad. It's so bad in many ways I do not do that where they start. So let's see ... Mira Sorvino, whose husband has been shot while protecting him, goes from Madrid to Seville for his cop. During the holy week (semana santa, see? ... everyone begins to fall asleep..every u it was bad at many points, even in the beginning), an assassin executes its victim like bull in an arena arbusting. He teamed up with male chauvinist pig Olivier Martinez and beautiful Feodor Atkine. Soon he discovered it will be the next target of the killer (wearing a red dress). Why, oh, but why? <br /> <br /> Why? This is the question that was in my mind the whole movie. <br /> Q: Why went to see that: Because I love Mira Sorvino (I apologize for that in the FIRST BEAUTY ...) <br /> Q: Why were we only 8 people in the theater this Saturday to the first weekend released? A: Ah-ah-ah. Spider-man was relaesed the same day. However, the fact that the film was explosion and excitement review. <br /> Q: Why was this movie being born? One: Money I Guess. But the boy made Mira needed the money. <br /> <br /> then ... why ???????????? First of all, there's always something wrong with European co-production. here you got a French-English-german-italian-spanish-danish production. yi-ha. Then he wants to play on the playgroung as with US thrillers / slashers / whodunit / mystery / whatever. Even VALENTINE, though unnecessary and bad scripted with injection, was the best of the suspense and the fun. <br /> <br /> Then give some credit to the story, the senatorist wanted to add some political eyes to the story. Bad: done in flash-back in a traffic photography like, it's certainly the most interesting thing I'm the movie. Could have stick to it, it would not have to sit in the entire movie. Better go straight to Guillermo del Tros at THE BIKLON DEVIL (El Espina di del Diablo) for some smart fun. Then the homophobia. Bullseye! The first victims are the S & M drug addicted to gay twins who were stabbed to death. The rather annoying Martinez goes to a dating agency made by a highly transverse transition truancy and a blond platinum wig. Call Sorvino's character to a great dike all the time. Do we need this kind of thing? Nah. Just initial offensive necessity, just like ol'times. <br /> <br /> Then the suspense. Yipee. There is no apparent motive. The first killers are plain illusions as they are a representation of a famous painting. But no. With the revelation of the killer (a terrible fascist, of course) could have occurred in the beginning as it appears at the end of the film as I guess it was time for the director to say "heel, time to finish that movie movie .. let's reveal now who the killer is why he kills. " Then the director thinks he's a director. Bad: there is no sense of suspicion, no sense of directing actors, no knowledge of changes in pace. A giant, mega-done. The scene of the holy week is useless (maybe a co-production rule saying ok, shooting in Seville but showing some credit to this beautiful and historic city with the celebrations of Easter. There are we: a mystery movie for tourists!) <brr <br /> <br /> then the actors. Everything is wrong. Mira Sorvino makes himself dead: he does practically nothing except getting stabbed in the right hand. All he did best (Replacement Killers, Aphrodite Mighty ...) was like they never existed. Olivier Martinez ... hello, no one here? When producers will learn that it is not an actor but a mannequin who has no speech or feeling ability? Feodor Atkine, bland and transparent. Only we paid great respect to Alida Valli, one of the greatest actresses of the last century (and I hope for some more role in this now one). It's tha main attraction here as it is the only one to give life to its poor line. I will not mention the other actors as they're just one-sided character, refreshing and deep. <br /> <br /> Inocherent direction, consistent actor, plot implausible. Idioms incarnated. <br /> <br /> Superwonderscope says: 1 <br /> <br />
