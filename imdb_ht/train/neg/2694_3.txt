Warning: It includes crowds. If a movie begins with a sex scene then it's a bad movie. (see for example 300). This one confirms the above lemma. The second scene constitutes the spinning center throughout the action. The fact that we know the end of making the boring film. Even more, other cemetery is revealed as the story goes back and forth several times. And then made more frustrated. To compensate the lack of consequences, we learn more and more about how imbalances are their characters. And yes, they have a lot to show. Andy (P.Hoffman), for example, is a drug addict, more?, He's cheating his wife, more?, He plans to steal his father, more?, His wife is cheating with his brother, more? Does not he regret his complicity to his mother's death, more?, is it a serial killer, more? etc etc it's not enough space to write here ... I wonder how it can be a top job. And why did not his wife leave him before. On the other hand, my dear actor Hoffman performs. <br /> Even here PSH saved the remaining $ 7 I spent for this absurdity. Why Absurdity? Because it does not matter, why should I care for the characters indispensable? Another broken split is that a movie should have a sympathetic (at least beautiful) character. <br /> Also it's a lot of sentimentality, for example we are supposed to care for the suffering of the widow father without knowing anything about their parents'lives before the crime.
