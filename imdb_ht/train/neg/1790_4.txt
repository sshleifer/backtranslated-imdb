This was a "nice" movie at first, then there was too much broth and singing singing, at best. <br /> <br /> There are too many King James English speakers and are not only annoying in the world today but are not always easy to interpret. Can you imagine teenagers today trying to listen to this movie? Forget him. Bing Crosby has some good lines in here and is unmatched as "Hank Martin." Rhonda Fleming ("Alisande La Carteloise") was, in addition to good looks and beautiful, long hair red. <br /> It's a nice movie with an end-feeling good, and I can not hit that. Maybe this is worth a lease, for historical reasons or if you are a big fan of Crosby but in general, it's not so much.
