This hollow film from indulgent moments to self-time moments, promises to develop into something worth hung on. But he does not. It's flat, self conscious, inimaginative and tedious. A set of image set and backdrops does not make a movie, they make a calendar. This kind of documentary to unlock social pseudo drama documentary ("It's True It Really Achieved") does not just fail to entertain, it fails to convince, so it does not even function as social history. Cliche co-mixed with dexterity to make that a movie is very difficult to finish, the entertainment factor is set in fairly quickly. Characters are one dimension, never developed to the extent that a person feels for them. The ego director is the largest character in this movie.
