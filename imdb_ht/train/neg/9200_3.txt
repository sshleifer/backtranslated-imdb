One of the wonderful things the script has come to write. <br /> <br /> Wayne and the other performers do a good job but as it is neither comedy, romantic enthusiast or anything else it is all rather irritating. <br /> <br /> One feels as though one of the wires was chasing it could be something refreshing. However, it's interesting to see a real turkey in a story that just did before the USA came directly to the war. I wonder if the surrounding politics has something to do and try to make a movie for all tastes, but end up with something that does not want to be one. However, it has historical value.
