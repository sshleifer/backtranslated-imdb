This film, although not totally bad, should have been filmed where the real events took place. Grand Island, Nebraska was devastated by no less than seven tornadoes at night on June 3, 1980. Grand Island is located at almost unmatched, flat Platte River Valley in Hall counties. The makers of this film are filmed in trees covering hills in Ontario and moving the whole event to a non-existent city called Blainsworth. The people of Grand Island are brave to survive this awful night only to be forgotten because of a sore film.
