This is, without a doubt, one the worst movie ever created. No discussion here. This is it. End of history. The story is juvenile and sub-moron, looking like it was created by a three-year old captive and dinosaur. The whole concept is just plain mute. It's subconscious how one can possibly come up with something so stupid and think it was fun. Jokes are also completely lame. If you have not seen this movie again, consider yourself lucky. If you are morbidly curious as how bad this movie is, please do not let me describe it. Words can not express how completely this horrible movie. This is not just as bad as being a bad movie. Even those who have Cohesion, if not the value of entertainment. That. . . This is. . . Ugh! Think about the worst story ever told and multiplied its wickedness level by 5,000, and you still do not come close to how horrible this film is. After giving a Pok√©mon movie at one point, giving this movie a point seems like nothing short of charity. That's how bad it is. Did the producers and directors take their film classes? Because this is a perfect example of how to do a movie. It looks like some high amateur on thin paintings made this movie. If you rent this, please take it back and ask for a refund. And do not even think about renting it anymore.
