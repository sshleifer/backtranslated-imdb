There is not one sympathetic character in this entire film. Is it the lawyer to play by Kenneth Branagh that we are supposed to pull for? Well, let's see - we learn it is a sleazebag defense lawyer who gets criminal off techniques. He treats his coworkers as a cow and gets involved in his personal crises (in the process, getting one of being killed), jeopardizing the safety of his children, threatening the new companion, trying hard- the police arm and school administrator - and all this for what? Because she was thinking of herself small! I was really pulling up for the dad and gang to beat the farsing out of the lawyer and drowning him in the swamp ... he'd made for a far more satisfying end.
