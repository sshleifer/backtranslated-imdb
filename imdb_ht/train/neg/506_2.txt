(aka: Bloodsucker is leading the dance) <br /> Many naked girls in this one and a couple of lesbian scenes cast in the movie are supposed to take place in Ireland but it looks more like Rome and Adriatic '. <br /> <br /> Gothic lesbians find guests in a county island count for the weekend. One by one seems to be missing themselves due to a madperson running around. <br /> It's not very scary or bloody and the rooms look like they are lit with floodlights though the candles are lit. Go face ... (sic) <br /> <br /> Dubbing is worse than usual and the plot only serves as an excuse for the erotic and nudity. Led by euro hacker actor Alfredo Rizzo, this is one snoozer. <br /> <br /> Pretty boring 2 out of 10
