A serial killer dies in a snowstorm and gets under mutation in the frosty badge of the snowman. Then go on a killing spree. Interesting draw. Sound scary. And it is scary. If you are five years old. Otherwise, it's kind of cheese. I saw it on the cable and I was glad I did not pay the money to see it. It has all the charm and style of a low-budget film that can become a cult movie. I'm sure he has a loyal fan base somewhere. I'm just not in it. Even though I did not like the movie as a whole, there were some scenes I found entertaining. Like the basin scene and the post-explosive scene with reference to Picasso. It was also enjoyable to watch the many ways Heroes try to kill Jack and he just does not seem to want to die. In short, "Jack Frost" is a good commercial low-budget B-movie comedy, but a bad low-budget B-movie horror movie.
