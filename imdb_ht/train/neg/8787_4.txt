I first heard about White noise when I saw TV ads. Before that time I did not even know it existed. I watched the trailer online and decided that I would go and see it. Now, being a fan of films like the Sixth Sense, I thought that this movie would give me all I wanted. He had Michael Keaton in it, and he was rocky. Unfortunately the movie did not deliver. He tried another sixth sense or stir in echoes, and failed miserably. It has a very promising start, but the medium just drags on to repeat itself, and ends with a totally poor twist that any monkey could calculate. Unfortunately as most movie films nowadays it depends on loud noise and bang making the audience jump. This movie could be so much more. It's a shame because it's a good idea.
