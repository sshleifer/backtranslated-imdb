This movie is terrible. Characters are completely incredible, and wildly consistency. The plot is awful and some of the classroom scenes are deserved-worthy and look comfortable. <br /> <br /> In fact, the quality of the script and characterization would suggest that this film was written by high school students, only lacking lack of credibility in the school setting would suggest that, in fact, writers They probably never went to high school. Acting in most cases was too weak, although many of this was down to a poor script and scheme, I'm not sure that any actor could make this movie lookable. <br /> <br /> it was said that the sound track was OK, and the cinematography was beautiful in places (although the correction was poor).
