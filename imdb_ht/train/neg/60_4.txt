I love Goldie Hawn and wanted another of his films, so when I saw the protocol for $ 5.50 at Walmart I bought it. Although lustfully entertaining, the film never really hit it a stride. Some scenes like a party scene in a bar just go on for too long and really have no purpose. Then, of course, there is the preachy scene at the end of the film that gives the whole movie a bad taste as far as I'm concerned. I do not think this scene adds to the movie at all. I do not like stupid comedies trying to teach me a lesson, written by some '60 burning out especially! <br /> <br /> In the end, although I'm glad to own another Hawn movie, I'm not sure he really is worth the money I've paid for it!
