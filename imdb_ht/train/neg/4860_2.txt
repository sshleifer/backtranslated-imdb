Terrible TV shows horrible! Why Central Comedy decided to repeat old bouts of this program is beyond me. It really sucks! I, of course, talk about the seasons after the first two. The first two seasons were gold, and if I only talked about these seasons, this show would have come out of ten stars. None of the comedians who appeared after the first two seasons that were not part of the original cast are any good. They were, and they, terrible. The comedy is not funny at all. At all !!! The original cast was full of talented comedy, such as Artie Lange, Phil LaMarr, and Mary Schorr (or whatever name it is), everyone should have better deals after leaving MAD TVs. This show is very overrated, and less worthy of your channel navigation time than Saturday Night Live, another horrible show. Go out on Saturday night and have fun, and let MAD TV fade and die, as it deserves.
