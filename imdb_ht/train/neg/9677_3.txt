somewhere I read that this movie is supposed to be a comedy. After seeing it, I would call it nothing. This film pointed out to me. The dialogue is all incredibly superficial and absurd, many of the sets seemed to be afterthoughts, and despite all the stripping and implicit sexual content, there is nothing erotic about this movie ... all left me in wonder just what heck this thing is over! The title title could have been the basis for a fun (politically incorrect) comedy. Instead, we're dealing cheap, up-to-date, and disadvantaged designs for its own sake. If I want that, I'll go buy a favor of jones cd.
