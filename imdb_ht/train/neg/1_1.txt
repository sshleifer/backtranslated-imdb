Robert DeNiro plays the most incredible smart illiterate forever. This film is so wasteful in talent, it is really disgusting. The Incredible Script. The dialogue is incredible. Jane Fonda's face is a cartoon in itself, and not a funny one. The movie moves at a snail's speed, photos in a sickly manner are advised, and is unbearable preachy. It also plug in every cliche in the book. Kurtz Swoozz is excellent in a support role, but is it so? <br /> <br /> Just as annoying is this new IMDB rule that requires ten lines for each review. When a movie is worthless, it does not require ten lines of text to let other readers know that it is a waste of time and tape. Avoid this movie.
