Just what happened to Sean Connery as a Harvard law, Kate Capshaw (does he still find work?) As his wife (small age difference) and Lawrence Fishburne as a South Rally captain (!) And Ed Harris in a totally pronounced pronoun in a fundamentalist killer of South series. <br /> <br /> Strange casting, but the movie plays serious mindf ** and the audience. (not it if you ever intend to watch this movie or forever watch this movie seriously due to the crowd) First of all, I felt myself rolling my eyes repeated in the liberal stereotypes: the whole sadistic cops and the black guy with no evidence. Christians, witnesses and even the lawyer of the defendant cooperate against her (she was accused of rape and murder of a young girl) because she is black. Connery is a Harvard law that gives a talk about injustice against black people and against the death of barbarism. It is approached by the man's grandmother sentenced to defend him and re-open the lawsuit. <br /> <br /> Connery is stonewalled (baye ...) by the little town officials and good IL's little club, but finding that the case against Blair, the alleged killer, now on the death row, all manufacture. The main proof is his confession that was beaten out of him. The beat was administered by a black cop (!) Which even played Russian Roulette to get the confession from him. Connery finds that another prisoner on death row actually killed the person and after a few small breasts with a seriously overacting, Hannibal Lecter-like Ed Harris, found out where Harris hid the murder weapon. It became a re-trial and Blair was released. <br /> I think ... movie about .... <br /> <br /> Suddenly! It seems that Blair is a psychotic psycho and that he uses "white guilt" to engage Connery. He devoted the story to Ed Harris in return for Blair bringing a little bit of death to Harris. <br /> Now Blair is on loose yet, thanks to Connery's scam PC principles! Final 30 min. is a strange action movie about a legal drama, Connery and Fishburne fight the serial killer in a home screen home screen on stilts (yes, you read that right) in the everglades. <br /> <br /> That was one unusual film .. So the whole system is corrupt and inefficient, the cops are all just crude and Abu Gravity torturous types, but criminals are really psychotic and worthy to fry . <br /> <br /> Surely depressing on all levels! The system is completely rotten with the white PC white qualities that its challenges seriously deluded too. Two thumbs down. Connery obviously made a mortgage payment or something.
