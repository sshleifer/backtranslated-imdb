I give this a generous card from ten stars, or point or markers, or something. There was a huge total of really really funny movies in this movie. All stages with Amy P and Tina Fey and Greg Kinnear (Greg Kinnear !!) have moved along enjoyably enough. <br /> Otherwise, the usual traffic of stereotypes, flashing speed, tuned pushed by a stupid soundtrack, and "band" is generous. <br /> Anyway, the really really funny scenes involved Amy P. It's just really hilarious of a kind of animal in style. It's a mix of what brand makers are doing about SNL and Lucille Ball. <br /> I hope they (Amy P and Tina Fey) just flush out admitting they did so for the money, because if not done, he was born in the Palin Sarah parody, then I guess we can say yes, it was worth it to put the black guy back to the role of man's servant, who's really there to help you be more humane. <br /> Blah. 4 outta 10 as I said is generous. <br /> But no more, girls, OK? Oh, I almost forgot. The mother from "Two and a Half Men" is in this film, and has some kind of plastic surgery, so that her mouth now looks like the mouth of a 30 year old, so every scene It's, I love trying to rearrange her face, or put it together in my mind, or just answer the question, "No. Wait ... Wait she's got plastic surgery?" Because as a viewer, you really do not want it to have plastic surgery.
