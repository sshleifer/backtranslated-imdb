Absolutely one of the worst movies I've seen in a long time! It starts off seriously and just deteriorates. Katherine Heigl is awfully miscast in a role of Lolita and Leo Grillo manfully struggling with what is essentially a cardboard cutout character. The only cast-member with any enthusiasm is Tom Sizemore, who host him as a villain and goes completely upside down with his role. The script is terrifying, awful acting and having a big hole drift enough to drive a double-decker bus in! It is also the most sexis movie I've ever seen! Katherine Heigl character is completely unsympathetic. He saw this as a bad, seductress who wants to attach the poor, innocent bride to cheat on his wife. It is implicit in the movie that it's minor, and the message that accompanies that draw-strand just chanting belief! In the end, he can not even redeem himself by shooting the person in obviously (ha!) Becoming depressed with rage and guilt, but the script allows him to kill himself, thereby rashimi himself in the eyes of men everywhere. Terib. Do not waste your time.
