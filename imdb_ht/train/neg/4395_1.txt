December holiday specials, such as the original frosty, should be rich-produced and quality music with a scenario, but lighthearted scenario. They should have a touch of mystical magic in the holidays. Basically, they should look, sound, and feel ... well, "special" and should have a decent and decent december holiday holiday. So when I saw the legendary frosty snowman on the TV list, I got my kids (6 and 8) pumping up so he did not tell them the story of the original frosty and passionate about how much I loved it as a kid. As my wife and children choked up on the couch to watch the movie their expectations were high but 10 minutes to read my kids were given with my wife and I gave each other the "look" and rolled our eyes. After 35 minutes my kids were actually asked to go to bed - I guess they were fed up with the sensitive and freeware language, seconds to disconnect. I was actually embarrassed about the deceptions (and I) and this movie. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the legendary Frosty Snowman is more like a bad episode of Fair Odd Parents are crossed with a worse-than-normal episode of Sponge Bob than a classic holiday movie. Do not get me wrong ... these are good shows and I love them as much as the guy next, but when I look at unprecedented parents or Sponge Bob, my low expectations (for mediocre, off-color, zero subtext, idea of ​​hustle episodes) are still satisfied. <br /> We chose some good books and spent the rest of the evening together. A better choice than the anbarrassingly bad legend of the snowman frosty.
