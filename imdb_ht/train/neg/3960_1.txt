Hi, let me because I'm not a major theater or a sophisticated film overseer ... I think this film is "boring" and "mute". <br /> I've rented this movie because of Charles Bronson and it's titled ... but boy is a waste of time ... just watching 2 guys sitting in a vault and talking ... the movie about This DVD was so "DARK" ... I had hard time watching the movie reproduction ... I realized it was a movie 1968 ... but they're putting it on a DVD then they'd must do some digital remastering. <br /> Also, I was totally surprised to see the high markings on IMDb for this movie ... as I said before I'm not as sophisticated as the others commented on this movie earlier.
