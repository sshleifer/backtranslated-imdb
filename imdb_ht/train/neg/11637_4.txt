Uwe Boll did the impossible: creating a game adaptation that remains at least a bit true in the game; It has become a full game of antisocial content and offensive in a full movie of antisocial and offensive content. So, as an adaptation, it's a success. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, it's still Uwe Boll we're dealing with here, so do not expect the movie to be actually any good. While it has the moment, "Postal" has outdated it very quickly and it becomes a pain to sit down. <br /> At its core, Postal is a satire in the United States, as does not a twelve year old kid. Boll seems to think that offensive is linearly proportional to the comic value: the more offensive, the funnier, and the more exaggerated funnier. That's the result of a movie that sets the new level of blood taste while having a lot of hits and misses. Yes, some gags do work but it seems to be the best chance. Highlights include the satire director himself, and those who are getting very violent hit by trucks and other cars. Low points include .. beautifully all else. <br /> <br /> After the initial surprise is wrapped, Code simply becomes a firm to look. Yes there is a good joke each and good ten minutes, but everything else consists of hordes of annoying characters to shoot and chase each other all over the place for what seems to be an eternity. <br /> <br /> This probably would have worked as a short film, but it just does not have enough content for something longer than 90 minutes (although it feels twice as long). There are beautiful ideas and trying pretty, but to find hopelessly lost in endless and unhelpful scene scenes and content that is offensive just for the sake of 4/10
