The best thing I can say about this film is that it is well-paced. It did not fall flat. The next best thing to do is the performances supported by the actor playing foppish groom-to-be Edward, still Holland Taylor's beautiful, and actor to play Taylor's wedding. The actor helps criticize the potential team in an early stage brings a good absurd-yet-winning thoroughness to the procedures. Well, that's about it on the positive side. Dermot Mulroney, whom I worship, is far more credible to express contempt in stirring any scene where he tried to be either businesslike or supportive. As others noted, it seems there is no emotional investment in this venture other than its packaging as quickly as possible. Stirring, on the other hand, sincerely trying to bring the film and to create the illusion of chemistry with Mulroney. It's adequate to do this, but it's simply not a loud enough actress to pull everything out without help. Give it an "E" for effort and a "C +" for achievement. Given the Mulroney's indifference, one thing that could have helped Messing would have a brilliant irons-ironing rider of the actor playing his ex-fiancee, Jeffrey. Instead, its performance is weak-knee, mewling, and safe. If I tried to analyze this one any further, I would obviously have to pay more attention than most of those involved. It's dangerous enough to spend time if you have nothing else to do, and less obnoxious (and less creative) than the wedding singer, but you are better watching "My best friend" again.
