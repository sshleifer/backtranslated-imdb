Remember the chain-channeler chandler exposed over 60 minutes a few years ago? This is it. Many of this movie reviews are without checking the good fides of the filmmakers. Producers have used promotional "promiscuous" promises without releasing financial and philosophical fundamentals for this piece of marketing trick. If you believe in channeling, reincarnation, new dreck age and day-old Baloney, this movie is for you. If you want a discussion about physical or reality proportions, look elsewhere. The purpose of this movie is to convince you that Ramtha is not a wacko, so you'll be given a bunch of money. If you can tiptoe through the Ramtha website without the screaming of disbelief, then maybe you'll think the bucks you fall on this infomercial for madness has been well spent. <http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/section?category=ANSWERMAN>
