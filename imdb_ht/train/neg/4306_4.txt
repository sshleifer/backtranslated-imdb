There is a good thing in this movie: Lola Glaudini's ass! I'm sorry to be so thin, but it's the truth. Too bad he did not make a naked one. It would at least have made this tolerable mess. We see hottest another chick but it is nowhere near Lola. And who is Armand Assante old or what? The man looks crap! "Impact" is the usual B-movie you would expect. The story was potential. It's like they were good idea but did not know how to execute them. Cinematography is just plain terrible. Ugly! The direction is inspired and the end result is a border thriller and larynx twists and washes up actors. Lola Gaudini is great as the vixen in a cheap, slutty way but it does not even save "Impact" from being garbage and not funny litter, just plain old garbage dump.
