I went to a screening of this movie and while having a couple moments that made me laugh, she had some great flaws. It first of all presents itself to be the silly exploits of a real life divorce trying to find love in LA. What it morphs in is a depressing, narcissistic, and unfunny disturbance in the history of life like the movie director and professional life. Jokes put too fast quickly and you suddenly find yourself not care how the date of this man progresses. The Ridicule is that the director simultaneously introduced himself as a very annoying and heavily disguised character and then hoping to be concerned.
