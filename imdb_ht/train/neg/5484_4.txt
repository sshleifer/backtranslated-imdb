This movie is about a family trying to become the theme and death of the mother / wife by moving to Genova, Italy. The plot of "Genova" sounds promising, but unfortunately it is empty and focused. The film only consists of a collection of scenes that describe the daily life of the family, such as swimming, piano lessons or cooking eggs. Most of these scenes are redundant and tedious, completely missed to engage viewers emotionally. The finish is extremely disappointing as it is not spectacular, moving or emotional. I can safely say that I'm disappointed and bored by "Genova" The only good thing about the movie is the sunny weather and the beauty of Genova. "Genova" can serve as an extended tourism advertisement for the city, but not as a movie to be enjoyed.
