Probably the worst movie Bollywood I've seen. <br /> <br /> No line drawn. Very little character development. <br /> Complete humorous and pointless humor. The whole movie was chaotic and direction-less. There was no finishing finish in the story. The airport was filmed in a mall. <br /> <br /> Even the story melts over and over again until you mean "please just move on to it!" Even the song and dance were useless and seriously choreographer. <br /> <br /> The only good thing about this movie is that there were hot bods all around ... but then most of the Bollywood movies have that anyways these days. <br /> My BT does not come from an American background <br /> 2/10
