Spoilers Warning. Superb recreation at the base of Antarctica where the real events of the film took place. Other than that, drugs!, Scandals! Filmed in Canada; presumably not a widely Canadian crew and cast. I hold the last half of this film recently on Global TV here in Canada. There is nothing so much to tell others than how surprised at what a blatant piece of American revisionist propaganda is; and start Susan Sarandon to everyone! I can only assume that Canadian-born director Roger Spottiswoode was forced to make USAF heroes in the movie when in fact the real rescuers where a small private jet based in Calgary; Kenn Borek Air.
