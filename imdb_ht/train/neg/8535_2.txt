As I said, the book was very good and this would be a good movie if Melissa Gilbert was not so horrible and incredible to lead lead. What kind of accent was thought to be anyway? He sounded similar to his terrible Russian accent in another movie that I saw him in. Every time he opened my mouth I cringed. It took 3 attempts before I could watch the entire movie. Brad Johnson was the other lead. <br /> I really liked the scenes where beaches. Added some brightly needed to take your mind off of Melissa Gilberts depression painted. I think they could use San Francisco to see more of the benefits though. It looked like the night scene was actually SF, but I might be wrong. I do not remember the character of the book being this depressing. <br /> <br /> Please keep Melissa Gilbert out of any future movie that requires an accent!
