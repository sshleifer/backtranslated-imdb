I think I should start this by saying that almost any style of work can be fun at parties. The true test is whether it is good from beginning to end, which is the reason I gave the analogy title for this review. Most of us would agree - even those like me, who enjoy reading a lot of blogs - which blogs can not be compared with writing good novels for a number of reasons. Likewise, FEM can not be compared to good movie making for a number of reasons, and I actually believe it's a poor example of independent photography. From start to finish, FEM feels like a pieced set along vlog. (Heck, even MySpace gets some pimping.) If I wanted to see an hour of lonelygirl15 - I'm not - I would watch it. FEM, while certainly grittier than the gum bubble atmosphere of the aforementioned media, so personal that it is without an interesting story. It's like looking at the world of life, which I think most would agree is pretty naturally boring. But the creators of FEM want us to applaud, many postmodern films on making a movie. Replica gives me. <br /> <br /> Finally, I do not care little the least about any of it. I'm shocked that I'm actually interested in taking time out of writing this review, even. It's not that FEM is downright bad, because it's not; It's a moment when I crack a smile or think that maybe - just maybe - something of interest is about to happen. It's rather that it's just downright ... mediocre. I feel so unkind about it that it's almost fitting into an oxymoron: passionate indifference. <br /> I hope the creators / "actors" of the movie get out of debt from their efforts. They will probably need it for when one of them moves out and moves on with life. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie if you have time to waste and nothing much you want to do; otherwise, than not, and do not worry that you missed some great, talented gender. You really do not have.
