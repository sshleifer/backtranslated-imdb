Definitely the worst movie I've ever seen ... Has anyone told me where should I laugh? There is no single hint or shadow of an idea. Three leading actors are pesticides, especially the one (I think it's Aldo) from Sicily that _can't_ makes a Sicilian accent !!! Do not say about dream-like insertion on Dracula ... just another quicker, drawn from the worst cabaret tradition, making this "movie" last a little longer. Massironi and Littizzetto do what they can, but the so called film was really too, too hard to save. I would give it "0" / 10, but the lowest mark was 1/10 and so I had to overestimate it by one mark.
