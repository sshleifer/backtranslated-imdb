First of all, what good is in the movie? Are some pretty actresses? exotic background? The fact that the actors do not laugh while acting (would I have if I were in their situation)? I do not know. The scenario is simple: a Catholic priest who makes abstract paintings trying to find that (another abstract painting) killing his younger brother, a prostitute male (raping another priest when he was young ...). I'm afraid there is nothing here to learn or leave a little bit about serious assassins, art or religion. Dennis Hopper is not very good here. This is the worst episode of the worst episode of the "profile" (series) and substitute actors and incredible coincidences (the uncle is the policeman who, the girl who lives in another victim's house could have a baby and the priest, etc., etc.).
