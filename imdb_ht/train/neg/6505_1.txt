A mess is confused from beginning to end. As they said about the Beatles'songs, there was a secret message if you played LP back. If someone had the patience to watch these movie scenes from finishing their start, you would come away with the same degree of deception. <br /> <br /> Apart from all that podge psychedelic hodge of flashbacks and fake commences, The most obvious characters were the movie tourists, out for revenge if the movie did not get sorted. There was nothing to love about these two. Overlapping, shouting and the threats were delivered in comic books. I think one dimension was an overstatement. <br /> <br /> Well, so maybe the artsy types are rolling their eyes reveling in the fact that unlike them, we plebeians just did not find it. Well I'm afraid there was nothing to get. And the two cardinal sins in any bad movie brought from start to finish. A non-existent and pathetic storyline if you want to call it that, and by far the worst, is not a single character you care about in the least.
