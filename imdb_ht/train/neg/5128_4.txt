Enter B early in the patriotic category to slap a gorgeous Gene Tierney on the advertisement and poster, but you have to wait for a good time before glimpse it, riding in a Hollywoodized camel train. Previously, we set up George Sanders and Bruce Cabot in the desert as guys who barely get together, but they must be gathering in the face of attack. I saw Sanders as many enjoyable tunes as he was pleased to witness a very good guy guy. However, Bruce Cabot's attraction is pretty much a mystery for me - it's base and unsubtle in comparison, but I've always felt it would just appear, smiling, from beneath a car, covered in fat and a sixth year education. Some people like this' em way, as did Gypsy Gypsy character to the queen. This is an action adventure filler, that, and just as we have been warned of invading locals and weapons, ready to sabotage and attack the Brits in their country, have a final battle weapon in which we must lose a main character for the good all. This feature requires nothing more than your barest attention on a Saturday afternoon, a programmer who did everything else he was scared and better. It was almost more interesting to identify great cast in support and a surprise appearance by Dorothy Dandridge in one of his first roles. A two or two and a half stars from five-MDM
