One of my sister's friends borrowed me this game, and it's too damn hard! It brings the appearance of a childhood game, but you have to learn how to make tons of complicated movements that require you to twist and turn your hand into all kinds of awkward positions, and you have to search for a seemingly endless level of score 100 , improve your score! You also have to find these impossibly hidden puzzle puzzle pieces, which require you to work almost impossible to find them! AND I GET ONLY TO DATE THREE !!!!! Maybe if you do not have nad living can stay home all the time you can get some fun out of this, but otherwise keep up! AND IT IS DEFINITION NOT RECOMMENDED FOR KIDS - WILL BE PULL HUSK FROM OR!
