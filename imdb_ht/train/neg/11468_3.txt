I do not know who has the idea that orcs go to murder and bashing and destroying things for revenge but my God is absurd. Orcas are most definitely not the cold-sane movie killer to make them out to be ... its comic. Orcas are very intelligent, do not get me wrong, but I'm very skeptical to know and understand a concept like revenge. So I must say all I got from this movie was the entertainment of how preposterous it was. So I was at least somewhat amused by it. Personally, I would recommend going and seeing Jaws if you want to see a kind of Animal-Killing-Humans kind of movie. But if you are like me and want to laugh at something far from realism then I'd say go ahead. : D
