The pet titles react to havoc in a peaceful desert town. This is basically the whole plot for this movie, and while the scenes devoted to the munchies themselves are a bit fun (in a kind of lowbrow in style), the rest is just filler, and the bad filler . From the "Hero", which is a painful Woody Allen wannabe, in the ultra-mute cop, it's hard to choose the most irritating characters in the movie. There were times when almost all of them were on the screen and I thought, "OK, at least the girlfriend is nice, but why have we set up with the rest of those morons?". The film is also filled with pop references (from Ozzy Osbourne Linda Blair), which probably made it already dating by the early 90's. (* 1/2)
