Revenge on our public watch maybe. I was sitting in this movie 2 hours and I was waiting for the second act to kick in so that the movie lived up to its title. But Costner never avenged her hate to her death and the movie ends. I left wondering where the rest of the movie was. If a movie is called Revenge then the hero best finds some of the end of the movie. I had a choice to see this or black rains in the movie. Fortunately I saw the movie other brothers in the movie instead. It caught up with this turkey on video. There was a good thing about the movie and was melody its beautiful theme. Listen to cd.dont watch this terrible one. 1 out of 10
