I just rent and watch this movie just to see what's all about fuss. So here's what my reaction is. It's easy to see that this is a low budget film and poor actors. The main draw in this film is about a woman gets revenge on her violence. This concept if doing right could easily turn out to be a really provocative movie. However, the movie does not trauma or disturb me at all. She just bored me. This film can easily be reduced under 45 minutes. All of the scenes are mostly filled in time, such as those scenes scenes and some scenes I described below. <br /> *************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************** I do not know if I've looked at the cut or uncut version, if there's actually such a version. I also found holes plot many of the plot already wrong writing. Here is a list on my mind. Why not take violent rape Jennifer during the night when she walked out of her house to find out what the noise is. That would be an excellent time. Why are not they just gang rape, instead of delaying some of the violent pleasures and Jennifer's hustle deterioration is not as a long time. It would probably be more shocking and disturbing this way. <br /> I found it really stupid that raped them from the jungle and head back to her home. Maybe they show that these violations are really imbalized. <br /> <br /> These violent ones should at least know that if you want to do a right job right, they should not send an inhumored dish to the job. /> <br /> Why do not Jennifer call the police when raping them finally left? What should be the first thing that pops up in the mind of most people, especially for someone who is a writer. <br /> <br /> Why did not these violent smell catch away when they saw Jennifer is alive? <br /> I find it really amazing that a slender lady like Camille can pull a man up a tree and hang him. ************************ End beke ************ <br /> But hey, this movie is Without its fundamentals, Camille Keaton is gorgeous and I get to hear one of the funniest lines I've heard when Matthew protests will go back to the house and kill Jennifer, "Why me? Why me, I did not even c ^ m !!! '
