I've seen my fair share of fenced thought-out and final movie twists, but I do not remember any movie that allegedly supposedly as this one did. <br /> <br /> The movie makers have clearly expected that the big twist would 'surprise' us all .... and it did, but perhaps not by the way the directors expected. I left wondering that Connery, Harris, Fishburn and Capshaw had nothing to do with this turkey, individually or collectively. <br /> <br /> The movie up to the final thirty minutes was rather committed and I love the way the story unfolded with the nature of the movie overall. But once the twist was revealed, the plot and inconsistencies were remarkable, the concealed motives for revenge were ill-design and the way things were so worked out for Bobby Earl was ridiculous far-fetched. What's worse is that, once the twist has revealed, the rest of the movie has become excruciatingly predictable. Harris gave a terrific performance and Connery is like Morgan Freeman in that he never gives a bad performance, even if the movie is not that great! So, all in all, it starts with the unfolding to keep the viewer interested. The last 30 minutes are one of the most dimmed memory memories in movies.
