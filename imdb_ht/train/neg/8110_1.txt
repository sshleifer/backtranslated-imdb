I think Phillip Kaufman read notes in the cliff of the Kundera novel and then put on doing this movie. Okay, of course he will not have the punch in the original. Kundera's novels are great because of manipulation of the narrative concept, his ability to step into and out of his story constructed. This movie does not even try! Seven dreams of Tereza, so vital to the atmosphere of the book, is reworked and it does not make any sense too. Also, and this is perhaps a smaller point, Daniel Day-Lewis looks like a lot like Ben Stiller in this (I know he's not really a complaint, but hey). A perfect example of the Hollywood izing in otherwise fine literature.
