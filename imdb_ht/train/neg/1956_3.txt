This movie has a feature of redemption. At one point, after a character attacked by an ax-touching ax, his brother asked him, "Why is your Dick, Chuck?" After suffering from nearly an hour of bad movie, this almost made my drink out my nose. Some of the acting is not too bad, but the kids all stink and PJ Sol should be ashamed of doing this movie. The story is weak and nobody does what you think (or what common sense dictation) should be. Of course, there are a lot of story points that do not add up. For example, in one ghost scenes of teenagers must focus hard to move a physical object to prove to exist, a hard feat because they apparently can not communicate with physical problems. However, later minutes they all gather branches into the ground and beat the fairy darn with them. Apparently they can sometimes move subjects and sometimes they are NOT. Go face. <br /> Many blood and intestines, though ... a few pretty nice. But that does not make up for their deficiencies. <br /> <br /> If you want a movie about Fairy tooth, go to "Dark Falls". I think it's great, though a lot of other reviews do not share my opinion. At least he sets an attitude.
