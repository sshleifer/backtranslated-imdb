Evident attacks on Microsoft are made by people who do not seem to understand intellectual property or market economics generally. <br /> Loony Liberal Tim Robbins plays a trivial cartoon underlying bill bill, and is a cartoon commercial mechanic astrologer right and left murders. <br /> While Microsoft can engage in some anticompetitive activities at times, it's easy to actually kill. Therefore, the film is on the head and ridiculous in the beginning. <br /> <br /> The "deeper" point apparently that the greatest technology innovations should be free to the public, and not subject to intellectual property laws. However, this ignores the fact that larger innovations would never have been developed if not for incentives to market (and rewards) provided by intellectual property. It's one thing to be opposed to anti-competitive behavior - this is common sense. It is quite another to be opposed to competing markets in the first place, which is the mantra of the film ("knowledge belongs to humanity"). Another example of Hollywood is being completely out of touch with reality.
