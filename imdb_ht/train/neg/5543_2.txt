Seriously, I absolutely love these old and simplistic movies, but I just watch this for the first time last night and it's easy to flatten my mind five of all time. Was this supposed to be about the love story or the zombies ??? This movie was so bad that after thanking all the things I could do is laugh at how ridiculous it was. Fortunately I'm too anal to turn a movie off without seeing all the stuff or I would not be able to make noise on watching this all the way to in one sitting! I like to think something positive can tell about anything in life so in keeping with that theory I will recognize the most positive film advantage, it was very short for a full length film.
