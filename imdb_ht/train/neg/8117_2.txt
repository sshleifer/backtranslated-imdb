"Terrible people" should be the subtitle of this horrible movie. If you want to see ordinary people do ordinary things, then look out to your window in real life. But if you want to see people unpleasant to do these dull things, you'll have to watch this horrible movie by Mike Leigh. The characters speak in length, but never actually manage to interact with each other. Why? Obviously because Leigh the things that we all are as effective and pathetic as her actors, and she wants real life movies. But we do not, and it fails.
