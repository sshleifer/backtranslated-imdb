When you saw people behind the sun I guess I hope for an evolution of style & technique to match the biggest scale of this movie. I was also very interested to see someone make a hard-hit reality based on fictional content of what happened during this famous Japanese atrocity, but this is not it. This plays as a movie-under-the-middle film of European film exploits from the 70s - e.g. SS Camp Experience etc. (possibly more like Deported Women in Special Section actually). Granted it has a larger dimension and more people run around, but it resorts to the same same cheap and joyful device of the hapless lottery that is not lit actor falls on the sound of fake ridiculous fuss, spell up and occasionally wrongly executed the 'trauma' sequence. This horrible documentary documentary is roughly reinforced in between scenes for hacking that even the real images are stolen from many of their powers. See Channel 4 of the 'Holocaust' (Delivered recently (always running?), As of 1 Name 2006) for a truly disturbing documentary about the wounds of war (presenting excellent in-context use of current footage). This kind of horror treatment in Nanjing deserves, not this garbage exploitation garbage (a better exploitation film executed less used in disrespect of stock footage would be good, but yet this is not even a very good movie exploitation). Rating: 3 (5 as exploitation, 1 as a treatment of the subject).
