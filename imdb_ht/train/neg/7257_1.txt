I was expecting a French music b-movie. After all, Dhéry, Blanche, DeFunès was superstar of French budget low-budget films at that time. And it is in color! But I have delusions in this incredible 30-hour hourly mediatration. Music numbers are terrible, and comedy is absolutely boring and stupid. With these songs? Which song? This is just a succession of bad numbers, one after another. Only one thing very rare about this is the nudity of women. It was not familiar to this time. In fact, some numbers just have to show us topless women. It adds to the mediocrity! And try to find young Michel Serrault, the future big actor in French cinema, in a bit part as a musician, in his very first movie. Good luck!
