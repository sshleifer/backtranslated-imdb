(Spoilers galore) This is an absolutely awesome movie. First of all he has that guy from the middle. I guess he's made a career from playing doting daddy. It was OK the first time she tried to scare her son by pretending to be a monster ... but then 10 minutes later they cloyingly did it again! So it goes, this movie moves in real time unleashed. At one point, I started her image was the day after, until I recalled that the story line was only in the coming day ... in the early afternoon! I'm not really sure this couple is supposed to be in real life. First of all they are presented as a sort of a couple of yuppie Manhattan who grew up and had a kid. But they drive an old Volvo blue. Those people stopped driving Volvos decades ago. Today they drive Priuses. But in 2002, I'm sure they still did not drive Volvos. <br /> <br /> OK, then there Wendigo. A "mysterious American people" gives the boy a little magical Wendigo statue and tells him of his powerful magic. C'mon ... we're still doing the old American mysteries. Just to drive it home, they pan through all American statues in the upstate tourist city of New York City. American Indians are described in a way that is not seen for decades in this movie! Oh, and about Wendigo. It's not actually the cause of the horror. He did not kill the kid's father who is the most terrible thing in the movie ... he just killed by an ordinary hick and a rudge with a high power steering wheel. Wendigo's only out of the film avenged the guy who killed the father ... oh, but waited, it seemed earlier that Wendigo was kind of crazy to the dad, maybe because he killed a deer ... So, Wendigo must have been happy that the father died ... but ... <br /> <br /> So it goes ... insults, boring and idle. There is no reason to watch this movie at all.
