Over the years I've seen a bunch of people in video segment video, and each person keeps the same amount of entertainment; Unfortanetley, the entertainment level is at a bar. Make sure the sequence actions were fun, but that was pretty much it. Seagal was really in his prime when he made such movies; Under Siege, under Siege 2, and executive rulings (at least on the action's point of view), but over the last ten years, these films of the Segal stars have not met the past qualifications. The most positive place, the film made good use of time, as some of the sequence sequences and uses of understanding. Just when the movie seemed to just drag on, a nice cool action scene carried it out of the gutter. I honestly believe that more of Segal's movies would do better if it was not the only one recognized by the movie fan. Supporting actors and actresses is very important, and if current cinemas were known to have this known actor support and actress, perhaps the movie will get famous results.
