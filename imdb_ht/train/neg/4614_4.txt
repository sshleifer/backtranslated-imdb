She boggles the idea how this film was nominated for seven Oscars and won one. Not because it is abysmal or because they provide the collective qualifications of the creative team behind it really worthy, but because of each category the Honorid Prizzi nomination has disappeared. Some would argue that old Hollywood pioneer John Huston lost her to this point in his career but I did not buy it. Only the previous year he signed the superb UNDER VOLCANO, a black character study set in Mexico, which was among the finest he ever had. Honor the Prizzi on the other hand, a movie filled with star power, good intentions and a decent script, proves to be a great disappointment. The overall tone and draw of a gangster fall in love with a female hit-man prefigures the original crimines that hold Hollywood by storm in the early 90's, but the script is too entangled for its own sake, the motivations are off and on The whole story seems to be exactly what it's trying to be: a romantic comedy, a crime drama, a legendary gangster etc. Jack Nicholson (performing a Brooklyn accent that works perfectly for De Niro but compelling sounds coming from Jack) and Kathleen Turner in the leading roles seems to be in check mode, just going through the almost sleepwalking motions of the roads in some parts. Anjelica Huston at the other but the far fare, but her performance is sabotage by her character's motivation: she starts out the victim of her father's grandot disdain and proves to be the support of her ex-husband, then become a vibrant bitch who wants himself on a plate. The colors of the film have a quality wash-up as it did in the early 70's and Huston's direction is as refreshing as anything else. There are pledges behind the story and maybe in the hands of an avid director to be aware he might have been morphed into something better, but that leaves a movie that nobody really was interested in doing.
