I studied Catalan, and I was happy to find El Mar, a movie and especially catalog catalogs, in my art video store. <br /> <br /> Hmmm ... not so happy to see that. <br /> Yes, as other reviews said, it's well done, and pretty good photos. Although the opening sequence of children is shocking, it's quite apt and convincing. (For the most part, which is ... Are the Mallorquins buried a corpse in the funeral preparation of the city's square, in full view of the boy's 10-year-old boy?) Oh, well. minute details. Until then, he had something to feel in a non-magical Pan Labyrinth, also set in the Hispanic Civil War. <br /> <br /> Fast-forward, with three children who have survived the occurrence of occurrence has come of age. Francisca is a religious worker in a tuberculosis sanatorium with the two boys, Manuel and Ramallo, both are patients. I know, but hey, coincidences happen. <br /> The problem, as with many Spanish movies (exquisite for Almodovar fans), is that with an exception (Francisca) the characters are just for dang * strange *. Motivation, personality, and dialogue are often simply incoherent. <br /> <br /> What's more, it's down to some miserable extract. Prepare for many pain and lots of blood. The review called it a "potboiler" is well on track. If he did 40 years ago, the poster would say: Look LOVE BABY !! RAPE !! MURDER !! MUTILASYON !! FANATIZISM! ANIMAL CRUELTY !! BETRAYAL !! <br /> <br /> The opening opening is not nearly enough to make the characters and relationships of the credible characters. To work, this should have had multiple multiple recoveries out of the characters. As it is, it looks like a rare and depressing cross between "Sun Feasts, Moon Sisters" and "Pulp Fiction." If this sounds like something you've got to see, by all means, enjoy. I think I go with something that does not make me feel like having a shower to wash on the gorilla and gloom. <br /> As for the Catalan, it's the Mallorqui dialect, fairly different than the Barcelona dialect, though I was surprised by the comment that even Barcelona apparently needed translation of the catalog to understand it.
