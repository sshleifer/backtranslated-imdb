Sheesh! What a great movie. Dodgy camera works, a script that has more corn than the Kellogg, and hinges so Hammy you could open a pig farm with it. <br /> <br /> To look it all, it does not know which audience is targeting - we have Cornel Wilde - or is that Corny Wilde? - Get on his soap box on the dangers of smoking whenever someone lights a cigarette, my dear oh, and in another awesome scene we have the baddie, lobo, forcing him, ahem, if you want to, boy friend 'does a striptease dressed in a bikini. Try to explain that one of the children ... <br /> Throw in a type of Treasure Island-like-type type storyline, and the result is a movie so unintentionally funny, it's enjoyable - I'm not should expect a DVD edition special anytime soon, though.
