Dolph Lundgren star as a former cop / boxer who digs Boston's rocky scene to find out who killed his brother, who was well thought in the community, however by the way, he learns how his brother enjoyed sex Kinky and that a serial killer is to blame. Dolph Lundgren is very good at this film, in fact on the basis of her performance here, one would forget to climb Lundgren's role role involved. This was said that the Lundgren material has nothing to work with, in fact, Lundgren is completely left out of the circle of a gigantic thriller that is both predictable and incomprehensible. Co-star Danielle Brett is also good, in fact the movie works best when it smokes around chemistry in Lundgren and Brett, indeed the movie has taken the time to explore the movie's relationships would have been fairly decent. However the film is subtle, the action is non-existent, the plot does not provide sufficient exploration (too boring B. Lundgren's investigation into his brother's employer) and the film is unusually gorish and ridiculous. Again, Lundgren is actually good (as is New Danielle Brett) but the film just glows from one sequence to the next, making this movie particularly disappointing. If anything else though, it shows how underrated Lundgren is, as an actor. <br /> <br /> * 1/2 from 4- (Poor)
