This movie is so bad it's good - in a unusual way. I could not stop watching it, I laughed a lot! It's like a parody of a romantic comedy, except it's a parody. Alexandra Paul plays Emily Wendell, the sailor's teacher's wife who falls hard to Luke (Corey Sevier), a hunky and mysterious driver who we eventually learned was imprisoned; Seven things are only guilty of, though, are bad acts! Remember, it's not worse than the other actors. You get the sense that the actors have * no * ideas in a really awful movie; they're playing it right. Everything about the movie is bad: acting, the script, the love scenes, the rhythm, the twists scheme, the choice of music. The climax scenes are just so funny - the first shootout of the church, then Luke final word Emily - I was screaming and laughing. <br /> <br /> Evidently Luke has done a lot of weight lifting and off crunches in jail, and we get to see a lot of all his torso. That's probably the highlight of the movie.
