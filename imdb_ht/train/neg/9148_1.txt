I was looking over incredible under 100 because I thought id never saw anything as bad as 9 plans out of outerspace or ball remake balls, I was wrong. Ben and Arthur defeated both. <br /> From this countless number of movies I've seen is one of the worst movie ever I've ever seen. Bad Direct, Bad Character, Terrible Acting, Terrible History There is nobody reason, but Sam always says anything positive about this movie. Sam was a terrible actor to harass her hand so badly she could just reverse Ed Wood. <br /> <br /> The director should be disappointed in his job unfortunately I must give him at least 1 star, but he deserves - to continue the star.
