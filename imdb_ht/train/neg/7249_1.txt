This film rival "Plan 9" as one of the movie dumbest ever made. Always be concerned when the same person is: the <br /> <br /> 1. Star 2. Director 3. Producer 4. Writer 5. Stuntman, and 6. Editor. Sadly, Justin Kreinbrink did all 6 jobs! IMDb shows that he and his father were west but Cascade. So maybe that was the problem. <br /> <br /> Here's just an example of the movie: in the movie The sheriff took a witness to another city for protection. Of course, the bad guys get out and are waiting for them. But what happens? The good guys are riding along with an outer ring inject and hit a tree near them. When the camera shows us the bad guys are all just sitting on a log, discuss. What's wrong with this picture! <br /> I could go on. Perhaps this movie was meant as a comedy. If so, he did not do that well either.
