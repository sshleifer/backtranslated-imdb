This one is just like the 6th film. The movie is really bad. It offers anything to the death department. One-piece material is bad and is something that should not be in a NOES film. Freddy comes as a happy child of the entire movie. Lisa Wilcox is still the only thing that makes this one worth while. Characters are extremely underdeveloped. All in all better than the 6th, but still one of the worst movies in the series. My Rating 2/10
