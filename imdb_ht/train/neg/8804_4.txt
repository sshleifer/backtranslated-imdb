Great CGI effect and a true Oscar-worthy performance by Gary Sinise as Lt. Dan. Tom Hanks is a one-trick shot of this movie, how he received Oscar's best Actor this year on Morgan Freeman was a crime. This film is a loving letter of love to the boom for baby's baby boom, with a very low right prejudice, starting from Forrest in Vietnam all the way to the "resolution" and Jenny at the end. <br /> With that said, though, it is hugely amusing with an American movie in and through. I found some parts of this movie very offensive, Zemeckis dumbs down this movie almost at Gump level itself. . .which was the point he was trying to do. <br /> Watch this movie and ask yourself "What is Robert Zemeckis saying about what makes a good Indian?" <br /> <br /> Forrest seems to have made the "right" choice and being in the "right place at the right time" for the last 45 years. People who are wrong by the director's vision seem to pay a heavy price. So, Zemeckis says idiocy disguised as innocent and naive is a patriotic, even quality American?
