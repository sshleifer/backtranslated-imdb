See a trailer for this on another video, and decide to rent when it came out. Boy, I was disappointed! The story is very boring, the act (aside from Christopher Walken) is bad, and I could not care less about the characters, aside from really wanting to see Nora's husband get whipping. Christopher Walken's role is such a throw-away, what a tease!
