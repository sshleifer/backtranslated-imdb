This has to be the worst, and I mean the worst movie ever made! And this tells a lot because the line of stinkers is time and smelly! <br /> Now, at least we know what happened ginger after he escaped from the Gilligan Island! A pair of Tina Louise (it's probably scary for someone to see this mess!) Is a stolen motorist who suffers from the most repulsive motorcycle gang of movie history. But do not worry fans! Batman, I mean Adam West as a hick-doctor doctor comes to the rescue! Pow! Break! Boom! Holy Toledo Batman! <br /> <br /> The only good points in this "bomb" are some beautiful women, some scratches scene, and always the "sexy" Tina Louise!
