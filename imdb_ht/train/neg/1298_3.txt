Sogo Ishii can be a skilled cinema under the right conditions, but Gojoe tells the story of a mighty monk and his only rival, a scion of the Genji family. The film has the main features of a low-budget production, including sneaking and stinging congestion scenes (the type you could get in a dorama under-product). The monk of monks informed his spiritual teacher destined to lie in the mystical spirit that guarded Gojoe bridge at night but did not realize that this decision would bring him outright into conflict with almost every element of society at that time - but that could have earned him enlightenment. <br /> <br /> There is no ambitious absence, however, in its illustrations of the conflict between the holy and the world. Artsy bloom in some of the photography and help editing to compensate for loose film-making style. <br /> <br /> A deception.
