I sat in this evening movie, forcing myself to stick with him though I never cared about any of the characters or what happened, because the two drivers, Gérard Philippe and Michèle Morgan, were stars big movie in the era and I wanted to see them in "something different," which certainly was. They both have provided fine performances, but in unattractive characters. <br /> <br /> Indeed, the whole movie is about a little shabby city of Mexico inhabited by almost unattractive characters (the doctor is, of course, the biggest exception). What Michèle Morgan has ever seen in Philippe falls in love and he never explains. This is supposedly based on a work by Jean-Paul Sartre. All I could think was that if Sartre's work was something like this movie, it must be a very mediocre attempt at Romus's romantic novel imitation, which faced a pervasive disease in North Africa. well-acting but refreshing film.
