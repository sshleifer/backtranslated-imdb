Not the greatest movie to remember Paul Naschy by. Gaston (Guillermo Bredeston) is probably the worst sword I've ever seen. Zorro should be disappointed! His only salvation came as the competition was just as bad. <br /> <br /> This film is described as adventure and horror. Forget the horror - no. No stripping, no blood, no monsters; just a Robin Hood adventure against an evil baron (Paul Naschy) who wants to be king. The main feature of the film was seen by Graciela Nilson, who had only done four films in two years and disappeared from our sad regrets. Where did he go?
