I watched this movie after seeing other comments on IMDb, even convincing my wife that she was a "unique horror movie." I wanted to love this movie, but he could not. "The Love Story" was good, but the horror aspect was quite bad. If the story was just about a young man who fell in love with a girl suffering parasomnia, then he would have a better movie. The care center stretched over the limits of credulity, in fact it was quite ridiculous. The doctor happily ignored privacy and professional law. A nurse goes to a room for a routine food in a dangerous patient (safe escort), and drops the tray and runs out of the room screaming for any apparent reason. The legal patient (and the bad movie) tied to a totally standing position - apparently for years? None of it makes much sense. <br /> <br /> The same movie had some actors that I liked in other things, such as the detectives, but still I can not recommend this movie.
