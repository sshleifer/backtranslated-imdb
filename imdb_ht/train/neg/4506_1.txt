American movie makers decided to make a movie they think is Japanese. Characters are all seriously represented, actors are not even Japanese and the series is cheap, real and definitely does not represent Kyoto in early 20ties and 30ties. Who ever read the book understands that the script writers did not add any additional value to contrast the movie from the script. Worse, they even change the original plot line and a few goofs. Rob Marshall is used for its two main characters of well-known Chinese actors who first met in couture dragon hidden tiger. Marshall has probably seen a Chinese film and these represent Japanese culture. See these two actors together again doing the movies more ridiculous. The first Quentine Tarantino scene of Kill Bill # 1 is ten times more Japanese than did in this movie.
