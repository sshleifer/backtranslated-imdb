Sole-donkey Sci-Fi Thriller, made with an almost total lack of conviction (a full control room in computers and other devices that used to receive and decrypt messages from outer space run not just one MAN, and it is very poorly guarded at night), and full of campy sounds. Christopher Lee is not only wasting, but it also gives one of its few "I'm here forbidden for the money" performance. (* 1/2)
