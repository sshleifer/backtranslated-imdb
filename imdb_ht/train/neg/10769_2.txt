I found this on the shelf while housekeeping and bored. How can this person be given a 10? It's not just that it's supposed to be a redemptive movie (I think) because it does not work on that level either. Weak scheme, bad dialogue, evil; There's just nothing there. Harvey Keitel is decent, but there's nothing to work with, and Bridget Fonda and especially Johnathon Schaech are just awful. Progression of conspiracy (especially the relationship between Byron and Ashley) makes no sense. It seems like the writers wanted the scheme to go a certain way to do it, without actually writing off the necessary bits to make it flow. It's only an hour and a half, but this 90 minutes in your life you will never get back.
