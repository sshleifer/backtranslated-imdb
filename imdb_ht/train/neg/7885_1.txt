I believe in holding religion out of government and out of the movies. When I want a sermon, I'll go to church, but I do not want one out of a movie. I do not mind some supernatural terms, (after all, religion is over as supernatural as you can find!), But this movie was so preached to it that I was really annoyed. The owner reminded me of the witches seen in other cinemas. The bad guy even looked like he had horns. <br /> And what a funny comic: the hero went into the meeting and called to all those old, and broke the spell. If only life was simple. I think when movies are so stupid, they must be distributed with a warning: Harmful! PREVENTING THE INTERNET!
