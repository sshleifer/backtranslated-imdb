This film is the worst movie, but it's very high for me. It is how a movie slasher should be. It takes place at a university in which only seems to have a handful of students. Teachers are dumber than a hammer bag. It is filled with good Catholic priests, sexually abused humor. Bad hair, bad clothes. The dialogue is so cliched it's hard to believe I could predict lines of quotes. The slashings have some creativity and looks at gravity around stabbing people into the genitals. A lack of continuity in the band and the worthy characters die because of being so bad, I recommend this movie for a fun time. Find a cheap beer case with some friends, watch it, and laugh.
