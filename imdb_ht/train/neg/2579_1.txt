I said that I used to be a big fan of the series. The first 3 was great and the others had the moments, but this new home BETA is one of the worst films I have ever seen. It's a shame since this was a great series and it just kept getting worse. I know they did for DVD movie but some effort would be good. <br /> There are no laughs, just a couple of good one-Matterio that will bring a smile if that. There is nice of stripping and very hot chicks. But neither the sexy thing nor the jokes really work. <br /> <br /> To add to all this is a racist movie too or as racism in a movie someone can do without asking to be called racism. I'm not one of those who think everything should be politically incorrect. But the minority paints are very offensive. I would not waste any time on this garbage. See previous versions, they will make you laugh not sick.
