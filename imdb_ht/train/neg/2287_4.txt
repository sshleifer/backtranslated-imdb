I only saw Gretchen Mol in two other films (6 girls, Donnie Brasco), and did not really remember her, but she did a great job as a naive girl looking for pictures because she was happy. <br /> It really did not think that he was doing was wrong, even when he left the business and found his religion again. The photos he made were certainly tame by today's standards, and it's funny to see men and cameras get all excited, and politicians pontifying about the harm to pornography. David Strathairn (Good Night, and Good Luck) played a great party here. Mary Harron (American Psycho) has written and directed an outstanding biopsy of the most popular pinup girl ever.
