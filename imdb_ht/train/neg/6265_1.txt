I came to be the nephew's director. It took my year to get my hand on a copy of this movie and I can confirm that it is indeed one of the worst movies ever. My uncle did not even have a copy of it again (I asked). I'm looking forward to bringing it a copy. <br /> <br /> Currently the average movie rating is 1.9 / 10. As far as I can say, that should put it somewhere in the mid 30s of the IMDB "100 Below", however with only 206 vote, he has not yet set it up. <br /> It's sad that the movie does not even find respect to a title under 100. Regardless, I donate this movie to family members this year for holiday gifts. Best / Worst Gift Ever?
