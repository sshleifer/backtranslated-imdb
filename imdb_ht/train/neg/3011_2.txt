I was very excited about seeing this film, anticipating a visual excursus on the relationship of artistic beauty and nature, which has the kind of wisdom to love in "rivers and tides." However, that was not what I got. Instead, I find a unimportant movie about how the human industry is bad for nature. Which is clearly a good Organic claim. <br /> <br /> The photographer seems controversial about the aesthetic qualities of his image and assumed the "ethical" duty he was the workers occasionally peupling the images along the periphery. And honestly, the images were not generally impressive. And according to this "artist," the scale is the basis for what makes a nice thing. <br /> In all respects, a stupid movie. For those who would like to feel better about environmental awareness ... but not for anyone who would like to think about the complexities of the issues surrounding it.
