I thought Harvey Keitel, a teens, fresh from John Lydon's Pistol Sex, then as a bonus, the music by Ennio Morricone. I hope an old-school, donkey, Italian thriller thriller held in America. Instead, I got a mishmash story that never made sense to a movie that let me say: WTF !!! Too many questions are unanswered, and not enough action. The result: a classic classic has floated down the toilet. Keitel and Lydon work well together, so perhaps Quentin Tarantino can meet these guys with the best script. Oh, and Morricone notes: OK, but not memorable. <br /> In general, not a waste of time, but not a "must see" unless you're a Keitel Keitel fan.
