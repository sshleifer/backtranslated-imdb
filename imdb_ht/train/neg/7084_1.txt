As many others have stated, this is a terrible movie, from all aspects of film making. How to ever get some known actor to take on this project is amazing. Many <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Many people complained that he shot on video 'cheap' video cameras. Yes, it was shot on video, but not 'cheap' video. What made it bad was the lighting, white swing, shooting techniques and corrections. There were many different shooting and correction techniques used to be a mess of production. Harsh, consistent lighting, on-hand utilization (Ala Woody Allen), hustle depression (another Allen technique), but not without real purpose. The lack of white balance in the restaurant scene kitchen is embarrassing; very amateur. <br /> <br /> The simulation sex scene had no value to act at any level. <br /> How this video ever made it to print is beyond me. It is worth to look if only to be surprised at how bad it is.
