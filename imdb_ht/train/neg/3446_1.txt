This paper film looked like it could possibly be good, after watching if I realized that this film was completely awful !! The plot has no meaning, and I think I'm counting the best part of 5000 off every scene that makes the film more annoying boring and ridiculous. I watch this dark night black night has no noise at all just to add to SCARINESS in it but the truth is the only thing that scared me was the music, what would they call the tragic music, to play my opera say be reliable !! This movie sums up all that is not good about this type of movie. To be honest to say no more but to look at your own risk this movie is just to fill garbage, enjoy !!
