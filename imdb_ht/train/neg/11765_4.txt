You know what you are getting when you purchase a Hallmark card. A sappy, verse and will be $ 3.99, thank you very much. You get the same with a Hallmark movie. Here we find a nineteen year old Ernie Borgnine coming out of retirement to let us know that as a matter of fact, he does not die as we thought. Poor Ernie, she is poor soul who married Ethel Merman several years ago and the marriage lasted a few weeks. In this flicker, Ernie jumps at first foot and shows Grandpa that bonding with long he has lost grandkids. We've seen it first. You can enjoy this movie but please do not say that you have not been warned.
