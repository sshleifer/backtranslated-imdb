Ed Wood is eclipsed and gets Orson Welles. This movie is fantastic. Vampire witches who fight in highly choreographed scenes and dialogues that could break ribs and laughter. Plan 9 De OUterSpace dons't stand a chance against that. Described by the writer and psychic Stephen Armourae on the Vampire Forum as a chief - he is from England and quite sarcastic. He has Stephanie Beaton and the producers know who will be to save them from bankcrupcy by repeatedly using it. Even if it leaves me cold as it looks more like the undead than all the devil breeds. Eileen Daly is just a lower Elvira rate. All this seriously does. <br /> Look at it for the script though
