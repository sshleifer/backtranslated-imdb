After watching this, then read the summary on the back of the DVD, then think back to the current movie .... I became a bit dizzy. I thought, maybe I fell asleep and dreamed I was a baby down waltz syndrome in a never-ending forest where people drive 11 miles an hour and stop for no other purpose then occasional miss without taste. Where Are (Zombies?) From nowhere and (Vampires?) Which (seduce?) Most smart citizens on the roads to save the world. Neither zombies nor vampires sincerely meet each other. The only fight I remember got that Bonny Giroux's coat of cuts. Now, be you! All of them! Perhaps that was because we watched it look upward and was too lazy to change it in its native resolution, but that actually made it more fun ... In the conclusion of thesis, I thought there was more continuity, draw, development characters, antagonisms, subject subjects, and then acting whole of this movie. He made Bloodrayne like Citizens F *** ING KANE
