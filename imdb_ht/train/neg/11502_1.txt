This film is suffering slowly and has no conspiracy. It translates the lives of a group of workers' ships. The older one is sincere in his attempt to find a job. There may be some social commentary here, but it is muddled as nobody is painted in a very sympathetic light. <br /> I do not understand why she had a 7.8 when I decided to look at her. I watched everything tiring and built up expectations for a great outline regulation. No chance. The IMDb Rating has always been a good match to my taste. Anything above 6.5 was worth watching. <br /> <br /> And my wife says Javier Barem does not even look good at this movie. It's not my kind, so my agreement does not mean much. I give it a 1.
