A small town attacked by a horde of bloodthirsty vampires. The only hope is a lone notice with a group of ragtag survivors. <br /> <br /> Released in 1993, "Darkness" garnered something in a culture after release. It's easy to see why-it's loaded (and I mean freaking charging) and gore, and it's energy and enthusiasm, as found in other no-budget horror cops budgets such as "The Next Door Dead" and " Children of Ravensback ", is actually rather infectious. <br /> While that may be true, this is wrong not enough to save it. The movie was shot on a Super 8, so the image is green and dark, making things very difficult to see (it would have been great if it had touched the big mullet protagonists.) Also the grid is the band make up of annoying casio keyboards and even more annoying metal deaths (seriously, what is it and these have no budget horror flashlights and bad Death Metal?) While one does not expect Oscar to deserved performance, the act is still strictly amateur hours, as the actors sometimes seem almost confused instead of fear or threat. <br /> <br /> In the end, I'm sure fans of no-gorefests budget will love this. All others, though, will want to have a little more meat on the ribs.
