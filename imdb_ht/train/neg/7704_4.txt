Well, there is no real plot to talk about, it's just an excuse to show some scenes of extreme violence and free sex (which can sometimes be fun, too, but not in this case). What else can I say about this ...? The action, when it happens, is invented and there is a cool scene where the characters fall into a skyscraper (one that has to be several miles high), but in general there is not much to recommend "quit". Watch it if you want, but you do not miss much if you skip this one ...
