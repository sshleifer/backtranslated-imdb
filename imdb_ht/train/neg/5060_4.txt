This movie is a perfect adaptation of the unforgettable Flick English. Ashmit plays the role of Richard Gere, Emran that's Olivier and Malikka the perfect wife's cheating role in Lane. They changed the second half of the film to adapt to the Indian masses. <br /> <br /> Even then the movie has been getting the full track of Unfulithful, though it could not catch up with the original. It was a cheap soft porn of the Bollywood lovers, where Mallika showed a lot more skin than anyone daring to show. Emran has done more roles as this and has even nicknamed the killer series. In the future, if US directors plan to mark an English film, they should look at the possibility of the American Censors. Though the film is bombed at the box office, the actors have received recognition of relief. In the future the directors should be a little more careful in renaming an Oscar nominated film. <br /> <br /> All said, this is not a family movie, so take extra precautions while watching it at home and the family.
