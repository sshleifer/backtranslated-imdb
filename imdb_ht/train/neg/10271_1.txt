This movie was due to be the worst horror movie I've ever seen. The act was terrible, terrific with cheese and talk about a predictable plot! I will never watch this movie again, nor will I recommend this movie to everyone. What a waste of time! First, as soon as the movie started I realized what I got myself. All that was done for this movie was to duplicate copies from many outside horror movies and bunch them all in this one movie. The call phone call, Halloween night, a psycho, and one knife! It's absolutely ridiculous. I was not afraid at all during the movie, which I thought horror movies were supposed to do. As for the movie, its beautiful hilarious as they all talk about how this film was so great and so scary. I mean how you do not realize that movies are a cheap rip off of "scary movie" for example. At least find some good actors in there and then perhaps it would have been pulled off as a good horror movie.
