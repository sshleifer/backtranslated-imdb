Eytan Fox, also generally leaned on the side of the apologist of Israeli politics, has made many films very interesting in the past as "Walking on Water" and the movie is simply wonderful, "Yossi & Jagger". In the "Bubble", however, he took this approach to the logic and dishonest extreme. <br /> <br /> Far from giving this movie a standing ovation, the people in the screening I went in slowly up and leaving. I was slowly left, smoking and angry at such a ridiculous movie-sided movie that translated self-preservation as racist, intimidation and racism (and terrorism) as the crisis to justify anger; which implies that the Arabs are so cruel by the evil Israelis that they react in anger to a constant stream of one-sided Israeli aggression against them, and that they, therefore, should not be liable for their actions. / This movie was not worth the money I paid for the ticket (indeed, I considered asking my money back), and was basically an Israeli squeezing of the Palestinian film "Paradise Now". If you want an anti-Israeli, then not all means to watch this movie, as it really justifies just such a belief system. The fact that this film was made by an Israeli director and, even worse, as a talented Israeli director, is a shame to cry. Indeed, just how Israel may be seized to be considered a state of Israeli pariah as the anti-Israel propaganda, insulting beliefs. What a shameful, humorous little movie!
