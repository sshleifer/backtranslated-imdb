Susan Swift is a teenage baby, a kid transplanted child in the 1980s (like a young Susan Dey), but it does not quite have the vocal range for a lead demanding dramatic and tends to balance; Still, it is rather sweet and has bright eyes and a smile. In the "Coming" (as it was called when briefly released into theater), Swift may be the reincarnation of a Salem witch. The flick is very low-budget and borrowed from many other photographs that I gave up on it and about 15 minutes away. It starts out loud and has some call in camps. Obviously, there are more serious films that deal with Salem witch trials that deserve to be seen on this one; However, as junk movies go, it's not too terrible. Local Boston is a definite plus, and the support of entertainment is amusingly collective. * 1/2 from ****
