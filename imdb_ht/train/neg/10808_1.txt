I gave the book version of Kazaam for my 8th birthday, and those who always said the book versions are still better than the movie, but this time they were wrong. At least with the movie it's about to fast. <br /> The act of this is terrible, which I hope in a movie with Shaq who plays a magical rapping genius that comes from an old ghetto blaster (which has probably been a good reason it's trapped in there). The kid of the movie that plays Max is whiny and a terrible actor. He was intimidated by the neighborhood kids, which I do not blame because it is a little bag bag. <br /> The story is just plain stupid and very clich√©. On a boy who is father constantly working and never around to find a new friend who makes his life better and eventually help him reconnect with his father. Even in 8 years old I thought this was a stupid mind. It's a surprise any of the people who worked on this movie were career after wards because it's a troublesome and should never have done. I was able to spell over even more about how this film sucks, but you should already know just not the plot.
