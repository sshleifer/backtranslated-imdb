Elvis left the building and was lucky because he did not have to watch this unfunny stinker. Scenes after scene director Joel Zwick found ways to make an unprecedented script even more fun. Complete with unfunny deaths, trite gay characteristics, and hack jokes, this movie is more desperate than fun. This is the movie sort that makes one hope that Kim Basinger follows Doris Day in the early retirement. Let's remember how it was (talent) and not what it came up. David Leisure, Dennis Richards are delicious with the rest of the talent wasted here. Zwick finds a way to minimize their talents at every turn. The guy plays Elvis sounds more like Gomer than the King.The only really good at casting is the young girl who plays Basinger as a borrower. It really looks like it is actually very good. The only other reason to watch this movie at all is to look for the Tom Hanks Camera. The cage is not all that funny, but at least it's not painful. One has to ask if Zwick has incriminating pictures of Hanks or something that would make him film this.
