I found the film offensive for Americans who had lost someone at the Towers, for those Americans in general. Pretend to be a tribute to the terrible reality that has happened last year, each director takes the opportunity to pollute and old reality (with no terrorist attacks), or criticizes the American political behavior, or compares to different political situations as they have in their own country that has nothing to do or to share with the atrocity in September 11. Shame on them.
