This is definitely a movie, bad-tasting movie. Eddie Murphy star in what is written as a sitkon. It is surrounded by his perfect family, full of good family values. If you are looking for politically incorrect entertainment, this movie is for you. But if you hate the idea being the only one not laughing in obscene gags in a movie full of pop-maid addicts, just running.
