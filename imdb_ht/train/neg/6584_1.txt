For being the only movie I could see in this year's "Nordliche Filmtage" in LÃ¼beck, this year's festival will be remembered as an eternal bait for me. <br /> This movie, which was announced as a thrilling erotic, is nothing more than a sick piece of crap! Excuse the language, but there are no decent words to describe it. <br /> <br /> First of all, the actors are not the best. But even better actors would not have saved the movie. E.g. The plot: After the first 15 minutes it was clear that John was sick, the neighbor girls were not real and that he killed his beloved first. The so-called "sex-scene" was nothing but disgusting (striking each other until blood flows for me to have nothing to do with sexuality), but unfortunately it was not just the lousy images to be shown. Everything else was copied by other directors, such as e.g. Lynch, but of course without the geniuses. <br /> So they summarize the whole movie and to save other viewers time and money: girlfriend lost girlfriend, girlfriend turns back home, guy kills girlfriend and gets angry after that, guys imaginative hot but crazy neighbors girl , guy who has many sex tastes and one of them (or so he thinks), in the end he realizes, he is crazy with his girlfriend and his new lover lying in his apartment all the time .. bad stories, bad actors, photos, which you want to vomit ... <br /> 1 out of 10 (1 point for the fact, that you realize how good you can understand the Norwegian if you learned Swedish - at least one benefit tonight - and you can not pick 0 points here).
