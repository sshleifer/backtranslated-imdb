It is difficult to know what happened through the head of Kristensen and Morten Lindberg's head when writing "Gayniggers of Exterior Space" - the film was billed as a comedy, but there was no real joke beside the name of their character (Captain B. Dick, Sister Ball Peel). The rest of the film is a (unmistakably) unintentionally humorous and ridiculously unsynchronized voice-overs (and the 'actors' basically reading the lines with no hint of feeling), futuristic computer displays full of errors, errors and a makes almost no sense. <br /> Even though 65% of viewers gave this movie a perfect 10 out of 10, this is the complete opposite of what a good movie is. It can be ENTERTAINING to watch with some friends, but this movie only deserves a '2' out of ten ... slightly higher than the lowest rating possible only because of the sheer fact that the writers somehow manage get some black guy star in this movie.
