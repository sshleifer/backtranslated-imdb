Michael Rooker is a decent actor, but no business has been the lead except in a low budget film. It really does not have much charisma. Ryo Ishibashi has a lot more screen presence, and sadly it is not really the main character. Most of the time the screen goes to the brick-faced rooker. Danielle Harris (from Halloween 4 and 5 movies) plays her daughter, and she is beautiful and entertaining but it was written as not too smart and one of her dumb mistakes became one of the main characters killed. Comedian Fred Willard, Bobcat Goldthwait, and Stephen Furst are here in the exciting role. Just watching what's going on in these characters is priceless. Vincent Schiavelli plays the Mafia's Local Mafia Conflict, and it's hard to say if you're not working as a comedy movie. Tim Thomerson is also in this film. It seems to be in every budget budget direct-to-video action budget. Thomerson is also in some low budget comedy. Seeing many comedians and comic actors in this movie made it feel like a parody. Is it an imitation of a Yakuza movie? It's hard to say at some point. There is certainly very little Yakuza action. <br /> <br /> Throw in support of Thugs and Goons is ominous and thoroughly cast. Some of these types of movies have thugs that seem to work in the comic book funny comics or as boys stock in Piggly-Wiggly. Overall this film is very unmatched. At some point it seems like a comedy or a parody. Then at other points she works as a good action movie. Then it sputters to an end. Without the contributions of Danielle Harris and Ryo Ishibashi this movie would rate a zero of humble opinion.
