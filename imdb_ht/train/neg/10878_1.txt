This film is a lot of a rip-off of the Mages "The Devils" and that's the only thing that makes the movie worth watching. The act is terrible, the action scenes are speeding up, the script is almost painful and the budget does not exist. <br /> <br /> If you think that this movie is fine then you havn't see a real horror movie, skip this and get a copy of the movie demons.
