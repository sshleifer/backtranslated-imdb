I work in a blockbuster and weekly store we have movies that come in with just a few copies, these are types of movies that are featured in Sci-Fi shows. Types of films that nobody wants, and only that idiot, when they bring it back I ask them "was any good?", They say "no we are turning it after 15 minutes!" Movies and awful computer products, super monsters imposed with such as, very unappealing. This is the same type of movie that Grendel is, with absolute trash in time, if you want a reasonably (and only reasonable) good Beowulf-based movie then try Beowulf & Grendel, starring Gerard Butler, who is also Starting at 300 in anticipated rush, as King Leonidas in Sparta. <br /> <br /> Plus, later this year we have another Beowulf movie, with a nailed star cast from Anthony Hopkins and Brendan Gleeson, Angelina Jolie and John Malkovich. But do not let that get your hopes up as we've all done with Eragon, or we're all for another great disappointment. <br /> With regard to rental, here is my rule of thumb: If there is one or two copies, do not rent it because it is a burden of crap. (This is true 99.9% of the time, usually not true if the title is alien, or a documentary.)
