In one word, this movie was boring. He missed life and sparks. A great problem is with the two leads. Jude Law and Gwyneth Paltrow had no chemistry too. It was boring, and it was annoying. <br /> <br /> The visuals were interesting, but they did not improve the scenes. If anything, the visual trends detonate the audience from what happened on the screen. None of the sequence of actions felt real, and hence, the movie failed to create any real drama or sense of danger. The movie was potential, but it needs a better script, best act, and a better director. I kept thinking about the film, you know, this movie would work if Harrison Ford was Captain Sky, Karen Allen was Polly, and Steven Spielberg was the director. <br /> <br /> Ignore crucial criticism for this movie. The critics I think they praised the movie because they * want * love it and want it to succeed even though it fails on many different levels.
