This is a very old and cheapest movie made - a typical low-budget B-Western in many ways. Gary Cooper was not yet a star and this film is very reminiscent of the early films of John Wayne who had made for the studio's "Love Loyalty". And both actors, their familiar style and the characters were still not fully formed. This incarnation of Gary Cooper does not seem exactly like the Cooper in just a few years later (he sits faster in this movie early, among other things). However, unlike the B-film average in the era, there are at least a few interesting elements that make the movie unique (if not right). If you ever want to see the woman who has been married to Errol Flynn for seven years, this is your chance. Lili Damita star as the girl love interest and this is a very, very odd choice to cast, as it has a heavy accent (she was French) and she was not even close to being "beautiful star movie". Incidentally, he also married director Michael Curtiz. <br /> But for me, the most memorable and unusual aspects of the film are the seemingly gay subplots - sort of like a BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN from the 1930s (and we thought this was a new idea). Gary Cooper's character has risen from two men who hate women and do everything they can in many of the movie to keep Cooper clear in women. This misogyny alone does not necessarily mean much, but there are plenty of clues to all the film that the makers of the film really tried to show them as a gay couple. In particular, towards the end, when one of them is killed, the other is shot by an arrow and holds to die long enough to pull off in the body of his fellows fell and fell - with his arm hauling around him! This was wonderful thing for the time and I think this make this movie really fascinating today! As far as Cooper and the plot go, the film is a bit of a deceptive and so sketch-able. Unless you are curious about Damita or luxurious homosexuals, make yourself a favor and get a better Western.
