MONSTER - It was great; I liked the special-effects that created this monster that looked like an updated version of "The Beast from the Black Lagoon." The scenes with this animal roaming the country and capturing people ranged from good-throw jaws. <br /> <br /> SOCIAL COMMENTS: Many of the stories take place in the quarantine area as doctors (under government orders) state that SARS-like disease is there. In a nutshell, we find the story unfamiliar cover-up history. You know, I hope that this liberal paranoid mindset and Hollywood film still paint our government as corrupt, but it looks like the Koreans are copying the format, and it's very tedious. In here, it takes away the excitement and suspense of "this monster." It just shoots the movie down. The main family featured in the movie has to watch out at a distance while the girl in the family, supposed to die, was scattered by the creature. <br /> <br /> MORAL: A typical "not polluting the water" message because this is what can happen - a terrible monsoon monster. This was used to be the anti-nuclear bomb message from the 1950's when radiation caused ant ants, spiders, fish or whatever of these sclusy sci-fi cinemas. Now, its "environmental issues" are the focus. <br /> <br /> The HUMOR This was mostly stupid. I normally laugh at slapstick but this was not funny. I do not know if Korean sense of humor is that pitiful, or the film has been deliberately trying ultra-coral and a take on the old "Godzilla" films. Let's hope it is the letter. <br /> <br /> TRANSFER - The video transfer was good. This was a sharp-looking photo and sound was decent with a lot of rear crowded crowd speakers. I watched this Korean with English subtitles. That would be a mistake as the Korean sounds good voice was annoying after half an hour. <br /> <br /> OVERALL - This has been a promise but turned out to be a great disappointment and even boring too much, which is inexcusable for a monster-monster movie. Two hours have been too long for this story. How does this film draw crowds in Korea I do not know. They do not have to have much of the movie's enjoyment and support.
