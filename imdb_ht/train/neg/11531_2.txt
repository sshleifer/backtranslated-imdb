The plot is so manipulative, counting completely on the most incredible decisions and disasters of adults in each and every parent's decision. Children are super as far as charm and delivery of the lines, but as I say, the whole scheme depends on each and every adult being complete idiots, and therefore in this case, make more sense out of their actions (and at the same time being the only way to explain the boy actions in total mistrust). Why would a good little boy take a baby to the shore? How did the baby reach the shore and at the same time account for being the best place to be searched? Why should the boys 2 never be informed a rather at the same time a baby is missing nobody gives a fig to run around with food and diapers and all that fights go on and literally everywhere else to dig ? There is just no possible justification that the audience believes. Ask for believing he would then do in trial (even informal environment) is too insulting to do.
