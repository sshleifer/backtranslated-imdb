There is no reason to worry about renting this cops. From the open credit, I knew I was in trouble. <br /> It was filmed as if it was a soft porn movie, but there really was no erotic about it. Looking at the world of sex addiction is intriguing, but only at one point. Boring sex sources, bad draws, and cameras by Ed Begley Jr. and Rosanna Arquette are not enough to save this movie.
