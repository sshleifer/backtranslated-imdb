One of those "come to age" films that should have nostalgia for adults and children's promises. This movie is not. It is a poor excuse left by Sylvia Kristel in a frolic body and a Eric Brown dorky. To make matters worse, the movie is either funny or stupid when it tries to be funny, sexy, or dramatic. Street awkwardly as we are supposed to believe that a teenager would go alone and bury a woman dying in her front yard. Meditate on how a famous woman for Emmanuelle needs a double body. As the movie went on and off, I began to imagine a hybrid of Private Lessons with Little Miss Million Sylvia Kristel seduced Jennifer Love Hewitt as Howard Hesseman made us nostalgic for WKRP. Look at this laugh at the other's sort, or for the Ed Edry Jr's comet, or ask what Sylvia Kristel would look like with Jennifer Love Hewitt. But I can give you an idea of ​​your lesson, staying away from Sylvia Kristel's movie starring Emmanuelle.
