The Darkling was a very fun and fun film while F. Murray Abraham was in it. Spoilers: Approximately half, F.Murray gets zapped, because the Darkling is some kind of demon-like animal that enjoys living vicariously. It takes bums and losers with the more perverts while giving them all they want in terms of success. He eats out in the pleasures of the seven deadly sins. However, part of it is that it needs to find people that can be flawed, but not completely wrong. Otherwise it can not "pervert" natural goodness. That's the little guy said in his voice Barry White, which I found both good and fun. Most fun. Like imagining Barry White if it was a little dwarf and she told Aiden Gillen "Dee Plane, Dee Plane, Bos, Here Come, Dee Plane!" All in the movie, Dee Nose (actually a robotronic cherub) speaks to Aiden Gillen in Barry White's voice, saying things like "It's OK to be bad, you know you want it." "Now you have committed murder, you really moving up into the world" and other remarks that sound like advertisements for "being wrong" stores or something. It really is hilarious in a sick way. <br /> <br /> Whatever, Aiden Gillen is no F. Murray Abraham, and the movie tanks as soon as Murray gets the ax (or knifed?). F. Murray brings a certain mischief to his role in this film. He is a good actor. Aiden Gillen in the other hand has a permanent smirk on his face and looks like his English Comp Comp. Class has never hit the Mythological characters and he could not imagine what the movie was about. The ending is really crap and yet almost funny. If this movie was a parody, the finish was perfect. If it was not a parody, then it was crap; but a cheap use of a girl to deliver a gross-out that the movie itself could not save. Those who made this movie lost everything they wanted to do with it somewhere before the end. It just ended up like they just realized they were running out of money and were filming a quickie sequel.
