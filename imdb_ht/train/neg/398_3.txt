C'mon guy some review before having almost written a novel to comment on this episode. That's just an old 60-year old show! This episode of Star Trek is remarkable because of the most serious Babe (Yeoman Barrow) ever used on Star Trek and the fact that she was filmed in a real outdoors. Unlike the TNG series and Voyager has been totally imprisoned in stages. <br /> <br /> This is used in an outdoor place (with babe) to provide inappropriate depth and almost like quality films in a very ordinary episode of this now dated and very accustomed show. <br /> <br /> Except for some remarkable exceptions, the "city on the edge forever", "Earth's assignment" and "Tomorrow is Yesterday" the old series of Star Trekers need seriously worms - Troubled and driven out of her boring misery. Half a dozen good episodes from 79 are quite a poor average beat. This is typical of boring Gene Roddenberry products back then actually, contrary to popular beliefs where some people worship the earth she walked on, she actually did a lot of garbage ! It's not worth mentioning about the same breath as Irwin Allen for example. Just look at the bridge series of the Enterprise from a modern point of view. They used wobbly pavers for floor, seat cabinets and plastic backrest and cheap cards above the instrument panels. You can clearly see the folds of the paper! Each expense is killed or what!
