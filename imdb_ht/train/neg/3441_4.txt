What the heck was that. Someone obviously read Stephen King and Sartre in the same semester. We find the bitter existence exterior with cheap horror. There were moments that were disturbing, but each was canceled from awful music, CGI, or acting. <br /> <br /> The problem with strange narratives like this is that it feels laughable. David Lynch's same job is like this at times, and just like its exciting show and movies it runs far too long. And sadly this is only 98 minutes. <br /> <br /> The cast was attractive, and that's about the limit. I think it touches on the feelings of adolescents and fear of loneliness we all have, but just do not make the characters likable enough to care for their destiny ... whatever they were. The final scene leaves everything clear.
