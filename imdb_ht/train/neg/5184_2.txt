I hope to enjoy a romantic comedy presenting Hip Hop, but she was disappointed at many levels. First of all, the story is so badly recycled as to make it almost unbearable. Second, the environment, acting and stories are not very authentic or credible. Third, there are many best black actors to choose from than these standard peaks. How about some originality? Third, there were many Hip Hop songs played in total - if any. None seems really central. Overall, film was a great disappointment, but the correction style was very interesting and almost made the movie worthwhile.
