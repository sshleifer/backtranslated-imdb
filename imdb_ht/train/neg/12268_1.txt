I saw on other Japanese horror movies and they were not too impressive. However, I could feel that there was a tender script to guide the way. <br /> Not here, there is no way. This is about a detective trying to tether along the same murder. When she finds a suspect in question, the suspicious phenomenon comes out because they keep seeing a ghost. Then the ghost begins to follow the detective around for a reason never to explain and take up more than half of the movie. <br /> <br /> Bad enough? Oh no. The movie keeps changing perspectives of different characters that are not so much done with the story. I've seen this before in other movies where it shows a different perspective. It's not the case here. <br /> Also, whatever happens on the screen that is actually privileged to quickly finish. For example, there are a few scenes with a few instrumental notes that are built and ... then it's just off to another scene. I know this can be a dramatic effect. That's definitely not the intent here. It's just correction. <br /> Finally, there's the "ghost" that just screams in a non-scary or unwittingly funny way. It's annoying and it's a lot to the whole movie. <br /> Of all the crises you've done before in the best way you can see them all come. Then, after one of them, the movie is over. At that point, a wave of confusion swept over the audience as I could sense we all felt that we were wasting our time. Someone made a stick mock and followed up. It was better than the whole movie. Simply put, AVOID.
