This is, quite literally, the worst film I've ever looked into my life. It can be the worst movie possible. Some movies are so bad that they're good; This movie is so bad that it goes past camps enjoyable and simply becomes awkwardly awful. It is anti-enantiodromia. We bought it with the intent to screen, and my family gathered around for a fun evening in smart remarks; Instead, we were sitting in silence stunned, gracious Peter Sellers poor. <br /> <br /> This is worse than the Lord animated in the Rings. It's worse than the Matris Suites. It's worse than Krull. It's worse than any movie Batman. <br /> <br /> No, under any circumstances, leaving this movie approach to your ten-foot TV.
