This movie sings plain and simple. Well, so it is basically a girl who gets raped, and finds his revenge to become another violent violent guy. The rapper is a dessert, but the girl victim is in part blame. I mean that they both get into the mood and start kissing with things, but when the rapist tries to have sex with him, it does not allow it so violent to rapide it. And the thing is the scene of rape for the girl is very short and it does not really exhibit or show anything, but when it happens violent is getting raped, it's a nice rape scene. There is basically nothing in the story worth seeing. <br /> <br /> 3.2 / 10
