The competition for the worst movie Warner Bros house Francis is stiff. I only saw perhaps eight of them, but Comet on Broadway is the worst so far. The very good thing about it is that it's short. Oh, and Orry-Kelly robes (of course) are fine. James Wong Howe's movie is not true. Francis's house all looks fat-faced and far less attractive than it normally does. Minna Gombell who I do not know otherwise is good as a semi-hard "burlesque" dancer (she looks more like a fashion show than burlesque). The shot was locked - Home Francis and his child (when the child learned that Francis Francis was his mother? Did I slowly?) Walk up a dusty path towards a painted prison by explaining misty on a sound sound drop away than ludikrous. The whole movie is so cheap, so implausible and so negligible that it feels infected by a cynical back on the part of everyone who has made it: Warner Bros tossing garbage to those who do not know, to estimate Cynical Warner Bros ', that these will become waste.
