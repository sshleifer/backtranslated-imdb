I can barely find the words to express how completely this awful movie is. I sold on the promise of action, with Segal and Infiltration Infiltration, which normally makes for a fun action movie. I can honestly say I prefer to stretch my eyes out with a drunk stick than having to see this movie again. The act was so terrible that it was almost funny. The story was insanely weak, with such a cavernously wide plot that you could fly an F117 across. The script was so poor, if I found that a 10 year old wrote it I would not be at least surprised. The direction and production are so amateur, I would not even hire those people to shoot my worst video video videos. Utter Use drivel. Those responsible for making this film were cheapened to the art, and they would be disappointed themselves. Steven Segal should never show his face in public anymore, I can not imagine what made him agree with the star, the worst movie I've seen in my whole life.
