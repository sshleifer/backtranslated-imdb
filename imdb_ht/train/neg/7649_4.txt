Joyce Reynolds looks like a growing up-up for the role of Janie, a boy-crazy six-year-old boy in the small town of America who has fixed his guys for a soldier to visit and winds up on the cover of life magazine (smooching at a party sheets) all in the same week! Stop dams in wisecracks, set-down, talking bulls, and unfunny bits in businesses such as Janie's younger sister paid family members, Hattie McDaniel (as the maid) constantly scuttles after sassy six kid, Janie's mother involving the Red Cross, and dad Janie trying to write an editorial on issues with adolescents today (such as parents, butcher, sex, Edward Arnold and Pert, discussing Ann Harding making a couple of years, even for 1944; it seems incredible helping them conceive a child much less to increase two of them). Nomination for an Academy Award (!) For Owen Marks' Correction, Warner Bros. followed this in 1946 and "Janie Gets married". Reynolds must have gained its co-autumn then - it was replaced by Joan Leslie. * 1/2 from ****
