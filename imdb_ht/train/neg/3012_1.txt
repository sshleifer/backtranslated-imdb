The film opens with a long shot of one long of factory piling up with the workers. Me, what we did in the planet you might think. I hope we get to see other things like this. <br /> <br /> This is very rare. When you're not looking at an orally filmed angle to the narrator in a conference room, you'll see her set up her camera to take pictures in different positions. It would be good if choosing the area was more tight with its subject but it does not. So then you'll hear some more narratives, watch a few photos go to them and watch it set up his camera. Why not use the filming camera to show more of the landscapes instead? It really kills any sense of rhythm and painter the guy as more of vain dreams. <br /> I could read tips on how to set up the cameras, fast forward in this whole movie and waste a lot less time.
