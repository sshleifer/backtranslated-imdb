The film looks like the director forced to make this film by some gang of terrorists. It should actually be called Dino Crap. <br /> <br /> There is nothing good about this movie .. Even the actors are not worth a penny. Do not waste your time watching this movie. The director should shoot at the top of the mentality to create such a bad movie. I mean it's not ashamed of the look of people facing them after seeing his movie? The DinoRok looks as if it's made of power and pretty much point-and-paste stuff. and it even the old story. people play God. create some animals. It's night and it's happy to eat people. and finally a beautiful girl and a guy in a sleeveless shirt came and killed her. bla bla .. u will figure out the plot of the first 5 minutes of the movie
