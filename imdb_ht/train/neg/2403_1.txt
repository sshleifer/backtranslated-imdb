Cut !!! I got this movie because Elizabeth Hartman was in it. I was disappointed to find out that it was like two short scenes towards the end. Other than that I've basically hit the button fast all the time. Some teenagers go on a trip to Romania with his father and gets bitten by a wolf and gets into a werewolf if there's a full moon. He killed his father and his friends. About 30 years of age but not a bit older and enrolled in a high school. There she meets a timid teacher whom she ends up biting and then has kids with her. This movie sucks and I do not recommend it to anyone. It's War and Peace rather. Only Mrs. Hartman did a good job. Check out a very young Bob Saget in this one !!
