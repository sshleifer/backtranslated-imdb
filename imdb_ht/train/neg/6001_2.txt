This can sound crazy even people who recall this show ... but I remembered this as live-action. I do not think I've ever seen the design. but movie? maybe. I remember it very clear. The guy was in a kind of kind as a showroom. He even had the red jacket. It was dark out and turned into a red car and had this guy on the second level looking down at him. The car / guy sharpened around and crashed into the big showroom window and out on the street. Then walked into the drive. That's all I remember. I really hope someone else has this note too. If not, maybe I'm still crazy. But I hope I'm not.
