In all low budget stories. This movie should be one of the worst. True debtors are some funny places in the movie, but in general it's just plain terrible. I just can not understand what people could not run a bunch of bullets. I mean they have to be one of the creatures gently on the planet. The only part worth while in this film is close to a bullet attempt at biting the finger of a man. This was rather fun.
