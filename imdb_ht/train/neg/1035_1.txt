Terrible act, terrible cast and cheap accessory. Would they have been a lot better if put as a movie action parody action. What a waste. Starting from the movie's name. <br /> <br /> "The Enemy" Its name "Action movie" would have made it better. (contributes to the parody effect). The captain looks like a 60 year old player, the blonde girl just has the same look boring vid on his face at all times. By the end of her film and she works together to take down the bad guys and every time they change their words just feels like the cheap lines given before a sex scene in a porn movie. Terib. Do not waste your time.
