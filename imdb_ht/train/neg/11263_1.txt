To humiliate, to shame that a fine actor like Joseph Fiennes would allow himself to be cast into this piece of nauseating drivel. The film was not only bad, but downright terrible and in no high quality rachim. The plot, (which was one?) Seemed to go nowhere. The Russians have played acumen kill or to kill games with the rest of the cast should declare nil and cancel for their pathetic performance. I gave up about 3/4 of the way in and came back to him. A "1" for terrible only because there is nothing below. Do not waste your time on this one, you will not miss anything.
