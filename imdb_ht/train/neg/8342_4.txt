Salvage: 4 from 10. Day Groundhog meets a Christian Christian crisis crisis. Okay maybe it's not that bad. But it is close. <br /> Claire (played by Alicia Silverstonesque Lauren Currie Lewis) is tightly and potentially killed by a serial killer (Chris Ferry who is quite ominous and brutal). I say probably because he wakes up and was all a dream ... Or was it? (Cue music) <br /> <br /> The basic problem with the movie is that these fifteen minutes of drawing (doing well first time) is repeated over and over again. And since Claire awakened every time and every scene is clearly a dream or alternate reality I just stopped taking care of what happened to Claire and started asking what twist blame in the end went to pull this together. has been eradicated for a sitting (which would have been more meaningful), but instead has one of those who are too obvious by half surprise surprise (Reflecting the Village or Bottom) Yup movie in effect faster than Donnie Darko's director off. All of the great twisting sequences of the Sixth Horror Horror Cinema, the original invasion of the Snatchers in body, Happy Birthday I worked because the audience did not wait for a left garden explanation. (Heck even the ship ending on the 13th Friday 13th was worth a worry) <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < Other fault recording is one piano sound note (even though the songs were decent) padding of obvious times (Claire makes the dishes, Claire's mother substrats), the way Claire says "hello is anyone with" every time she thinks There is a series of Kill Some of the High Roles Acting (In Claire's particular moments played by Maureen Olander that resembles a Mary Homes Zombie) shows the first time actors low budget roots. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />! Problems are they really do not.
