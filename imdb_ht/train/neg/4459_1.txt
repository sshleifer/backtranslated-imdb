I do not say that because their production value was so low, but because it was filming it terribly. What injections of the girl wash her hair in the creek? Did we really need to sit there for a relieving shot and watch it do for 5 minutes at the same place? It was terrible, the illumination was just plain bad. You could barely see anything and when the characters spoke, you could barely hear what they said. Did I watch the entire movie? Of course I do not jump in most of it, and I do not want to hear anyone saying I need to look at everything first to judge it. This movie was so poorly done and executed that even by independent standards and low budget it just plainly sounded. Horrible film ... Do not waste any time on it unless you want a good laugh, but even then it's not because of the "funny" actors line, it's because of how passionate bad productions are.
