Animal Farm (1954) was a very good read about the dangers of totalitarianism. How good ideal can be changed and distorted by ignorant people or menstruation with a point of iron and an empty head. Unfortunately this movie does not feature one of these. What we're showing is a propaganda piece with a lot of fingers and pointing. The animation and direction was good to consider the budget and the time period, but the essence of George Orwell's novel is sorely lacking. <br /> <br /> If you are the one who wants to see how not to adapt a novel or are just interested in seeing an adaptation of this romantic romance then not every means to look. I just found this one to be a bit mediocre. Just one person in the opinion however. <br /> <br /> The note is a tooth but not much.
