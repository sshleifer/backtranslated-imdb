This film is an abomination, and its doing it should be considered a capital crime. One of the great mystery of making films is why nobody has ever made a faithful movie adaptation of this wonderful mystery. It's a story of a truly attractive, wonderful, old-fashioned romance, mystery and English humorous mystery. Why the musicians had to change Richard Gordon from a Scotland Lakshore policeman to an amateur detective, featuring the idiotic and caricature role of his English servant, changing parts of the main storyline on the murderous charge and circumstances in Gordon's struggle for save for the defendant, etc., etc.? These producers and directors who always think that they can make a better story than one in the book should write the original script themselves and do not violate another's product.
