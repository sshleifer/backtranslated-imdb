What mka said. A Kamal Hassan movie was terrible. It acts very well, but it is a terrible story, along with horrible directions. In my opinion, the director Gautham Menon must give up convergence. There are a lot of tragedy throughout the movie. In addition, one can just not believe how true they were these lurid crimes. There was no practice in the movie. Gautham is just running out of history. But Kamal Hassan and Jyothika really do. Bananas look too ugly, though their performance was not bad. I do not think that is a Sunday afternoon movie like Padayappa that you can see with the family. You will not get to sleep this movie !! However, Harris Jayaraj again did a great job, and that is why I gave this movie 4 out of 10. His songs 'Partha Modail Nallae' is feeling and calm. In addition, great movies. On the whole, this is just a bad, bad movie. Kamal Hassan, I think, should reject this movie.
