This "debut" today on the SciFi channel and all I can say is "my sense" I was stuck it today so I can watch it tonight after work. I had high hopes, Now I tear apart their wardrobe looking for a rope length so I can hang myself. Perhaps the worst movie I've ever seen. I wish I could say something nice like "It was fun to make this film" but this movie gives me nothing to work with. I know you do not suppose posting defiler here and out warning before but I'll be anyway "This movie sucks" I also told her! They should show this movie the flick to show them NOT! My nine year old niece could make a better movie. The only decent thing about this movie is the sound and / or sound track. OH! I just found a rusty C-clamp in my old toolkit. I will put it on the thumb in my left hand and tighten it until the pain erases the memory of what I have seen. I could just tap on this VHS but I think I'll burn it into the pit instead. I was able to wash with soap but I fear I never get clean again. Christmas is coming. Buy this movie and give it to those you hate. -Mike
