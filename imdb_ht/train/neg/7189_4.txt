What a utter disappointment! The score of 6.1 here on IMDb builds up some serious expectations but oh, I was disappointed. The first thing my bugs are these braindead, child stereotyped colleges. Yes, I know adolescents can be harassed and so, but why are they still described as complete braindead morphons? There was one character that I thought was OK, but he / she (not to reveal it here) was killed in the way before the end. The other characters were wrong executed and even the supposed hero / heroine just did not do it for me. On the plus side: The plot is very good and outputs value a cut above for these types of flicks. The act was generally not very good, Rutger Hauer meant a small role. But it all failed and bland and braindead character. You just stop taking care of them after 10 minutes. 4/10 (and that was generated).
