I saw this film for a number of main reasons were Mira Sorvino. With it on the cast it might not be so bad. And it seemed like it had some mysteries and Olivier Martinez was her companion at the time and was very good at `Unfulithful '. The story is set in Spain so it might be an exotic movie movie with one of my favorite actresses. <br /> <br /> If you're thinking about the same thing let me warn you: this is a really awful, refreshing, boring movie. The only adjective that comes to mind is pathetic. <br /> The story is perfectly and sub-scheme that adds nothing to the narrative. They try to build a slasher / thriller with a look at Fascism in Spain but fail horribly. Twists are no credibility and the so-called investigation leads nowhere. The characters are paper-thin! I did not care anyone. More that they are disappointing and lovely people with lovers. The act is atrocity. Miracle What's Wrong With You? Why Mira? You are an Oscar winner! Keep some dignity! Her character was weak but unexcused for such terrible performance. It seems to be sleepwalking all the long films. Come to think of it, I actually think I see her eyes slowly close to some scenes. I used to think this woman was sexy. Well it's not here. If you want to look into some pots try Romi and Michelle because there is nothing to see here. And that accent? My God ... <br /> <br /> Olivier Martinez is even worse. It's too painful to remember his performance describing it here. I'm sorry but I can not. I've suffered enough with this waste. <br /> <br /> The whole movie is depressing! It's so bad in every way it's a wonder how he even did. A disgusting team produces a disgusting script and makes some money on the actor's name. Do not fall for it. <br /> Avoid It! <br /> <br />
