Only the quality of redevelopment in this film is that it was bad enough to be comedy. All of this movie looks like a porn industry out there. I actually see the best act of budgeting pornography. I even though I actually rent some kind of gay pornography following this classic scene: Jim: Watch your ass Nick: You look for yourself (along): I'll leave you behind! <br /> <br /> The first action sequence shows how terrible the production is, but its really kind of funny: Good guys have transformer weapons! In one scene, they all have fake HK MP5 sub-cars. Next scene, AK-47 copy! Then, in the head it all, they do some swapping weapons between scenes and a couple of M-16s !! I think they had a budget shortage for weapons, not enough to go around between good guys and bad guys. Battle scenes are poorly coordinated and fake as hell. You have to remove the pin / spoon from a grenade to explode on its own. You can not fire a shoulder to launch missiles of any kind while riding inside a helicopter. Gun that you throw does not suddenly re-appear. When a weapon is out of bullet, it's always a nice stupid thing. Unless you have no idea how to reload them. Big truck slows down around the first gear making for awkward action scenes. I really can not believe movies like this are actually produced. This movie might be hilarious about nitric oxide or maybe just drunk.
