Another cult hit again. This is not a stake, because the real end comes after you folks who brought this overly-pseudo-scientific infomercial ... Ramtha at the Enlightenment School. <br /> <br /> When any religion / philosophy needs to hide behind an OZ-like screen, I walk away. Thanks to Ramtha I watched a copy of lending in this movie on the recommendation of a "friend" ... for being wasted expensive resources on this New-Age lobotomizer would be tragic. I can only hope they "really believe they can walk on water" enough to take the guide to this "logical" conclusion ... in other words; walk, woo ... or close :-) As a movie ... it deserves a strong "1" on its entertainment value, especially to create the most decisive character of the movie history (Photographer's Photographer ... eeeeeek!) . If you have to view this movie, lend it to one of the recommended folks in the brain.
