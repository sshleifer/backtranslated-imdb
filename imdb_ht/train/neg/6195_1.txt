Much to do. Dreadful acts with a sequel that the Director looks forward to understanding out of nowhere as the movie was frankly nothing short of dull. This movie is considered a premiere of Gij√≥n Film Festival. Everyone who came from the theater was in the same opinion as I - what was the same point doing the movie? The references to Iraq were either scarce or just not thought of well. I am surprised that this movie has given a release - very, very irritating to a waste of my time. Sorry, strongly negative reviews but hopefully will discourage some people from making the same mistake. What a pity we did not have a Q and A at the end of the movie - now that might have been interesting.
