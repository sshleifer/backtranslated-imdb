A bit like b-movie goes, SCARECROW is one of those who is so bad, that it gets incredibly annoying to sit down. A student who loses students in high school is being picked up by classmates and rejected by the girls, ending up the walk on the trafficking mother having sex with a redneck drink. Then he chased the kid out of a nearby grain field and killed him. Apparently, children's souls were transferred to a scarecrow that then went to kill the bullies that harassed her, as well as the teachers. This scarecrow, on the side of having a one-lumpy snappy for each of its victims, can also make Matris as flip through the air and murder on the sidewalks of daylight. Also, why did he always look like a rotten corpse? Just like the two useless suites that follow, this is not even worth a laugh.
