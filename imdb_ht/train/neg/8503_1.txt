and all the European studios involved in this one, you would think you would at least get some nice photography; but the local color is kept at a minimum. <br /> <br /> Irritation # 1 is Mira Sorvino using an accent Russia in order to play a Spanish captain - WTF? The story is hopelessly confused. There's a romantic supposed story that is intentionally confused - is it or is not it a lesbian? - serving no reason too. The cops in the movie are the most stupid to have honored a serial killer movie in a long time. There seems to be some messages on the Mid-'30s Spanish Civil War but since pretty much everyone involved in that is dead, one does not see the point in it. Despite the bull-fighting series in the narrative part (which party? Who can say), you never even get a good look at a bull fight. Earnway Earnest would push the director into the nose - with my blessing.
