Do not let the fool cite you - this was one funny movie. The problem - it was not supposed to be a comedy. The story sets you nicely for an end that never comes. Even worse, the set-up has never been explained. You will let the theater ask "Is it it?" I missed it a 2 simply because there was a short moment of promise, but the finish left you completely flat. Nicholas Cage did as a good job as expected in the role, but he had very little work with them. There are odd caps, and interesting turns everywhere, which has absolutely nothing to do with the movie. Let this one come out on video before wasting your money.
