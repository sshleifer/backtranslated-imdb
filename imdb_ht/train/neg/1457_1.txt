I watched this movie some times and all I can say that this is rubbing budget low and that it has nothing to do with a real story fact. Performance actors are very poor, but the result is limited to acting. Anyone who watched this film now probably thinks of Hitler as some crazy crazy crazy men who run with a gun like some Chicago gangsters. I can only say that there are better movies about Hitler and Germany over the years and that the Rise of Evil is much lower than average. I can recommend German movie Downfall in which you can see brilliant performances of Swiss actor Bruno Ganz on a roll of Adolf Hitler.
