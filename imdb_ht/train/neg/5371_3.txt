This movie was rather a disappointment. After very slowly, very intense (and quite gory) begins the movie to start losing it. Too much scheme left too little time for explanation, and from the theater I wonder what this was all about. The characters remain deep, the story is not convinced at all, most of it is dangerous stuff without hints of parody, and some very cheesy parts ... Like the young cop have to dig a body. Of course he's at night and it's raining and he's doing it alone ... baye! Or the manifestation of evil was "nazis" more "genetic manipulation" ... Wow, that's really original. Some nice bits, though, like the fistfight scene, mountain views and some (running) gags, but (though Reno and Vincent Cassel do what they can), that's definitely not worth it. (3 out of 10)
