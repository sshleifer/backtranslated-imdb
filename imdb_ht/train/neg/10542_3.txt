Detective Russell Logan (Lou Diamond Phillips) has a big problem in her hands. The serial killer, Patrick Channing, for whom Tess (Trcy Griffith) psychic extreme helped her capture, was resurrected with the First Power (.. given by Satan after her execution of gas chambers) and can own the body of the weak. Somehow, Russell, who registered forces with Tess (.. with an understanding of these are accountable), will have to stop channing or many women will continue to die from his blood. They will seek help from Sister Marguerite (Elizabeth Arlen) who tried to inform her superior at the Catholic Church in the First Power, but she refused access to a weapon that can stop Channing ..a cross with a blade that can penetrate into heart in Channing Ridding the world of his evil. He will take it anyway and borrow a helping hand to Russell, who will need all the help he can get when Channing kidnaps Tess prepare him for some sort of satanic ceremony / ceremony. , Mykelti Williamson, is still a welcome welcome to actor support, becoming the partner of Russell's role .. so you know what will happen to him. As in the film of this kind, everyone around Russell is dying, but when he attempts to kill Channing, he merely killed the weak army of some other poor soul. <br /> <br /> More busy than ... the gate to the finish line. Phillips and Griffith try, I'll give them that, but in a movie flick as this does not stand a chance. Kober, who is usually often as efficient as the heavy, is really handed over nothing more than a wicked goofy that is cold in the air and tosses rotten rot.
