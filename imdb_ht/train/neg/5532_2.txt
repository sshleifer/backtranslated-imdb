The revolt of the zombies is not the worst movie I've ever seen, but it is very far down on the list. When an expedition sent to Cambodia to discover the trick of making zombies after World War II, one member decided to use the knowledge for his own bad ambitions. And he succeeds, at least at first. A love triangle triumphs the few stories. <br /> <br /> This really was a tiring, and horrible acting movie that made it hard to say who was zombie and that was not. The dialogue was little better and the plot was incredible (not part of zombie in her but parts related to the "romance"). And while I'm not a student or movie director, the camera work did not seem to help the movie very much. While I've seen a few movies worse, this is easy to please anyone. It's bad, and NOT in a way that's bad-that-it-is-good in style.
