I mean, I thought I heard this dialogue in the movie, but it was so bad and out of place that I can not really believe it. I laughed so hard at what was to be written in worst and acting in human history, I was seriously worried that I might have a heart attack and die right in the theater. The scene I'm talking about, the "hero" just looked at his brother's car and his brother's car exploded right there just foot away from him (the hero). The "Hero" was sent to expect the "fit" to see something so tragic and people were trying to keep him back from running in the burning machine. In the middle of his fit and uncontrollable rage / emotional crush he says "I'm sad" - he said right? Am I crazy?
