The guys who-ever even think about watching this movie have already got some blows to themselves .. This movie has nothing to do with the Jack Ripper (incase you thought) it's another B, I want says E-Class movie that includes a bunch of horny teens in certain unknown sex scenes that they were watching just before finding the widows splattered on a nearby tree. It's not scary, funny or funny. If you really feel like gorian stuff with no conspiracy, then watch Kabin Fever, at least the director did not fall asleep in this direction krap.only this look if you absolutely have nothing to do in life & The only thing about TV is Oprah Winfrey crying on the TV series.
