If this is a 2008 product in one of the major Indian American movie productions (Yash Raj), then I'm afraid it's a very forward sight for us to reach the right standards. <br /> If you can go wrong in this length and cast as an enormous star of Anil, Akshay, Saif and Kareena, then films still have to be studied more difficult by everyone associated with this movie. The film lacks almost all departments except cinematography and Akshay Kumar. It has a few nice rendering dialogues that alone can not make you enjoy a flick of films and great expectations. <br /> <br /> The first scene of a car going down to a river from the mountain has very cheap graphics as that of a cartoon movie. That was a clear indicator of the director's vision. Every actor who otherwise is an advantage in a film is simply wasted. Stacking Anil Kapoor in trying good English falls flat most of the times. And Saif will surely strike himself thinking of why he signed this movie. <br /> <br /> In short it's the worst of resources after "JHOOM BARABAR JHOOM". I would say that even "Aaja Nachle" was a more enjoyable movie than that. <br /> Someone can not understand how and why this script was written and approved. The most desired is the flashback sequence of Akshay's love story. After the faulty script the weakest point in the movie is its music. Vishal Shekhar gave just some filler melodies to each song. The songs begin quite well and suddenly the drops blend high. Only one song "Falak Tak Chal" is somehow good at all in the lot. An opportunity wasted by Vishal Shekhar. <br /> <br /> Regarding the ongoing intelligence of the just musicians: Akshay and Saif on the road in the bumpy area in a foreign place (probably Ladakh). At the next stage are looking for the Haridwar Kareena and then back to the hills and Kareena at the dicky of the cars. I always thought this was written. <br /> <br /> If you manage to sit down until the last point then the climax is too long with funny and unnecessary demonstrations. You can see all the heroes walking in the storm in bullets do not hurt as if they are God. Are we still seeing a movie 2008 and all the heights that these techniques achieve? So there is no more word about this pathetic film and venue, but a heartfelt request from senior actors from fans. <br /> <br /> Dear Anil Kapoor & Akshay Kumar, If possible, please ask for a preview of your movies after their first copy is out. As high artists, you have certain responsibilities towards your fans and viewers. People always beat for you as you enter the screen in your first scene respectively. I think this kind of movie should not see the daylight as it prevents the reputation of all associated with the movie, the actors and the home production both.
