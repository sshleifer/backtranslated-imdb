I think the show was a great concept for working with them. But the execution was poor. The poor script and acting is bad. There were many issues that could be described in a better way, such as protesting against gay marriage or finding the graveyard. The show can not be properly called as comedy show as it misses humorous humor. I should say this show was barely successful in putting the life of the Muslim community to some extent. Until now the second season is worse than the first one. I had my high hopes regarding this show, but I was kind of disappointed. Still I appreciate CBC's to put up this concept before the viewers. Anyway I wish the best chance for the future.
