The Egyptian films have many films and high levels of drama or romance or comedy or even sports action. "The Ta'Kohl AL Lam's Ziab" was banned in Egypt Because it's Nudity content (full Frontal Girl nudity) The kind of Nan Nudity is forbidden in the Egyptian movies .. When I saw this movie I feel down ... Crazy Story .. Naked Actors .. Bad Action .. Some Manure Movie & Frustrated .. Dear friend .. If you want to see a great Egyptian movie ... Simply: Stay away from the "Ziab Ta'Kohl AL Blam" form. We have great movies in Egypt ... We have a great actor who won A Global Winner Like: Omar El Sheriff or Gameel Rateb .. We Have Great Director Like "Yousef Shahin" So Believe Me Pall .. You Do not Have To See This Movie.
