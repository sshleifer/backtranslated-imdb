Deep Driver plays out as a TV movie: a whole cast of commercial-quality actors, an evil creature designed to be the "bad guy", with a full-featured script, political slang and imports than he knows what to do with. <br /> I check out the movie because of the creature (I like to see what filmmakers have in mind for the drawings of these cheaply made videos), and right off the bat, I got disappointed because animals on the box was not one of the movie. The actors I hope because of his movie type is (really quite generic and not thought out past a certain point). The music was typical, non-thought-out symphonic music action. <br /> I like the design of the computers and technical equipment, along with the mini-sub design. The same movie really shrinks, and screen screens let you know which set you look at the story in. But there is not much of a story here anyways. <br /> <br /> This movie gets a 3/10 star IMO. The boring search and destroy the missions blow up the North Pole and the animals protect it ... lame types. Even lamer is the love-related relationship between two of the characters you do not see coming. This one's chicken up to being a movie that tries to get acting career on the bench and in a video. Do not bother.
