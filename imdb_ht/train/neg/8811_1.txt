SPOILERS !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! <br /> I watch half of this movie and I didn not like it. <br /> <br /> First of all, boring. Lovely anything happens, women are sitting around and discussing how horrible life they are and how they do not have hope, smoking weeds, reading magazines, caring for their sick friends, and cutting off the corpse from time to time. BORING !!!! <br /> <br /> Second reason: There are too many things left unreasonably. Many scenes are dedicated to a zombie hunter who kidnaps random people, restoring them in a chair and interrogating them. Who are these guys? How do you know anything about illegal activities regarding the eating of the flesh? Why does he kill one and leave another? <br /> Also, this dude is the first time I thought also had the meat eating but it put her point in a wall that was superhuman to suggest it not quite what we had originally thought-never explain! How frustrating is that? <br /> <br /> Conclusion: I found the annoying women, the refreshing story, the tired duologist, and non-existent actions. Also the cover art is misleading since it makes you believe that this film will be cold when it is clear is not. I rent this movie based on some of the comments made by others on this website, and although I respect the fact that some people might have liked this flicker movie, I'll be from now sure that I read more than two revised funds in a movie so to avoid renting another movie I'm sorry to see.
