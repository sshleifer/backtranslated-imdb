After coming to the first one you think the bravery franchises could come up with some new jokes. Though I guess not. If the first one was not bad enough this one is just so bad it hurt to look. With all the actors in this movie you think they could come up with a little smarter. Even if they could not, they took all the same, not funny jokes from the first one and somehow put it in this movie thought people would laugh at it again. Even though the thing is I did not laugh at it the first time. They tried to make these movies in the parody even if they failed at each level. Most of the time it's just randomly locked, which are so disgusting and raunchy that it's hard to look at it and enjoy it. Then, when they try to make the movie parody film just end up making a 20 minute recess at the scene and maybe one joke at the whole scene. Also for those who say it is not the greatest and real young audience, well I fit into the broad range that it is supposed to be funny. While people say that different people have different ideas in what's funny or not, if you find this funny then you probably are not one of the most mature or intelligent people around. It does not take that much skill to write the type of a script, though if you want a more smart movie and funnye go see the movie spaceballs. It's a movie parody that's actually good and well done and it did not have to use jokes and lousy to make it funny either.
