What an incredible fall for Sean Ellis. <br /> You picked up a bunch of friends at home, all hyped about the work following up at Sean Ellis. You have a vague idea of ​​the plot, no deflators that might kill their fun, high expectations. <br /> <br /> It's late at night, perfect atmosphere for a movie of this type. <br /> / 15 minutes later and you start telling yourself it is tied to pick up, at 25mins you start wondering if you should just go to sleep and save this for another time when you can fully appreciate hoping does not exist subtle touch. Over half hour marks you realize half of your audience or the hyped is already sleeping and calling it a day. <br /> A few days after using all the other materials you look at, in the middle of the day this time, hope your mood will keep you awake this time. 10 minutes later you find yourself fastforwarding intermediate and intermediate intermediate transitions and images. Anything else I'd give up already but has cashback and heritage. But this heritage can only bring you so long, this is a new level of boring film-making, imagining a short story extending to a novel with just description, this is what it is. <br /> Wasted, no movies that let you in awe like nightback. There are films that annoy you, there are films that lack certain aspects, or just cheesy, unfortunately this is just a waste of time. <br /> <br /> Final word, stay away.
