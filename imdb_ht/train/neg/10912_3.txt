I did not really like this movie much at all. It was not really funny and in some cases it was just outright stupid. Rob Schneider is definitely one enormously talented individual and while his action was fine in this, he just seemed like a real waste for him in star inches. I mean there were some parts that were okay with a bit Funny in a wonderful way, but that's about it. The only thing that actually caught my attention while the jokes of jokes themselves were that there were some pretty good women present and I'm not one to watch a movie only because of but in this case it was the only place Even slighter in the case of redemption could be found. All of it was a couple not lower than an average movie! <br /> <br /> Final Query: <br /> <br /> Theater: So I did not waste too much money on this. > <br /> Buy DVD: Umm, let me think ... no! <br /> <br /> Rent: If you have a prehistoric sense of humor then why not.
