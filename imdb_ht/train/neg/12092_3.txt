I do not fail to recognize Haneke's higher than average film-making skills. For example, I appreciate her delays on unremarkable-natural-day-cohesive environment as a powerful way to force a strong sense of realism. However, regarding the content of this film, I am very sad to see that in the 21st century there is always an encouraging relationship to domination-submits or feelings (and / or BDSM practices). The problem that the main character has and his mother is unbelievably topical as the alienation and misunderstanding felt by Walter (I do not mean frustration of a guy who does not like to go back in the same way, which is understandable, I mean that it looks like it was crazy, or as if it were a monk, come on!). I mean D / s is not something new in the world and I think it is rather unusual to treat the subject as if it was something "freakish" or pathology; it's not. In general, the films dealing with the topic are really just behind the times. <br /> So, for me, I feel that this movie ends up being quite a programmatic movie, worried and highly outdated psicoanalitical theory (is not it almost embarrassing?), and not really related to life Real life and experience of people engaging in D / s relationships (personal experiences, forums, irc chatrooms even recent student studies will show this).
