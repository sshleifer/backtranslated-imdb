Elvis Presley plays a "half-cross" Indian ("Indian") who has defended his reservation of nasty business tycoons. Everyone likes to get drunk, fight, and have children. Fighting, struggling, and punching out each other replaces steriter but raised expression "How"? Although she does make-up, she's obvious Elvis is healthy than she's been in the movie before; Perhaps he was getting ready for his famous "comeback". He could not have been because this movie script was nothing to get excited about. Joan Blondell tries to seduce Elvis, with Burgess Meredith in "painting wars", should be disappointed. <br /> <br /> The best song is "Stay away" (actually, "Green handle" with different lyrics). The most embarrassing song is Elvis's favorite song of the "Dominic" bull. There are some surreal scenes, but it never gets trippy enough to succeed in that genre; though, "Stay away, Joe" can give some laughs if you are in the "good mood". <br /> <br /> <br /> Otherwise, stay away. <br /> <br /> ** Stay away, Joe (1968) Peter Tewksbury ~ Elvis Presley, Burgess Meredith, Joan Blondell
