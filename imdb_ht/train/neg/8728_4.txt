This one is bad. A really bad and boring crime movie that has nothing out of the ordinary of it. A series of crimes, the killer that you do not see throughout the movie, the classic investigations. Also, the classic story of a cop who figure out what's going on and does not believe in anyone, so he had to fight alone to reveal the truth. Not too much of this one. Vote: 4 out of 10.
