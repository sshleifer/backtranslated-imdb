I think it's very safe to say that this is the worst movie ever made, when I saw the trailer on TV I knew right from second 1 that this would be a piece of **** and it would be best to avoid it, but I somehow dragged into this view by some friends, I was walking in the movie with low expectations but I was hoping there would be a couple of laughing cheap to keep me wake up during this movie. The so-called "jokes" in this movie brings a landscape to the face, they are mostly composed of those who take batter in the face and balls, the baby is bizarre and acts like a horny gangsta and the typical race jokes We see this often in today's comet candles. The film is obvious and the story is not only impossible to believe but also predictable and dull. Characters are very annoying and heavily stereotyped. I never wanted to see this **** movie again, I'd rather take a shot of the foot than be exposed to this piece of fuckwood ever again. If someone I see says they loved it, I'll physically punch them in the face
