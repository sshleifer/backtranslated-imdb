I spent almost two hours watching a movie that I thought, and all the good actors in it, should be worth watching. I could not believe it when the movie ended and I was absolutely no idea what happened ..... I was crazy because I could use that time to do something else ... I tried to figure it out all went out, but there was no sign. Thanks to those who figured it out and explained it .... good or evil, it's better than not knowing anything! Who was the lady of the movie with black hair that we saw a couple of times driving away? How does First Lady know that her husband was cheating on her? At the end of the movie Kate said he would eventually find the truth. This means that we will have to end up game 2?
