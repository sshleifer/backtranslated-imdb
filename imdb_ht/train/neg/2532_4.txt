The cult of personality has elevated the status of Roger Corman, Sam Arkoff, Lloyd Kaufman etc. as King of the B. Because their way to Crown International was so great, they were not elevated to the status they deserve. A film like the VAN can now seem like a disposable piece of drive-in scooter, but it was a sizable hit when he was released (not to mention after re-releasing as a double feature and striking other Crowns). <br /> The VAN was a perfect example of Crown's hit stroke strategy of thrilling on the mood of the film-spectator at the time of a movie release. Here, he has sex, drugs, rock 'n roll and briefing "Custom Wind" whim. As others noted, it is ironic that the song "hit" in the movie refers to a Chevy when the title car is a dodge in the movie itself. I had a Selectman town where I was at the same time declaring these trucks to be "tent of sin on wheels!" A perfect ad line for the movie! There is the usual assortment of "good" and "bad" girls, muscle-top and low-brow hijinks (including a bit supported by Danny DeVito). In many ways this is not much different from old beach party movies in the 60's, but now is spotted up with the use of nudity and drugs. Needless to say, a limited budget with a limited schedule, the country's film together is quite enjoyable with a twin charm that is compensated for some, by today's standards certainly, un-PC views on women. a toaster to Bobby's hole in sin on wheels. Yes, a toaster! Hey, you have to have something hot for those munchies! <br /> <br /> Grindhouse Fest.
