This film resembles play entitled 'Blithe Spirit' written by Noel Coward. The plot of a ghost wife and a medium are strongly linked to writing the Coward. I am surprised that movies in this nature do not recognize the original concept of the writer. I realize that the public can not know that this is a knockoff but it is. These films are so expensive to produce. I perk up when a scenario is original. I'm even up when it's an innovative way to produce a job that has already been released. There were some samples (such as Topper, etc.). <br /> I realize that movies are always a comparatively affordable form of entertainment. However, I do not please when the public tastes are taken for granted. In this situation, the public taste is overlooked. <br /> I look forward to better movie product entertainment .. In this case. I prefer to see the play.
