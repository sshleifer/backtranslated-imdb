Hello there, <br /> This is my first post of IMDb though I use it as a reference for quite a while. That's why I want to greet you all. The fact that I am a Greek is inevitably going to affect my judgment hoping to not control you .. <br /> I spent 2 years in my life, (all we Greece was actually), analyzing Omirus Epos (and not Homers as you see everywhere), rhyme by rhyme. If I remember it was Iliada (Iliad) about 8th and Odyssey (Odyssey) in 9th grade. Troy Warner, it was a great disappointment for me and my fellow Greeks around the campus (I studied in the UK). Iliad Epos is one of the best literary works ever to do. It was composed by a Greek poet Omirus a whole 400 years after the current war. Historians put trojan troops around 1200 BC, and the actual reason of the war was not Helen's beauty, but the strategically critical position of Troy. That is to say that one can now understand that Omirus epos does not present the actual events (as it is not exactly historically) but that was never the purpose of this work. Reading this great poem, one can find himself asking for the many definitions of honor, love, anger, hatred, heroism, discipline, loyalty and so on. The best and most educative part of the well-known talks between the warriors before the battle. None of these even though they were revealed in 'Troy' <br /> Warner's Troy was really cheap in my eyes, and others intellectual English Finnish and German colleagues. It's a shame to spend millions of dollars in such a bad storyline. By the way the perfect storm was a bad and stupid blockbuster (computer graphics did all the work), and yet it is Wolfgang Petersen's best work. <br /> I conclude that you would better look something else. I would give Troy 2 out of 10. It's a really movie movie B. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
