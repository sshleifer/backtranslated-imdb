Anyone who made this movie must do it as a joke. I mean, this was the stupid movie I think I've ever seen !! A bloodthirsty sniper terrorized a small town? Give me a break. Love it when it takes to drive the cop car. More like a comedy than a horror movie. If you want a laugh, rent this. If you really want a horror movie, stay the hell away this one !!
