The central theme of this film seems to be confusing, such as the relationships, environment, acting and social context all lead to the same place: confusion. Even Harvey Keitel seems to be from his elements, and his usual lack of impeccable, directional and intense. To make matters worse, the character's name is 'Che', and we are just told (directly, by the narrator) well in the movie that it is not 'what' Che, just a guy named Che. Family relationships remain clear until the end of the movie, and once defined, the family is divided - the youngest generation goes to America. So cliche. Other reviews discuss how the film depicts the impact of the revolution on the boy's family; however the political position of the director is the best quiet, and we are never quite sure who is responsible for what bloodshed. So they lost their property (acquired by gambling profit) - so what? Refusing to take a political stand, when making a movie about the Cuban revolution, is an odd, odd choice. Not to mention the movie was in English! Why are all Cubans English speaking? No wonder they did not get the movie permission in Cuba. But if the most important family life look here, it would be great if we could know who - we are 'presenting' them all at the beginning - a cheap way out to make the clear relationships throughout the movie ! The act was mostly deep, wild, and incredible, distribution was cut all around. 'Special' visual effects have been confusing and distracting. References to American films - with black characters as Greek choirs - strictly free, understated intellect, and always out of place. I was just watching the movie all because I was waiting for clear, or some point in it all. It never happened.
