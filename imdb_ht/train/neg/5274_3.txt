If you like cinemas on creepy towns, hotels, homes, states (the Ala Eagles "California Hotel"), etc. that owns the people who "just passed through," it's almost any Stephen King woman instead. If you love the setting of "Disappearance" begins by reading the King's Desperation, but also check out the "Shine," "The Great Salem" and "The Unnecessary Things". The crow motif, the desert, the family leads to despair to escape or avoid possession of tired. Why did not they just make films from the novel "despair"? Maybe they came to King and appointed? Must have. <br /> Susan Dey and Harry Hamlin look happy to be assembled and have both been torn well over the years, but still TV and direct-to-DVD actor caliber.
