As a fan of the Stookhouse Sookie books, I get this series to be a totally creepy representation of them. Vampire Bill is not very good looking and looks much older than described in the book. I found that already made colorful characters look very strangely and vulgar. One of the things I liked about the books is that despite all the crap that it will be in Sookie is still a lady, and yet in the TV series it does not seem like this all. Not only that but the prejudices appear in the TV series are not nearly as wide spread of the books. I did not expect an exact copy of the books, but I at least expected to feel in them to use for the series.
