I'm not sure if captors are looking to raise questions about abortion, and make really strong and evident things that a woman should allow an abortion if Satan is the father, but it drags on and over. Ron Perlman is ridiculous. The baby is really stupid looking, basically a crab and a baby head up on it. You can pretty much see the material on Satan's costume. What a mess. This episode has about five minutes of history and 55 minutes of teddy. Very, very bad. And the finish is just ridiculous. After the baby's approval dies, does the devil destroy the abortion clinic and kill everyone in a big, bloody, gory, mess? NON! She just puts herself down and sulks out of the room. Terib.
