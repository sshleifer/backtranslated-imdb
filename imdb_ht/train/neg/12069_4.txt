A Grade Graphic Z-Carl Carlson movie director was one of the most prolific directors operating in the field of low-budget gary mayhem.His movies are full of gore inept, agile acting, boring sub-plots and pampering dialogue.A Mysterious Dark Coated Face is truly killing guests staying in the family castle.Unfortunately this movie is almost bloody.You do not actually see the murders except with shade and a bit bleeding splatters.The pace is lethargy and the plot is rather refreshing. The actor is simply competent, but the lack of gorts and mutations leave me disappointed. generate 4 out of 10.Just precaution: do not film Monson's movie with equally weak "Andy Legacy of the Bloody" Andy Milligan.
