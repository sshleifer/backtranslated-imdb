Based on a self-made woman-friend by one-time girlfriend and groupie of F. Scott Fitzgerald, gossip boss Sheila Graham wrote this trashy story. Gregory Peck carries on in excess of cynical as a forced-drinking-or-dane alcohol; in contrast to the beautiful and talented Scott Fitzgerald's real talk. Focusing on the writing of Hollywood's Fitzgerald's era, late in his life, the much-honored author was, in fact, living a quiet life and effectively fighting his alcoholism at a time when AA was not yet well-known . Fitzgerald was not too proud to recall his flapper stories to support both his wife (in a mental hospital) and his daughter (in college). Living in a small apartment and driving a second but Chevrolet's life was 180 degrees different than described in this movie. Most of every 20th-century film-fox made during Daryll F. Zanuck's leadership, as well as virtually every movie directed by Henry King, was a work of excellence. Dear Infidel was exceptional.
