I thought that I would never find a horror movie like "Back to the Texas Chainsaw Massacre," but this movie compete with it. <br /> <br /> I'm not a sleeping person when watching a movie, but I did it 15 minutes after the Vision began. I woke up and started looking at her agenda. Why did I deserve this? All the film was a torture, I must use fast forward to look it up. <br /> I can not stand out why one of my favorites actors ever (MR. WALKEN) could do this. I must think that he has made the director a favor, or he really is in the need of money, because film after his movie is done, he is ruining himself; and so fast ... <br /> <br /> What about the movie? It's not scary, stupidly drawn, the terrible characters (but I really liked one that was played by Jarz Harris), the effects are very poor, lack of death & blood, etc.; In three words, it has nothing. And I mean it. Can not stand as a director can make a movie like this. <br /> In any way, when I got more shame was when I saw in the video cover, the movie was presented by "Stephen King", I think he could never present this crap, no ? (I rent it in Argentina). I do not recommend it to a million years. <br /> I missed this movie with a 2 out of 10. (As I say in my "Back to the Massacre Chainsaw Massacre" review, there will always be a worst movie, and therefore it does not deserve a 1 out of 10)
