Terib !!! I do not want to be too negative, but this movie has an IQ of stupid monkey. What a disaster. I just could not believe how bad this film is. The dialogues are just pretty weird and chop topics, The camera work at just awful times, the music at times like a band for Lawrence in Arabia, I just watch this movie to see how worst it can get. Some of the side kickers "actors" are total disaster.Sorry but all my thumbs and toes and anything that can hang down on my body fall to the ground. Harvey Keitle is a great actor who knows perhaps that he's in financial crunch to take part in such a movie movie. . . . . this film should be presented to all students at all film schools just to teach them a lesson about how to do a movie
