As a major fan of the original movie, it's hard to watch this show. The garish set is decorated with lightness stiffness to stole any style from this remake. The atmosphere is never there. Instead, he has the look and feel of many TV movies in the seventies. Crenna is not a bad choice as Walter Neff, but its striking wardrobe and "swank" apartment does not fit the mood of the original, or makes it an interesting character. He does his best to do it work but Samantha Egger It's a really bad choice. Accompanying the English and California seemingly can not hold Barbara Stanwick's voice lamps and sex appeals. Lee J. Cobb is trying to force Barton Keyes mode, but even his performance is just gray, without style. He feels like the TV movie he has and again reminds me of what a remarkable original movie is still.
