First: I bought it in the video store. Second: I watched it. Third: It was boring. Fourth: It was not funny. Fifth: Most of the antics were lame. And last but not least: Not only a bad movie, it's a total fyasko. <br /> I'm a big fan of Adam Sandler despite this movie is disappointing and forgotten. I pity her because she was his first film. Even if you're a big fan of Sandler Adam, do not bother watching this movie. Instead, just take the video, board a yacht, and throw it further.
