Let him give Paul "sex on the brain" Verhoeven comes with a sublime and juvenile inflation in the invisible MAN story. If he would lead a Pokemon movie, I'm sure he would turn it into some massive orgy of quality. I do not mind having sex or even sleaze (check my other reviews) on film but honestly, it is obvious that the director has a single idea to follow and he could not see interesting aspects on an invisible man scenario than the rooky implications he comes up with li. It's a shame because it could be good if the film did not spend much time there to be an invisible Kevin Bacon woman groping. <br /> <br /> Throw in toys of actors to do what he can with the one-note cheesy script but I felt bad for some of them, including William Devane, who totally wasted here. But then what can I expect from the director of SHOWGIRLS, which, BTW, is more fun than this movie and bad movie.
