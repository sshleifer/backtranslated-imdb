I know slashers are still supposed to be bad, but come on, what is the hell of this? It's like a bunch of 10-year-olds save their lunch money and started filming this weekend. Anyway, six young people all go to the same house get killed on screen.We have one of the brainy, the breath, the other shoe, the black guy, the killer, stereotypes like that. The only one gets to eat by a shaking boat, the others are all tralked by some guys who put a mask to the people in the poor box to reject. There is one decent pretty decent somewhere in the middle, but then it's back to even more boredom, and especially more frail fake.Serverly, we actually know he can not be the killer when someone gets attacked because the guy sure likes to take his sweet time for everything. <br /> After each character you are hoping to die, the chicken's ugly white standard and his-to-be-companion eventually get captured by the killer (they get like, push down and then faint) with killer to reveal himself .I think the writers of this film just took an eye butcher and a pen and put it somewhere on the list of characters.The motif is just lame and not even get I started on the modi secretion.The killer then of course takes way too much time to explain everything (and then about ten minutes in which he slices up his own arm for some reason) and eventually become overpowered by a guy with a gun.Hey, there is no just! one of the most terrible movies I've ever seen. I could enjoy myself more by watching a Lindsay Lohan-movie, I swear. I mean sure, the 80's slasher sucked as well, but at least the throw some T & A. This movie just has nothing to go for it.
