Much like the movie Boogens movie horror film, the unseen invisibility killer is quite a disappointment when it finally comes to view. Although the Animal House Stephen Furst has obviously been fun in the role as a product of incest, his performance is much more comedy than horror. <br /> <br /> The plot, a very tired, has three sexy women (Bach, Lamm and Lois Young) can find a hotel for the evening, so they want to accept them staying with a lost museum curator type, exceptionally played by Sydney Lassick who died. If you've ever seen any horror movie, you know that traditional IL 'Sydney is a disruptive psycho, so one knows what will happen to the lovely ladies. The three women are all pretty much, especially Barbara Bach, but Lois Young (a script Helen Hunt) is the only one to go naked, as Sydney looks at her take a bath.
