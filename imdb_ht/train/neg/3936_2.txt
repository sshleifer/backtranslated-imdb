Wow. I thought this would be insipid but it was even worse than I imagined! Sometimes I like to watch a good movie "car crash": people are so bad that you can not look away because you want to see how they can be found. This is really the only reason I was able to let the TV over - morbid passion. It was not much to act, which was only mediocre or slightly worse than one would expect from this cast, but the cite with the plot that would never have seen the light of day. The script, too, is plain-induced. As for movies, did anyone notice that a segment of "curtain designs" was used, as in an old 50-year TV ... but without irony? At first I thought to be kidding but the movie took itself too badly used this in a language-in-strain way. Do not even ask me about the note ... The only high point is the final song, by Morcheeba. I guess they wanted to let people with something for them $ 8 ... glad I saw it on TV !!!!! Just funny! I wonder if this is why Timothy Hutton has had trouble finding many jobs lately? I guess if you do not expect much, and you want to watch a sense of thrill, it's better to spend an evening moving your nail, which is why it's quite a 2.
