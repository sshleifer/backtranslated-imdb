Doris Day never allows a bad script to get it down. Even in most attempts at circumstance, Day gives 100% and usually comes out unscathed. This comedy, possibly inspired by a real-life New York City black-from 1965, but actually suited from a late-50 'French play by Claude Magnier, gives Doris little to do but lacks his own tasty- tasty, and, in the second half, must be commercially sedated (which is fun because of the day's turn giving the situation). There are some funny lines here, but the staginess of the material has obviously been carried out in the play ... and instead of conjuring up some entertaining incidents at Big Apple, we get stuck in the suburbs. Doris' co-star (Patrick O'Neal, Robert Morse, and Terry-Thomas) are not well suited to him, and neither is the forge hairstyle they have brought. Still, it's not terrible, it features a few big laughs, and for his angry day it's a must-see. ** from ****
