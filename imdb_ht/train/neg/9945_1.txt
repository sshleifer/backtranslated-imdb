After watching about half of this movie I noticed something peculiar ... I find myself constantly changing in TV-channels to see what else is over - not exactly a very pretty movie. <br /> <br /> This movie is listed as being in a number of genres, and I must say it mostly fails in each one of them. 80% of the movie I changed over to watch an old stroll instead. Below the line - the whole movie felt as if the ones that did it did not exactly know what to do and ended up in a concoction with no discernable flavor.
