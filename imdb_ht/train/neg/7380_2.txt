I think its time for Seagal to go slowly into the night. What I was just seeing doing all of her direct in video sharing in the past few years looked to hit her early 90's smash in comparison. <br /> A laboratory bio laboratory will make a new type of drug that jacks up a human adrenaline system at the point where they become psychopathic assassins or something. Somehow Seagal is supposed to stop the infection or it's the end of the world ... or something. Seagal also went on hitting squadron like jellybeans, every time I watched he was commander of a new face so it was hard to follow character development as well as knowing athmma Steven preventing him from calling to the head of his lungs, but even why is it still armed by those who sounds nothing like him? Usually these drawings and sequences of action can save it from being a total waste of time but this did not even close. As I said, it was more of a horror movie and a lot of blood and shank stabbing rather than straight up fighting. The problem was it not really scary and Seagal looked completely out of place because the infected people were supposed to have the speed of light movement again 40 years old Seagal's 280 lb killed all a single? I guess the Lone option in the movie was the first 20 minutes where the new recruiting asked Seagal to come to the strip club with them. <br /> <br /> 2 out of 10
