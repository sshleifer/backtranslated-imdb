If you really enjoyed 2002 movie movie resident, then you should just see it instead of slowing 2 hours you will never get back. I can not believe that no one commented that this film is just a cheap hit off of RE. First, a "special" command force is unique defense for a facility with a computer matrix that has an AI and holographic projection. And this "hive" rip-off has a series of traps that inevitably kill at one member of the squad at a time. There's even a checkpoint in the code names, which was in the dialogue of RE. Despite the fact that no zombie, the "rook", the movie nemesis, is some sort of bio-creature, very rainy in color suggests nectric tissue, and a lot of Cyborg components just like a super mutant in RE. So a margin-of-finger-tone to Mr. Richard Taylor to claim any credit for this story. <br /> They are not the same movie obviously, but the writer got the idea of ​​watching Resident Evil I think.
