This movie was rented by a friend. Its choice is usually good. I read the first cover and she waited a good movie. Although it <br /> <br /> was a horror movie. Which I do not prefer. But no horror came to mind while watching the movie. It was a dull, <br /> not very entertaining movie. Appearance of Denise Richards <br /> <br /> was again a pleasure for the eye. But that's it. We (four of us) <br /> we are a little disappointed. But feel free to watch this movie and judge it yourself.
