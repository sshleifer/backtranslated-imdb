... but I've seen better too. <br /> The story here is predictable - a movie crew trying to film a horror movie in a place where people died. Three guess what's going on. This is not a total bomb - the cast is fairly good and advantage to Ireland Ireland, Faith Domergue and John Carradine provide the best performances. It is reasonably well-designed for a low budget film. Just do not expect any nidity, swear, blood or gore (the movie has a very moderate PG rating). I was never totally bored - it OK to look on a quiet night. I saw it on video - it was a horrific print - very black and some scenes were impossible to see. Still I did not hate it and it has a cool end that has surprised me - basically nothing happens until then it catches you off guard. Worth to see but only if you are a complete horror movie.
