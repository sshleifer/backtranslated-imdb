### Spoilers! ### <br /> <br /> What does this movie offer? From control control and cinematography matches with a terrible scheme. It is sad to see Denzel Washington's talent going to waste in garbage like this.We are certainly hinting how the Mexicans can not save themselves, force outwardly needed, possibly military, American people. And we know the father is a shady character, he's a Mexican after all, unlike the wife who appreciates Creasey more because he is Indian. He killed all of them thinking he was dead. And did it? Of course, he will not, it's a kid and you do not suppose to inflict sensitivity to fans of Hollywood. The trade of the scene was the only thing that prevented me from scoring below the "implausible success" (as some critics pointed out) 'taken'. Cancer these cinemas will take time away. It is in the cinema rating that we doubt IMDb's credentials.7.7 for a movie like this and 7.0 for my own private Idaho. Go face! I will be in the range of 3.5-4.0
