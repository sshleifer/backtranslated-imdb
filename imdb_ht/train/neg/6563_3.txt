Bugs Bunny accidentally finished at the South Pole while trying to vacation in Florida. Where he met a little penquin, which he tries to save from an eskimo. This short tries and the penquin is adorable, but in the end it's a bit too light at the laughing department. The Eskimo is not really that great in a foil for Bugs and I just see a better cartoon bunny cartoons frankly, even other shorts when it's scared with other unknown antagonists. So I can not in good conscience recommend this one. However it is nice to see it in its form. This cartoon is about Disk 3 at the "Looney Tunes Collection Volume Volume 1" <br /> <br /> My Class C:
