An unmatched and unistinguished "new" Columbo who sees the man-in-the-Mac goes to his nephew's wedding, only for his bride to disappear on their wedding night. Columbo investigates ... <br /> <br /> And that he is about to read: indifferently drawn and amazingly loaded with a flat script, provided that he writes by Robert Van Scoyk, who was annually highly enjoyable to the Kolumbo story " Kill Glass "on the big day of the detective; There is not even a melee talking about and the greatest amount of intelligence given to Kolumbo by the script writer is down to suspicion through photos taken at the wedding, including everyone! /> Devoid at every possible Columbo feature, I thought I was watching an episode of Hill Street Blues. An insult to the history of the series, with appropriate soap opera style acting. Very Avoid Things.
