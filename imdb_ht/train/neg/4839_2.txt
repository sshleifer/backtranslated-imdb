... And they were bigger than ever before. I will not make any direct reference or anything here, but to say at least, this film is pathetic. If you are a military trainer, do not bother watching. I put it on the DVD and 2 friends want to look a bit a bit interesting / war. Why could not I just read the first reviews .. Already in the first stage "bomb" of the movie have great glitches, and continue to show them and become bigger and bigger. My 2 friends, by connecting to the military in any way spotted a couple of cinema errors almost as fast as I did and ask me if some of these things will be realistic. Well, as you might guess, they are not - at all. <br /> Avoid this movie unless you can overlook these errors completely idiom and re-happen. 2/10 to get my interest first.
