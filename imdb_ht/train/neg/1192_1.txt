I completely agree with jamrom4 .. this is the most terrible single movie I've ever seen .. holy ... it was awful .. i was warned not to see it .. and crazy i watched it anyway .. about 10 minutes of the painful my experience completely gave up on watching atrocity..but sitting at until end .. judging to see if i could .. well i did and now i wish i no did .. it was disgusting .. nothing happened and the end was all preachy..no bad movie has the right to survive .. i ask you all spare yourself scary in the busy bus ride .. only I have listened to the same warning .. please save yourself from this movie .. I have a feeling that people who have rated it are very involved in doing in the movie .. and they should all be wiped to the face of planet la ..
