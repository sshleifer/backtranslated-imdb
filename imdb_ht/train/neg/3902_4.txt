This is indeed an adaptation of God in Jane Austen's novel. Compared to the American version and Guinneth Paltrow, he wrote the script to the as much as possible the book. But the act was terrible. In addition to Kate Beckinsale, whom I believe was a true look of the Emma in the book, all the other actors were trying too hard. Strong brand was not the "gentleman" he assumed. It was often rude and offensive, there was no feeling any, and in all of the movie you could not see his love "growing" for Emma at all. This had a terrible effect on Kate Beckinsale, who seemed to be trying to "resque" her leading role as well as her partner. Moreover, there was no chemistry between the entire cast. Hariett Smith, played by Samantha Morton, seemed to have no real attachment to Mr. Elton, played by Dominic Rowan. Therefore, it did not seem as heartbroken as described in the book. The settings of the film are also too poor. Costumes are even more so. I would imagine Emma Woodhouse dressed in a most fashionable and elegant way that she did here. Finish too long. It is good that it looks like finishing the book, but it's a killer that ends up for a movie. And again, I can see no feelings of happiness in dealing with Mr.Knightley. To conclude, I believe this adaptation must be loyal to the book but with the poor actors. It seemed as though the movie was made without any budget at all. I would prefer to see the "lighter" version of Paltrow and Northam, though it is clear that it was meant to be a "blockbuster", rather than watching these actors (except the good Olivia Williams and Kate Beckinsale's best) script.
