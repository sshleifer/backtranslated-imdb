I will not mention any of the draws, because, although it would be very predictable anyway, one of the remarkable draw twists is giving away everywhere, in the movie reviews, in the plot summarized here, and even in the Summary on Netflix Envelopes me. I would love to read more if I did not know it. Maybe. This movie has a good trumpet cast, most of those who have been credited with the material rather limited by hand, including Donald Sutherland, Lesley Ann Warren, and Tia Carrere and Rosemary Dunsmore in smaller parts. It was impossible to love William McNamara, but that was clearly not designed. And there was a couple of nude scenes by the Callipygian Lenore Hindu. But none of this brings the slightest recommendation from me. Are not any of these fine actors actually reading these scripts before signing over?
