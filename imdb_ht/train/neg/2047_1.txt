I do not want to go on a rental here, but ..... this is the worst "movie" I've ever seen. Worse than the Avengers. Incompetent directing, written scripture, and actually awful is consistent elements only at all. Injection videos are very cheap, it looks like a high school project, but without the emotion. The lighting often looks like a single-gun sunshine. The sound is slightly better than a single micro on the camera, but everything else about this thing is just awful. The plot cut in unusual direction with no foundation or later resolution, the techie elements are patent absurd, and the correction looks worse than a rough cut. It's not even bad enough to be funny. It's just bad. BTW, the packaging is intentionally to lie. <br /> <br /> The door lion must be $ 4.00.
