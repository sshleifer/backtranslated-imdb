This was shown on the biography channel and was as informative as a child's comic! I gave her 2 out of 10 for her attention in detail because for the most part she had a 70s feel with the three ladies who played the original three angels to look like them so the make-up was good. <br /> <This was supposed to be a biography on the biography channel but it was canceled in everything that normally / usually sees in one of the biographies. No interviews with surviving disposal members, crew members, team members, etc., or friends, relatives, and any biographer of these people. In fact, I know very much now about the program as I did before I watched this movie based on (supposedly) the biographical book. As for actually learning something that no-one knew about the program and not being well-known knowledge that never happened.
