After two long, open skit, one of which brother I saw the conclusion coming in and the other totally free joke, we started the fast-forward festivity that it raised the appropriate TUBE. Of course, uber-asserting frat boy who always maintains JACKASS or Tom Green will get the idea of ​​fecal matter coming from the few tubes, OLYMPICS SEKS (I really do not need to give you details, do me), and a clown that basically does "very attractive clown" bit I think I've seen about eighty times now going to eat this up like manure beetle: well, more power to you. <br /> I just want to express that, despite what you've heard, this movie was in no way a model for the infinitely many funnier movies like KENTUCKY FRIED MOVIE or what not. The skit film has already been made in and now for another completely different, all you still want to know about sex, and so on. And to make way better.
