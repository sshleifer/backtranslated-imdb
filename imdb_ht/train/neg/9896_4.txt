The DVD version consists of 2 episodes, the paralysis of Caesar being the moment. In addition, the Spanish language was without translation. Therefore, it is difficult to review this movie because I did not understand what was said. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </a>. It is strong-tempered, but also a very supportive, tender soul companion. Thimothy Dalton as Caesar is perfect and romance are the main thing of the first episode. So it's not really a documentary, neither a peplum, but a beloved story. <br /> <br /> After the parody, a new guy comes (Marc-Antoine), but the taste goes: we always remember our first love. So I found the second episode and tragic fate was not said powerful. However, the production is abundant: the sets are large, nicely decorated; Morocco is home to exotic and collective splendor. Producers have a lot of money to insure, but they do not spend anything on their special effects. They are so poor (blue screen, chips, sphinx) that it's funny. <br /> <br /> Finally, I'd love to hear it in French or English to make a definite opinion on this two cinema.
