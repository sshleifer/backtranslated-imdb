B The best movie. Sound effects are very good. Army Concept, decent execution. I think it's a rental. <br /> "You put some oil in your mouth to save you from the poison, you cut off bite and suck from poisen.You will be OK Tommy." /> <br /> "You live by the airphone, when Agent Harris calls you to me!" "Give me a fire extinguisher." <br /> <br /> "Weapons - we need weapons. Where's the agent? All we have is this .. Sporks!" expert. <br /> <br /> Local ERS can handle occasional snakebite. Warn every ER in the Tri-City area.
