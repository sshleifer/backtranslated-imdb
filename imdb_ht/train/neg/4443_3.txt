Serom begins as Eddie (Derek Phillips) is pleased to learn that she has accepted medical school to bring her family tradition to become a MD like Richard O'Neill and his uncle Eddie (David H. Hickey) , but his happiness might be short live as Eddie involved in an accident & is running off by a car. Taking the nearest hospital he does not look good for Eddie poor so Eddie's uncle convinced Richard's brother to let him save Eddie and the serum he developed, a serum that will give the recipient the power of Self cures any sort of injury or illness. Desperate for his boy to live Richard agrees but the procedure has high side effects like Eddie's turn into a zombie eating food that's just not a good thing ... <br /> <br /> Executive product, writing & directing by Steve Franke I will perfectly frank myself and tell Serom is terrible, Serom is the one who has no budget horror movie that tries to rip off other any number of the other and end up being a little more fun than having your nails pulling out with pliers. The script is awful, it has the whole Re-Animator (1985) feeling with crazy scientists who have great syringes trying to eliminate death, but it's so boring it in true, the first forty is nothing more than a soap opera really mats how much nothing to expect the time pad runs out with Eddie arriving home after spending some time away & finding his ex girlfriend was tuned to another person, argument with mom-step, getting drunk and companion read & generally bother the audience. So once the teddy in the first forty minutes is over & if you're still watching it take another twenty minutes to get Eddie re-animated & then he killed a couple of people, police catch up with him '& shoot it, in the end. Thank you God. Serom is devoid of any of the features in which one would associate with a good movie, sucking the character, the dialogue is poor, it takes itself far too mild, it's dull, it's slow, it's forgettable & considers it means that a horror movie must be an alarming lack of blood, gore or horror. Not recommended, have I mentioned serum was boring? I thought that. <br /> <br /> Franke's director does nothing to live this up, although competent there are no styles here at all. The gore levels are not existent, there is a bit of blood splash, a neck pain, a couple of marks on a woman's face, a couple of scenes where a needle is blocked to poison & that's it. Do not expect a Re-Animator in the department to handle because if you do you will be seriously disappointed, much like I was in reality. Movies in what looks like one house, a restaurant and a movie laboratory has no variety either & just looks cheap at all. There's a couple of scenes of stripping but that's nowhere near enough to save it. <br /> <br /> Technically the movie is not too bad, at least it looks like proper cameras are used, I can not really comment on the special effects because there is no hand generally speaking serum looks reasonable to professional. Apparently shot in Texas, or should it read it should be literally shot in Texas? The acting absorbed although I think that was the good actor rather than friend or family director. <br /> <br /> Serpent is a horrible movie, it's dull, slow, boring, no gore & feels like a terrible opera soap for the first forty minutes. I do not understand why anyone would feel the need to watch this when they can look at Re-Animator or one at the end of it again, seriously I recommend giving Serum a miss. There I just saved you from wasting 90 minutes of your life, you can thank me later.
