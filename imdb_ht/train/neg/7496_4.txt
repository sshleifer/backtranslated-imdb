It is difficult to put into words almost the hate hack I have in this movie. But I'm going to try: <br /> <br /> Every other word was an explosive, the sex scenes were uncomfortable, the rampant and stereotyped drugs were beyond the norm, if not offensive to the Italian Americans. <br /> <I did not say the act was terrible, because Leguizamo, Sorvino, Brody, Espisito et. go, do good. But ... almost every character of the movie I despise. Not since the fireworks of things I have neglected every character on screen.
