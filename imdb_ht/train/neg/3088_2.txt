1. Aliens resemble plush toys and puppets but while having non-functional arms. <br /> 2. Foreigners have mastered intergalactic space travel, but they do not know how to push an open vault door, but they can push open a door kept close to five people. Old security guards know how to get a hold of C4, and they just wait for the right time to use it, say, suddenly they are shot unreasonably unreasonable. Apparently, US Army Boot Camp, in the 80's, involves several sessions of "field garden combat", including the pirouette turn of death. To impress your prudish girl friend, you have to "save the world ... mistake ... neighborhood" from aliens. All women are slammed, either openly or secretly. Scummy night club looks like bad dinner. <br /> 8. Scummy dancers double as dancers for the Fontanelles (how did they talk about this?) Who can only do bad bad 60 dance. Private army dreams of being rampant. <br /> 10. Grenades apparently have an "flash-bang" setting. <br /> <br /> 11. Burning alive apparently only left one with minor burns on the arms. The US Army Army Sargans apparently came to the area and did nothing about foreigners in the area. Foreigners apparently still "go home", which means back to the arch were unlocked. The aliens attract bright lights, apparently in the Los Angeles area one would assume, the protagonist's house is the brightest object in the area. Show 16 scene parking in a movie to make the hearing rumor more. Vans from the 80 apparently have terrible suspension systems. <br /> 17. Comedy is supposed to happen in this movie. <br /> 18. Horror is supposed to happen in this movie. Space and homage are supposed to happen in this film. <br /> <br /> 20. This film heals insomnia. <br /> 21. Apparently, garden tools make electronic keyboard noise every time they are used, not just in battle (telling me I'm not the only one who noticed this). <br /> <br /> The truth is simply that this movie just came out bad. Period. There is plenty of meat on the bone, or does it really well. Even average. It's just bad. However, I've seen far worse, and the racist fight scene is pure, intent or otherwise comedy gold. <br /> <br /> 2/10 - Jail 4 has worsened then this. At least the movie has never taken seriously.
