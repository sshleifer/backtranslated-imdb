I can enjoy a cuddly fun cautious cops, but this is just bad. And not bad in a way you might enjoy watching MST3K make fun of it. It's just nauseatingly bad as you can not find anything to enjoy on that no matter how hard you try. I'm really sorry to waste 2 hours of precious life on this crap. You can say no to her that no one asked to act with everyone in her knowing that this film would only bury their careers. Apparently "Tall Market" has garnered enough income that a person decides to make a buck of investment. If not the worst movie I've seen, it's so bad that it's bloating the movie gets worse off my memory.
