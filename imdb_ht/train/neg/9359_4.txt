This film is probably pro-Muslim. <br /> <br /> Why do I write that? The main character has a Muslim father and a Christian mother. He lives his first 20 years in a Christian village. At the end of her film she is a Muslim because of putting herself, that she holds her hamlet, and her overall dress. He has a six-year-old child who puts even head-wear and therefore is probably a Muslim, although the mother is a Christian. The main character so chosen, it seems, to be a Muslim with his child becoming a Muslim. No one of the other main characters, Christian, seems to breed a child. There are more Muslims in the world of this movie at the end of it, and so looks like.
