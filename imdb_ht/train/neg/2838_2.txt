Skip Mission: Galactica and look at the original Living Legend Church instead. The network took part 1 & 2 of Living Legend and blocked them into one conspiracy with the terrible fire in Space. Although Galactica suffers from writing controls and a shortage of time to prepare for a proper production, Living Legend is best in the 1978 TV series. Fire in space, on its own, is one of the worst episodes. As a historical note, watch the original Star Trek, Galactica, and then restore the trek to the series and you will see the difference in quality between network-producing sci-fi and syndicated sci-fi.
