I was going to say this was the worst gay-themed movie I've ever seen, but I can honestly say this is the worst movie if any genre I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> You know you're in trouble when a movie begins with a "personal note" from the Director, asking for "understanding" the audience for the "many challenges" facing a first-time Principal . The audio track is so bad at many scenes it's almost impossible to follow the dialog, with this from a DVD version. Bad lighting, bad weather, bad photography, poor script, generally bad acting all adds up to making this unwatchable "movie". I did it until the bad end of several attempts, and immediately gave away the DVD I crazy to buy. I'm sure there are many challenges facing a first-time Director. But do not try to palm in this lame attempt as a finished product. I see in detail IMDb that this was not the first direct attempt of Richard Natale, but also the only. This is one positive thing I can say about this alleged "movie".
