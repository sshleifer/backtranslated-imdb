An Italian / American co-production co-starring Linda Blair and David Hasselhoff of Hoff: how could any fan of trashy horror resist such a treat? <br /> Well, based on the changeable, very tedious, and absolutely nonsensical first forty minutes or so, I would have said 'very easy'; Fortunately, however, things eventually get a tad more fun with the introduction of several death scenes invented, and for those lucky enough to get an uncut copy, a smattering of stripping too (unfortunately, my copy modified copy was removed as offensive material ). The Hoff Hoff stars as Gary, a photographer who accompanied her lovely girlfriend Leslie (Leslie Cumming) to a run-down hotel on a seemingly deserted island in order to take photos for her latest project, a book about witches; Also, there is chilly Gary also hoping to try and heal a bad case of blue balls by relieving Leslie's girls. Rose Brooks (Robert Champagne and Annie Ross), daughter of Blair, son of Tommy (Michael Manchester), beautiful Nymphomaniac architect Linda Sullivan (Catherine Hickland), and Jerry Real Estate Agent (Rick Farnsworth), who came to inspect hotels island a. <br /> After explaining their unexpected presence on the island, Gary and Leslie are welcomed by the new owner property, and when a violent storm suddenly chooses, making it dangerous to return to the mainland, everyone agrees to spend the night in building old age. Unfortunately, unknown to the new hotel guests, the place is also home to the spirit of an evil witch (Hildegard Knef), who requires human beings in order to bring himself to life. One by one, the victims pulled in a red vortex whirlpool (which guaranteed street unintentional), before meeting a terrible fate. None of this makes much sense, and the act is atrophy (Manchester as Tommy is particularly bad, while Hasselhoff proves to be one of the best performers, speaking merchants about the others), but those viewers who make it The past half the first saddened rewarded with some very decent moments of gore: Rose has her mouth stitched together, before being roasted alive in a fireplace; Jerry is crucified and burned alive; Linda is tortured by hags and scrambled on a swordfish (!!); Freddie's veins are pulsating and bursting in blood gland; and Gary gets short in the back. <br /> Oh, and Leslie is raped by a guy who has no mouth and Blair gets owned (again).
