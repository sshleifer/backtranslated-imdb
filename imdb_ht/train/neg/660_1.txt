Good grief I can not even begin to describe how poor this movie is. Do not get me wrong, I did not wait very much to start with them. Let's face it, a scream movie scissors PG-13 is pre-destined to be missing the ummm ... abat, so no one would be surprised at the lack of Gore. But it was the level of incompetence and clich√© on display in all the other aspects of this movie that's really blow me away. <br /> <br /> We have a protagonist that is simply so completely useless that you find yourself rooting for the bad guy. And here is a turntable for the books ... It never changes - hence crush the cardinal rule of the Basic writing screen - character development. If you think of the end of this movie the poor girl is going to turn around and finally kick some ass up then think again. <br /> <br /> On top of this, we will be able to repay the least intriguing (and definitely at least frightening) killer ever to favor the genre. I'm not joking when I say that Dora Explorer has bad peasants than this movie. <br /> <br /> Finally, because all the potential for tension or gratuite is removed by inept (and apparently thirteen-year-olds) directors, what could possibly let them fill up 2 hours in screen time? <br /> Closets, that is. <br /> <br /> Lots and lots of wardrobe: large wardrobe, small closets, reflective closet, Narnia wardrobe, so many damned wardrobe you will not want to dress yourself for another year. In fact this film would just be called "closet", and it has a picture of an awesome angry fury on the DVD case. On the back he could have had a photo of the falling audience with a quote by Roger and Ebert - something to the limit of: "what's f * @ we've just wasted time we're watching!"
