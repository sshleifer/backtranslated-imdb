(SPOILERS AHEAD) Russian "fantasy" fantasy (and I use term in injuries) that I was trying to look for over a year. I finally gotten to the end and now I wish I did not put in the repeated effort. <br /> In an effort to save two hours in your life I'll tell you to draw- a guy who has the ability to project a long blade from his arms back home to see his mother. Things turned ugly when she was beaten up by the mafia companion of an old girl friend. He took revenge on the guy when he brought the girl home. Mafia's mother sent her guys out to get revenge while the cops start looking for him too. <br /> <br /> Very little said. No explanation really provides for anything (such as why they close ID girlfriend in asylum) and the action, for the most part is the whole screen. The movie essentially consists of a guy who looks like Adrian Brody intensely and does not say anything, murder (on screen-most of the action happens on screen). It looks good, is quite acted and there are some forms of reasons for what goes on it might have been a good movie. Hell, I would like some sense of real-life or back-story development (all we know is that the guy took on such a kid). The movie runs the best part of two hours and feels like its six. If they were not going to tell us anything they could have at least pick up the speed so it seemed like it was moving too fast. By instead we find the hero on a boat. The hero of a bus, the hero of the hero, the hero of the jeopardy.Hero and his girl. It really annoys me since I think this could be a good movie if they simply did something or had someone actually say something significant other than giving instructions to "get this guy". <br /> 4 out of 10 .. It's about four hours (all my attempts to see this) I will never get back. Only for those who want to see a Russian haze action movie with very little action
