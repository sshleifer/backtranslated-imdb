I know I'm in the minority, but ... Uwe Boll is about as a talent as a frog. Not even a frog; just a frog. It's reminiscent of about one hundred other no hacking talents that churn one unnecessary crap-fest after another. <br /> <br /> This movie? Is a crap-fest. The Slunter's talent is only minimally used by one's leader to believe he had other things (such as his failed relationship) about himself. Reid does as if he had either forgotten his acting lessons, being hit hard on the head and had forgotten his lessons to act, or he has one of the worst directors of the story of films. I vote on the third choice, myself, although the other two are still possible. <br /> Uwe Boll never made one thing out of which I came out the same slightest pleasure. Frankly, I am satisfied that he made this stinker. I was concerned with Bloodrayne competition and "Underworld: Evolution" for ticket sales. Now I am confident that Len Wiseman has nothing, and I mean no, worry about. <br /> This rate a 1.0 / 10 rating for this room, complicating crap-fest, from ... <br /> <br /> The Inend :.
