I'm one of the biggest fans of silent comedy and have probably reviewed more Buster Keaton movie for IMDb than anyone else. Every film she has made since the beginning of her career in the early 30s and only two exceptions I've reviewed, so you can say I'm a big fan. That's because I've found this episode so painful and hard to look. I loved this movie and kept thinking "Buster, how could you?". Well, now that I think about it, I guess I can see why Buster Keaton plays in this god-awful episode of the Twilight Area. He would lose much of his wealth after a dirty divorce in the early 1930's and his film career as a leading man has long been too. Now in the 1960s, Keaton needed the money and liked her resurgence in popularity so she whore herself from anyone wanting to pay - appeared in Beach Movie and disrupted this in an episode of a great series. The biggest problem with the episode is that it's just so loud writing and Buster deserves better. The show is supposed to be funny but not and instead of a tribute to the silent film is just painful to watch - especially with Keaton wearing that stupid long journey helmet as well as all the slapstick is wrong executed. Make yourself a favor, SKIP SA - it's a pale imitation of the greatness that once Keaton's career !!!
