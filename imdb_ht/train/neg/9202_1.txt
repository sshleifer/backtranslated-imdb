I own this movie. No choice, I do. I was really bored the other day and the box intrigued me. So I popped it to the old VCR and spent the next hour and a half of my life crying "Why God Why?". The story-line was not that bad, as a gamer I could appreciate bits in it. I think maybe if you are in the super-romantic cheese scene you will enjoy this movie. "I always think about myself as a Vulcan you know as Dr.Spock ... can love" There are very few good things to say about this movie, truly it is terrible. And if you're up to really doing this movie is the one for you !!! The real story is much more interesting if;) <br /> If I had to sum up this movie in one word it would be: <br /> <br /> LAME
