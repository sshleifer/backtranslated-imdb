After reading in many of the reviews, I do not know which films some people were watching, but clearly it was not even the one I saw. This movie is terrible. Acting, primarily Moore, is just awful. The woman can not act. Nice tits, but she just can not act. There is no point he came across the current character. Instead, he was spoiled Hollywood actress going to the beach to play make-believe with the boys. And that's what this movie finally is - Hollywood makes-believe. The training sequences are on the top. Politics - on the top. Policy policy - on the top. Combat scenes - you guessed it, on the head. Your mission is to get through and get out without detecting. So what do you do? Why shoot on as many rounds and make noise as possible, of course. Oh G.I. Jane, you can be my zeal at any time. <br /> <br /> The situation is good, but as soon as Hollywood gets a hold of it, we finish with Top Gun and Tits. What's more expected in US commercial film yet? Not much I guess.
