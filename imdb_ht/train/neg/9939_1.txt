The film school-intelligence can drink everything they want about the meaning of the important (imagined) significance of this movie, but it's just that: intolerable drool. This movie is creatively bankrupt, with some of her endless endlessly wanking abilities as substance. Yeah. <br /> Evidently Godard was not a stone fan. Too bad, because this could be great. He captured the birth of this timeless song and chose instead to cover the music and some guys read from a True Detective or some crap. <br /> <br /> Then there are the endless shots of what looks like the 60 libraries to spray-paint words on the person's car. Then there's seemingly always "interviews" where the actress was brilliant instruction to answer only yes or no of all the questions really deep and intellectual. There are some dude in a purple costume that reads more crap out of a book, which goes on for, oh, only about 20 minutes. With black panties or something in a junkyard. <br /> It's almost intriguing sound? Well, it's not. <br /> But for hipsters who do not care about hipsters about lost opportunities to have full access to the stones to bring humility to the devil in the world and would prefer to hear some English readers rather than look on cover at the Nudie Mag, this movie is a real winner! <br /> <br /> More ... quite possible Godard just neck.
