The best that I can say about this movie is that it was fun lustr at times, and that it was a time-appropriate killer. Unfortunately, this movie is also so annoying that I wanted to calm those characters around. This is the kind of movie that is so sweet, it hurt your teeth. Intentions were good, I suppose, but things get awfully fatigued when the dialogue is SO nauseating. When the two leads are not set on screen, that's really not bad at all, but you need to fear during those times often when the love couple begins to talk to each other.
