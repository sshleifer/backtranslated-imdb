The Invisible Maniac begins as a young Kevin Dornwinkle (Kris Russell) caught by his strict mother (Marilyn Adams) watching a girl (Tracy Walker) strip in his telescope ... Cut 'Twenty Years After' & Kevin Dornwinkle (Noel Peters) is now a physical teacher who claims to discover a way to turn things into invisible using a serial 'mollecular reconstruction'. However during a demonstration before his fellow scientists failed & they laughed at him, Dornwinkle went mad killing a few of them & was locked away from a mental institution from which he saved. Going forward 'Two weeks later' with a college summer college student discussing the tragic physical deaths when the head of Cello's head (Stephanie Blake as Stella Blalack) said she had been hiring a replacement, yes, she was guessing her to Dornwinkle. The student does not take it and treats it like dirt, however Dornwinkle has perfected her invisibility serrus & uses it to satisfy her sexual pervertedness & urge her for revenge. Co-written & led by Adam Rifkin wisely underneath the pseudonym Reif Coogan (I would not want my name to be associated with this turd of a movie either) The Invisible Maniac is real under the barrel thing. The script by Rifkin, sorry Coogan & Tony Mak is terrible. She tries to have a gender / sex / hybrid sex genre that fails in each department. For a start the sex is nothing more than a few female shower scenes & a few boob shots, not many other things I'm scared & the birds in the invisible maniac are not even good looking. The comedy is lame and Miss miss by the thousand proverbs, this is the kind of movie that thinks someone fights an invisible man or has Henry (Jason Logan) a dumb man trying to make a phone call is funny . The Invisible Maniac makes the Academy of Police (1984 - 1994) the movie series look like the pinnacle of sophistication! As for the horror aspects that too are lame. It is also an incredibly slow (it takes more than half an hour before Dornwinkles even becomes invisible), dull, predictable, boring & has very annoying and incredible young characters. <br /> <br /> Director Rifkin or Coogan or whatever makes absolutely try and make the invisible Maniac an even a little enjoyable experience. There is no crisis, tension or atmosphere & as a whole movie is a real chore to sit down. It does nothing with the angle of invisibility, just a few open doors on their own are as adventurous as it gets. There are a lot of throat or violence, a bit of blood splash, a strangulation and some decent bit of the whole movie when someone has blown up with a shotgun, unfortunately it was invisible at the time & we only get to see The headless torsion later. <br /> <br /> The budget must be low, and I mean really low because this is one badly looking movie. Dornwinkles Laboratory is basically of jars on her bed bed! When it escapes from mental institutions it has all one dog sent after him & the whole school has about a dozen students and two teachers. The Invisible Maniac is a bad movie made in all its duration at 85 minutes, I spotted the boom to boom on at least one occasion ... Allowing just to say the act is in a low standard & let it's that. The <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />. I have not found any recurring features of it at all, there are many more best films out there you can look so there is no reason whatsoever to waste your time on this garbage. Definitely one to avoid.
