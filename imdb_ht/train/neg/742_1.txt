If this movie has a budget of 20 million I would just like to know where the money goes. A monkey can do best CGI effect then that has been wasted for 3 hours on this dreadful piece of waste, although I have to admit the machines and the Martians would have to look really, really cool on an original game play station 1 , and early pc games from the mid 90s if there is a game ever made. What is my puzzle is where did the money go? Pendragon films could make a great movie with good old fashioned computer and computer controlled a George Lucas cameras about 1975-83, and actors who actually look like they care about what they are doing (or damaged in this case) for about the same 20 million dollars. This is probably the worst movie ever made! I would rather sit in a 24-hour screening repeating Ishtar than watching this movie again. I hated it completely! I'm sorry. I say this is the WORVER movie each has to do because unlike other bad films such as 9 or killer tomatoes, or Santa Claus competing martians, these are the movie that's so bad you have a special place in your heart for them, you love them. There is no love for this movie and no place in my DVD library for it. I sell it to a guy for a dollar. I borrow money for the movie spent on bottles and other bumps for the cast and crew. Shame on You Pendragon Movie! I want my money back!
