I was blindly bought this movie and I am so angry that I've paid as much as I did, but I would say that it's at least worth a rent for some fresh and agile deaths. It is not a good movie in any way but I must say that I was very darn funny. I think it might be called bad-it-good. As I said, the act is terrible, I feel like I could do a better job that shows, at least, any emotion. The story has nothing new and has done better. I guess I just have a soft spot for any kind of carnival-skate film. I would say this rent or download it, but definitely not buy it. It's not worth more than a look.
