The plot is compulsive but banal, so beautiful and overlooked by the rich and powerful wife has a throw with a psychotic couple, then try to cover it as the psycho legs and his blackmails. But what develops from stupefyingly logic. Although the resources available to the usual couple with money and influence, our privileged heroes and heroines appear to have only one domestic, lawyer and local police (saying they can do anything) at their disposal while they are confronts with suspense and fear. They do not have any private security staff (only a fancy security system that they mishandle), at home or yard staff, drivers, etc. Not, apparently, the funds to hire private nurse-clock care for the hero when he suffered which threatens life wounded, leaving man and wife alone and vulnerable to the castles. Our heroine is described as having the brains of a doorknob and our hero, a tycoon, behaving in the easiest and irrational way. The production is a curse for spectators who have wasted time with this drivel and a crime for wasting the talents of actors Oliva Hussey and Don Murray (what they thought?). And, shame on television forever to insult the intelligence of its audience for this offering.
