I read somewhere where this movie was supposed to be a remake of 1949 film "Cross Criss." I found the letter to be disappointing but it was still better than this movie. This movie is a "neo-noir" since it's modern-day and its color, of purist things would make it disqualified for movie noir. <br /> <br /> The biggest negative in it, however, was not the movie (fine), but the story was muddled. Hey, some of the 40's Dashiell Hammett stories were similar, but I did not care for some of these either. The creators here did not help the situation by putting flashbacks in the story that seemed like every three minutes. No wonder he kept up with this story. It was ridiculous! What happens is that by the 45-minute mark, no confusion is concerned again. I know I did not.
