Would anyone really watch this rbbish if he did not have small children running around naked? From a movie point of view is probably one of the worst movies I've ever encountered absolutely terrifying. Some perv up one day and think I'm going to make a movie with the girl and call it art, sticks to land and there is no need for a story or explanation about how they were or why they do not appear to live anywhere or have parents because p * rn movie does not need anything like that. I would comment on the rest of the movie but I did not have a cooker so I'll just say avoiding, avoiding avoiding and finding yourself a proper movie to watch
