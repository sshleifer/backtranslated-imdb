I can not say that Aag is the worst movie Bollywood ever to do, because I have not seen all Bollywood films, but my imagination tells me that it might be good. <br /> This film looks like an attempt at artistic suicide on behalf of the director, and I believe one has been successful in his mission. No A-list actor outside this film would risk sharing the same bill as it is for all humiliation that the film is bound to carry with it. <br /> But do not let just blame the director here, there is Cinematographer, which looks like it is recurring for the amateur film maker of the year award. There are dramatic notes, which are expected to bring you to the next stage. The lighting, who must have kept a cigarette in one hand and light bulbs on the pole in the other, and hope that the burning flame of the cigar would add to the much needed light in each scene. And, of course, the actors! Some of them are not meant to be new, otherwise they can be forgiven here. The ensemble of actors in Aag has put together a new beginning and dimension of re-making of India's favorite movie ever, 'Sholay'. One must not forget that these actors were not forced into this film, they are A-smooth and unwilling participant of something, let's face it would surely have been high and eager to wait public ... So, it enters the question, Amitabh aside (for now), did other actors really believe their performance even tried the best original? Does Amitabh Bachchan read the script and believe that people would remember his dialogue in the abdominal cancer of a movie? Not to be stupid, of course it was not, this was a public demonstration of how much talks could make the actor walking. <br /> I really hope everyone is satisfied with what really a vulgar attempt to notice a classic film, which only succeeded in polluting everyone's mind when they look original.
