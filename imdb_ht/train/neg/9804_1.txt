Power guards, traditional TV shows in the 1990s, had to be the most pointless and ridiculous TV show ever created. <br /> <br /> What exactly is this point to show anyway, other than selling second plastic storytelling to children? There is nothing even remotely ax or interesting about this show in anyway. <br /> Look at the costumes, which look like spandex goes bad. <br /> <br /> Hair in style mullet, earrings, and fashion in the early 1990s look completely ridiculous these days. <br /> <br /> Avoid this show at all costs!
