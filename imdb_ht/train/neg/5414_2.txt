This film is even a great step down to forming the typical wine ticket from Bollywood. Their performance was terrible. Even Boman Irani, who still managed to shine, goes completely OTT as the villain. The soundtrack is not memorable either. And in spite of trying hard, the female driving does not manage to be "sexy". Vivek Oberoi is able to project far as Fardeen Khan seems to be stuck in the same fare for the time. But this monstrosity is even under his limited ability as an actor. Esha Deol and Amrita Rao are awful in the brightest roles seriously written. It's high time for Indra Kumar to hang his direct hat. Hope it never led another horror like this. Future of Hindi movies are at best but now. Sum it up, staying away from cellulose garbage.
