Why would someone go back to someone, who kicks them to their teeth, not once, not twice, but over and over again. <br /> <br /> This film teaches us that in order to find love we must accept abuse (not only forgiving it, but it completely accepts it). Gosh! No wonder my first relationship was lasting ten years. I obviously did not embrace masochists inside me. As Bucatinsky's first writing, there are many wonderful aspects of this film; However, to justify reunion Eli and Tom, more character development could be helpful. We never know with Eli's masochism, in fact, we are leading them to believe it is not a masochist, although Tom's psycho-emotional Sadis is very obvious.
