****** SPOILERS ****** <br /> The unfunny radio display shows Kyser army and his mediocre group is the excuse for Lugosi, Karloff, and Lorre to pick up a check in this bland, sporatically negative home horror parody. Lugosi is a mysterious sign of being exposed as a fake attempt of a heiress fortune; Karloff is the butler and Lorre, a professor of false medicine, but seems to be both in conspiracy and Lugosi. <br /> Of course, Kay Kyser and his band at 30-something year old "kids" discover the truth and the minimum humor possible on the road. Not recommended to any complete hand of absolute horror.
