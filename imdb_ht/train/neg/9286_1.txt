OK first of all let me say that I'm still amazed about how the scheme sucks, but it's still a movie that succumbs to a Steven segment film with no Steven segg omg !!! <br /> <br /> just random budget scene action really does not have any point I always amaze i burn 90 min on this crap really !! <br /> just rent a movie jacky chan or go see wwf more fun and no and suppose no and plot !!! plz plz avoid it !! The Best Actress BEST actor has Goldberg bill and says so much !! <br /> and no it does not play very well as i said plz avoiding it pfff i still cant believe i wasted 90 min and have spent 10 min more write that !! :)
