This movie is some of the worst crap I've ever seen. I literally got a sharp pain in my head while watching this movie. The CGI was awful, and the story was just a dump of ink. Karen Dean Cain was Mr-Super-Intuitive-I-can-face-out-anything, except he may not seem to work his own helicopter correctly. The biggest problem was the cracked screen camera. I felt like I was watching Brady's bunch or something, only he was not different people in the boxes, just locked ups with different views of the same. I can only figure that the actors really need the money, because this film was not worth the movie he shot on.
