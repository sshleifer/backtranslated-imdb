It should be assumed that those who praise this movie ("The greatest opera ever filmed," did not I read somewhere?) Either do not care for opera, do not care for Wagner, or do not care about nothing except their desire to appear Culture. Either as a representation of swan-song songs, or as a movie, this strikes me as an unmitigated disaster, and a lead reading of the note matches a realizable, lugubrious realization of the text. It is doubtful that people who have the idea of ​​what an opera (or, for that matter, a play, especially one by Shakespeare) is "about" to be allowed anywhere near a theater or movie studio; Syberberg, very fashionable, but without the slightest justification from Wagner's text, decides that Parsifal is "over" bisexual integration, so that the title character, in the latter stages, transmutes to a type of beatnik babe, even if someone continues to sing high tenor - some if any of the actors in the movie are the musicians, and we get a double dose of Armin Jordan, the conductor, who sees it as the face (hand not heard as the voice) in Amfortas, and also appeared monstrously in dual exposure as a kind of Batonzilla or conductor who was Ate Monsalvat during the Good Friday music - in which, by the way, the translucent loveliness of nature represented by a Sown in store crushers and tied glued to sick-wearing the turf, a speedy abundance of me. In the theater, we sometimes have pieces out of these flaws and thoughts, but I can not imagine why Syberberg could not connect to Parsifal and Gurnemanz, such lush mountain pastures as provided for Julie Andrews in the sound of music. . Remember is difficult to maintain, the high voices and the horns in particular possess an equilateral splint that adds another sort of fatigue to our impatience and the inspiration faced with paralysis unfolding at the ceremony. Someone in another review mentions Bayreuth's recording in 1951, and Knappertsbusch, though his temptations are often very slowly, had that jordan missing, a sense of heartbeat, a feeling for the ebb and the musical flow - and, after half a century, the orchestra sound of this series, in modern pressure, is still superior to this movie.
