I'm a massive fan of the book and Orwell is certainly my favorite writer ever since studying Animal Farm at GCSE. I bought the DVD from absolute curiosity, Burton is an actor I kept in great consideration so when I heard he played the role of O'Brien I had to knife. <br /> I watched the trailer on the DVD First and some fears started to put in, especially regarding the frankly awful "Theme Song", hearing Eurythmics mechanically shouting "1984!" On and off again in an electronic beat is as bad as it sounds. The action on a whole is very good, Burton and Hurt play their role well with the tension that exists in the Ministry of Truth towards the end may be felt, especially in the 101st floor scene. However this is where the film is also down. The film spends too much time focusing on the love affair between Winston and Julia, which frankly is not what Orwell wrote about. He wrote about a harrowing future, about how Ingsoc built a human belief and then broke them all in the name of his loved ones Big Brother. The film jumps to what is essentially the most important part of the book, Winstons comes to terms with his position in life with the world, and re-educates it through O'Brien. At this time the states that the stick movie of the book is completely correct. Julia is not present when Winston visits O'Brien, not committing themselves to the Goldstien Fraternity and confessing their crimes. There is no obvious mention in the first case where Winston finds the item with the Unpersons, but found out near the end, if you have not read the book it is completely confusing. which some excellent acts can not be saved. Michael Radford seems to have completely missed Orwell's point trying to do, and the sound electronic track is frankly awful.
