I saw with the first two love a lot, really. Especially because the second is not just a try to make another one as good as the first. And it's a story standing alone. You do not need to know the movie first. I liked that in the "Free Willy" movies, too. <br /> But the third, here is absolutely useless! I tried it with a friend, because we both loved the first two. We decided to stop after a good half an hour. The movie is okay, there is funny part of it well. But what about? Timon and Pumba were funny creatures in the first two cinemas. What Lion King 1 1/2 is for me is: a tough attempt to get even more fun in the movie first than it was already, plus telling the story from their point of view. But what about? I would really like to know. You know, the idea of ​​вЂ <вЂ <the two of them sitting in the movie will look at the first one, is really nice. But what comes next is especially needed. I guess many people loved Timon and Pumba, and so I really. But for my many parts were very constructed and a try to be funny. No chance, most of it was not funny at all, at least for me. BTW. what was the movie on anyway? Was it a) about Timon and Pumba or b) an attempt to gain more pleasure from the movie first? I tend to choose b options and I'm very disappointed about it. If you like to see stories such as "The Story Behind Xy", you should see "Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are killed" by Tom Stoppard and Tim Roth and Gary Oldman. This is really funny and does not try to get more out of "Hamlet" then it has.
