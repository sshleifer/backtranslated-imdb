There is no way to describe how really, really, really bad movie is. It's a shame that I actually sit in this movie, this movie is very tedious and predictable. What's wrong with it? Act: There is no single performance that is even remotely close to being sub-par (atleast all very nice). Soundtrack (song): "If we find orgy on the band then everyone will know that they are watching a horror movie!"; Soundtrack (note): Okay, but anyone with a keyboard can make a soundtrack these days. Not even finding I started on "Where the hell?" Time, here are a few: Assassin can move at the speed of light - open door actress turn, no one, turns back, there is something sitting in front of him. From now where the killer shows up with a power exercise, a really great one! The filmists get points for at least tuning it in, but I can really believe that the killer took the time to get the power outlet to plug it in. I feel like one of the guards at the beginning of Holy Grail and you mean "Where are you get the power exercise? ". I could go on and off on how bad this movie is but I only have 1000 words. I'll give this 2 out of the ten stars. A star to make me laugh and another star for all the cleansing. Seriously, do not waste your time with this one.
