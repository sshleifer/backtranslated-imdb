OK, but does that make this a good movie? Well, not really, in my opinion there.there is not a lot all recommended it.I found it very slowly, tediously, in fact.it also predictably pretty much in and around .number one and two were a bit as predictable, but not as much. It also felt that this movie was well campy at times, which I did not really think fits this series with the character. Jeff Fahey plays main bad guys in this slice. He is a decent actor, but I felt he played his character too on top.ia guessing that fit with the tone of the movie, which would have been great if I liked the movie.plus, there were some nice many hardware material .Arnold Vosloo returns to the title role, but given little to work and in this movie the movie has not really evolved, as I had hope. This is just my opinion.anyway, for me, while this movie is not abysmal, it is pretty bad.my vote for Darkman III: 3.5 / 5
