A flicker slasher movie, which was born in the early 80's, has a curse on it that has anyone who tries to finish it alive. Years later, a group of film students tried to fill the movie - also withstand the cursed cursing films. Great ideas for a movie, but sadly 'Cut' is just another opportunity wasted. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately Australia has not had the best record in the track world when it comes to horrors. 'Razorback' (1984) was an out and out dude as it was 'Holwing III' (1987), which was half an American movie anyway. As for our plot of comedy-horror, 'body dissolved' (1993) is best left to forget. The problem with 'Cut' is that the musicians are trying to create a clever horror a 'Call' (1996), but there is no insight into the genre or what it does. And although this strange sounds say this about a slasher movie but what 'Cut' really lacks is any "heart". Ensure it follows the basic "rules" established by 'scream' but does not want to play with the formula, rather it goes for a cardboard card at the earliest. <br /> <br /> The assassin, Scarman, is probably one of the most boring villains and charity in horror film stories. Its endless damslike dams, lame one-material would make the dialogue in a porn looks like Shakespeare. The cast does not seem like fully involved and look like just waiting for a shot to be on so they can collect their paychecks. And the feeling of the movie is like it's deliberately trying not to climb; looking more like an episode of 'Neighborhood' or 'Heartbreak High'. By the way, people who try in MTV style, hyper-movies during the "search" sequence just look lame, dated and out of place. <br /> If Australia ever gets a chance to make horror again (which I hope we always do) maybe we should take a leaf out of the book 'Mad Max' (1979). Instead of trying to copy the US we should try to take our own on the genre.
