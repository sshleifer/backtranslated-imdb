I confess to have a feeling of uncomfortable feeling on movie ghosts, and while I sometimes enjoy the genre when it comes to horrors, but when it comes to comedy, they really need to be crazy to be funny. 'Over his body' seems to take a little too badly, and fails in my opinion from almost any aspect I can think about. The story is completely incredible in course, and did not succeed to convince me either in the comic or in the sentimental register. Choices of actress princesses were terrible. While Paul Rudd is at least beautiful and looks like a nice guy, the taste of ladies in her character seems to be serious improvements as Eva Longoria looks too old (sorry) for her, and Lake Bell looks too unpleasant (sorry yet). A romantic story unreasonably good enough for romance is due to failure at the beginning. Jason Biggs and Lindsey Sloane were actually the best but they only supported their role. The rest is refreshing and uninspired, with flat cinematography and cheap gaming borrowing from unsuccessful TV comedy. There is nothing really worth seeing, nothing to remember.
