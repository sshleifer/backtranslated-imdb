Just so that your fellow movie fans get points on this movie, I decided to write another review. I missed a few things out recently ... <br /> <br /> First, the script. Second, act. Thirdly, Jesus Christ had thought to make a piece of rubbish like this and then wait to enjoy it when there is no feature redeeming any from the beginning to end, except when Joseph Fiennes finally gets nod to a more complicated unlimited ... <br> <br /> I can not believe I wasted my money on this when I could give it to a homeless person or a busker or something! <br /> <br /> Are you getting the picture?
