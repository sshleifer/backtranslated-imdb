Well, I was bored and decided to see this movie. But I think the main thing that brought this movie down was that there would be an hour of footage, then basically the same hour repeated 4 times. It consists of 1. Gathering troops and discussing the attack plan, 2. Flakeboarding of the men's wife 3. The approach of troops is walking in a long line 4. Men rush up hills and shoots, usually first shot At the top then 3 others saved him. 5. Defeat of the enemy and call at base to say success 6. Male flashing back to wife and singing 10 minutes. That was the basic movie, and the same order of events happened about 4 or 5 times. and every time he did a flatback wife, he would show the man, then his wife and him. There were about 10 people or more that would have a flashback so this took tons of time. Otherwise, the men could not kill their enemies except with either Bayonets or grenades. I liked the music and had a lot of action, though the action was repetitive. In general, I probably did not want to see her again, but it was not too terrible.
