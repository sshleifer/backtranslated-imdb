I love bad shots movies. I really do. I laughed over them. and the channel was sufficient to have a marathon in them, culminating in the prime minister of the new original pictures, hammer: shark frenzy. Based on the forecasts, it looked like it was going to be a lot of fun. Essentially is a remake of Benchley's creature, really. He was preferred by a show of Shark Attack 3: Megalodon, which is hilarity shark movie at its best. I was in the mood; I was ready to go. bring it on, hammerhead-crazy-scientist-man! Oh, God, was that movie movie. <br /> <br /> evil, evil, harm. <br /> <br /> sick. trese. MESSE UP. <br /> This is the theoretical repetition of its worst, my friends. when a girl drugs-out carried out to stop animation and attach to a screaming table itself off because the shark-human hybrid fetus "the absolutely crazy scientist" deliberately implanted in his belly wants out ... Jesus monkey. That's what I call disturbing. <br /> <br /> That's really how the scheme works: hmmm, thought the mad scientist. My son died of cancer, but I did it back to life by combining her DNA with that of a math shark, because sharks do not succumb cancer and cats more reproduced through plasenta. oh, look! a perfect amphibian tea! I created the next evolution of the human race! I KNOW! let's make it reproduce! but to show whether all these young sharks did not have my son's blood; instead of violating the hot beards I keep sending in her small forest paradise and hold her food. but check this! Among the random people who are, in the way of some important twist, ended up on my research island, is the woman who was my son engaged before he died! I bet it will do it! All this leads to a very touching and sincere reunion: woman: you're going to impregnate me? Crazy scientist: no. he is. (indicates rotten shark-man in tanks) how sweet. <br /> Do not make this film. all the time.
