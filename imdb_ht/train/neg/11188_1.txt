This is really the worst movie I've ever seen. Ever. Period. I actually paid Â£ 3.50 to watch this tiddy thief in a movie. Incredibly dull, wrong acting, direct script, often incoherent and too many scenes that do not seem to be of importance to the film in general (as when Heath Ledger's priesthood partner was nailed to a wall by a ghost ... what was The point at this stage? Answer on a postcard please ...) <br /> I should have a medal for sticking to this movie for it ever running. I'd rather take a big kick in the weight than sitting in this movie again. <br /> <br /> This should be thrown in under the IMDb 100. Hopefully my vote 1/10 will help him on his way.
