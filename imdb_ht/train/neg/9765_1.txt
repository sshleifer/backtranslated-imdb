I do not but out "people" often, but if there was a movie that deserves this sort of attention, it's "Gaz!" This is self indulgence that arises in some of the ambiance of M * A * S * H ​​and falls completely flat on its face in the attempt. <br /> I see what Corman went for - Malcolm Marmorstein and Elliott Gould tried to reproduce the role of Deathless Gould in the original movie version of M * A * S * H ​​with a similar plot (in the film " Whiffs "- watch it here at IMDb, http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0073891 / for more info). Marmorstein and Gould were closer to Brass rings and "Whiffs" than Corman made with "Gas!" but did not quite get there. Neither one of these films was even close to success M * A * S * H. <br /> What's wrong with "Gaz!"? What is not? No one comes close to really acting at a higher level than junior high school theater. The production values ​​feel. Another person here mentioned great light regeneration on a car getaway, and there's more to lack of attention to detail. There is nothing that works in the way it is supposed to be in this film, and nobody cares. <br /> "Gas!" actually put me to sleep. It's not a sure cure for insomnia but really close. On the Cinematic Sleep Disability scale, "Gas!" dropped somewhere between "Last Year in Marienbad" and George Clooney's renewal of "Solaris" (which itself was remarkable for being more boring than the original mosaic, although familiar looks like this studio and the idea to keep the audience's attention judicial correction). <br /> <br /> Judicious correction would have to despise "gas!" about twenty minutes. The result would be meaningless, but no more than the original movie. <br /> <br /> Some of the films are so bad that they have a compelling quality that they are worth seeing every way. This is not one of them. Do not waste your time. It's not even amusingly bad.
