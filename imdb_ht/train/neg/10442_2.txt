All internet buzz aside, this movie was terrible God. I hope the movie to be more of a farce than anything. Instead the movie makers tried to make a serious film / movie horror, and they completely missed. There were only a few good parts, and a good couple line by Samuel Jackson. Otherwise, it was a bunch of Gore and some animated snakes. Everyone in the internet plays it was miles better than the current movie. Now that the movie is actually out, hopefully this joke will die. Do not waste your time or money on this hyped garbage. If you are looking for something that's funny and funny, then just go to Snake on a Blog.
