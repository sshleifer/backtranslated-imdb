Gayniggers from outer space very beautifully summed up by its name. Running only 27 minutes time, she described a spaceship of gay nuts that came to Earth to free men from women. While I see a little meaning in the plot, it is also really logical. Granted, it means to be a comedy / parasite on society and science fiction. I found myself laughing several times, so he succeeded. <br /> <br /> The special effects are terrible. When the spacecraft is floating above the Earth, you can see the star pulled for no apparent purpose. Asteroids are shown at the beginning of fake look, the equipment on the ship is logical, there are several missiles in the text, the actors are compelling, the characters are messed up; In general, the whole thing does not take seriously. If you get past all the aspects that make it a bad movie, its extremely accessible and easy to see up to the end. Some parts are hilarious. But in general, the only thing that you are leaving to remember is that it was one of the most ridiculous concepts ever. <br /> Look at it a short film and it has some funny aspects, it's not the worst thing to see. But its logic and keeping little long-term value. I can not really recommend it; If you look it, do this for the unique concept, not the quality.
