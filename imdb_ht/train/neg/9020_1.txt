I mistaken myself to wake up late last night watching this. On the only thing I could say good about this typing movie is that it could be used by movie school to show how not to make a movie. No proper character development, wait, I'm not even sure of being character. Set-ups are hokey and inanimate, and the overuse of cracked screens has been wasted since sometimes they could not even synchronize with alternate shots. If I could give this a zero or less rating I would. Unfortunately, it's not even worth the time for a few laughs. It's just a sad example of money wasted by Hollywood, and now I waste my time even thinking about it.
