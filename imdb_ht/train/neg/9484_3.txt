If I have to give this movie a note on a linear scale, then I must give it a low score of 3/10. But it was fun, and there are several good things to say about movie cameras James Bishop will be assigned to hospital St. Andrews for his resident, and exits and eager to "change the world". Since the beginning of the movie you know that the hospital conceals an evil truth, but James thinks it can make a difference and do not recognize this evil. <br /> <br /> The story builds fairly well, you know ever since there is a truth in what patients are saying about some bad resident, and wonder when and how James will discover this. Also when the break comes, James is in a way eased by the evil, and you feel some suspense until the "fight" is over. Add an innocent girlfriend to the worst possible weather with other standard horror elements, and you get the picture. <br /> <br /> The rally character is actually fairly good, you are featured in most of the people who die, some of them "get to know". <br /> The movie sets an unpleasant scene, this also makes fairly well. There are mysteries that reveal - in an acceptable way. The main character, James is very credible - the story of a student's desire to start working is good in this environment. /> What is the film's death is: * Stupid special effect - a modern version of "Plan 9 from outer space" -type bad (the evil monster looks like a purple scar) * Some bad act (or probably very few take when filming) - The main characters sometimes act seriously, and somtimes good. * Sound is at very cheap times. <br /> I kept thinking "I could make a movie like this with my home video camera" throughout the movie.
