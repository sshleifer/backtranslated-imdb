Ft. This movie started out in an interesting way, but quickly ran the gamut from the dull confusion. The confusing parts arrived mostly at the beginning, where the cuts off are so much difficult to say just what's going on for the first twenty minutes or so. The strain comes later, with a romantic spell between the two living people (the two chariots). The vengeful spirit of the dead girl is actually the most lively person in the movie, which is sad. If the rest of the cast was up to his caliber, the film might have been better. <br /> <br /> Maybe. Because the scenario becomes really interesting for a while, as it appears that the mom priesthood mother of the deceased old-year-old girl is trying to resurrect her daughter from the dead, and the desire to unreasonably unnecessarily All of the dead people would return as well, take on solid human form, and most likely start killing everyone. A sort of Japanese mysterious night of this dead dying quality. But that does not happen. Even though this priest will spread with a basket of his own to tell the refreshing youth that this will happen if the priest finishes his ceremony, he does so only with the deceased only who is his daughter. No rising mass of the deceased, no army of corpses, nothing. The priest merely makes the girl's spirit come back to the land of the dead, getting washed out of the wuss of a companion with him, just as he would break his spine like fragile nuts (to which point I was tempted to cheer loudly, like This idiot goes on kissing and fondle the dead girl, ewwww !!!). Robbie Robbins, the best friend does not have a long introspective shot at the end while leaving the village for the last time, and that's it. There is no real horror, no real creepiness, which Japanese tend to do far better than American movie makers and the emphasis on cheesy face over-the-top make-up, no screaming mimis. I was very disappointed.
