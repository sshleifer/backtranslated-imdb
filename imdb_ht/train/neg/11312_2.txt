This movie deserves credit for its original approach. It combines elements of theater, film, and seasonal sex history. Unfortunately, it fell flat on all levels. The biggest failings films are it's unwillingness to commit anything; It contains camp elements, moral elements, and elements without ever committed in any of them. As for the story itself, Chretien of Troyes revolving around his grave in this terrible adaptation that becomes lovable, unbearably innocent of Percival in a most ungolatable and crude churl. <br /> <br /> Most likely the types of people will see this, francophiles or arthuriophiles. Speaking as one of the letters I found the unwatchable movie with an incredibly discounted, disrespectful treatment of a beautiful story.
