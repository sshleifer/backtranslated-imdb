DOC SAVAGE: The Man in Bronze (1 outta 5 stars) <br /> <br /> Large fry, fruity fritters ... based on the magazine pulp / Paperback by Lester Dent / Kenneth Robeson ... on a super heroic adventure hero of the '30s and his five assistants, all experts in some fields of endeavor to fight off evil. It was a series of hokey series ... but liked to have fun when I was a teenager. I knew they had made a movie version of the '70s, starting Ron (Tarzan) Ely ... but I never had a chance to see it. He never played in theater where I lived and never showed up on TV. Now I've finally seen the movie I can understand why. The plot and the characters never treat seriously ... it's all kind of tongue-in-cheek and campy ... such as the old Batman TV series ... only without the benefit of being funny. .. or have any visual flair. Corny dialogue, hit special effects, mute stereotypes, creamy action scenes and bad, bad acting. Actually, I find it a fascinating kind of bad thing ... what might they have thought? Arnold Schwarzenegger was rumored to be starting in a modern-day rumor ... but I did not imagine that would have come out better.
