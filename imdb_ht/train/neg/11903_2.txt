Wenders was great with Million $ Hotel.I do not know how he came up with this movie! The idea of ​​providing the situation after spt11 and looking at the American Society of Hope, making it 2 out of ten. But this is not a movie. Is that a better person can do with a great idea (western conflict east) .There is important thing to go on in the middle of east and it is just given on the screen of a MAC * with the fingers of an American girl that is actually at the level of sort (because it is just ignorant on the facts) .The characters are not well formed. And the most important thing is the idea that giving and religion is somehow funny to me. At the end stage Lana says to allow just to quiet and try to listen. And the background music says "... I will pray." The thing is not about religion actually. But it ends with this. How you will see the truth if you just close your eyes and prayers. Lights are already shining on the truth. It's just that nobody wants to see it. PS: "My house is not a place. It's human" The only thing that gets 10 out of 10 is that phrase. But it is wasted behind this movie. (By the way, as "someone" mentioned below, Americans finest young men are not finest, they are just the "poor" and "hopeless" who register for the army who need good checks that do not give in government!)
