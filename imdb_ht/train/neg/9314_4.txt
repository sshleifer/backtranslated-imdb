Well ... in general, this movie was pretty much worthless, and it's basically a horror movie that ended up being a comedy. I just rented this movie last night when I and my friends went to blockbuster looking for a scary movie. This definitely was not what we were looking for, but it meets us for humor. The actors in this movie (especially Brandon) are so fake that it's funny. And especially that Tracy Girl every time she's riding up the room tells the clown to go. They show almost no emotions and it's just so obvious they are acting. Also, when the clown is looking through the black box of paper with Mark's trim, he does not even look like it was scary even though the clown like it grabbed him and started to attack him. And seriously, would you just be jogging if you were chasing down? I might sprinting for my life! (Though anyone could possibly overlook that clown because it is like 300 pounds.) Not to mention that the effects are not that great, like any time the clown chops off Susan's head in the jungle, Each time she launched herself in the upstairs room with Denise and Tracy each time Denise launched the head back on. Also like in the previous commentary, the beginning makes absolutely no sense and I do not even see why it was even included in the movie. So, what was this movie being made in 2003? The music made it sound like it did in the 1980's, and the camera-ing (?) Do not even really look professional. Half of the time, it seems like the camera can not even stay fixed when it is supposed to be. In general, I should say I enjoyed the movie. I would not recommend it though if you're trying to find something to scare you, but if you're looking for something maybe the fun or get a laugh out of, I'd recommend it sure.
