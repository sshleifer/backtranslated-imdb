The above title is used to present the movie "Gen" to its audience. There is about a young doctor (Doga Rutkay) and a sick mother. The movie begins and leaves her mother behind to start her new job. While driving, we realize that it is not closed home as the hospital is in a remote area. As soon as he steps into the garden of the hospital, he sees the body death of a patient. This is the beginning of a nightmare for the next few days. <br /> <br /> Two policemen come to the hospital for investigating the suicide. In fact, they will have to stay in the hospital because all roads are cut due to weather conditions. All communications and outside worlds are off. There is no way out !! In those days, there will be more nasty killings. Now everyone suspects from each other. <br /> In my opinion, the idea is brilliant. It could be very scary indeed. There are positive sides in the film of course. I really like the start of the movie. Especially, when he drives to the hospital and his first time at the hospital. Actions are okay. Some of them are trying too hard to be mysterious and scary though. I think that the final shock should be spread in the movie. What I say is, it was a good twist but instead of showing it as a parody in the end, we should have realized that came when we see what's going on. The director needs to explain it all together that I think did not work well. Also the most dangerous patient in the movie is supposed to be at least 48 years old but his body looks young and fit for someone who spends most of his life in this hospital. Lastly, I would like to say a few things about the director. I'm sure it will improve. This is his first attempt. I recently found that it is only 21 years old. This made me feel more positive about her and her future film. I'm not going to rate this movie * from ***** though.
