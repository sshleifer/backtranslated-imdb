A spoiler. <br /> <br /> What three words can you guarantee a horrible movie? Cheap Canadian production. THE FOOD fits the words perfectly. Horrible scriptures, exotic acting and special effects make this a must for every movie fan BAD. The hunger is hilarious. The post production team looks like it happened. What makes the brain admirable is in the second half, it actually tries to be good! Does a bit of intelligence and consistency save what is already a joke? <br /> It's around Christmas time. A mother and daughter were murdered by one of the funniest villains. The following day, a rebel young man joins enough trouble as he sent for a psychiatric analysis. If a junta is cut off with a bloody stranger and an ax without telling you some kids did it, whom would you believe? What starts as funny and tedious turns to the end when the brain tries to be serious. A child can not be frightened by fear pace. The brain is too funny a concept to try and be fearless. The psychological research institute is larger than larger manufacturing plants! Our wicked pests and their coordination get credit for pulling some of the worst act I've seen. Stealth videos are readily advised.
