What can I say about Intent 2? Well, I can say in all honesty, I'll only watch this movie again if I attach to a chair and have my eyes open-orange-style mechanisms. <br /> <br /> Robin Dunne movie in 'star' No, I never heard of him either), whose terrible impression of Ryan Phillipe made me cringe at all. In a case of terrible casting, Dunne attempts (and failed) bring in a beautiful charisma, chic. Since the actor is not beautiful, neither charismatic nor spacious, the character is left completely incredible. Amy Adams, (she was in an episode of one buffy time), trying to pick up where Sarah Michelle Gellar leaves and brings Katherine in life ... However, Adams is not a good actress and her performance was flat and Missing of any real emotions, often it looked like it read cue card just to cameras. There were two good actors in the movie however, Barry Flatman (Saw 2 & Saw 3) and Mimi Rogers (Mrs Kensington of Austion Power), made very good and fun performances as the parents of Sebastian and Katherine and the reason only why I rated the movie as a 2, not a 1. <br /> <br /> The movie itself is a poor version of the original, and these allow as carbon copy of dialogue and mimicked the missing scenes scene the previous movie. <br /> I think as a TV show, it might have worked, but if it was regrettable to those who might actually act in the main parties.
