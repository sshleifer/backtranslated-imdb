Now I've seen a lot of bad movies. I like bad movies. Especially movies bad actions. I saw (and enjoy) all Jean-Claude Damme's movies, including one in which it is his own script, both of them where he plays twins, and all three where he is a cyborg. I actually own one of the places he plays a fashion designer and has a fight in a full durians truck. (Hey, if nothing else, he's got a big ass and you almost always get to see it. With DVD, you can even pause and pull!) That's why you can trust me when I am says that this movie is so bad, it makes plans 9 look like Kane citizens. <br /> All about snake eater is bad. The plot is bad. The script is bad. The bad compositions. Battle is bad. Exhibitions are bad. FX are bad. The act is spectacularly, earth-long-bending bad, very likely to show off the worst performance of every so-called actor in the cast, including Lorenzo Lamas, and that's really telling something. And I should want to bet all those involved with this film is disgusting to bed, in boots. SPECIAL Lorenzo Lamas. <br /> It is managed to be unwittingly funny, so it's not a total loss. However, I recommend that you watch this movie only if you are either a congenital or very stupid, very stony. I could sit through it myself because I needed to look something to distract me from rinse urine cats from my laundry. <br /> It did not help much, but it was better than anything. A point for Ron Palillo's casket as a gay arsonist.
