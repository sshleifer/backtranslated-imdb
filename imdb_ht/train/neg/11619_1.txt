I watched the whole movie, waiting and waiting for something actually happened. Maybe it's my fault to expect evil and horror instead of psychology? Is it a strange re-tell in the mythical myth: I want to kill my father and mother and marry my uncle and composer music with him? I did not understand why some scheme elements were even present: why was the upper house construction, why there were big stairs and a perfect spot for someone falling into bankruptcy if no one actually was going to do that, why Have the scenes at all with the dad at work, why have such a nice kitchen if you're just going to eat outfit, why would the boy want to be baptized and parents must be the same ones instead of the other way around. I see lots of good reviews for this movie ... have my taste been corrupted by going with 70s b-cinema and old sci fi cics?
