I love the time period, I love the attempt, but watching a movie that looks like I look at it in a coke bottle gives me a headache. If I have played computer games that have been this cloudy and out of focus, I would improve my computer. Could that this was looked at the director was after, but not so it hurts the eyes and you want to leave after 10 minutes. If I did not take someone with me this movie, I was out there. Though it was a series and not a movie for each said, the Band of Brothers accomplished this. They made it look like WWII feet, and just a touch of pills, but it was always a pleasure to look. Movies need real people, and real sex, and real places; Use CGI when appropriate, not for an entire movie.
