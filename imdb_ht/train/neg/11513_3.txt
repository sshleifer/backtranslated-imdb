* May contain crowds * <br /> <br /> I bow down to be just this movie. I knew she was playing Madonna. I knew he lasted a whole week of theater. I knew he got a lot of bad reviews. I did not expect a deeply and thoughtful examination of class, culture and sexuality as we received from the original Italian. The benefit of the doubt lasted one whole minute. Madonna plays a rich, firefighter, naughty Gorgon who goes on vacation with her henpecked husband and flippant friends (the brunette woman is as bad as Madonna, showing some really dumb expression. Adriano Giannini plays the first-mate boat that the Madonna character delights in humiliating and treated as dirt in each scene they have together. Why is it like a bitch? Simply because the scheme requires it so later when two of them get marooned on a Mediterranean Desert Table will turn and will teach it a lesson. Just as inexplicable is how they fall in love despite nothing in common and they have been abusing one another for two thirds of the movie. <br /> <br /> "Sweep away" is a funny, simplistic, superficial movie from the beginning of the end. Madonna provides a usually wooden performance. There are many dumb scenes: Madonna sings and dances at the request of Giannini, a fantasy scene with Madonna and a lot of scenes where he hits him and kicks him into the butt. Guy Ritchie makes it "stylish" editing that is ridiculous here. The movie has some of the worst dialogue I've heard in a major movie in many years. The finish is tricky and implausible. It's basically the "Blue Lagoon" meets "More" less the nudity of the former and humorous sense of the letter. <br /> <br /> Maybe Madonna's month is so great that she insists on continuing to prove himself as a competent actress. Please give it, Madge, for us just like you. This is not his worst movie though. This distinction is still part of "Shanghai Surprise". He did nothing worse than that ... again.
