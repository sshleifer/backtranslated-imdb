A BDSM "sub-culture" in Los Angeles serves as a set for this low budget and chaos to build chaos, a square worth a piece of value for its top-bill, Celia Xavier, who also produces and scripts while is doing a double role as Vanessa sister Vanessa and Celia. A question soon develops as to whether some rather imoderat cameras, lighting and pyrotechnics corrections can ever reach a point in connection with a weak and often incoherent narrative that will not be taken seriously by a sensible viewer. Celia was employed as a highly motivated probe officer for Los Angeles County, while her twin evil became an iconic figure in her fetishist world largely because of erotic performance on CD-ROM, but when disaster struck "Mistress Vanessa" Veteran Celia, is determined to stretch his vicious attacker, starting a new job as a "sex slave" at the private castle club where the home specialty is a "dungeon party". FBI's agent (Vanessa's official deployment is officially required due to his involvement with BDSM web site), in addition to a detective Los Angeles police detective, is assigned to investigate the crime, while trying to provide security for Celia With highly enthusiastic performance in its new vocations it is avidly adequate to consider by its customers as they create conditions of personal danger for it. The flaws of logic and continuity are numerous, such as a homicide that has been allocated to operations-South Bureau L.A.P.D., a region of the distant metropolis removed from the environment of the film. Direction is focused and does not help by irrigation post-production correction and sound reproduction. The gymnastics mentioned photography are unleashed with a batting mount near the end of the movie before the foot is but tangently referring to the scenario. A major turn acting appears in the middle of this slag: Stan Abe as an agent FBI wing.
