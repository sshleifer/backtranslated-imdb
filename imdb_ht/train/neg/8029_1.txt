a friend I bought this (very pricey) and decided to give it to me as a birthday gift. I thought I never looked it 'cause I knew it was a joke and the cover of the DVD looked pathetic, but then my friends and I got really bored and watch it. from start to finish! I know quite an accomplishment but it really is a masterpiece. it is difficult to describe. You should see it, it is a real lesson about what people can be when they think they are creative and smart and really are not. The "act" is sub-terrain (you can actually see the "leading lady" street on some occasions, it's definitely the worst). The "story" is stupid to be summed up and really everything in this film sucks. Please pay special attention to the "sheriff". The guy is an adult and chapter has absolutely no excuse to be involved in this. it is very bad as well. whatever it did to have some hilarious moments. check it out, haha
