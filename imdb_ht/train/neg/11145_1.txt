Where to start ?! . . . I feel ... raped! What's right, raped! I just spent 1.5hrs in my life, 1.5hrs that I could have spent doing something more useful, like watching dry paintings, on this horror film called. <br /> It's not scary, it's not funny, its not dramatically, its actions, nothing it ... <br /> <br /> Its predictable, boring, its tragic ... <br /> I might come in a bit harsh here, but watch this movie and you'll feel the same way ... or ... no, do not look it ... unless you want feel violated too.
