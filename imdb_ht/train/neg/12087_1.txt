I've seen all sorts of "Hamlet" s. <br /> <br /> Kenneth Branagh was the most ambitious, Mel Gibson was quick and at the point, Laurence Olivier was the best - but down. But now, we come to the Bard Maximilian Schell. <br /> For one, this is an armed version of a German TV production of William Shakespeare's revered chestnut. But if there is a slower, more plodding, more lethargy and worst-scenes version out of place, it must be acted at the grade level. <br /> <br /> Did you see it on MST3K help, and Mike and the robots take jolly good jabs of the old boy, punctuating the black and white TV depth, Shakespeare and the wisdom (?) in German acting an English play and making it look like an Ingmar Bergman rejected. Of course, the best parties are the MST RST. Best Line? "I'll settle the Great Dane," "I do not think so," burst, "" Meet the Beatles, "" Hey, Dad, you'll help me with my science project, "and, my favorite personal, party - "Keillor's Garrison leaves Germany (YAAAY !!)" But then there are Schell, playing the greatest Shakespeare's character as a lack of department store would not only be as expressive. Big actor, but here it comes on as well as Paul Newman in the "Silver Chalice." Ever seen one? You GOTTA look at those on a double box! <br /> In the end, this It's an example where it's true that you are best to just read the book, at least the book is not dubbed by Ricardo Montalban, a star only for this "Hamlet"; ten stars, of course, for the version of MST3K. <br /> Good night, not-so-sweet masterpieces.
