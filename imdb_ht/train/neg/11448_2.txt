Does not mean that this movie is as bad as 'Perfect Stranger', but it just was not funny. He could not stick to one kind of comedy - he jumped out of SNL, Adam Sandler-esquire, in romantic, to little guy big scores, slapstick, in the 'films' (film) kind of comedy. Although there were some very slapstick moments (the fall down the hill), no one was very particularly funny or exceptional in any way. 'Schindler's List' was funnier (and felt shorter). You never knew if Andy Samberg was supposed to be in high school, college deportation, or just a deficit living in her home with her mother - Sissy Spacek, at her worst choices. And poor Ian McShane, the serious actor if I was only in the name of one, given his crap in the camera. The storytail shooter and completely predictable up to and including the end (no defurator here in the case of Adam Samberg's mother wants to see it). Do not spend any money that will see this movie, and perhaps Lorne Michaels will get the hint and start producing quality (Yes, Wayne World and Tommy Boy are quality).
