Little Mosque is one of the most boring CBC comic ever seen. They have a way of producing simple comedy programs to be the oldest-easiest-viewing viewer for CBC to mean 85-year-old farmer in Saskatchewan. The jokes are all predictable and thus lame death I can not believe it. Performances are very hostile and acting but I do not blame the actors since these kind of one-dimensional stereotypes are probably exactly what the CBC requires and requires. Very lame shows and bad jokes tried to present as controversial "controversial" assets and less controversial than other funny CBC comedies such as the Hour 22 minutes, Royal Canadian Air Farce and Rick Mercer's Report.
