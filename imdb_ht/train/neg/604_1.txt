I was so disgusting to this film, and I felt compelled to warn others. This movie has no history, draw or hint of purpose. The movie begins after the standard "allowed scary" intro movie, which by now every movie surveillance has become accustomed. So we can ignore the beginning completely. We are soon presenting the main actress and at this point it becomes clear of all you've just wasted hard you've earned and it would be best to look static. (Unless you've seen white noise - EEK) Acting is a DISCRACE and all of them should return to the mime to travel from where they came. After saying that, even the best actors in the world would struggle to make this film remotely look can. Poor performance simply contributes to the disaster. Nonsense violence and what I can only assume is the word written in another writer up the "unique" writer, who probably considers himself an artist, has caused a movie that will test your patience. It was not until my fellow witnessing came back to me, saying, "We watched this for 45 min" I realized that this film was as thin and tasting as a cup of tea without a bag. Clearly something was missing and unfortunately it was not the audience. Rather than suggest that the movie is missing, let me tell you what it has: blonde mute (surprise surprise), victim, bad-monster-guy-stuff, about 2 minutes of scenario that is stretched over hours, days, weeks, months ... and credit. Want a silver lining? Well, the blonde girl is a little saucy looking at some of the scenes, but expect to want to see her face tear off for the rest of the movie!
