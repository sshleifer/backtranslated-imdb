I was excited to discover this late sixty comedy starring some of my favorite people - Maggie Smith, a very young Bob Newhart and, of course, Peter Ustinov. My disappointment was so composed to discover the film does not work as either a comedy or a perfect movie heist. Ustinov plays a momentous flight just out of jail that sets his site on a large American-based corporation in London. Bluffing his past dimwitted CEO Karl Malden with Geek Newhart technology, Ustinov spent himself on as a computer expert and subsequently plans the 'perfect heist' of the movie. To do this, he needs to find a security security system that mainframe corporation guards. And here is one problem. Its perfect plan only works because everyone else in the movie is considerably believed and stupid. His blame scrutiny was taken at nominal value and this should be the computer center only anywhere by harassing and video cameras. The second problem is the heist (really fraudulent) happening in the first 30 minutes of the movie robbing the rest of the picture in many ways in dramatic tension. Maggie Smith is sadly miscast as the next Ustinov wine next to the fee / secretary who just can not hold a job. I like Maggie Smith but it just looks too much here, too composed, the party called for more of a mad, physical comedy. In addition, Ustinov and Smith have no chemistry together, maybe it's the age difference, but the patient's romantic relationship, as devoid of current romance as it is, always comes to a little climb. Ustinov co-writes the script, and she thinks well at the time, but I found it unfunny, shed with a sad garb of a great cast.
