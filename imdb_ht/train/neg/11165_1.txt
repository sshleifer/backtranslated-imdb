I mean, really ... either I suddenly lose my sense of humor or this is just a really bad movie. It's stupid, ridiculous and just not funny at ALL. <br /> Since I've seen the preview I knew it was not going to be a big movie, I just did not think it was going to be bad. .. <br /> <br /> What happened to the old times when you could find smart funny lines in any movie? When the actors did not have to play ridiculous roles in trying to be funny. Now we find ourselves with movies like this one, Borat, Little Men, Scary movie 4 where I could not get the funny parties !! <br /> Just skip this piece of waste <br /> PS (sorry for my english)
