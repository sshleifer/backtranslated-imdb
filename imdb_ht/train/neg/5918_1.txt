Carl Panzram has lived an amazing life and scribbled down his memory on scratches of paper for possibly the only person who never done anything sinister for him. The book "The Panzram: A Journal of Murder" by Thomas E. Gaddis and James O. Long, which came from the best part of a century after Panzram's death, provided the historical context of a first-generation American counterpart in running away Home goes to the west and be a cowboy, getting caught, dropping into the boy's house, getting away repeatedly and thrown into prison over and over all the time getting tortured and sodomized. As Panzram grew strong and strong, he sought to take revenge for the wrong done as he traveled to South America, Europe and Africa, and he did not matter who he was raped, robbed, or kill because we are all equally worthless. This movie projects thin James Woods as a rough neck, meaning the donkey son of a Carl Panzram bitch who is in the movie is a "drunk", overly dramatic and emotional, and never mentioned the joy of sodomizing men and toddlers boys. The film neither elaborated on anything else particularly of notes on world travelers and career captives (such as former Tehran President Taft or being released from prison in Oregon as long as he gave his word back). In short, I do not think Carl would be too happy.
