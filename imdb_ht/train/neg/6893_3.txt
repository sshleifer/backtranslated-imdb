I had high hopes for this movie. The theater monologue is great and Nic Balthazar is a very interesting man, with a lot of experience and knowledge when it comes to movies. <br /> I'm a fan of a lot of Belgian movies, but this movie is bad. It's completely incredible that the 34 actors suddenly play their role in adolescents. The "Linguistic Games" was frightening and overhead. Nothing on the movie seemed to be real to me. The finish was way too deusing the machine for me. <br /> I'm very disappointed and thinking I wasted an hour and a half in my life.
