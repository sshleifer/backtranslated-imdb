The film was not a garbage except for some boring scenes in between. But the cast women gave a pretty good show to the men who were mocking. <br /> But Krista Allen really throws in the movie .His voice was so seduced and sexy. The scene in the bed involving Krista would have been shortened, but she did it so watchable and sexier than any one was able to do.Crista really is one of the best in these roles. It also adopts quietly well that baddie in the last 5 minutes, which is the exciting part of the movie. <br /> <br /> Burt Reynolds was not that good and this was not her best as an action star. She could choose a better script than this .Really think she did for money.
