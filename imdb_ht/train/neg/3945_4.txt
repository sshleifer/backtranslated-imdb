My name is Modesty is a low-budget film that tells the story of the origins of Modesty Blaise. It's not that the film is awful, it's just not what I was hoping or hoping for. While I was aware of the Blaise modest character for years, I'm not overly familiar with the funny stripes or the graphic novels, so I come to this movie as something like an outsider. This can be part of the reason for my deception. I waited for more action and more comedy. The movie is driving dialogue. I suppose I was looking for something that has a little more valuable camp. As it is, my name is Modesty is a serious movie death. There are very few, if any, "light" moments. Acting, at least from Alexandra Staden, is unacceptable but nothing is outstanding. As others commented, it appeared a little too vulnerable to be completely credible in the title role. What scene actions have in my name are modesty being one of the weakest points films. I never bought into the notion that this woman could handle a lot of bloodthirsty killers. I really hope Quentin Tarantino goes ahead and makes rumors about a big budget movie based on Blaise's modest character. I am convinced the concept has a lot of potential and I would very much look forward to it.
