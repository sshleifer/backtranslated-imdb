Where to start ... If this movie was a black comedy, I would say it was FANNN-TASTIC! Unfortunately for me, and anyone else who has free time with a buck of reserve (the idea that the price I paid, got it from Wal Mart), this movie was meant to be a thriller . The only salt I received was watching Kirkland's disgust at Anne Wilkes from Misery's senseless wooded woodland area. If you want a good laugh, on a rainy Friday night with some friends, then I highly recommend this movie. But if you want to look something at least half decent, then do not even bother. <br /> Here for one to enjoy the final movie, the worst is the best in most cases. But Wow ... I want WOW! The only person in the whole movie who did not feel it was the little boy, played by Vincent Berry. The only reason why I gave him 3 stars is because he gave me something to do.
