First of all, as a long time student of the Titanic disaster and members of several Titanic clubs, I feel I can comment on the movie. I do not really care how many awards and rewards the movie won, but I still read an absolutely horrible movie. Cameron had the resources to make a 'proper' semi-documentary film in the disaster, but unfortunately chose to turn it into a skin-faced romantic butcher. The fact that many around the world are falling for it only shows, in my mind, the sad state of taste and common sense that movie critics and audiences have these days. Anyone saying that all the movie should have a hero and heroine fell in love? In fact most real events are anything but romantic and the Titanic disaster certainly was not one. I feel that he needs a better script and director who has a semi-documentary approach and as little artistic license as possible. I almost dropping up in the last sequence where the 'dead' lovers encounter among the lost riders and crews that break out of applause. Is it a smart movie? Ask yourself.
