Do not write a script for this outrage trashed! You just sit back and watch a pair of women candles and invites each other to come out before a audience dubbed the "Jerry show"! Violent and obnoxious, this cash-in on the real Jerry Springer program reveals everything that shows the sub-rated show of hyped talk by showing you about the air - unless you have a collection of nonsense videos made by the producers in "cops". Even the outside world of Springerland reveals the most amateur act of the decade! This goes to show you that the GONG SHOW MOVIE has a central character in a motion picture turkey. Change the channel! REVIEWS <br /> <br />
