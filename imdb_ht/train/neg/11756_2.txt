Only children younger than 12 years should be allowed to view this movie. The rest of us should take a book, MP3 player, or just take a nice nap to support the experience of this event. This can be best summed up as a "movie-up" TV movie being distributed in theaters. Children will want to see this movie, and they will love and be amused by the movie.
