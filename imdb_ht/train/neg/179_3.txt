Back to Cabin by the Lake just .... missed. It must have been a very low budget because a fair amount of film has to be filmed with a regular video camera. So at the same scene - you'll have some camera-quality vaccine and simple video camera shots. It makes for a very odd mix! I think they should have found some way to do not make the "video video" type of effect! <br /> I think it is refreshing to see it IF you've seen the original CBTL because then you can compare and see the differences. And if you have not seen the original CBTL .... you'll never want to see it if you see this first one! It will probably seem way too cheese and turn you off from even taking care of the original one.
