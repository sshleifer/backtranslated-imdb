The IMDB Terms of State that you are required to state if your comments are 'frozen'. <br /> Well, this whole movie is something of a spoiler ... a careful story that glorifies what he cautions, a story of lost youth who does not know where he himself is going. > <br /> I just saw this in the tribe movie festival. This movie was not just bad, it was really bad. <br /> <br /> The actor is consistent, the characters are the least clich√© offerings and little depth, and the farnsworth's act was very bad in particular. <br /> from the patronized accents of the useless plot line from elements of 'graphic' place in the rehearsal dialogue and scenario ... it sucks the big one. <br /> I think he was looking for sort of a more orgy, updated 'Cowboy Pharmacy' with a touch of 'natural killers' killer but it is not as sensitive to the characters as the former and no place as shocking (outside some frat level gore) as the ladder. <br /> <br /> More than anything, someone really needs a) edit the scenario <br /> (some things are to be built on and clearly <br /> with a worthy topic. .. if threatened in his tent.) B) edit the movie. If it was cut down to a core, it might be beams. <br /> I would go below 1 if I could ... like maybe kelvin zero.
