What else can you say about this movie, except that it's awful plain.Tina Louise and Adam West are the reason to see this, but that's it, but the talents are wasting in this tunk. I think they used a double in some of Adam's scenes, as when he was running because you could not see his face. If Adam was embarrassed at being in zombie nightmare, just think he should have felt about to appear in this ??? If it was before or after, I'm not sure, but still nightmares zombie is a classic (check out Mystery Science Theater 3000 and first version) compared to this. The gang is very annoying and over-acting by some of actors.Rip-off of the Wild One begins Marlon Brando, of course.Tina looks stunning though. I hope he and Adam got a good check !! Pass!
