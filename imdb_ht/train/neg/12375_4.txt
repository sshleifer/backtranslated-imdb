The good thing about this is at least fresh: Almost there are no movies about dance music and the club scene (if even did) hit the movies. And it also spreads much energy, from the music to the painting in Ibiza. But the main problem is that he can not decide what he wants to be. Although it definitely loves to be a mockumentary in the line of this is Spinal Tackle, the makers also realize they do not want to play copycat. However, it failed aloud about the jokes because it is not very well written and many characters are underdeveloped. And it does not have any arch of its script and is directed to do it in 90 minutes, so why not edit it down to 75? The Department of Production and Movies always try to save the day (like Paul's house). In a strange and unexpected way so all gone Pete Tong works better as a simple drama in the Almost Famous line. Especially the scenes with Beatriz Batarda offer some power to act. <br /> Conclusion: It's a mess, it's a bit fun at a basic level, but you're better than a night at your favorite club.
