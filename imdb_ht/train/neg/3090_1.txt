I really have nothing new to add but I just felt like I was commenting on this bag. So here goes: <br /> <br /> Atrocious. I ran into my MST3K DVD collection again and I just looked at Hobgoblins for the 10th time. It's really, really painful but it's next on the list ... You can see that there's a tiny kernel in a current movie buried under the crap that's "hobgoblins" but it just could not come out. All about this movie is 4th rate. The story, the actor, the effects, women, the "scene actions", ... ahhhh forget it. I can watch a piece of crap such as the "Bloodwaters of Dr Z" (aka "Zaat") on and over and over and hardly any ill effects (I like it in reality- it will be about TCM later this month - October, 2009), but "hobgoblins" is a whole total bullet. <br /> <br /> The worst part of it all can be that it's now about 12 hours after the movie has ended, I had a good night sleep, some coffee and some dry seeds, my medicine, and again the dance music "New Wave" that Amy, Red Shorts, and Laraine Newman frolicking in the living room is still running across my head. This torment will last for days. <br /> <br /> Good luck, will not you?
