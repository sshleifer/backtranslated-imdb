This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I can not express how bad it is. I honestly wanted to kill myself several times in this atrocious experience just to end the pain. I recommend instead to view this film, you bath in acids then you will at least know a fraction of the pain without all of the marks. <br /> I had such high expectations when I read it behind the back of the DVD case, and when at the beginning it added that Jesus followed them I was so excited ... then at the end I wanted to kill myself. I mean a twenty-minute minute introduction of the most annoying characters in the story of the movie ... Just paused! Monkeys could do a better job correction to this garbage. At least they would have to throw feces and some troubles in the trash. It would make it better not to have seen any of the horrors. <br /> <br /> It was not that I did not get jokes, it's that they were not only not funny, they repeated themselves like twenty times. Apparently, something is not funny unless you see it as a million times. <br /> No matter what you see. People have rated 'Manos Hands in Fate' as the worst movie world. I also saw it and agree that it is bad ... but ALAS is just the second worst. The 'bus ride' is by far worse. <br /> This deserves all sorts of harsh languages, but I can not write here so just imagine I swear a whole bunch.
