The plot of 7Eventy 5IVE involves college children who play a game of unlucky phones (unless they are fans of horror) come in to themselves. The story of 7EVENTY 5YW, on the other hand, is that of a horror movie that has a little bit of promise, sadly in writing really bad. <br /> <br /> What could be a pleasure, if a bit is funny, old-fashioned slasher story is ragged early on by its filmmaker seamstress who the audience would like to watch a bunch of loud, rich young bitching with each other for most of the movie's running time. With the exception of a police detective that is played by Rutger Hauer, (in a minor role designed primarily to add only the movie's power movie), each character on the screen is a distinct different kind of young A-hole. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/>. Worse, since the deal deals with a party game goes awry, most of the time the scenes are full of these little ***** *****. Therefore, there is some break for the viewer, who must put up with the angry sniping of the wrong-drawn protagonists. Even though at least some of these are supposedly friends, invariably all characters interact in a very hostile manner, long before any genuine conflict has actually appeared. This leads to the worst possible outcome of a slasher movie: the audience, intending to take care of their conduct, rather than just cheers on the anonymous assassin, but willingness to get started picking up vacu early. > <br /> The real shame of this poor characterization is that otherwise 7Eventy 5yIV actually had some potential. Visually it's fine. First time director Brian Hooks and Deon Taylor know how to build a suspense attitude. They also manage to deliver some competent, if rarer, timely classical 80s-style gore. Surprisingly, casting the output is also justifiable. It's not that the actors can not express real human emotions; It is simply the scenario (co-written by the new Vashon Nutt and Hooks director, who is the best farmer behind the camera than a keyboard) is short in those moments. <br /> <br /> 7EVENTY 5YV can hardly be recommended, as familiar to its familiar and few emotions can not exceed the bad taste left behind by a story driven by a gaggle of unpleasant characters. In this whopunk whodunnit, the real mystery is why anyone should care about a group of popular young people who can not even manage to love each other.
