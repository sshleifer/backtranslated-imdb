If you hate redneck accent, you will hate this movie. But to make it worse, you see Patrick Swayze, who was trying to have a redneck. I really can not stand up to redneck. I love Billy Bob Thornton, it was good at Slingblade, but she was annoying in this movie. And what kind of name is Lonnie Earl? What more hickish can this movie get? The scenario was stupid. I usually do not judge this movie, but I could not stop this movie. If you want a good Billy Bob Thornton movie, go see Slingblade. My mom found this movie for $ 5.95 at Wal Mart ... figure ... I think I'll wrap it and give it my grandmother for Christmas. It could just be that I can not stand redneck accentually, or that I can not stand Patrick Swayze. Perhaps if Patrick Swayze was not in it. I did not laugh at once in the movie. I laugh at anything stupid usually. If they showed that some fingers were breaking, I could laugh. Fingertips are getting crushed by accident still makes me laugh.
