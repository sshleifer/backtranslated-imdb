FilmFour will do a lot better than this little one in a movie if they will get the right sort of reputation for themselves. <br /> This film is filmed in Glasgow (although only a couple of high characters have nothing to approach a Scottish accent). The situation, about people in life will be nowhere, who all meet up in the same cafe in the early hours of the morning as they have night work, are made for a really funny, insightful, original, movie culture. Instead we have a self-obstructed saddos group and a draw that made these bits I suprised it was not forbidden. X and Y are friends. X is sleeping with Z. Y sleeps and z also. Oh you figure it out. <br /> A total waste of time. Poor dialogue - it sounds like something that a group of 16 years old should write for a GCSE drama project. The female character was completely superfluous - just written off as a girl sign in hope that women could cajoled in seeing her. <br /> <br /> If you are the sting of thick boys who laugh at beer ads and they can usually find wandering round of packing crying on Saturday night at center city center indifferent. you will love this movie and find it "a right laff". Everyone else, run, do not walk away from this bad little mystery. <br /> But a question when the group left the boring city Seaside (although Saltcoats did not change the name on the movie), back to Glasgow, WHY they did it through Forton Motorway service in LANCASTER in England?
