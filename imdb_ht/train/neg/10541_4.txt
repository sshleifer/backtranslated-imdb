I jotted down a few notes here on the first power, Lou Lambada Diamond Phillips' 1990 satanic killer yuppie hell-Fest ... <br /> 1) Heavy Diamond Phillips was recently accused of beating his wife and serving the time prison. I only hope he can find Armani prison put in style with: One of the guilty pleasures of this film is seeing his police detective coverage of $ 4500 designer layer, a $ 7300 designer costume designer, and seeing him $ 3500 / Los Angeles Bachelor's backyard galleries and interior design by Mies Van Der Roeh. <br /> 2) Leading Ladies Tracey Phillips has superb porcelain pots, flowing red hair that always looks like soft, with amazing breasts that hi-lit in 2nd half of the movie by a designer designer who sadly stays in place on his torso even when he prepared to be sacrificed to Satan. At least back in the demonized assassin 1970s to strip the victims before they do away with them, though there is something to be said to leave a bit of the imagination. By 10 minutes final of the movie I could think about is what her breasts probably looked like. 3) Professional cyclist living in Los Angeles can pay $ 4 million dollar condos on Mullholland Drive overlooking Los Angeles with a view that would make Brad Pitt decide he was hooked. As a matter of fact the condominium used in this film looks like the same one seen at David Lynch's MULLHOLLAND DR., Which at least had the good sense of making it a resident film director a successful film director. Only professional cyclists I've encountered in this movie are all currently serving prison sentences for wire fraud. <br /> 4) I forgot his name, but the villain of this movie is wonderful, and it's "how it will be, buddy boy?" line might be the best movie neglected since "thank you for the riding , dam !! from CREEPSHOW 2. <br /> <br /> 5) Under major metropolitan cities there are large sinks of simmering acid that will explode in great fireballs if someone launches a lightweight Zippo lightweight to them, which is why large public waterworks plants they all have no sign of smoking plastering all over them though the idea of ​​smoking around water being dangerous is of course impartial. And since Zippo brighters need to be manually filled with lighter fluids that can often flow out and be absorbed by those clothes, the idea of ​​a single carry in the pocket of your $ 7300 Gucci suit will either hit me like much more dangerous. > <br /> 6) The exhibits of this movie are impressive to say the least, and one of the fun things on watching it is to stay up to you that you do not look at computer effective special effects but current stuntpeople life risk and members contributing to a movie that earned almost universal BOMB ratings from critical when released. <br /> 7) satanist movie always amazed me: Here is a guy who has been tapped into Lucifer's offer power, and yet instead of using it to do something as useful as making himself rich or cause fashion models to engage in sex form free with him, and instead owned lady checkers and make them outdoors in the person's apartment. Speaking of who here is an indestructible guy, can fly, and is able to put him in the body of others - and yet he's widespread star Lou Diamond Phillips and an ordinary fistfight in the film's conclusion, yet no good sense to live Arnold Schwartzeneggar or Apollo beliefs to ensure that he has. <br /> and over and over ... to watch the company of wise friends split while consuming beer. You will have fun as long as you refuse to take it seriously. <br /> 4/10
