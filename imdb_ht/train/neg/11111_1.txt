Do not bother to waste your money on this movie. Do not even go to your car and think you might see this movie if anyone else does not appeal to you. If you have to watch a movie this weekend, go see Batman again. <br /> The script was awful. Sometimes written in the movie format of random horror. Given: somewhere in closed space, a fool with various weapons, a curious man who manages to uncover all of the clues that honest police officers can not put together, and a woman innocent and overly curious, yet beautiful and strong and that many of Audiences would like to be able to call their girlfriends. Mix together, add many wrongly executed Gore, and what the hell is to put some phenomena there for a little "turn" into the plot. <br /> <br /> The act was terrible, and the incredible characters - Borat was more credible than this .. <br /> <br /> *** Spoiler *** and you can somebody please tell me 'how a verse's verse can make a bullet ricochet out of the person after being shot without even making those who have flinched ??? I'm in the army. We need that kind of thing for ourselves. <br /> 1 out of 10, and I would put it to the decimals in which rounded up to her the lowest possible score I can.
