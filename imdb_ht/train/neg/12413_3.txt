I will not say that this movie is terrible, because I've seen worse, but it's not even half decent. <br /> <br /> The plot is very confusing. I could not really know what's going on and where things went. When the film ended, I let myself scratch my head. I looked up at the end of the credit to see if they had something after which could clear things, but once the credit was over, that was it. I felt I was jarred from a weak point to another in the whole movie, with little or no transition between the two. <br /> <br /> Character Development Very Deep. I could not figure out when someone was upset or there was a bad one against anyone. I could not tell if half of the characters were just supposed to drink, steal, mentally challenged or they just had a bad actor to show them. This film seems to be based on stereotypes (its credit, it is difficult to avoid when you make a movie on a singer in a rock band), which would make character development easier, since many other films have already illustrated the suffering a child abuse, or attempts at an addictive heroin trying to become clean. Stereotypes are easy to describe, which would explain why many bad films tend to exceed stereotypes. This movie, on the other hand, uses stereotyped characters left and right, but then try to keep them as incomprehensible as possible. <br /> Another problem with the characters is that they seem to be postponed with no explanation. I guess this OK because so little time has passed to develop the characters that I really did not get a chance to know any of them, so I never really missed any of them. <br /> <br /> And last but not least Sadie's song. It is terrible. The music backing up is not prize winner, but it is usually drowned out of the screeches that was released from Sadie's vocal cord. I swear that there is a point in the movie where he sings a song for at least 10 minutes. I seriously thought I would have to turn it around this urle-a-thon. <br /> <br /> As a whole, this movie is confusing. The sick-developing characters, acting to the Georgian wild and stiff, Sadie's character is yanked out of a bad situation in another, with no back story or explanation. The music was unbearable, and I think there is no good reason to view this movie unless you have a thirst for Cinematic pain.
