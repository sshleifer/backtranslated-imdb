Ever since I had eight years I was a big fan of struggles. It did not matter what the federations I watched. WWE, WCW, USWA. For me the action is all I watch it for. <br /> <br /> May 23rd, 1999. That was my 19th birthday. I ordered the Edge and I was just waiting another pay for every lifestyle. But this time. I was guilty. Instead, that was one of the earliest night out of Canada a true man was killed by a stunt going wrong. Not much can you change the situation. But what happened to Owens's death made me very crazy. Rather then end up pay for everybody to see and do the right thing as human beings the WWE decides to protect what comes first and that the money does not keep paying for each look as if Owens's death never happened. <br /> I must tell you. Vince Mchmaon made some stupid decisions in his life but that was by far the stupid decision he ever did. <br /> <br /> And this crap and saying Owen would have wanted to see the straw straw seen to keep going. Give me a break. When a person dies on a paycheck, his sense of humor is stopped. It's like a police officer shot a thief or a mugger with a run and then just let the man die so he can go home and call it a day as if life never counted. matter what's happening. Owen will be missed and thanked for the memories of all the time you gave us.
