Invasion of the Christian Christians would definitely be in "so badly bad" category if the movie was not so sexy or racist. That it is like just making it bad. It has the same type of stereotypical steroids that you have seen in Queen of Exterior Space, and the type of racial stereotypes (in this example, Native American) that you would normally get in thirty & midnight b-west. In terms of being non-comic, the same gay-market-to-the-cave is repeatedly over ten times during this short film short film. Ray has only one good impression of Jimmy Cagney (but he can not do it for two impressions of Cagney in a row, nor does he care for Peter Lorre when he tries it). There is really no production value to talk about, as the "Star Creatures" make Ro Man's from Robot Monster or Tor Johnson in 9 plan from outer space look like the creation of industrial and magic lights. /> This movie was definitely one of a vanguard in what you should call early independent movies ... by artsy enough for those who are theater and not good enough for anything but the latest feature of an all-night drive. /> <br />
