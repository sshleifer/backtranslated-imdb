102 Dalmatians (2000, Kevin Lima) <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />! Things will be fine for Cruella who is busy helping homeless dogs on the street. When the clock hits on Big Ben, things turn bad. The hypnotic healing is reversed and Cruella is back, and this time it is determined that the spotted clothing he always wanted. <br /> <br /> Glenn Folds her role as Cruella de Vil and once again is the film record. Every scene with him is worth seeing at the end of this dull, which feels more of a repeat of the previous movie, rather than a new story .. It has changed. ?? Ken Sheperd (John Gruffudd)
