Nothing will ruin a movie as much as the combination of a poor script and the poor direction. This is the case with the "tomb of the mummy." The script is the idea of ​​resting from older, better universal cops such as "Dracula" and "Frankenstein." The direction is trite and stale. The act is mediocre. Even the Khari Chaney is weak compared to Tom Tyler's "Hands The Mummy," and the producers are crazy enough to add footage from Christy Cabanne to vastly better prequel and point up the weakness of their own movie! to realize how this film was, and essentially remade it from scratching two years later as the "Ghost Mummy" with a better script and best director. The result was the best film of the movie "Momi" film, although not anywhere near as good as Karl Freund's original 1932. <br /> <br /> The Foot Cabanne raises this movie to a 3. The "new" thing is a 2 of the best. Dick Foran and Wallace Ford were probably pleased to see the characters bumped off so they would not have appeared in Drak like this again!
