This movie has nothing like "Office Space" except in the quotes. Office space was hilarious. I would not recommend this movie to anyone, as I laughed not once during the entire movie. Mr. Cornbluth's self-indulgence became increasingly annoying than 15 Jason Alexanders in the same room. If you decide to view this movie, use a free rental or look at someone else's house so you can leave it as needed.
