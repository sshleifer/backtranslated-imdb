This film was potential, but what made it really bad is Lindsay Crouse's action. I never saw it before anything else and maybe some Crouse fans are out like it in something else, but its performance in this movie is bad. <br /> <br /> Its delivery is robotics. When he delivered his line he appeared to have tried to make sure he had the right line and was simply reading the list in his head. So his voice is very little. I can not believe a bad person in act has given a lead role in a movie. He knew someone in the biz. Now I hate to be this mean on it, but the comment must be to be "this" long and its performance is what's more than anything else. <br /> However, I loved where the story went so I continued to watch it. The first part of the script has the makings of a good movie. But the end was disappointing too. Maybe if she did better, I would love her.
