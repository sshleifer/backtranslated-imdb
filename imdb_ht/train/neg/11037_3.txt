I love the episode where Jim becomes the Greenman. It is great! When Jim throws this little man out of the window, looking at his face is priceless. Then when he started addressing the priest in his wife's name only to know that he had come to the pee-woman? Great writing with great casting and great acting make this a must see. I try to find a certain picture of this episode. I would like to use it as my avatar on a message board because I think the Greenman is hilarious. Anyone know where I can download a picture of Jim as the Greenman? Can anyone show me the right way to get such a picture?
