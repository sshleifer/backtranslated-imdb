Words can not describe how stupid stupid story (and that's why this bad movie) is! Basinger, Del Toro ... what did you think ?? So, there is a shopping mall and parking space is totally full. Basinger's character goes to buy a cup of tea and some packaging papers. When it comes out, the whole place is so empty, that nobody hears shot shooting nearby ?? Even if it lives, when driving away from the wicked, it goes to the most remote and divine places would be possible instead of the nearest police station or at least a crowded place? Come !!! I will not even go to the Red Red Box Tool, since others did so first. Let alone how he kills the thugs morally one by one. This is so stupid, without the least bit of logic, I can only warn you watching it, it's a TOTAL Grab of time, honestly !!
