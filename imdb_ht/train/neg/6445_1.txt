When evaluating documentaries that focus a relatively small Ugly ultra-right wing group with conservative groups like this in the USA you must consider the following. United States of America and its population of 270 million and its complex history as an aspirational democracy and its hopes and desires to defend Human Rights that it has its weakness and downside. It is of course expected that extreme wing group ultra and ultra ?? Conservative groups exist in size semblant however relative to the size of its population are very small and isolated. On a Europe-wide basis, Britain and even Australia have the same straight-line group in fact on a per capita basis the actual size of Neo-Nazi groups in Australia is actually higher than in the United States of America. It is for the above reasons that it is unwarranted to deny and disassociate the American people and their debate in the American Society of Society by many frauds and exiles featuring this ultra-right wing of psychopaths as representative of the American Society. By doing this, Greenstreet, deliberately chose small and isolated groups at the opposite end of the spectrum to construct an image of America that is an exotic exotic exercise and exercise. This film is clearly designed to inflate and harassment in the views of those portions that are subconscious and morbid ports hating the American people and way of life under the guise of fashionable spurist and glittering ideologist wing ideology. This film was made for profits by not advancing the truth on the American Society and the Human Condition. Greenstreet can make documentaries that focus on the ultra-right-wing, complex military industrial complex but fail to mislead an intelligent and balanced debate based on real alternative solutions to weakness democracy in a vibrant democracy. The movie is exposed as anti-American by its support for this garbage. SENSATIONALISM in its worst anti-USA waste.
