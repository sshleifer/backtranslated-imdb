I never liked to comment on a good movie but when it comes to a bad movie, I have to come up really hard on it. Talking about Vivah, this guy, Badjatya's harness, seems to have completely lost her. Following the success of Hum Aapke Hain Kaun, she thought she could make money with cheesy wedding videos. Vivah is so cheesy that Badjatyas left Johars and Chopras behind. <br /> <br /> There was not a single moment during the movie where I can say 'Oh! at least this good thing '. Aloknath makes clich√© in a role of the girl's father, Shahid Kapoor looks like Fat and Shahrukhed, Amrita Rao is another disaster in addition to lying ugly looking, bad stockings, racquet scenarios, monstrous scary, hard-to-acting actors, cacophonous music background, soundtracks cheap. Now the departure I warn you guys how is happening in all of his other movies, after a film incidence calamity ends on a happy note.
