This movie really tries hard. if you're going to make a horror movie, at least give it a reason to believe in the viewer's hook. <br /> <br /> You wait and wait in the movie waiting for some grand explanations but it does not. rather it tries to be too smart to end and not reveal anything. <br /> What was the point in the movie? where is he going to go? and most importantly what the hell was going on. . . <br /> <br /> Why was it there and how it tied to anything? just another weak sci-fi horror. I like the fake reviews on IMDb telling how great it is by releasing press releases related to hit the movie (either those or those with low horizons). it's not worth your 2hrs all .. <br /> I do not tell the movie is better than the brittle, but at least gave you reasoning and why it happens and it has a final result. This does not make it just waffle on with tons of padding to make everything feel scary. This movie is as low as an alien call. God has also been crippled. <br /> <br /> Big tip, if you're going to make a horror, make it credible and reasonable and explain the viewer what's happening on them, so they have a hook in your story. because if there is no reasoning or credibility then no firm hold on anything and can not scare. There is no disrespect to dispose of or crew to cause a good job. it just writes to the poor.
