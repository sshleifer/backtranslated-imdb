LL Cool J. Morgan Freeman. Dylan McDermott. Kevin Spacey. John Heard. Cary Elwes. Roslyn Sanchez. Justin Timberlake - wait a minute. Justin Timberlake? And is it the star? I should know better than rent EDISON FORCE. In fact, I knew better. But at the time of absolute weakness, I rent this STV. When you have great names like Freeman and Spacey in an STV, you know it's one of two things: an indie or a dog. As in sit-on-a-shelf. What did that. And good reason. The scheme as such involves a squad of corrupt killer of the MAGNUM FORCE, and "journalist" Timberlake is one of only brave enough to uncover them. It is aimed for his efforts - or maybe I should say for his terrible act. I turned him down after one of the bad guys was shot in the forehead and he was always premeditated to his shooter and smile before falling. Just awful. The real exposure to how bad this flicker is to see Freeman on the cover and in the entire movie a bearded beard, looking like nothing much like a hobo. You just know the director was not in control. Freeman is clearly slumming.
