Sorry, but I will spoil both the drawn line and finish for you in hoping to avoid a holiday fiasco like the one I'm currently facing. The father dies and the mother asks Santa in a letter to bring him back to the family for Christmas, ... and Santa does. Father is peach, happy in health and totally unaware of the fact that he died. All end sweet sweethearts. <br /> But as a parent who recently looked five years old-lost friend her best canine, she was a flicker. Now my son is convinced that all he has done to bring back his back is to ask Santa! Do not underestimate the volunteer in a young heart - no convincing number will convince him that he was only a movie and that his dog is not coming back for Christmas. He was frustrated to watch his happiness only knowing that Christmas Eve he will have to face he lost again. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> How to play the game. It's hard enough to cope with the loss one time for a child, but there are some desires that we should not even show as a possibility.
