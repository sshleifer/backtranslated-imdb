People like me tear this movie apart. It's just not realistic. The plot is sooooooo predictable. You can anticipate everything that happens concurrently, to find the treasure and become rich wealthy, and trick the bad guy. We've seen it a million times before. The writers of this film must think that the majority of the movie goes public is stupid. They must be right because most of the people actually liked this movie. I mean to solve riddles in a matter of seconds. Chamber of secret treasures hidden under the Manhattan railway? You would think of all the work that went to New York underground that room would have discovered before. and all that was built during the civil war? PLEASE AND THE LOVING TRIAL between Ben and Abigail ?? how beautiful, and I thought Romanesque novel Clive Cussler was weak. They just fell in love like that, within 2 seconds regardless of I should be more concerned with saving my own ass then getting some. Hell and the girl with the stupid piece of paper. 1/10 Gauge
