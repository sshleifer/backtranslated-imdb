This was probably probably the worst movie I've ever seen. I watched it with a big group of friends and after it was over by one of us understanding the plot. Aside from the lack of plot, the act was atrocious, "special effects" were not so special, and the writing was absolutely awful. Factors only pick up the factor is that it's so incredibly bad that it's quite funny. You can not help but laugh at a zombie being run on while the actors spewing wrong dialogues. I would not recommend this movie to anybody looking for a good movie, but it's something that a group of friends can get together and have a good laugh over. It's now a joke running among my friends and I. 1 out of 10.
