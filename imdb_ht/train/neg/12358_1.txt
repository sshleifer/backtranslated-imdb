Demi Moore characters in the movie were chosen for the SEAL because of its looks. That was a bad start with the movie down from there. The plot was totally unbelievable. The willingness to do it in a tough military unit is not enough. This movie did not convince me of a woman's physical ability to perform the kind of work required. <br /> Try to assume that women and men are basically even an insult to everyone's intelligence. The gender differences are what makes life interesting.
