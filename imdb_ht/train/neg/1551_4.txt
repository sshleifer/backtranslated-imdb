Ladies Ladies is a funny movie. There are not many thinkers behind it, but what do you expect from an SNL movie? It's actually better than most SNL movies (So Superstar or Night at the Roxbury) Tim Meadows and Will Ferrell were both very funny. Chris Parnell was also funny at his short scene (one of these funnier in the movie). Otherwise, the rest of the cast is average and is just having to support meadows. I've definitely seen funnier movies, but I've seen people dumber too. Again, it's not exactly a deep movie, but it's good for a few laughs. He was funnier as a skit though. But still, if you are looking for a very funny movie, I would recommend this one. Just do not think about it too much, or you'll hate it. <br /> Rating: 6/10
