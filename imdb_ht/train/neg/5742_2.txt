When I loaned this movie out of a friend (thankfully I did not buy it) on the package (which really looked ugly and ugly) was printing "the ultimate vampire vampire". After watching it I thought that the marketing campaign was probably more expensive than the movie itself. The story begins when a teenager (surprise!) Is chased by some vampires / zombie-animals. <br /> <br /> Lighting, sound and everything reminds me of my first attempt to make a holiday-video Ten years old VHS-system if it's not bad I gave the movie a 2 out of 10 and only because the Promo-T-shirts looked kind of cool. I do not want the ten 'movie-students or splatter-movies Generally but I saw Braindead and I saw a 20-dollar movie-budget of students who were ten times better than this crap.
