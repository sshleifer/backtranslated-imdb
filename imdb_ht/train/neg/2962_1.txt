Movies about dinosaurs can be fun. So who Whoopi Goldberg movies. But Whoopi AK Dinosaurs? After the first 20 minutes of "Theodore Rex", I came to a conclusion: this movie is wrong. Evil, vile, wicked and reputable in spite of it for the hearing. There is nothing wrong with this accident; This is the visual equivalent of a turtle room. <br /> <br /> First of all, Whoopi does not do good movies (see "Fatal Beauty" if you think I'm lying), but the movie makers do not care - it's a tough cop here, again. <br /> See a million buddy buddy flicks this week? Well, here number one million and one, pale. <br /> <br /> Do not like beautiful, humanitarian dinosaur animated since TVberg shows TV on them? Too bad, here's another and it's a cop, too! You are one of those who hate car chases, shot-outs, demonic dialogue, boring futuristic FX and seeing talented people (Goldberg, Mueller-Stahl, Roundtree) stuck in a movie that looks like a tax-off tax? A great tax write-off? <br /> And you read this review all the way to the end. You DESIGN an end. Seriously. <br /> No stars, not one. But if they really make an end to "Theodore Rex", Hollywood deserves to be attacked by a group of dinosaurs who have widespread cracking foam rubber. <br /> Now I'd pay to see it.
