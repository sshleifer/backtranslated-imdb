The worst movie I've seen since Gingerale afternoon. I think this is a horror / comedy. I very much anticipated every stage of this film. Special-effects were not so special. I believe I could come up with as good to the effect from what I was lying around the house. I wish I could have a good thing to say about this movie, but I'm afraid I do not. Even Coolio should be ashamed to appear in such a turkey. I do, after a little thought, there is one good thing to say about this movie - it ended.
