I'm looking for this movie for a reason - Al Adamson. It is among the worst directors of all time - right up with Ed Wood, Jr. and Ray Dennis Steckler and the Pantheon of Horrors. However, I was a shame because although the film was indeed bad, it never approached the horrible levels of some of his earliest schlocky movies. Because of this, this movie was not particularly fun to look for our bad movie fans. Now I have been pushing on watching this movie, as the title "Naughty Stewardess" makes sounds of films such as a pornographic film - something I should not review on IMDb. However, this movie appears for this at times - especially the first 10 minutes. But you could say that the script has undergone many changes, as for many of the movie there are no titles at all and towards the end of the movie there is a plot that comes out of no where is violent and certainly PA sexy! The result of all this is confusing aggregate. Unfortunately, none of the many parts are good. For example, such a porn video, it shows amazing little and it's incomprehensible why they would wear a 71-year-old guy in some of their favorite scenes. Sure, for a 71-year-old Mr. Livingston look very good - but it was still an old man and no one wanted to see him getting on with nymphet youth! Then when the final 20 minutes become very violent, just as Livingston became a Rambo-like guy! Talk about weird and inappropriate. <br /> Overall, there is little recommend that this movie is sad. It's not bad enough or sexy enough to care about and the movie managed to be rather boring even with such a crazy title as "Naughty Stewardess".
