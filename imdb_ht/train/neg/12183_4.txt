Christ. An end to one of the most cloying films of all time, this at least has the essence of leaving the songs (bar a refusal of the "Tomorrow" unbearable) but continuing the tradition of being nauseating and unfunny. This time, Annie and her friends head to London and get caught up in Joan Collins's plot blowing up Buckingham Palace or some like the coast. The film has a bizarre sketch attitude towards its eponymous character at odds and how disappointing it is: every time the little bugger squeals "Leapin Leza!" I could feel my teeth glitter themselves down in powder. Photo disorder, glushy and plodding, the movie has one memorable line ("Unhand me, or stupid genius!") And the fact that it's not the original recommend it.
