This movie is AWFUL. I have not laughed so hard in a movie that was unintentionally funny in a long time. Leno should be stuck in stand-by and end night TV. The cars in the movie were cool, but the movie alone is the dumbest movie I've ever seen. It's pathetic, the act is horrible, and the plot can be written by a 4 year old. Do not get me wrong, jay leno is hilarious, but not in this movie!
