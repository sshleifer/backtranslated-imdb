I read half dozen comments from other users on this chart and it looks as if the views vary greatly. I must agree with those who found this film to be awful. It paints me that since I would expect this would be great, or I would not have to worry about seeing it the other day. I like to support independent movies, especially if they are gay-themed, but this film is almost too much tolerated. Those who walked out, as I consider doing after about three minutes, probably did not mind shelling out $ 11.00, or just figuring it went nowhere, fast, and will not improve. Maybe I'm a little more optimistic than them .. Who or they did not pay to get in the first place. <br /> <br /> Logan is bored. It's a klutz. It is gay. I'm aware of that. The problem is that because the main character of a film is bored does not necessarily mean that the movie about it has to be boring too! There are ENDLESS scenes in this kid just laying as a load of laundry, re-establishing everything you already learned in the first stage, with the second stage, etc., etc. ... There is nothing or no go any where. NO ONE says anything even distant or funny or interesting. Probably the worst of all is that I did not feel the slightest bit of sympathy for Logan. That in itself is a major achievement. He did not grow up, he did not change, he did not learn (no one to teach him anything), he did not do anything, and he did not make the movie! Scene after the scene the same does not make a movie done. <br /> <br /> In addition, the title makes no sense at all. 1/10.
