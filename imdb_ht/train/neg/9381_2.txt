The monastery monastery lives on the borders of French society, in a nonsense, purpose or direction. <br /> I watch this because of all their stellar reviews, but I'm afraid I must miss something. Mona characters have little or no personality while no drifting in life has been rude to people, getting high, and contributing nothing to anyone's life. It's not interesting or interesting. It's just useless. <br /> I've seen and known enough people like that: no secret secret what they are doing. They are just lazy bums. I would not want Mona anywhere near me, as it tends to steal anything that is not nailed down and leaving her friends in the lurch. Make sure it is enigmatic - because there is nothing to him. Many of the junkies, winos and bums I've seen are enigmatic; I do not want to see a movie about them either. <br /> <br /> Maybe something has to be totally missed. Otherwise I assume that all the comments from those who assume anything done by a French female director is high art.
