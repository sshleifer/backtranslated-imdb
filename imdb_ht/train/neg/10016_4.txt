"Ghost Dragstrip Hollow" was one of the many '50s movies on gene-genes that meet the supernatural. In this case, the youth can not pay the rent for their hangout and get evicted. With nowhere else to go, they decide on an apparently haunted home. As you can guess, once they arrive, some strange things start to happen. And there is a twist at the end. <br /> There is nothing in this movie that you have not seen in other movies, but it's lovely entertainment however. My favorite character was the bad-mouth parrot. Well, let me rephrase this: he did not speak as a character in a Quentin Tarantino movie, but he said things that we do not expect from a bird. Hokum the best movie, but harmless.
