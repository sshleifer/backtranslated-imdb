In the first one it was mostly giant rats, but there were some wasps and a giant chicken. This one, however, is just rat giant period, quite giant rats and a really little boy grow up. This one is about this boy growing up with a scientist who tries to help him so he accidentally creates giant bloodthirsty rats ... you know how it is. This movie has some slaughter and its moments, but I find it to be on par with the original, I just prefer some variety of my giant cats. Well, that's not true ... I actually love "Empire of the ants", maybe I just do not care for giant ranges. All in all a movie rather drab though it does have one rather odd turn of events in the sequence of one dream that is really scarce. I just can not recommend this one.
