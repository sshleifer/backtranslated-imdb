Of all the films I've seen, this one, the rage, had to be one of the worst again. The Direction, LOGIK, continuity, the sketch-script change and dialogue made me call out of pain. "How could anyone come up with something so bad"? Gary Busey is known for his "B" cinema, but this is a movie "W" movie. (W = waste). Take for example: about two dozen FBI & local law enforcement officers surround a trailer house and a jeep wagoneer. Inside the jeep is MA and is "confused" as to why all the cops over. In seconds a big gun battle is, MA was killed straight. The blast blast away in the jeep with Gary and explosive company away from them. The cops fall as dominoes with the jeep and Gary drives around in circles and are not hit by one bullet / single tablet. MA is killing and Gary seems to have not noticed that the guy is hard. Surely a miracle, since the six-shooter held 300 bullets had such a miracle.
