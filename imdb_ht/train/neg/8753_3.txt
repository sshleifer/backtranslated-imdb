This kind of movie reminds me of a Mari-Kate and Ashley movie-only got worse. Just the rich sister of two things I think even though Alysons plus the actress, in this movie Amanda michalka was okay sometimes but Alysons act stunk. I think after high school they needed to come up with somethihng better and this definitely did not read. The story line was not that great and I think they should have gotten from other people to play Taylor and Courtney. I'm not a big fan of Alyson Michalka and this movie did not make me like it any better. I think they should definitely be sick of singing and only watch this movie if you have nothing better to do (which sadly I did not)
