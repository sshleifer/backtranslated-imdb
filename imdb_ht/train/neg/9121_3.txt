This is not an all-around terrible comedy, but it's very dull. She had barely any laugh, and she wiped her darling value. There is an impressive moment near the end, when Fu Manchu offers a dose of elixir it to his "nemesis" and tells him that "You were one worthy opponent, and now we can start all over again ". This scene, however, together with Fun Burt Kwouk's funeral in the beginning, is only the memorable parts of the movie. (* 1/2)
