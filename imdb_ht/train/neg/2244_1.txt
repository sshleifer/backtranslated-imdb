There are two points I need to make clear right at the start. First of all we all know what Oscar this year were really all about this year. It was the way the Academy showed people that they had no racism, and never were. They wanted to clear all the preconceived notions of themselves. Secondly, it's unnecessary sense to point out the show, because really, what difference will he do? But it's fun to write about it. This is the year I became nourished-up with the Oscar! I will never look again. Every year they do something wrong. Before Crowe wins for "Gladaitor" when real winners should be Ralph Fiennes for "Sunshine". If you have not seen this movie yet, watch it and you will agree. "Eyes Wide Shut" when released is not nominated. And as far as this year goes, well, the bad choices were all over the place! Bas Lurhmann has no nomination "Best Director"! Can you play it !! "A nice idea" is for "best make-up" ???? "Training Day" to be nominated ?? The movie was awful, and it seemed like Washington did not even turn into a performance, all it proved to, he knows how to use four letters! That's what the award was for! Take the language and I bet he almost plays himself! I liked "Gosford Park", I really did, but why 7 nominations? And how about Earth they can not give it too Altman! I mean, c'mon, if there just give the award to people to clear up any bad feelings, what about Altman? The man was in the public eye for 32 years now and there is no Oscar! There have been many, many things bother me about the Oscar this year, but I'll live with it, as long as I have never seen another show again! The Highpoint (and the only one) at the show was when Woody Allen made his first appearance ever to show in awards. This will go down as one of the greatest moments in his story in the show.
