I usually comment only on movies that I love, figuring "everyone's own taste," but here I want to make an exception. First of this film, which somehow seems to get lost in the shuffle, is that these two self-centered adults have a perfect right to go to Las Vegas, get drunk, marry, and inflict incalculable suffering on every dream in children. Even allowing for civilization to be sanctioned, they neither have the courage or sense of responsibility to wake up in the morning and defeat that they have put in motion. After all, "love" is all that matters, is not it? In Hell and All Others. If you're not doing things "work out at the end" is really not the point; In fact it is very irrelevant. The point is disrespect for others, especially if they are young, and especially if they are in an addictive position, they have made the light and thereby reinforced in this movie. There are far more harmonious behaviors that "parents" could do that would bring down a host of social workers on their heads in a heartbeat.
