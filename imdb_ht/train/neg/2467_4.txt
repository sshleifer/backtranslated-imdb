This movie gets both a 6/10 rating from me, as well as an 9/10. Therefore, as a standard horror movie for the standard horror mob, where action and gore and crises have been taken into consideration, this film will make you. It's basically a family drama similar to what you would see on the lifetime canal, but set in a horror universe. The story with the age-old formula, daunting hundreds of times. If you are looking for any originality in the drawing structure or the minimal conflicts, you will be disappointed. Take the zombies and you will have something similar melodramatic as a nice idea, jumping on cheese. This is 6/10. <br /> However, the basic summary and ideas are pretty original and over-the-top. It's literally something you and your friends would be joking about when you're half drinking. . . but that joke actually got a theater release. The idea becomes an 9/10 in my hand. The only reason it's not perfect is because they can take it even further, but they did not. <br /> <br /> The mixture of both is mixed. I thought it was funny, but as with most all comedies, it was not funny. I had my mother and my sister watching her with me and the jokes we had about it were funnier than the scripted jokes. There were moments in genius, but there were also moments of pure boredom. <br /> <br /> I sincerely hope that other cinemas take this kind of risk-over-the-top with their original ideas. I just can not say it was perfect, or even close to it, because of the lack of originality of the plot. <br /> A GREAT movie family. A great movie to watch with a bunch of guys (or girls). A great movie to watch with anyone. . . but if you look it alone, it will be a bit boring. Others still do this kind of funnier and rich manure. <br /> 4/10
