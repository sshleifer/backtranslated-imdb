I start this review with a huge giant flyer on this movie. Do not read more ... here it comes, avoid your eyes! The main heroine, the girl who still lives in other slasher films, is murdered here. There, I just save you 79 minutes into your life. This is one of those cheap movies that has been thrown together in the midst of the slasher era in the '80. Despite killing the heroine off, this is just substandard junk. Both priests and college students get a bad rap here. They are imagined as oversexed, Mauritius societies who have too many internal problems deal with what looks like junior college campus life ... and college students come off even worse. <br /> <br /> "Splatter University" is just gunk set in your VCR when you have nothing better to do, although I suggest watching your own tape, which would be more fun. This is rated (R) for strong physical violence, gore, profanity, very short female nudity, and sexual favors. <br /> <br />
