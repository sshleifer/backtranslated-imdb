Diamond bubble made a point in the first episode that other people in the world did not have domestic cattle but Europeans did, and that against why we were able to make steel and invented complex cars. But then in the Third Episode it was said that when the Europeans in South Africa were too far north to run to Zulu people and other tribes that * hedged animals and planted crops *. So what explains the lack of technological, economic, and artistic achievement if there were key key issues the authors needed for success? Diamond also advertises microbes in the form of tinplate (brought to North America by black slave) was our biggest weapon. Well, if 150 Europeans can defeat 20,000 native warriors and 400 non-South African soldiers can defeat 10,000 Zulus * without one * injury * in any case, then I think you must conclude that microbes are irrelevant. With or without germs, we were going to succeed. <br /> It tells malaria to stop the Europeans from colonizing more North, killing "thousands" of Europeans while not affecting the Africans. (I would like to know real numbers but it does not say.) Then at the end he says today malaria is killing thousands of Africans and that is why they can not catch up with us. So who is it, Jared? Did malaria help Africans when they stood Eurpanz or hurt them? And how did Europe do well despite massive throughout our history? <br /> It also seems too far to say that the European reason to succeed was because of dumb luck. At the time when the evidence threatened to accumulate the theory of its chances, it was hard to admit that perhaps Europeans succeeded because they worked for it. It's sad to watch this obvious Neo-Marxist plot reality to try to prove its point.
