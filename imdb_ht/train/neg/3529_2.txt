I heard this movie was much more stylist than the guys Guy Ritchie (Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrel, Snatch) headed before, the problem is, it is perhaps too stylistic. Basically, Jake Green (Jason Statham) is released in jail after seven years in solitaire, and within two years he gambles loads of his money. He is ready to seek revenge against the toll-free casino owner who has received Jake in jail, Mr. Dorothy. Macha (Ray Liotta). In the process, physician told Jake that she had three days left to live as she died in a bloody disease, o, and Macha hit people on her. Zach (Vincent Pastore) and Zimbabwe (Andr√© Benjamin) bills are asking Jake to pay cash back and perform some odd jobs. This film filled with Jake tells of some flashbacks, and in the last three days before coming to the great revelation on Zach and Avi, and Macha, well, I suppose that it was. Also begins Terence Maynard as French Paul, Andrew Howard as Billy, Strong Mark as Inverter, Francesca Annis as Lily Walker, Anjela Lauren Smith as Doreen and Elana Binysh as Rachel. They are sequences involving a little bit of animation, repeating lines twice in different perspectives, and changing speeds for moments, and all of these are disappointing in the point of confusion and boredom, making it a funny crime drama. Pretty poor!
