I do not buy kung fu movies for a draw. I bought them for battle scenes. A bad plot can be forgiven for excellent battle scenes, but not other ways around. The story was decent but moved slowly to my taste. There were about 3 or 4 mediocre battle scenes at all, lasting only a couple of minutes off. The last battle was a bit longer, but by that point I was so bored I did not even pay attention to it.
