Is not it hilarious when an average schmo that leads a pathetic life suddenly has something immensely magical to happen to her, turning her life upside down and causing her to learn a few important lessons along the way? That formula never gets old, does it? It's such a fire way to make sure you make a classic movie! Just look at bigger hits like Liar Liar and Big! ... This must have been Rob Schneider's line of thought when he made semi-success Deuce Bigalow: Gigolo Male and follow it with the Beast. Since I've already traced the plot of sarcasm, I let it color it in more: Schneider plays a deficit cop that's suddenly involved in a tragic accident but is saved in surgery ... not a squat veterinarian who loads her up with animal parts , causing him to whinny as a horse at proper times, running like a cheetah, etc. This film is a little more likable than other Schneider-starting flicks (like another lame-drawn follow- up the hot chick), but it almost feels like they want their audience to hate it by filing a reality television star as the romantic lead (Colleen Haskell from "Survivor") and inserting a comma by Norm MacDonald. My favorite scene ... just does not exist. Sorry - nothing memorably good except the output value. I just want to finish this review by saying that slight references to other movies in a movie can be okay, but when it comes to the lines released exactly the same way ("You can do it!"), There is a word for that - "treacherous." Actually, here's another word - "cheap."
