The first movie is spooky: a woman gets pregnant when she kisses a stranger in a bar. <br /> But as soon as the movie begins, a terrible opening scene is established that this is a kind of C sci-fi television movie. It's a great Star Trek and a small X-record, but more than anything else it's boring. When the movie kicks into action everything is predictable and clich√©. He looked more like a 2 party in a bad set of Sci-Fi TVs. There is no suspension and there is no emotion, but not for a lack of trying. Just a lot of predictable dramatic conflicts between the main characters. <br /> Do not waste your time.
