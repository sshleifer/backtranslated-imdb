Matt Cordell is back from the dead for a third go-round, although I'm not sure anyone who cares at this point except for comfortable MANIK fans design. Cordell, who died in flickering the latest film, resurrected in Voodoo, and now hot on the trail on several Wednesdays involved in the shooting of a very fond Cordell officer. I missed part of this early '90s low-budget quickie, but it was fun to see Cordell wracking up the body count in various ways. Problem is, the overall movie is very static, and Cordell simply is not Jason or Freddy. The wind speed is very fast, even with that Grand B-movie master Robert Forster as a doctor who ends up with his brain creepy. Stick with the first movie in the series, which is funny and scary and exciting, all at the same time.
