Basically, "Caprica" ​​is the story of Cylon's history. The situation in the show is interesting. However, the writers follow many story lines and clog them with too many character POV that it bogs down the storytelling. The plot ramps at glassy speed detection what tension it might have. In any given episode, little or nothing happens. Daniel Graystone (Eric Stolz) is a military contractor working on a robotic soldier using a stolen chips. Unfortunately, his only working prototype is driven by the AI ​​version of his daughter's daughter Zoe, who died in a suicide bombing caused by a soldier of one (STO), a group of extremist monitors underground. Meanwhile, Joseph Adama (father Commander Adama Battlestar Galactica) is struggling to keep his family together while looking for his daughter AI version (also killed in bombs) in a virtual Machiavellian version of Caprica (which strongly resembles the 1930s Chicago). In addition to the stapled writing, Caprica suffers from a similar issue of similarity. We already know how it ends (that's the Cylons to develop their own civilizations and rebels against humanity).
