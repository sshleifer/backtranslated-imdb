This movie is really one of the worst piece of waste ever. It really is surprising that something so completely terrible could be done. But if you can stand the mind-numbing scheme, character development, and direction, you can get a kick out of the band that is so appalling that it is funny. The movie begins terribly and quickly becomes unbeatable. Someone should give anyone involved in this movie some sort of consolation because their career was probably lost because of the film's involvement. If you have finished viewing this movie or you've seen it already (I feel your pain) then these words have become too late. For anyone else, stay away from all costs or realize that the movie is so bad that it will be wasting 2 hours of your life. Then at least you can clean up or something while watching it.
