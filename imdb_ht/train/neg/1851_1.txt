A "friend", clearly with no taste or class, suggested I take a look at the work of Ron Atkins. If this is the representative of his job, I never want to see anything else by him. It is, self-indulgent, trash criminal and self-indulgent trash. "The mangler's mangler" in the title is a bad movie low budget to kill a bunch of hookers. There is a little nudity and some erections, but no single element can possibly save this from the core to the helmet. Lighting is terrific, the dialogue is a few and especially loud, and the direction is clear. I saw a doco on American American filmmaker during the recent Fangoria convention. Atkins was one of those who featured. He spoke like there was something important about his work, but after a look at this, I did not see anything at any import as well. There are no styles, either, and the hideous video effects (such as solar) only enhance the amber. Not even so bad it's fun. Avoid.
