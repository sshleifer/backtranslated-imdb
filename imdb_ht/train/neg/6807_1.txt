Spoilers? Perhaps a few details, but nothing is too related. Do not like it would have trouble with this movie. <br /> <br /> Air rage blatant ripening in the mid-air crippling quotes of Executive Decision. Glass-T led a team of four "elite" commandos that wear black shirt shirts that we can only imagine to hide the invisible bodyguards as their idiotic tactics (similar to those 3rd grade students used when playing Star Wars on the Playground) lead them to absorb a hail of bullets. <br /> What entertained me most about this movie was used to look-like have-been actors. You will immediately recognize Cyril O'Reily as someone who once acts in a movie that you really liked, even though it was so long ago that you probably will not be able to put it (it was Porky). Here Cyril plays a decent knock-off of a character Bill Paxton. Most hilarious is Gil Gerard's porker, who is very fat that you will never recognize it as the Buck Rogers TV. Instead of conveying his past heroic past characters, Gerard gives us a performance of crossbow crucifixion fat fat guy, which was clearly imagined for John Goodman. Finally, Alex Cord gives us a good hybrid look-like performance as a Chuck Connors / Kirk Douglas type. In the 10 years since New Jack City, Ice-T's act has deteriorated considerably. It does not act as much as regurgitation in line that it might actually have memorized. <br /> One of the items that plays in this movie is a CD-ROM of classified information. It was hand carried, and it apparently and unbelievably not sharpened, despite the security-savvy aura of NSA Gerard's character. What a joke. I'm very much concerned with the information indicated on the CD ever to be assembled in a portable format. <br /> <br /> Despite being in a closed airline without the silence, the bullet is on as well as when boxing, and causing a person to flinch, so apparently there is no foley budget. Assortment of selected weapons is very funny. The flight attendant serving in a coffee pot is on the most realistic illustrations of violence in the movie. When it comes to intuitively the mini-Uzi pistol, which has to be one of the worst pistol designs ever, this is just too stupid. An elite team would bring MP-5s for this type or perhaps SOCOMM .45s, or even Customized Hi- may if they were really old school, or maybe something FN 5.7 if new school ... Army- The 92Fs standard is totally unbelievable, losing most of the cools after the Gun Giver I. The bad guys, supposedly experienced soldiers of the type of fortune, have an assorted blend of absurdity, such as the aforementioned mini-Uzi pistol with a Tec-9 and infamous non-functional external barrel that is not a silencer. <br /> <br /> There was one touch of realism on which I would like to correct the other reviews: the flight attendant and the ice-t made the lower craft at 10,000 feet for their "breathable air" open the door. And I also had the impression that the flight attendant was NOT able to get the door closed, that he basically just went up on that point. As far as the landing, there was no mention of flashlight until about 2 seconds before landing. Signs. <br /> Only the Dukes of Hazardous Discharge Roscoe P. Coltrane in the "Pass" could be disgraced this film for use in stock footage. They obviously chose incredible (and retired) SR-71 because they could not get stock in an F-117. Aside from the fact that mothballed already in 2001, let's also forget for a moment that the SR-71 is not a pure infiltration plane in the sense of the B-2, and that at empty empty points. Well, I'm no expert, but I doubt as if it could be invisible on radar. <br /> <br /> As others point out, the references are repeated in "F-15s" when F-16s showed upset. Details about 747 were very stupid. No aircraft would put some passengers on a 747 to start with, not to mention anything else that was idiotic about it. Pay attention to the use of electrical wiring. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Wow. What a show. Catch it on Stars or something. Do not pay her rent, but watch her for laughing. In controversy for worst movie ever, just up there with Barred's name holds, which at least has some originality.
