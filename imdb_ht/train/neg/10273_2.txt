When it comes to horror movies, I'm more than willing to stop disbelief, ignoring sub-par value production, and neglecting tracing holes in the interest of a good scary. This cinema simply does not have any good crises to offer. He can not even enjoy camping. Wrong dialogue, bad actions, bad directions, killings were predictable and poorly staged, the music was annoying, the camera work was miserable, even the costumes were bad. I felt really bad for the actors, who were obviously trying, but who were dealing with terrible, compromising dialogue and an obvious shortcoming in the direction. I doubt they had any repetition, either. It's embarrassing to look, and so boring than making it to understand the "surprise" finish required tremendous endurance. It's easily one of the worst movies I've ever seen. <br /> I do not normally write reviews, but this one was so bad that I felt compelled to warn others. This film is a complete waste of time. If you have to watch this movie, do not miss "Make" the scoop. The writer / director seems to be under the impression that the killer of a woman was kind of bold, daring. (See it.) He and the cast spend half an hour deconstructing this movie as if it's a new age "Citizen Kane." It's like listening to a group of third-year students taking you behind the scenes of Christmas Pageants. They really think that they created something in substance. It's sad, really ?? The only reason I gave this movie a "2" is because I think "1" should be reserved for true atrocities, such as "Manos: Hands of Fate" and "Space Mutiny." So, "Indian nightmare" is not the movie I've ever seen, but I should say it's somewhere in the bottom of the bottom.
