For the record, this movie is intriguing but it is hardly original. Back in 1998 a movie that begins Talia Shire called The Landlady was almost exactly the same but with the least character. The story is Amanda Lear has been a bad life, abusive father, horny doctor, mental home, etc. She has finally released the happy home under the guidance of her perverted physician ... who he wisely abused and killed the poor guy . (now that was the original) The doctor financed a mansion before he was killed and buried the sucker in the yard. After the move she fell in love with a stud called Richard, who just came to marry a singer blues. If you've seen the Landlady you know the rest, he kills or tries to kill anyone who gets in between and Richard (including a roadie). Many of the ideas came from the previous film, even identical sidekick that beat his nose, even spying on the guy with a bowl of popcorn, even flying a bodypress. It made some original materials, the beer bottle thing was brutal. The highlight of the movie was Amanda's beautiful breasts at the hot-haired stage. A bit of a ripple but not a total waste of time. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10
