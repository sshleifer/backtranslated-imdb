This hodge podge fits from a Gore Vidal novel (actually one of the great American writers) to make Christians in MAGIC and VALLEY in their look like art-work felini. Raquel Welch, with an incredible body (and it is actually not very high) in a lead role (except for KANSAS CITY BOMBER when it was good) play Rex Reed (bad movie review; not critical) changed-month, only to be surrounded by dragging queen (big chick) Mae West, horny John Huston, a young and naive Farrah Fawcett (pre-Lee admirer, who is a shame), and other various types of riffs-azoids pretend to WAY parody They have nothing to do except the inter-spliced ​​old movie clip (ie the KISS OF DEATH, Lena Horne Widmer) ... JUST to continue bleeding the life from everyone. <br /> A 2 out of 10. Best Performance =. It's so bad, it's worth seeing!
