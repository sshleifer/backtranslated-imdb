"The house of the demons" is quite awful. I live in South America, in a country that has suffered a military dictator just like one of the film trying to describe, and even though everyone knows movies can be far from reality, this particular film treats viewers as both ignorant and stupid. Things are not so simple and linear as they appear here, and of course political processes are much more complicated and interesting than the scheme of "the house ...". If you can not show that complexity on screen is better not to make a movie at all. There are a lot of examples of how politics can be seriously taken to cinema, without much space. In some parts I felt that Carmen Miranda might appear in parrots and palm trees. When you talk about something you have to be careful not only but respect your public intelligence.
