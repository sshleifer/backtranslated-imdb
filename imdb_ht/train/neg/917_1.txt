This movie has made it really tasty. The script was really bad. I feel really sad for Gregory Peck late to take on the role of this title of Adaptation B-movie in one of the greatest stories ever. The film was politically correct and vividly sensitive to the others who fought the Japanese in World War II. There was a scene where I almost vomited, showing Macarthur in a bunker on the island of Corregidor talking to troops as a seasoned politician when he came across a wounded, one legged Filipino soldier. Soldiers bleeding and dying managed to sit right on seeing the general and saying: No father, no mother, no uncle Sam 'and Macarthur give talks to his own people that Americans have never abandoned the Philippines . The scene ends with the soldier being instructed by Macarthur's words and giving him a smart greeting. I mean if there was a more condescending scene showing the U.S. as the great white savior in the world please tell me because this one takes the cake. She has shown that the Philippines are virgins of distress incapacities in honor and have counted on the great Americans only for redemption. It is flagrant and deliberately covered by the membership of USAFFE (US Army Force) in the United States, these are Philippine volunteers who were integrated into the U.S. military during World War 2, which was killed by the Japanese fighting American people who walked alongside the Americans in Mass Bataan's death and defend Corregidor Island did not launch a guerrilla officer after Macarthur left for Australia and his famous I will return 'speech. My late grandfather, a global war in Philippians 2 veterans and USAFFE was one of many people who fought the Japanese with honor and love for their home country. I think this film does not give honor to thousands of others who Macarthur relies on intelligence preparation for his famous return in the Leyte Golf landing.
