The tooth fairy is on the ghost of an old witch who has attracted children to his home to find a prize for loose teeth and then take life. The first few minutes introduce you to the beginning of 1949 in the legendary fairy tale and then change the present day. The plot is worn out very beautifully saved by the solid act. They were able to do without the Hammond fees and a few other scenes, but overall the Gore scenes were bloody but quick that had a minimized effect. The eye candy is very good for both sexes. Camera work is good. Dialogue is just, but cheese. I hope the movie to be a bone to do, low budget, slasher and many recalculating factors. I was surprised by the quality of the movie.
