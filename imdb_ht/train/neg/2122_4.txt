Although in some aspects of seven books is solid and interesting in some of its narrative style, Gabriele Muccino's project is rather mediocre. The film becomes more and more and more manipulative as it moves toward the end: human heart and emotional, physical eyes and metaphor. Seven books are more of an amateur imitation of Alejandro González Iñárritu of Amores Perros and 21 grams, with many and many flashbacks. The problem is the story is quite predictable from VERY easy on the movie. That's too bad, because seven books could be as genuine "good" if Ben and Emily were put in their right hands.
