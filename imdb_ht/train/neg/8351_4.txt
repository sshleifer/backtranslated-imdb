The same average score by Monogram standard, this mystery (a remake of the Sphinx) has an oddball plot that does not unraveled many effects - you'll see it after about ten minutes. Their drive has some nice twin dialogue at the start, but John Hamilton is hopelessly dull as the villain (perfectly cast Lionel Atwill out of the role) and Hitler Hitler's sweat is very annoying. However, it's worth sitting for a five-minute appearance by the incomparable Mantra Moreland as Nicodemus Janitor, who gets the best of the defense attorney during a hilarious courtroom appearance. You've got it from Bill of "One-Taken" Beaudine; he was not much of a director, but he would still punch up a routine programmer and some vaudeville jumps.
