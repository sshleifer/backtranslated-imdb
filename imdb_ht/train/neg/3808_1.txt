WARNING! This review will reveal the end of the film, "Scoop." If you do not want to know how the movie ends, do not read this review! <br /> <br /> "Scoop" is so bad you will think "Annie Hall" was a fluke. <br /> It gets one star because you get to see Hugh Jackman's naked chest. This is the only "Scoop" that will be for him. <br /> <br /> misyny's Woody Allen, and fixing her on fast enough teenagers, at this point, to be her daughter and disable any ability to make movies she had at any point. The plot seems promising: a ghost, Ian McShane, directing a fluffy LED student, Scarlett Johansson, to investigate whether an English Lord, Hugh Jackman, is notorious to the Tarot Card Killer of Prostitutes. A magician, Woody Allen, helps the girl. <br /> <br /> Promising draw despite, the movie completely lacking charm, or humor, or atmosphere. It's an amazing sound, amateur effort for someone who made even one movie before, never got dozens of ideas. Perhaps Allen had a stroke that had been signaled in the press. Many are made in the fact that unlike his previous film, Woody Allen, now a septuagenarian, has finally allowed a smaller lead to find the girl. <br /> <br /> Not so. In fact, the plot is constructed in such a way that the girl has no one. There is an early scene where Johansson, for any central purpose of the film, allows himself to be drunk, and seduced, not a powerful, older director. "Seduced" is a efemism for what is happening. It's a "slam, bam, I had to go" kind of moment. He has no relation to the trace whatsoever, and it's cheap Johansson in the viewer's eye. Why does Allen add that unnecessary scenes to the movie? Because it shows a powerful director - like Allen - sex and female lead. Allen gets his cake and then eats it, too. <br /> <br /> Johansson is not yet an actress. It does not know how to command the screen except by putting a tight, low cut off. She imitates Allen in a couple of scenes, and that just seems strange and sad. <br /> It does not help that his character scripted as a doll that can not function without a ghost, or an elderly and less than worrisome-inspired magician, telling him what to do at every turn. <br /> It's about Jackman's half age, and it comes across as a very screamful presence of the scenes together. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />! <br /> <Hugh Jackman is just copying to the script. Allen apparently can not stand it up because Jackman is so stunningly good looking and young, and so he gives Jackman nothing to say or do. Like Johansson, he's just used for good looks. This is a shame, because, as Jackman showed in any number of outputs, from "Oklahoma" to "X Men," he can act. <br /> Here's the big draw twist - Jackman, suave, good Lord English, really is a killer. So even if the movie says it's all about leaving someone else, other than Allen, get the girl, he does not find anyone. Jackman, the man he made love, is a man who killed a prostitute. Nice, Woody. Beautiful ways to punish your heroine to be beyond your hands. <br /> In an aggressive touch passive, Allen deprives his heroine in his own presence, as well, killing his character, the magician, leaving Scarlett Johansson all alone at the end of the movie. A final note: in my screening, not a single audience member who laughs at any point during the movie. Still a bad sign when a movie is released as a comedy.
