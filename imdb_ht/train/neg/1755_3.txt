This film is not devoid of charm and also shows a bit of heat, but ultimately this effort is too prosperous and too strongly focused on their conduct. There is no doubt that Mary Tyler Moore knows what to do with her entire screen but it takes too much of the limelight away from the rest of the cast. <br /> Another problem is overburdening in the script and clicks. The daughter who secretly drops out of college, an older woman finds it difficult to get a good job (and first end up with fairly-living tasks), the executive executive soldiers and her executive games that go for glitz substance, the journalist who sticks up for his beliefs, etc. There is nothing really wrong with any of these, meaning they are all well rooted in reality, but in combination they are just too much and leave us with too much already-over and over some surprises.
