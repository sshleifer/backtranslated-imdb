Hey look, deal with it, have better painted in the difficulty of black America than that. Although I think this story is weak, my criticisms focus on the poor execution of the story, which I mentioned, course. This was done in the mid 80's and terrible in the music / note department. It's funny to see Oprah as a last-day crack-whore. The scene where Elizabeth McGovern's biggest thing is in the burn. Most classic movies. First, I do not care how your drink is, you will react to 1200F degree flame (no matter how bad your act). But they really are the scene ... it was funny. I'll tell you that, though, I had great satisfaction in seeing Elizabeth McGovern burning in a faux death; it annoys me.
