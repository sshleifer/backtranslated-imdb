I saw this dull waste of time on the Comedy Channel HBO, so I'm quite innocently and obviously suppose that this was a comedy. But there is absolutely nothing funny here. A good cast is basically wasted on a script that I could write with my butt-shake left - after it was unkaten in the 15th-century Inquisition episode. The first half is particularly bad, as it has some of the most dull dialogues, the useless I've come across a while, and zero comma zero draws to talk about. Just the fact that stars like Ewan McGregor and Zeta-Jones are in this little movie and yet this movie has less than 1000 votes on this site, they should tell you everything. A couple of beautiful shots of waves hit the British cold coast, but that's about it. This is the movie sort that gets done just because the person who wrote it has good connections (family connection, preferably) and / or lots of cash lying around.
