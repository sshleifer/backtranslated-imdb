Personally I think this show looks very cheap. Some of the actors are awful. They're about to do it & look fake. I can always say how it will end up in the first 10 minutes or less of watching because they make it transparent. It is not very well written either. I love to look at her in the street. You know he says "It's so bad that it's good?" Well, what to say applies to this show. I also like to look just to see if I'm right when I guess how it's all going to end. So far I was right every time. It's like a little game that I play. It's good when you're bored and you feel like laughing at something.
