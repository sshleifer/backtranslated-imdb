The battle scene plays such slow-motion Jackie Chan and their attempts to understand are pathetic (the worst point is far: "Guess what? This time I heard you come"). The stars are a mismatched pair: Brandon Lee, despite the terrible lines he says, actually shows traces of charisma and screen charms - things that Dolph Lundgren are completely free of (at least in this movie). Note the director: in the future, please stay away from any love scene, especially when your main actress will not make any stripping and you must count on a double body. (* 1/2)
