This film is pure gloves. Mother always says if you can not say anything nice ... but even the mother would say I had to be my party to warn others of this movie. <br /> I can guarantee this is the movie that Geoffrey Rush wishes would just go. I would expect Greg Kinnear to shoot his agent .. from a cannon to give him the script. After Ben Stiller this is probably praying for someone to face "There's always something about Mary." I've always been a fan of the Wes Studi, thank you everything you hold apart for wearing a mask in the movie so maybe not going to identify the movie with her. <br /> It starts with promisingly with a parody stylist in the movies of the Batman movie and then just loses something ... like a coherent draw and half decent effects. <br /> <br /> jokes are telegraphing an hour before the punchline comes, and even then they fall flat. If you want to see a perfectly effective in the comic book world sees "chasing Amy". <br /> <br /> RUN! DO NOT PLEASE ATTENTION "Mr. Mister"!
