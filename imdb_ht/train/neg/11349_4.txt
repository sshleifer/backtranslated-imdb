Actually, this is a lie, Shrek 3-D was actually the first 3D animated film. I bought it on DVD about 3 years ago. Is Bug Life not doing that too? I think it was at Disneyworld in this tree, so I say before they go and use that as there are logo. Also, Shrek 3D was a motion simulator of Universal Studios. They should always consider it a movie, because it appeared in a "theater" and you could buy it for DVD. The film was beautiful, at least small flying. I love IQ. I agree with animaster, they have done a work from making a movie out of something that's just an out-and-back adventure. I recommend giving families and children.
