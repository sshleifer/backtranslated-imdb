You can not really go far away when the initial story is not all that great. Cyber ​​blood cyborg is just dopey. <br /> <br /> the blaster script '. The actors do not have much to work with. Together they were out of the desert to cut costs. It's a trademark that if the background is the desert, then the movie has no budget. <br /> <br /> Lack of budget is okay, if there's a story. "Solarab" and "Without Champion" are examples of decent jobs with no $. but this movie looks like scratching them together just buying the cameraman a sandwich. Again, forgive if only the story was not just plain sucking. <br /> <br /> Finally, this movie commits the biggest crime at all: It does not end! It simply ends as if it's a commercial break away from the rest of the movie. But the rest never came. Just odd. <br /> <br /> Just bad.
