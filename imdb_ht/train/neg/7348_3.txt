I was really disappointed with this movie. The first Waters movie I saw was the mother's serial and I loved it. Then I saw Pecker and I loved it. Then I watch Polyester and really sort of hate it. The only thing I liked about was this divine movie. He / she has a hell of a lot of talent. I was really surprised. As a whole, I would not recommend this movie ...
