Ah yes in the 1980s, a time of Reaganomics and Sly, Chuck and a host of other action stars hid in a remote jungle blown away from comets. At that moment, I could not believe how movies such as RAMBO, MISSING IN ACTION and UNCOMMON VALOR (And who can forget the ridiculous RED DAWN?) Made money at the box office, they`re turgid action Crap Fests with a rather on putting right-wing agenda and being dating very seriously. TROMA'S WAR is a language of cheek to take on these kinds of movies, but you've wondered about being they needed spoofing in the first place? Of course not. TROMA`S LAG lacks any sort of sophistication - though it makes the point that there's no real difference between tyrant wings and left-wing - and sometimes feels more like a z class movie than a throwing. Maybe it is?
