Ever wonder why Pacific Islands seem to automatically assume humorous sense of Black Americans? regardless of ethnic origin? Well this film will not give any answers to this question often reponse - but it will provide a great case study. <br /> From its onset this film acts as a sort of "Old School" for Pacific Island New Zealand, which immediately raises the question of exactly what is the point of such work. Does it mean to pervert irrigation steroids in the Pacific island of New Zealand? or is it designed to exploit this potential marketplace? The story is weak, humorous jokes, and the expected finish. This film has nothing to do with New Cinema Zealand, as it is simply an affiliate romantic comedy that is devoid of any merit.
