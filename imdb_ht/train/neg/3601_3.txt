Was it predicted when Tori complained that his first companion was treated like a robot, and then his new companion (the murderer) turned out to be a designer of artificial intelligence? I think so. The scenes make you pliable and fun: Montage garage, a tease strip of a kimono (what do you call it when you seductively wear clothes, instead of taking off?), And a climactic battle on skis! Definitely tune in for the start and end, but you can grab a sandwich during the second act when all the draw is happening. Is It Better Than CO-ED CALL GIRL? Nah. Tori ever made it to paradise, or out of the snow, even? Nope.
