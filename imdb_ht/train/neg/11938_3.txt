The film started quite well. He had a friend get hit by a green meteorite thunder, getting power (telekinesis, x-ray vision, invulnerability, theft, talking ability with dogs, superspeed, heat vision, and the ability to make plants grow big and quickly ) and fighting crime. From there on it all down. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />! . <br /> It would not be so remarkably bad if it did not look like a boxing match where two fighters pretended to strike each other while the audience stopped looking while the fighters just continued to dance . <br /> Despite all this nonsense movie has good points. He stated clearly that if you try to take on a gang alone then they will come back to your home and hurt you. It states that gang & community need to see their real enemy (the great employers who use them for their own to finish breaking honest people into a ghetto existence). It also states that people do not need superheroes if they want to work as a community to destroy the evil predators. The only message it really lacks is that voters should ensure their elected officials (Rudolph Giuliani, Marion Barry, Ronald Reagan, George W. Bush, and George H.W. Bush) are not Crooks.
