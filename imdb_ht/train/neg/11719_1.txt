In Charles Dans's character of this film, "Bollocks!" There is no draw, no character development, and incredible net. Filled in just things does not happen in the real world (since British police officers were armed and wounded in shoulder holes?). Full of errors (train to Bulgaria in London?). Full of dull and artistic dialogue. And the LED / correction is terrible - wobbly camera shots but which has nothing to hold in the movie except a wave of seasickness wave; confusing jump-off; there is no structure. Wesley Snipes' character is totally unsympathetic - why should we care what happened to him? Direct video? Direct from the dust!
