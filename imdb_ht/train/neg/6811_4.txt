When I first saw this movie movie 11 years ago, I loved it. I always think that the LEDs and cinematography are excellent, as is the music. But it's really the script that has about the time started to bother me more and more. I find Emma Thompson's top-absorbed writing and heralding the original book; It has reduced Marianne to a side-character, a second play it's too much too old, very mild to Elinor - it's the movie given a lot of 'focused moments', and often appear to have just shown Thompson myself. <br /> I understand he cuts several characters in the book but leaves out the scene one of Willoughby's books in the redemption? For someone who is red and loves the book long before the movie, these are things that are always difficult to digest. As for the actors, I love Kate Winslet as Marianne. It does not give the best script in the world to work with but it always pulls it gracefully, without too much sentimentality. Alan Rickman is great, somewhat old maybe, but he plays the role very well. And Elizabeth Spriggs, it's absolutely fantastic as always.
