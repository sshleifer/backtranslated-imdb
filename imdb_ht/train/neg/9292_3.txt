First of all, I also hoped another hero - a fantastic job of art for genre of action. I've only seen the part of Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, but I can imagine that it is better than HoFD. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />! , but you still care - that's good to act) <br /> <br /> What has gone wrong? What begins with political intrigue wanders into a love story. Worse, it's a opera triangle like love triangle. You have three characters, I guess, fall in love with each other - for no good reason. This film basically falls apart after the escape from the prison (I fall asleep for forty minutes in it). It's almost as if they have changed the writer at that point. The rest of the movie is about how a character is "like the wind." Ick. Also, you really need to stretch your suspension of disbelief to believe the action stock pieces. This is not unique in this genre, but since the story is weak, you can not wait for the action, and then, when the battle broke out, it really was not good. The beginning of your tram, but then this movie just ran out of gas.
