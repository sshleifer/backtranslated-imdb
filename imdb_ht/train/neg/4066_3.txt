In Eric Stanze's director of 'ISOYC, IPOYG', three men were subjected to torture from the women's sexual abuse. The first victim is forced to eat his own crap, before being axed to death. The next move ends with a bullet in the side after refusing to have sex in the rear and the first guy's body. But he is the third person who gets the worst: he has to watch the star 'star star' Emily Haack get naked and masturbate with a bale handle (oh, she also gets the handle pushing her too!) . > <br /> And, unfortunately, so we (get to see her masturbate, that's not to get a handle sweeping up our medical care!). <br /> <br /> Yes, 'ISOYC, IPOYG' is one purely experimenting look, not because of its relentless violence, but because Haack, who is obviously under the foolish notion that he has the body of a goddess (as opposed to that of a roadmap for Metallica) constantly gets naked buckets for the camera. It is not a nice sight. <br /> In addition to non-stop stripping from an ink-up hook, viewers also get to see obnoxious directions from Stanze (who think endless shots of graves and trees are fun stuff), some really bad act, and a fat guy's penis. <br /> <br /> Strange enough, I give 'ISOYC, IPOYG' a rating of 3/10, which is actually a little higher than its current 2.9 average. That's one point for the ax ax attack (which, being a gore-hound, I actually liked); a point for the bit where the guy has fat her face pushed into masked chocolate mascara as hilarious; and a point for the sheer nerve suggests that this movie might somehow end up in the classical Meir Zarchi's classic exploit I spit on your tone.
