They took part in GEORGE 2 on TV lately, but could not find myself watching it up to the end. Just awful! I can not even remember the plot. All I know is that George and Ursula are not George and Ursula in the first movie, which was bad enough. There are a lot of scrambling around, but the direction and correction were so shoddy and stuffed, it was like watching outtakes or deleted scenes. Having the original voice of Ape returned to Ape was not nearly enough to make me warm up in this. GEORGE 2 is probably the end of one worst I've ever seen, and that says something. Jeez, because of the IMDb's ten-string line 10, I have to keep thrilling when I have nothing further to say about the end of this crap-made TV. Disney, hang yourself in shame.
