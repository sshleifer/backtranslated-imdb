I was too intrigued by the high rating (8.5) for this film, and she was very disappointed. I just saw a couple of good movie aliens and was looking forward to doing it three in a row, but it was not to be. I went with a Spanish speaking friend who felt the same way. There is plenty of a scheme, if any. I do not necessarily need that in a movie, but it does need to somehow entertain or bring me the best inch I might say would be expected to be a Altman-esque film, albeit with a small ensemble. Sure, there are moments, but an easy moment to get thinned out of 97 minutes to slow down in nothing. I do not understand the high rating for this movie. I give it a 3. <br /> <br />
