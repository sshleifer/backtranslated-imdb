Justin goes home to live with his father's strict, hard-nosed sadness, but looks like Dad has turned upstairs to three fortunate apartments each with rare tenants who live in them. Straight-worn idealist Justin is pushing into the world of occult, murder, drinking under age and other things dastardly. Ho-hum <br /> <br /> Wow, I saw the same movie that almost all the other reviews about here to see ??? Intelligent, compelling, original, intense, smart, genius ???? !! I witnessed none of these things. What I saw was a refreshing, bland, trite, very cliche low-budget trading that was ripe and implausible and no tension in the least bit as the killer telegraphed as soon as the movie was released monologue / debate / discussion. And where are the funny laugh-out-loud moments? I never so much chuckled, maybe because I was too busy trying to not get to sleep in the movie. <br /> <br /> My Class: D <br /> <br /> DVD Extras: Audio Book and Dave Campfield Director; Second Book with several contributors as well as isolated music tracks; 4 Feature (Make, on the lock, turn 1 room in 4, & Inside the dark circle); Interview with Felissa Rose, Desiree Gould, & Raine Brown; Alternate scenes; bloopers; a music video for 'Addiction'; A trailer for this movie; With Trailer for "Shock-o-Rama", "Chainsaw Sally", "Crawl Skin", "Sin", "Bacteria", "Christian from the Hillbilly Lagoon", & "Millennium Crises"
