It only became the third bill (behind Arthur Treacher & Virginia Field), but this was effectively David Niven's first to begin roles and it's charmingly funny as PG Wodehouse's drug Bertie Wooster, master (not only) Jeeves, the most unflappable valets. As an adaptation, it's more like a roll-down 39 steps than a true Wodehousian outing. And that's too bad since interplay between Treacher & Niven is not too far from the mark. Alas, B 'movie mystery tropes and forcing comedians to grow fatigue even at a 57 minute briefing. Tracking next year (STEP LIVELY, JEEVES) was even more in the brand, with no Bertie in sight and Jeeves (everyone!) Forced to play the goof.
