A couple of children (Brooke Adams, Jeff Hayenga) went to a doctor (James Karen) to try to get pregnant. It works but Adams slowly gets to know that there's something seriously wrong with the baby ... <br /> <br /> Pretty interesting idea well done in not a disgusting script - The basic idea is OK but gets screamingly predictable towards end. I saw all "twist" coming. The direction is poor - it seems no idea how to shoot a basic scene. Their production value - to be beautiful - disgusting. Very shabby. And, the Gore scenes are too unpleasant (I almost turn it around when a pregnant woman starts to stab himself in the stomach) with special disgusting effects. The movie completely rotten in the end when it became clear they had no idea how to end this movie. <br /> <br /> Some good act make it a bit treatable. Adams, Hayenga and Karen are indeed in their roles and they have kept me watching but that was on it. This movie was barely released in 1991 and still remains unknown - it's easy to see why. I give it a 4.
