"Skulling Skull" is open with a warning and an offer for free funeral service if you should die while watching it - now there is a hook! The story itself has a fairly interesting citizen for a horror cops: complaining husband marries a wealthy woman with a story of mental illness, then try to convince her that she has gone crazy and retorneys, mysterious knocking and skulls that turn up in inapportune times. Add to the formula a sufficiently creepy gardener who always dares to memorize the first wife of the man he has devoted to. Perhaps it's just that 1950's did not have the technology pulled on some of the make-up stages needed to junk up this movie, the techniques used here seem optimally to Munden. But then again, when I first saw the "House on Haunt Hill" as a nine-year-old, he gave me the jeebies of the same as I'm sure this film was made for young viewers at the same time la. <br /> <Do not get me wrong, the movie is not terrible, it just seems to get tired of times. But there are some great atmospheric tensions in the Whitlock House, but large, but furnished, and the gardens and pools are a nice touch. For me the best played out scene involves Eric Whitlock (John Hudson) gone maniacal in the pond trying to retrieve the hidden skull, it's just wades right in clothes and everyone, in contrast to his own mentor gardening (director Alex Nicol in a double role). It makes you wonder who was the real one. <br /> In its own right way, maybe the most shocking thing about the movie: how about this Whitlock own routine makes their first appearance - gull door wing in 1958! That at least makes me jump out of my chair!
