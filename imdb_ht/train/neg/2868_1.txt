This is actually a victim of the victims and families of the BTK killer. These events in this film are not even close to the truth. Why could not make a movie in the real events does not make sense since the real events are more interesting then this make up mashed. Do not even waste your time watching this for free. Low budget and a shameful storage of events that should not be a joke, which is really what this movie has done. If they would allow me to give a 10-movie this I would. The act sings and looks like he's fired on an old VHS video camera from the 80s. Save your time and money by watching this movie.
