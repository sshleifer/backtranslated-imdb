Hmmm ... where to start? How a serious actress like Demi Moore was involved in these crap? "First Blood" might be rated as Bull's *** t but this type of nonsense is just rambo and tits, point. Of course if you are interested in the krapstory (Demi Moore just wants to prove that a woman can be part of the seawall seals) that is the brightest one I can think of, you will say "GI Jane" is a great movie. Just the performance of Viggo Mortensen made this movie spread out hell, I can not think of Demi Moore being rambo (especially not during the last, useless, 30 minutes). Ridley Scott does not deserve the credits to make one movie that comes up for women who are just right, it's just the brain propagation for the American army and making it the most attractive to fall to Moore in it. Manure films.
