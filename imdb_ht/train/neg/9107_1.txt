I was angry anyone who made this movie. I was even more angry at losing important minutes of life I'm still looking at. I could have had a waxy job and they were much more entertained. At least Cherri makes me laugh before she hurts me. I was a bit confused at first but then I kept on and realized what was going on. At that time the movie was halfway through, and yes I'm a procrastinator but I still want to see things up to the end. So I stuck it out I looked at it all. Not only the actors who are not as attractive as the evil intent, they just do not persuade. I saw my nephew crying for more persuasive attention than the surprise assumed to be on screen in this movie. If you love the bad and the bad act of this watch.
