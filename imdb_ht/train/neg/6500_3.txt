Look, I'm sorry if half the world gets offense in this, but life is confusing enough. I do not need to look it in that way. I searched Anthony Hopkins, great time. I'm watching Fracture, and I knew that would be a steamer steamer in Quentin. But this is not quite injection, and it does not hatch - even if it is artsy. The well-produced film has grounds for cutting and fast edits, not this "oh, but it's a realistic interpretation" excuse. This thing'll make yourself hurt. It's the fastest moving picture ever takes you nowhere at all. I still love AH, and I'll always give him another chance, but if you have not done in time to watch the bad idea on screen, skip this.
