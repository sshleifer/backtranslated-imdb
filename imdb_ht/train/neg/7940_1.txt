Guy de Maupassant was a novelist who wrote a novel about a man, a poor man, without any kind of moral. He only wants success in a society where the people, political people, businessmen, journalists, women are corrupt. The only king is money. Hero of Maupassant, Charles Forestier is going to be higher and higher in the society scale thanks to his seduction. She is in love with all the women who can help her in his actions to steam society. At the end of the novel, he was married to the biggest daughter of the daily paperwork, at the greatest church in Paris: "La Madeleine". "All Paris" is there. He has a chance and more, he will become a member of the Parliament and later a Minister. The "useless" women come from her watch, but she always keep in touch with the beautiful and the useful women. Photo "AFFAIR PRIVATE OF BEL AMI" is a MORALITY story. It is everything, but not a story of the Maupassant idea. Why was it put "BEL AMI" in its title?
