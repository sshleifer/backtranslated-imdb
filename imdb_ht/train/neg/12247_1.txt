This movie is really awful. terrible as in it is a waste of 84 minutes in your life. Special effects are so awful. The act was not convinced. <br /> It's about a crocodile that attacked a tourist seeing how to film a documentary about "without browsing". Without browsing is time to navigate around sharks but it turns out to be terrible when a banned 31 crocodile has a holiday. Sharks do not look real. The crocodile is even worse, and it becomes even more pathetic when they run away from the animal's form, but the crocodile gets stuck with her 2 brunette flash. Deaths are fake and pirates are just filling in time. A useless, horrible movie is not worth seeing !!
