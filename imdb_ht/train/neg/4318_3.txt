I thought this was one of the most depressing holidays I've ever seen - others were the WIFE Christmas and JACK FROST. All three movies are about death. If you love being depressed, then not all means to watch this movie or any of the others. In this film, the good act and some of the landscape (apart from people dying) are beautiful. But I'm worried that a depressed clinic can accidentally see the movie and make it yourself! Although a "happily ever after" ends, the great part of this movie is a terrible disaster after another. And, for some crazy reasons, I do not want to be depression when I watch a Christmas movie (I know this crazy sound as - after all, is not bawling your eyes out and feeling miserable what the holidays are all about anyway? ) For a more irresistible experience, try the forgotten home without a Christmas tree, Christmas Carol C. George's or a Christmas story instead - unless of course you love being miserable.
