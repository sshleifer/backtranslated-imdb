Wanda Nevada is a pibesan fantasy film using around 1979 the idea of ​​what constitutes illegal romance for 13 old girls. Script, rhythm, and directions are just as awful. Action sequences challenge beliefs. Character spoken to the simplified dictionary is usually found in films aimed at the bottom of the 10 series, but also includes several sexual references involving Shields' character as well as graphic deaths. The movie wants to make a comedy on some levels, but it's never funny, an adventure picture, but drawn with the unspoiled actions, and a movie of a child but presents pedophilia and rape children as real possibilities. He also wants to have a picture of friends, one coming in old photographs, a ghost movie, an Indian movie, a travel, and a west. The overall affect is in massive sort and a nasty twist. Wanda Nevada is a complete waste of time unless you want to see a great many terrific shots at the Grand Canyon. That he managed to do just fine.
