This was a really unprofessional movie. Their performance is third rate, and the dialogue is so stilted that at times it seemed to have just rolled about it dead. My purpose for renting this was simple: Find a movie and scriptwriting. I needed a visual aid for my presentation, so I figured out why not using a clip? My boy was wrong. After searching my local video store, I came up with this, where he was suspected of "Starstruck". I thought, "What is hey," and decided to give it a try. Well, I was very pleased with my results. There was perhaps one scene I could use, and meanwhile, I was practically falling asleep because of the sheer banality of the flick. So ..... I took this back and pick up Ed Wood. There's a movie I can use as an example. Then again, anything would be presentable compared to the drivel that is "Starfucker".
