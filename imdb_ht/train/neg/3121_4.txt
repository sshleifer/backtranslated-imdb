This movie is rubbish. It has terrible tastes, and it is pedestrian and convinient to script although supposedly based on real events - that does not add much to anything but makes it more of a disappointment. Directions are not quite done in as scenes and dialogues are out of place. Not sure what Robin Williams saw in this character or story. To begin with, Williams is not convinced as a gay in a relationship relationship nor is the relationship itself interesting. What's worse, his character is forced by an ugly pedophile story that is base and has no place as a trace device. You have an older Rory Culkin flavorless spouting "d_ck_smker" - in good fun- which is annoying enough and then laughs up by the Williams character. Finally you have Sandra Oh as an Angel Guardian advisor and a cast of explanations about the whole fiasco in the end. Toni Collete's character is just plain annoying with a re-hash of its 6 sense of the poorest and poorest direction. Very miss-able.
