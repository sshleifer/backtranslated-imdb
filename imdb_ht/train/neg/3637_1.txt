I am surprised in positive comments for this movie without uninspiring. Often with foreign films I jump on the complaining review of slow speed and looks like "absence of action" as many of the best international films do not live up to the Hollywood Western model of cinema history. <br /> I love the often nicely and lack of clich√© in the foreign movie spot. I love that many foreign films do not bind things in a nice little bow. <br /> <br /> That said, this particular movie offers no redemptive value for the time I wasted watching it. There is no meaningful character development, there is no arc history, there is no way to get emotionally involved with any of the characters on the screen. <br /> Summary: A lot of people in the field of emotional immature prostitution colony maltreated the slaves, and a girl gets hurt by her only friend when the "house-boy" finally gets fed up and abuses him from her . <br /> While the above paragraph is intense and dramatic, this movie will make you while playing out the storyline. I was so marvelous that she had taken three sessions to complete her, and I would not even have done that for her positive reviews. <br /> <br /> Unless you have an academic interest in the period I strongly suggest steering clear of this one.
