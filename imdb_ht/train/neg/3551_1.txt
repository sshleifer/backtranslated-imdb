This movie is just plain terrible !!!! Slow acting, slowing of getting to the point with wooden characters that just should not be there. The best part was shown in Iron Maiden singing in some videos in a theater and reading it. The end was worth watching and waiting for that was it !! The characters in this film put me to sleep almost. Avoid it !!!
