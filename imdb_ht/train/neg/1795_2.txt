I had the opportunity to preview this movie as a member of a test audience, and the only thing that kept me in place was the chance to complete the post-screening survey. I felt the biggest movie problem was its lack of a main draw. Instead, he composed of (too) many sub-contest competitions for screen time. As a result, no single character develops enough for the audience to form any sort of attachment. What the director and producer failed to do was show us why we should take care of what happens to the characters. In fact, one could remove one over-drawn and the characters associated with it, without severe detriment in the movie. (The time would have allowed the development of the need for the rest of the sub-cemeteries and characters.) Simply put, the Bachelor's Club Hunger Club has overcrowded and side dishes and enters when a whole wants.
