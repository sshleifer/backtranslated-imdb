Allow the first start of this review and the fact that I sign up just to write the review and tell people to save their money !! <br /> This was one of the worst pieces of garbage I had seen since the mountain. The scenario was the most predictable waste you could possibly come with. If you wait 24 hands on the big screen, stuck waiting for the toilet immediately along with the money you would use for a ticket .. You can get more fun in that way. The act was terrible, the plot was completely unrealistic, (and so called "twist" to the end. I must say that the finish was to surprise me .. I did not refer to the twist plot that surprised me. , but rather the easy way that they put together what can be considered the only scene of a bit decent action in the movie all .. They run the finish quickly as I did not even realize that it was about until I saw the rolling credits and at that point I consider burning the reel film if I could just figure out how to get into this testroom. <br /> <br /> Distribution was awful for a few reasons. First of all, they must have accidentally changed the character duties, because Michael Douglas played scrolls that CLEARLY Keifer Sutherland should play While Douglas was sneaking around agents, tapping phone lines, hacking into the system and taking out those who chased him 'Sutherland play the less silver can still be in the abusive attitude of ads even when things will not be serious for him. He does not have anything like Jack Bauer's style to roll out our 24 love fans. <br /> I can just be on your promise that this film will disappoint all over the area. It can be best compared to a remake of the "fugitive" / "in the line of fire" but written by people with mental disabilities
