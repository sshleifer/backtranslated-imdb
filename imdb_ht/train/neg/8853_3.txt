In the first shout, we are presented in a world where werewolves exist, and they are a bit organized. The plot of this movie made some sense; a TV reporter investigates this and tries to uncover the truth. It ends up having to kill many of them including his boyfriend who gets one. Then it shows the world that they exist by transforming on live TV. The special effects were just mockable in the first movie and found no better in this one. Whether it's the transformation or the bad puppets or the cheesy computer graphics that show their superpowers. <br /> <br /> The line drawn is not all that bad; They must kill the leader of the werewolves for some reason. This will not destroy all werewolves and it really does not end the threat from werewolves as he ... they just want to kill him. I think there has been some disturbing reason for this but it really gets lost in the movie. After the film "finish" we have a 10 minute montauge of the movie we just watched and every other scene is one where the leader of female werewolf tears over her head exposed her breasts while some banding Devo-horror plays in a crowd in werewolves. <br /> <br /> The only thing that makes this movie the same watch is Christopher Lee.
