This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. However, the slave girl, Alice and Jared Harris imitate Christopher Walken is what makes this movie fun. Smoking Alice, drinking and dissatisfied ways to show when calling her name is strange and interesting. I must applaud Jared for imitation of Christopher Walken, and Christopher Walken for allowing this to be in the movie.
