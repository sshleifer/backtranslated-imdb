Where to start? How best to describe just how terrible this movie is ??? <br /> Let's start with the Hick campy humor. It's not very funny. Add a bunch of active actors musicians - Bread meat is terrible and Deborah Harry is even worse. Poor Poor Art Carney, who should have known better than doing this movie. <br /> Then there is the plot. A roadmap whose purpose is to work is an Alice Cooper show meeting a girl whose purpose is to be a groupie for Alice Cooper. At least they get what they want ... <br /> <br /> Then just when the movie should end, they can not come up with a more possible one than one - well, I will not ruin it for you if you really want to see the movie. Some actors let you know that this will make a movie "B" or maybe worse. Gailard Sartain is one of them for me - and it has a more important role. That's a sure sign that the movie probably will not be very good. If there is nothing else, the movie will live up to low expectations - even overtake them when they are worse than poor. Let's say that. This is the movie account that all bad movies compare. And there is no worse than Roadie.
