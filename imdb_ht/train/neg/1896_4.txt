This movie shows we are nothing original. Each idea or (action) scene can be found in many movies already released. Fabulous Nick is completely plain here. Even Patton is calm and evil or good. Mr. Duvall is ok, but has a very small part. So, Angelina, so how can we determine his newly acclaimed limbs? In general, there are too many characters, so nobody and nothing specifically detailed. This makes the movie easy to forget. Too bad, do not you think?
