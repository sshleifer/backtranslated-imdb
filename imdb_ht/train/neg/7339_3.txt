Maya is a woman without any interest. It's just his dreams to go with wonder, why he does not feel fulfilled. This could be an interesting topic. That would need a good story, a nice setting and good dialogue. It does not have any of these. This movie is totally boring. There are only lengths and no climate. The highest point is Shahrukh Khan. But although I'm a big fan of it, I could not stand this movie. Even she can not make this movie out. The movie is not as bad as "king uncle" and if you're an Art-house fan or likes it slow, you may possibly like it. It's not funny, it's not interesting, it does not catch. My recommendation: Do not look at it.
