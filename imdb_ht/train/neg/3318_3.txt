How good Gwyneth Paltrow! This is the right movie for her ... too bad she is completely out of role. I have not read the book by Jane Austen, but I can not believe it is so superficial and the characters are no more than caricatures. It was not probably easy to reduce in 2 hours to display about 600 pages of the book, but I was expecting more than just seeing old pieces of furniture and tea cups. I took a sigh of relief every time I saw an actor who had not overtaken the mark of overacting (a couple of times).
