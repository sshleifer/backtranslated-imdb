There is no suspense in this series! When one episode ends the act so shoddy, the effects are so poor and the script is so awful that the last thing about yourself is how Batman and Robin will save the day. No, in fact, the last thing about yourself is watching the next episode! Show this so boring that I can not see how it's ever been done, let alone drop on DVD! It's obviously the effects are not up to date with contemporary movie Batman, but even the script is awful. An evil incuborous disorder on some evil teachers with a ray gun or something like that, I'm not quite sure, because it is too terrible to follow. Look at the 60s version, or version 90, or even Batman starts, just anything about this version!
