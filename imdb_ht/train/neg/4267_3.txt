I saw this movie at the Rotterdam Festival, as was presumably all the other voters. The principal was present and seemed to work very hard and be very engaged in the project, which I think explains the average reception above and marks it received. It's the most similar to a feature episode characteristic of Aussie's favorite "Round Twist" but it carries it too seriously to have the same resilience feature. The movie itself is perhaps worth seeing if you're trying to make a Cinematic World tour visit all United Nations members, as I can not think of another filmmaker but overall it was generic, wrong act (albeit by an amateur cast ) and animals of the subaltern mentality. Moral in the story seemed to be that the native island tries and grips with each other, but as long as a white governor is essentially decent at the stage, all the problems can be resolved (do not leave the island).
