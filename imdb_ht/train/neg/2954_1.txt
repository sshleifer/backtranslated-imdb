I look very bad movie, lots !!!!!! It's kind of a pleasure, really. Almost every Saturday nodes a group of friends and I get together and watch the garbage around the globe - ANYTHING. Turkish superhero cinemas, vampire cops from Brazil, Italian gorilla transplant movies, Kevin Costner movie, ANYTHING (except perhaps Helen), but Ihave never saw a movie WORST than THEODORE REX. Do not ever. And it's not even entertainingly bad in a way Ed Wood folks - it's just success. Now this movie was famous in Hollywood at the moment he did because Whoopi had taken off the gloves and made it clear in the press and anyone else would listen that he had this PIECE at CRAP = he tried to get out of his deal, he whained, he moaned but however they poured his fat loop into the skin of this tight leather uniform futuristic uniform that is horrible to see, yikes !!!! And you can just see her boil while taking - to do everything, but look at camera for her agent so she can call her. The dinosaur has three facial expressions and the script is so awful a third-grade class can do a better job if promised candy.
