History goes like this, Netflix was late to send me my DVD so I went down to the analog location location known as "Blockbuster Video" sucking you know. Real bad, They have 150 copies of the latest host movies for your watching pleasure again I never want to see any of these. So I saw BTK killer there on the shelf, all by its own self. I like to see films based on reliable assassins. It's just a part of humanity that I will never understand, that's why I want to see what kind of thing. Anyways I put this DVD in and all the sudden from the very first one, it sucks. I sit here with b.f. and we are like, "what is this kind of crap?" Some camera operations, terrible acting, - the first scene in which a woman killed you wonder if she would rather just calmly give instead, then a rat gets stuffed down to her throat. I really wonder if the director has a hard-on for this crap. There is nothing decent about this "movie". All I told the director is "do you own a freakin tripod?" Each shot was brutally unstable. The music was awful. It was like they just decided one day to make a movie. They were probably gathering people from WalMart to show up and "act" for them. Just plain terrain. If you make a movie like this then direct your enjoyment-NOT what you should be doing for a living- Do not be doing it in the DVD kidney outlets for film enthusiasts like myself. Better leave at home for your friends when you have a party and run out of interesting things to entertain them .... Then you break out your BTK KIller movie and say, "want to see this movie deterred me did once? "
