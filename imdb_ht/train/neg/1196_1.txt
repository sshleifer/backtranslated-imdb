How can a movie with Amy, Posey and Raechel have nothing funny in her? Believe it or not 'House Bunny' did so best and funnier. Hopefully the principals had a good holiday and got some money - this movie is a troublesome of all of them. It's a cliché from the beginning to end. Cliches can work well with a script, or at least one idea. This movie does nothing but uses cliché after reviewing rather than mind or script. He uses the preexisting character of the actresses rather than developing characters. Bad, sad, and garbage. Now I apparently have ten lines of text for a comment. Really? Why? As an IT ops manager this is another example of sloppy encoding.
