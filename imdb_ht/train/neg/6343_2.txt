Maybe I'm not a sophisticated. This and the closest are two of the supposedly cerebral films I've seen lately, and both suffer from exactly the same problem to a tasting limit. The dialogue is false fo fake. There is nothing out of anyone's mouth that seems remotely credible. Perhaps this way is that movie that is so supposed to be felt, but it was insurmountable. And boring. I walked out after 20 minutes of teddy. <br /> I'll stick to Sleeper and Banana for my Woody Allen ranks. If I ever come across this teevee, I'll turn over and try to get an episode of Quincy instead.
