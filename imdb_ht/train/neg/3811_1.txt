I hated this crap, every Friday as part of Tgif it was over, and always succumbed to great time and sort every and every week. If you want to see something funny go look "No on would say" starring Candice Cameron and Fred Savage, it's really hilarious, pointing out exactly why no one ever goes in to a good movie career after making a horrible TV show . Show this really makes me sick, I hate kids, and bob saget need to go jumping on a bridge forever to make this crapfest. I've seen stuff everywhere but here but here. I AHet write 10 lines! See 'full house' to see the younger humanity offered in the way of art and entertainment.
