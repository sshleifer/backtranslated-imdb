I'm trying to decide whether jumping to a wooden helicopter would be more enjoyable than this drak. It ends the destruction of what was once a classic couple of films. And Thursday, Threat, Clowns and Sith we have death in Lucas' career. He wants us to swallow Annakin's Vader's nonsense. I never believed it was true. This movie indicates these feelings. The story has not worked since Phantom Moron, and each new movie just picked up the crap on until all that was left was a game parade. I must go. I know where some new stones are sent. Do you want to distort? Here they come. Luke and Leia PA are related. Vadys are NOT Fathers. Duke Countoo should change positions while still able to. Yoda has less verbal skills than Yogi Berra. His advice was never good for anybody. Obi Wan has been lying for Luke for the first two films. Annakin did not build C3P0. He found it in the desert and lied his mother over putting it together in scratch. Chebacca has fleas. This whole mess and Vader and the fall of the Republic may have blamed on that stupid b *** h Amma-Lamma-Ding-Dong. If he had any brain he would not come in a light year at Annie, but he said that George Lucas had written for him. What a Drug!
