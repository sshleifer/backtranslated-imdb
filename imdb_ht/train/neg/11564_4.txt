Italian horror / suspense movie about a rich British master who cruises pubs and taverns for girls with red hair just like Evelyn recently died. You know he must really love his wife, because he brings them home - a big, rotting castles - and making them sick and then torture them, whip them and kill them. The most rare aspect of this film for me was that somehow by the end of the movie, we see this guy played by Antonio De Teffe as the hero of the movie. Anyway, soon, under the advice of his uncle playboy Roberto Maldera, De Teffe settles down with a girl he meets in his uncle's party. It moves in strange things to start to reach Deifff's fragile state of mind. She starts to see and hear her dead wife and finally, well, just look at the title if you are still curious. Also, family members and friends begin to die in the most brutal fashion. Poor Aunt Agatha (it seems he might even be less than De Teffe and have him in a wheelchair and try to look old) to meet his fate in a foxy fashion. Another person is injected and then buried alive. And of course, there is a whole explanation of why / how Evelyn did what he did. Director Emilio Miraglia does some good things: the settings of the movie are well suited for this movie though trying to convince us that England is the best of humor. None of the actors watch English. Many with dark black hair and Mediterranean complexions and wearing an English dress should not die in. The cars are driving on the wrong side of the road. But all that, the cryptic scene was effectively shot and I liked the cheese resolution too. And of course any movie and hot, red-headed Erika Blanc is still a plus. There is a trace of sexual perfection; However, which I found somewhat appalling to the idea that tortured women was well-timed and healthy in order to relieve one of her mental demons. C'mon.
