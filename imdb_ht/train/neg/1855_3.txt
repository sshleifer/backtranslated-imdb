This is the crappiest movie I've ever seen but of all its justice in montable and rather funny. I do not think the movie makers intend to be typical of your Hollywood blockbuster quality. It's just a stupid film about a serial killer that gets doused in a charge of toxic waste that causes a reaction to him and the snow (as it's in mid-winter). She then turns into a killer snowman that is enough to make you laugh on her own. This movie is really stupid but it's funny. The killings are hilarious.I would not advise you to go and buy it (as I did-to cover good look!), But if it happens on TV a night and you're up for a laugh then, stick it on.
