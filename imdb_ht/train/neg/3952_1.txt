Back to Boogyman is a horrible film that does not play as a movie, and plays as an episode of a TV sitcom when they flachback in older episodes. Back to Boogyman is just a clip show. <br /> <br /> Half of the movie is recoverable and annoying from the movie first. Over and over again the same footage. How boring that. The movie really is about a psychic woman who has the vision of the movie first. <br /> I saw the first movie I do not want to see the same scenes over and over again and I do not know who would. The whole movie seems to have quickly made a few bucks and its readers.
