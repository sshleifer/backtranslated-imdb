A great concert went wrong. Poor acting, even worse writing .... After watching the first two episodes I wondered why he ever did it in season. The characters are forgettable, the writing is poor, the sets are just OK. The special effects are simply sad - so better are the same time-frame - where is the money going on this one? The first episode starts out interesting then goes down soon - the prescription of the entire show is just silly. Now, do not get me wrong, I'm a big fan of sci-fi and 'geek' - but this show simply does not cut it. As I said at the outset, I'm really surprised she did it in season - so much better was canceled after one season (Jake 2.0 for example). This show was just bad.
