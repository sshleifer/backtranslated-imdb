You probably hear this phrase when it comes to this movie ?? "Herbie: Fully packed with crap" and yes it is true. This film is really insuportable and totally lame. This has got to be Lindsey's second-biggest movie ever since the confession of Queen of Drama Teens. The only good thing about this movie seems to have the throwing talent that is far beyond the movie's million times and the only selling point in the movie is. I do not see how such an actor respected as Matt Dillon was able to take part in this movie, is not he simple scenplay before he signed on to be in it? <br /> What I do not like about this movie is also the basis of how Herbie is surreal and fantasy like extraordinary ability and riding on walls and going faster than a racer machine after all it's just a beatle. I know it is a movie of children but they have gone further with it and it just turns out more funny than fun. Little realists need more storytelling is also predictable. <br /> <br /> Final Words: Unless children are actually 5-12 years I'm very skeptical that anyone can enjoy this movie sense. Which deposit in my money. I feel like cheating. <br /> Rating: 3/10 (Grades: F)
