OK, I really do not have too much to say about this movie, other than this: I've seen more than 4,000 films in my life, and over 2,300 of these were horror movies. While I have some difficulty to decide what the best (as opposed to my favorite, which I can tell you is George A. Romero's DAWN in the DEAD), I can tell you without the slightest hesitation that ZBBBADBAD ZOMBIE Shevet 'absolute worst movie horror I've ever seen. <br /> There is simply nothing positive I can say about this movie. Acting, the dialogue, directing, make-up, the music ... Each aspect of this movie is simply too far beyond what is acceptable that it boggles my mind that this has never been released. /> Even if you are a complete filmmaker or zombie, please listen to my warning and DO NOT waste your time on this garbage. There is no pleasure to be seen from this view. You will not even get any laughs from the utter uncertainty about display ... Trust me. Please.
