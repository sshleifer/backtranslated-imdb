Firstly, this is a very dated movie, which does not focus on its exhibit in the left wing revolutionary politics. Honestly, when someone says that the only way to be truly revolutionary is to cease to be intellectual (which in itself is quite meaningless, since the answer came to precisely being intellectual) it diminished me in despair; as if all of us should return to being in equality - it's simply ridiculous. Our intelligence is only one of many human qualities, but this does not mean we should not educate ourselves at the highest possible degree. But there is no doubt that this does not educate the link's link with Godard's use of rock music; So the rolling stones. Singing 'sympathy for the Devil,' with the creation of our witness, and in which the film takes its name, is in fact nothing special. The code sequence, which is not specifically original, has been used most effectively in the Led Zeppelin's 'Thankyou' (LED Zeppelin II). Apart from this form, 'Sir' Mick Jagger states in his usual nebulous way (rather like Bob Dylan) - noting how the first tune phrase is unimaginatively repeating again in forming the verse. The black slopes shown in this film do not seem to know what they are fighting for, the most interesting scenes involve the equation of fascism and pornography; a message that in fact weakens the 'liberation' of the sexual in the 1960s and today (indeed, a message that would belie the behavior of the rolling stones around the time the movie was made). <br /> <br /> It's not surprising, the DVD became free with the Sunday Times! For a historic display of genuine deepness, listen to the Luigi Nono, 'Al Gran Sole carico'd'amore'.
