Obnoxious Eva Longoria dies on her wedding day when an ice sculpture of an angel (without wings) falls on her back on a truck and kills her. She is then attempting to break the relationship of her former companion and her new girlfriend, a psychic who can see her. <br /> <br /> Evident unoriginal movie should not be bad in a clich√© sort of way, except that Longoria's character is lovable and obnoxious that he drains all the fun out of the movie. It's like having your ears cleaned with paper. To be just Longoria, or anyone else in the cast or crew, is not the problem, it is the terrible script script that sinks the procedures. It's just really stupid.
