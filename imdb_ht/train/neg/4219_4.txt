This is an amateur video shot on video, not a "electric drama" as the DVD loom notes strongly boast. I've seen best things from undergraduate movie students. Much of the unfolding history and an all-around taxi ride around Jakarta. This movie could be made using a single video camera but there are a few sections of the cameras used and the content was bounced together later. The correction is very rough. The final edit was probably done with two cameras, bouncing content behind and out, instead of a proper editor. Maybe they made the correction of the taxi too? In the translation, English was written by someone who did not speak English, e.g., "Where are you going now?" To say high quality production is on a par with Blair Witch is generous. If you're not scared away yet, this movie was an ambitious and creative endeavor, with lots of cool and funky images from all over Jakarta.
