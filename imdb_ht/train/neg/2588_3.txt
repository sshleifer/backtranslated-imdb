The Band was awful, the naked mile was a little better, and this third third DVD of the American Pie franchise looks like the same quality as the predecessor. Basically Erik Stifler (John White) split his girlfriend after losing his girlfriend, and now he and Mike Coozeman's Coozeman (Jake Siegel) co-found at Erik's college college Dwight (Steve Talley). With the promise of many parts, many booze, and warm enough chicks in the Beta home, they have only fifty jobs listed to become from privileged official members. But a threat comes from eyes and rivals, GEK ("Geek") House, led by Nerd Power (and sheep shagger) Edgar (Tyrone Savage) offers bigger and better than what Beta has. To solve it once and for all, Beta and Gek go into battle and the ban, for forty years, Greek Games are defeated each other, and the loser moves out. The last champion of the games, the father of Noah Levenstein aka Jim (Eugene Levy's only regular) runs the show, which sees people wearing arms, a gladiator duel floating on water, catching a greasy pig, the Russian roulette The mouth and cartridges of aged cows, wife carry and drink a full foot of alcohol (and puking by disqualifying). It all comes to the sudden death, and a guy is getting dancing ever dance, and they have cumming resistant, winning Beta House winning when Edgar cum and a girl dress like a sheep on her lap. Also begins the Christopher McDonald Flubber as Mr. Stifler, Meghan Heffern as Ashley, Dan Petronijevic as Bull, Nic Nac as Bobby, Christine Barger as Margie, Italy Ricci as Laura Johnson, Moshana Halbert as Sara Coleman, Sarah Power as Denise, Andreja Punkis as Stacy and Jordan Prentice as Rock. The nurturing amount is very little increased, as is the size of the jokes, and I might guess that they have rated a star out of five, but I love it. Adequate Yearly!
