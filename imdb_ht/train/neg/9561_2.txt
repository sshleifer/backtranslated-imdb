As many others have commented on me here, I said that this film is bad, but not the worst I've seen. There will be no direct reference to film plots or sequences in this comment, because I hate spoiler. <br /> I got a feeling I was watching an episode of a TV show or something, where they gotten a hold of some extra $$$ they were spending on CGI (I saw the worst of those). .. All in all, it is quite a curious viewer, at least if you have computer knowledge and / or technology at all. There are just too many in those times of insult to make me feel uncomfortable, and I find myself just begging for it all to the end - fast - half. In addition, there are many "easy ways out" scenarios, which is also a diarrhea of ​​your intelligence as a human thought ... This movie is absolutely disappearing in comparison to the old "Wargames", and I think it It's a shameful humor that has come to call it an end. <br /> Two stars in my hand, because of one thing and one thing only: the actors' performance is not half bad, considering the peace regurgitated in a script they worked with. Still, they would never have been signed on this movie. Not really a career-moving, but I guess we all have the bills paid. <br /> For those of you who scored this movie top ... you have to do on the payroll studio or something, this I only explanation. <br /> For all those who have not seen this one: by all means, look at it and make your own ideas. But lower your expectations of the floor (and then some).
