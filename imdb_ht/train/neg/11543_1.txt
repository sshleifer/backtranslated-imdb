Although I use this site quite often to see how others rated what I think they are hard or just plain enjoyable enjoyable, after watching this "movie" on Film Maps last night I felt compelled to write a Things down, though it just helps clean me once more. The movie was perhaps the deep experience I had ever had - the main characters played by Danny Dyer (23? Do you make sure?) And Gillian Anderson (who are still Scully as Leonard Nimoy is still Spock) there was no substance Real About - I'm not sure if the first half hour of the movie did not make the final cut but surely in a movie you would like some sympathy with the victims ... here I could not care less. In fact, the only character I seemed to care about was the dog, and the sick came a second close. And both animals out-acted Direction (sugar) and Scully, who were quite frankly terrible. I guess even if you're just as good as the script gives you, and I would like to thank the writers, producers, directors and all the cast to wasting 90 minutes of my life and some electricity perfectly good.
