This movie always throws me into thinking of bone in it. This movie was not just as bad as in low-budget, seriously acting, etc. although it certainly was all this. The problem with this film is that it seems to be intentionally trying to annoy the viewer, and make it with great success. What do I want to know is this supposed to be a horror movie? I mean, it's definitely worried, but not in the horror scenes way to assume. I could see the first segment trying to be horror and failing, but what hell is the second segment? It's just annoying. The third segment is like watching a student study film, which is amazingly enough to make it the least painful segment. It's an atrocity that this film is not as low as 100 below, so get your vote (1/10) of people !! I know some people have given this good review, but, well, they're lying in a sadistic attempt to trick you. Believe me, it's impossible to love this movie. The only benefit of this movie is a life-prolonged effect: it feels like you've been watching this movie for years after only the first hour of half past.
