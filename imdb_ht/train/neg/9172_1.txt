When I go to see a movie about the zombie, I'm not expecting Oscar calendar performance, or writing about the godfather level, but I hope the actors at least do not look like the tension reads the cue cards, and non-sound dialogues as it was typed out 10 minutes before the actor read it in the camera. This movie was just awful, I actually got up and left about 25 minutes in and went next door and looked Cold Creek Manor, which was not very good either, but it seemed like Citizens Kane compared to this pile of crap. On the plus side, the girls were very nice, that's probably the only thing that kept me in my seat for longer than the first 5 minutes, in fact I was leaving after the hottest one died, There was nothing to keep my interest afterwards.
