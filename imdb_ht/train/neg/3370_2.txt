Just an old movie. Stanwyck's first son gets his foot locked in a really dumb-style, and then her husband gets his foot stroke in another really dumbing way. In an effort to save him, Stanwyck gets unhappy, yet again, and comes through a convicted escape. He has a chance to kill him, but fails in a very dumb manner. At the end of her husband escapes, and Stanwyck tells us in narration what the mute message of the film is. Everyone has finished the mute. <br /> I never could figure out how a dangerous woman like Stanwyck ever made it as a leading lady in Glamor-oriented Golden Era Hollywood; Which nose is so beautiful ?? So fotogenic ?? The film is short thanks, runs a little over an hour. It's as if the director felt he was crap, so he thought he'd better keep the crap crap.
