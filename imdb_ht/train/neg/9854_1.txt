This documentary (or I should say mockumentary) is the perfect example of how ridiculous people can be, when they are full of enthusiasm about something like that. Honestly, I hate Cryptozoology. It is knowledge, it just destroys it. However, something positive in this was the visual effects (dragons were beautiful), but some of the information in this mockumentary was totally false, and that's really disappointing because it came from scientists, so that's right for what it deserves a 1 to 10 and not a 0. An example of false information should be the idea of ​​hydrogen: It is true that, according to Chemystry, the product is hydrogen in the stomach, but it is impossible to be produced in the proportion so in this case, you need a good explanation of what really happens in a dragon stomach. There are a lot of hydrogen substances in the nature but it is not necessary to loudly an animal like these flying, and the hydrogen does not appear in anything, so it is impossible. Anyway, there is actually something worse, the idea of ​​the platinum: This element is harder to get than gold, and I can not explain to myself how dragon survived depends. It is ridiculous, they present dragons like animals and low odds of Earth's planetary victory, but of course at least explains why they have disappeared. Probably the cryptologist calls themselves scientists, but they are not. People like to say lies in this mockumentary, and most of all, some people are buying them. But I do not think that someone who cares about science would believe in dragons after watching this. Those fake scientists waste their time.
