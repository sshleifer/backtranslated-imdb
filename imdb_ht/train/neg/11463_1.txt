This is just a response to the yahoo that says this movie is much more realistic than the classic, genre defining MASTERPIECE, jaws. Yes, brains, large white (and other species of shark, calf, black-type, white-type tiger, tiger) are recognized in populated areas where they find easy animals. People do not often do it on this menu, they are granted, but the shark in the movie has repeatedly pointed out to be showing normal behaviors. It's not like it never happened. The chances of a killer whale destroy almost a whole city, singling out a human enemy, sinking dozens of thick tear North Atlantic fishing fishing and knowing when certain people, all the friends of the aforementioned "nemesis", are close enough to the water to Its to reach, are so thin as to be mockable. Much like this turd of a knock-off jaw. Praise. Large white sharks are also known to often chew on boats, cage underwater protection and people on boots and surfboard, as they seem to seal from the bottom. A shark the size of Bruce (if you do not know, look it up) would be more than able to sink a ship like the Orca (hey! That's the name of the blatant we'll discuss!), As it would weigh equal to 6,000 pounds. I could go on, but I do not need to. Jaws are amazing (better acting, better effects, better music, better writing), Orca is crap (blatant rip-off jaws, wrinkles, abominable effects, ridiculous sketch this side of a Olson Twins flicker movie ). It does not take a master from Columbia University to see it. Watch the best movies.
