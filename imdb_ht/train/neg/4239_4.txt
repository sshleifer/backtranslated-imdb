This was a better than average movie I thought, for it was about cable. I was hoping something on the lines of cheesy melodrams and special effects seen in the classic as Christmas Rush or First / Target / Shot, etc. <br /> The cast was well selected ... I especially liked Ron Livingston as commander of SWAT strong pressed SWAT. It's good to see him review the same material he has had many fortunes and the Band of Brothers. The producers and designers did their homework because all the scenes and shots looked like they were done that day back in 1997. So if you get a chance to watch this movie, and I'm sure you're going to FX Reruns everything 50 times ... take 2 hours and enjoy it.
