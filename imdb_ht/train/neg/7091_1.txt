This movie was so amateur I could hardly believe what I saw. He was shot on VIDEO! NOT FILM! I have not seen this love since the early 70's, when late night network showed the film 'Horizon Cocks' week in the ...... video. It looks like a bad soap opera, and that is paying him a compliment. Some of the actors give it the best shot. Michael Des Barres makes hiccups and what he gives them to do, which is to act as a sex addict out of control. I can not say that it is nice to look. Nastassja Kinski as the therapist sits in a chair for practically the entire movie, with very little variation of camera angles. I can not blame it for blocking other people, but it is totally incredible in its role. Her girl voice is working against her here. And I consider myself a Nastassja Kinski fan. It is certainly annoying and exotic, but it's out to fix it with this. Alexandra Paul is particularly overwrought. Each line it delivers is with three points of exclamation. One must direct him in shouting at all costs. Why would Michael Des Barres want to have sex with such a bad wet? <br /> <br /> Finally, Rosanna Arquette as sweet, the maligned wife comes in hiccups, and probably the most credible of the bunch. But that does not mean much. <br /> This has to be the worst movie I've seen in the years.
