This film has the potential to be really good, considering some of the scheme elements being borrowed from the HIDDEN Sci-Fi shareholders. And Dolph always bribes some cheesy calls in his role. But someone somewhere really falls the ball on this one. Dolph plays a bouk-kicking monk (!) Who travels to New York to retrieve a key that opens a door under the monastery that was in prison to the Antichrist for 2000 years. It must fight the minion, which is a spirit that jumps from body to body much like the HIDDEN and JASON goes to hELL. The minions, of course, want the key to let the Antichrist come out. Together for the ride is an archaeologist harassing women and together he and Dolph are chased by the minions-owned bodies. <br /> If I do this funny sound, forget it. The rally is very awkward and sluggish, subparing to the best of action, and the scene of evil scene battle. Dolphin Dolph in his role and some of the worst dialogue in his career. The cheese factor really chooses at the end when the minion fights an army of monks-monster monks in the monastery, but the rest of this flicker movie is a snoozefest. <br /> <br /> Too bad, I really wanted to like this.
