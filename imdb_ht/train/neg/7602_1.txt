One of the other comments mentioned are almost out. If I had not been with my wife, who wanted to stay, I would leave. It's a shame, too, because I think he could be a good movie. But this is unlikely one of the worst adapted scenarios I've ever seen. It starts out nowhere and goes nowhere (I might say it goes anywhere soon, but it really goes nowhere to slow down ... painfully). From time to time there are suggestions that something interesting can happen, or that there are potentially some depths under one of the characters, but that's all we get - suggestions. There is not one settlement or revelation of the whole movie. Not that I need a slick plot to be entertained ... I love a good study character as much as the next indie fryer. But these characters add up to anything. For the duration of all the movie you do not care what's happening in one single of them. As a matter of fact, you almost begin to expect to die, because at least one death can be more interesting than watching their inexplicable behavior, which is so strange and unforeseen that you think it's in itself should be compelling, but it's not . Instead of charisma, noir-esquire characters act in hard-boiled mode, you simply recognize it immediately for what it is: a bunch of talents, but actors miscast, breoding and raising their eyebrows while reading scarce dialogues without a hint of relevant context. All this for two plodding, suffer slowly slowly. Mad.
