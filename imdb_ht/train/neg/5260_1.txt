Normally, I have no problem with a movie or story with a sequel that leaves you asking to puzzle out what really happens when it's done on purpose ... <br /> But this movie really feels like they got all but the last 15 minutes to make, then realized they were $ 5 let's end up on ... <br /> I see it on TBS ... I recommend you do not spend money on it either. If you catch it on TV, watch all the last 15 minutes, then go and make your own end up in your head. <br /> <br /> Really, the movie would have been better if they simply went, and back with the State Patience of Feds only to find that the city and the carrying car went, and the All appearances have never been there ... <br /> "Wish I had more thumbs, so I could give that movie 4 thumbs down!"
