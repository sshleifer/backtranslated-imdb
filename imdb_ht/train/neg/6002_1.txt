"Sundown: The Vampire at Retreat" is a waste. The act is terrible, the atmosphere is non-existent and the characters are refreshing.The awesome thing only on this piece of scum is that the majority of IMDb users gave it a 10. This is really worried.No gore, There is no suspense, no violence, nothing.Bruce Cambell ("The Evil Dead", "Intruder") is completely wasted, the support is also terrible. Yes, some people may like this picture, especially a mainstream society but hard-core horror fans or gore-meats will not enjoy this piece of crap. Personally I hate comedy horror, I prefer watching serious horror movies like "Olibok Cannibal" or "Last House on the Left". In my opinion, a real horror movie is supposed to be scary, too bloody and disturbing, without stupid humor, which usually breaks the whole concept. This is not scary, not gory, is not even funny as a comedy, So do not waste your precious time.
