Faith Domergue (best known as "Dr. Ruth" in this ISLAND ground) is the only reason to watch this movie. The story is very thin, and once Air Force friends return to the United States with a Cobra curse about their action is just a waiting game. Watch the Faith of the Snake Woman and try to pretend the rest is not happening.
