This maskarad film as a social commentary, when in fact it is all as ridiculous as the racist is very condemned. The first movie: African-American = Strong ... any other race = weak. The worst part is when Rapaport pulls a gun on Omar Epps and a Jewish guy. The Jewish guy, in stereotypical fashion, moves in fear and begins to struggle for his life ... but the big, strong, demeaning Omar Epps stands strong with no fear. We also have the conviction of each member of the fraternity as a preppy or violent preppie. The girl violated white, of course, begins to consider lesbianism since she is just a weak white girl after all. When the guy guy is rejected by members of his fraternity it must be dropped in with the skater, which is incredible to loose; especially the great muscular guy who battered down quickly by strong black people. Wait ... BUSTA RHYMES beat a GUY GUY SIZE ??? Yeah, right. Of course the black guys NEVER reject their own people and the Omar Epps move around and they are easy. The scenes where cube ice threatens its white collar and keeps them in line are just stupid - of course he is dominated by one while his weaknesses white collars sit in fear of him, and eventually move out. This movie was just awful and the finish made me actually laughing loudly. Long-moving movement moves between Epps and Banks to become hilarious with their faces - it's like watching my nephews and cousins ​​making faces in each other (and they are all under 5). Make yourself a favor and skip this crapfest.
