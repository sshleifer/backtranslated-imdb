Jesus Christ, I can not believe I was wasting the time I watched this movie. I only watch because I have such a crush on Jordan Ladd. But watching this movie almost put me on it. This is absolutely awful! I could watch Survivor Series 93 on this. The lead guy in this was so bland and generic. I would like it if the big Mistuharu Misawa Tiger drove '91'd his donkey in a glass window. I was harassed every time he said "lakes" and "cabins". I would kick her donkey. <br /> <br /> Jordan Ladd, on the other hand, was absolutely wonderful. A true angel. But he could not even save this joke pronounced in a movie. Unfortunately, he could not even act as he cut his nuts when he took this medication. She looks hilarious. <br /> I also liked the bit where Jordan accidentally shed yogurt on it. He reminds me of a time where ... nevermind. <br /> <br /> Anayways, watch this movie because of its terrible.
