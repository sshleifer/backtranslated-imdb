I remember going to see the movie in the summer of '78 and my parents, and they were beautiful at it at the time. Of course, I was seven at the time. <br /> <br /> Right before the films Jackson came out, my wife and I rented this movie since she never saw it and I felt nostalgic. <br /> <Ralph Bakshi ran out of money on the way to the animation process for this movie, and was forced to drastically cut corners on this production. Since this movie has been done primarily with rotoscoping, the animation technique for people on a budget, this will say something. Many of this film is animation only in the sense of many other words in the word. Some scenes are very obviously just those who stand in front of a screen, and maybe some animation effects superimposed on themselves. Because of the budgetary constraints, the film - already a compression of the "Fellowship of the Rings" and part of the "Two Towers" - has been pared down even more. What you get is sort of like a movie-strip version of the Cliff Notes in the books. Not all bad, though, the animation brings a heat, that I've found missing in Jackson's movies. It's nice to imagine what it could be like with decent financing. <br /> <br /> This movie is also important for having the end that never came. Several years later, a half-hourly half-hour special special TV was revealed, which meant to wrap things up. All I'm going to say about this is that it was a music.
