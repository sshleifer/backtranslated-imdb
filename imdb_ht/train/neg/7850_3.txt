Alexandre Aja noticed in Hills having eyes was one of the brightest spots in 2006. Not only was it a remake of a classic movie movie, but it was very good too. So, almost a year later, we were treated to the end that was noticed. While the original Wes Craven scripts are back as producers and co scripted, this film just fails to rise to the level set by the original and the remake. A military coaching group stopped by in the desert to check in on some scientists and find themselves running afoul of the mutant family from the first movie (at least those that are left to some new ones). There are many of them to be here. What annoys me about this movie is the utter lack of characterization. The viewer does not give a damn about what's happening to any of these people because we have not gotten to them. Even the mutants had some characterization last time out and that time, nothing. Gore for the sake of Gore is pointless. There was a reason for this to happen to be interesting. There is nothing that is happening here interesting. And what is it recently and the movie rape scene? Here we find another one for no real reason. Hopefully this is one set of hills that will not visit again.
