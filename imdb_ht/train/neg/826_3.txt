I love those actors, but they were wasted in this movie flick. <br /> <br /> I can only ask, what they thought to disagree with this crap? <br /> <br /> Debra Winger just dial it in; Dennis Quaid and Arliss Howard were caricatures. Some people thought it was deep. Well, if you like "Breaking the Waves", you'll probably love this too. I was hated both. 3/10
