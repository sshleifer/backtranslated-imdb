I'll bet any of you knew that the famous Conquistador Hernando coast made a preliminary scouting expedition in Mexico before taking on the Aztecs. The good thing he did was because he would never know about these T Rexs who lived in one particular valley where the locals honored them as gods. What was not being deposited in blue eyed Ian Ziering as the coast. Even with the blond hair made famous in Beverly Hills 90210 black color, Ian looks positively ridiculous. At least he does not make any attempts at a Spanish accent. The real hero of Tyrannosaurus Azteca is Marco Sanchez too late in a TV set and a semi-renewable role in Texas Ranger Walker as Detective Sandoval in the PD Dallas. He finds true love and an Aztec princess and life should be just perfect if it was not for those prehistoric animals to worship animals. <br /> <br /> Tyrannosaurus Azteka seems to have used some outtakes from the famous South & Marty Krofft Land Series of the Lost. All that was needed was some Sleestak displayed. <br /> If you are interested in finding out about this reconnoitering expedition that did not quite make the story books by all means check out Tyrannosaurus Azteca. Then try and sit in it with a straight face.
