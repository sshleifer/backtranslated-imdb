I do not take too much time here, just meant that Darkman 3 is awesome. I have all about 3 DVDs, added to my collection DVD movie together. Darkman fixes up with the best, like Indiana Jones, Aliens, Star Wars, dead hard, you get the point. There are not many good hassles, thrills, lying out. Many thanks to the whole crew, and set to give us the Darkman trilogy. By the way if you ask how I came across this one on DVD. I bought it from the internet, however, region 4, as you know most DVD DVD players are region 1. If you own a Sony Playstation 2, you have the best DVD player since it is a region player. Just go to set up then select your region's witch region settings (1-9).
