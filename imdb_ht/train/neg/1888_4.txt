This film reminds me of "Irreversible (2002)", another art-work movie and is a violent and radical approach to human nature. I did not like the movie but I can not say that it's a bad movie, it's just special. I also reminded me of "Camping Cosmos (1996)" where a bunch of low-grade figures are residents of a camp in the sea in Belgium. The same description of people living together, side by side against the additions and all the confrontation of characters that do not match together. I also thought about the books by French writer Emile Zola who was a writer in the style that is naturalism. I did not like the movie and I do not like people in it. They are all so vulgar, without any good taste good. One might ask the question why they live, they all seem to have on this planet a member of a large farce, forced to live against their will. Or you can say: Hell is on this world.
