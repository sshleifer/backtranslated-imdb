hg is normally exploited, and never really harassed me before - I liked "blood 2", but I really do not like pseudo science or play on heuristics. The whole movie is based on a person and SP caused by an electric accident and a witch. I was not opposed to witches, and I love "carrie" (the novel and the movie) but that one bothered me. I think it is because of the main character develops esp from an electric line. also the university professor wasted his time studying ka esp. I was not alive in the 60s first known but if you were not a common illusion then I assume that any theory of these natures would simply be criticized. What really harassed me was the way the police described schizophrenic as cruel, predicted who may seem like normal people 99% of the time and then just snap. There is nothing that can be far from the truth. I hate these concepts because they are added to the public idioms. Many people still think schizophrenia is a hydrolysis booth disease. Those who wrote this script did not know much about psychology. <br /> <br /> there were some decent concepts in the movie. I love the way the witch uses men; It was a nice change. I liked how she could make herself attractive, but not when she was around his forced lovers. I found it interesting as her second lover also burned her face. The script had been touched up for weeks before production and not focused solely on its dumber audience, this may have been a decent movie.
