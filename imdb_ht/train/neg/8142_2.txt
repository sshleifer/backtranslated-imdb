After being bitten by a bat in a cave, a doctor named John Beck underwent an accelerated transformation of a human-rod creature. His wife assured him that nothing wrong with him, it's all just due to rabies or the anti-disease drugs it's taking .The local cop think John is responsible for several murderous vibrators. "The Beat People" by Jerry Jameson is one hell of a horrible movie. The bottom is very dangerous and there is no gore nor nudity. This pointless piece of crap is so mind-numbingly boring that you'll scratch the head a total disbelief after suffering in it.Even the design of a human-rod creature by a young Stan Winston is completely pathetic and unmemorable.void this stinker like plague.2 out of 10.
