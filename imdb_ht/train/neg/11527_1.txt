The movie starts out as an ordinary comic-hero-movie. It is about the boy who took over, no parents and is madly in love with the # 1 girls girls. There is nothing surprises in the movie, there is nothing that you can not guess to come to the movie. Toby Mcguire shows us that either he is not good actor or that no actor in the world can save a script like this one. Perhaps children around the age of 10 can enjoy the movie but it's a bit violent for the youngest. You can not get away thinking of movies like X-men, Batman and Spawn. All these titles are best. I almost walked out the last 20 minutes! One thing that could be good if it is the computer, but not even that is the thing to wear at the Christmas tree! So, my recommendation: Do not see this movie even if you pay for it!
