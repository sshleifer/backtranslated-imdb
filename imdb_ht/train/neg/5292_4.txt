I can not recommend this movie as a date movie. Gary Oldman's semi-autobiographical account of life living on a South East London estate is a violent, Beckettian account in one of Dante's circle of hell, frankly. In the center of it is Ray Winstone, who did this sort of character before, but never too. The movie opens with her ordering cocktail in a pub bar - that's all - and you've already gripped with a sense of frustration, self-spell and barbarism that it exhibits in many different ways throughout the movie. It's a masterclass acting .. In the course of the stymied and deputy needs a foil in a drama like this and Winstone is matched by Kathy Burke as his long-suffering wife, who absorbs and ultimately rejects unbearable behavior. Charlie's beliefs make a turn turn as to remember Billy's note of Billy although he must have asked sometimes exactly what he left in for. Gary Oldman directed close up on the actors, maximizing the claustrophobia at the flat tips scalor. 4/10
