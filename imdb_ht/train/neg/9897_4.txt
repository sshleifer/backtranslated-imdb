I found this a good movie to spend your time, but not by any chance of any historical value. The painting in Cleopatra reminds me of a cheap soap opera. The twist of reality are ... funny! He gave birth while eating his people! Oh, please ... A pregnant Queen in Egypt (especially this one) would not bother to go to one room on the other for that reason! They tried to make it appear a saint for God's sake! And how tried to justify killing his own sister ... beyond description. <br /> <br /> Cleopatra was the greatest politician in his time. Its decisions were based on nothing but his feelings and morals. He did everything for only two reasons: power and self-preservation! He did in a family where he had to straggle for survival, something he did very well. Anything that stood on his way was either murdered (his brother and sister) or seduced (Ceasar and Mark Anthony). <br /> <br /> Unfortunately Octavian was too powerful to kill and too ... gay to be seduced. So it was late ...
