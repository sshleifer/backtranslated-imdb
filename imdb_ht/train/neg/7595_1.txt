"Ask the dust" look intriguing from the trailer, and we are especially like all the actors. Unfortunately, the film was not compelling enough to be considered drama, and it was not funny enough to be a comedy. He practically seemed to satire himself, and there is no fun effect. After seventy minutes of waiting for things to get better, my wife and I walked out, appreciated not having to waste any more time off nonsense. It simply was not interesting, moving, funny or artistic. It appears as if it were written, produced and directed by a young high school; Worse yet, it was like a garbage that is disgraced by otherwise extraordinary talent actors, not to mention our time and money.
