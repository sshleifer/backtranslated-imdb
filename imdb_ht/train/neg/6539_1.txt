If this would be rated a 0, it would be. From the unusual wooden acting matter, plodding, the exploitation of the small and sophomoric pseudolesbian titles added purely for the sake of sad viewers, this is a disaster in a movie. predictable, as in the beginning one is absolutely certain of what will happen to all the characters and how the plot will start. From a start, unexceptionally starting from a turbulent and weakening phenomenon, every single presence of this film is wasted, with every lean draft of talent dug for this turkey wasted. <br /> <br /> If you want to look something as weak asleep and many of the same childhood titles, look at one of the Ilsa films. At least they're unapologetic and up-front on what they're trying to do. How this bad thing ever managed to be rated above a 5 is a miracle of how people with no normal or normal taste or discerning can sometimes come together for the most dubious of purpose. <br /> It's not scary, it's not exciting, and above all it's not excited in any sense of the word. It is, in my opinion, a crime; It is a crime that has been such an offensive and incompetent piece of garbage ever getting pregnant in and providing resources to enter into existence, and even more a tragedy that it is still advocated by some rapid viewing viewers. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Not even Elvira happy personality and shocking way would be to blame that this horrible travesti in film is. Avoid it at all costs.
