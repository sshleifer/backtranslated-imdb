Marquis De Sade, Egypt, former gnostic cult, Robert Englund in a double role, free sex and stripping, murder and destruction ... on Tobe Hopper's horror sounds like it should be at least a fun, fun cops giving ingredients. It's not. It is a draw less, incoherent trauma that brings little entertainment. There is basically no plot beyond something vague about a cult that follows the work of De Sade that for some reason clearly feels the need to seduce the daughter of a local Christian archaeologist and kill him. That's pretty much it- I think he has something with Gnostics, but who knows what the writers thought. Most of the film is a sudden disruption as the heroine is exposed to various deities, dream sequences and erotic encounters, intercut and scenes from Englund as De Sade's prison in the 19th-century mill sculptures. It seems like the musicians were trying for something serious but also the pretensions they were buried in the cheesiness, the bad act, the sleaze and the fake headless head. <br /> There are many good points. Robert Englund is fun to watch, as always with the lead actress, Zoe Trilling, also not very talented, is attractive and at various stages of the film's film, but watching Night Terrors is a chore. At least I got to see the movie from which "Being Criminal as I" bit from the Australian filing guide certification guide on the front of many VHS tapes from the nineties came from.
