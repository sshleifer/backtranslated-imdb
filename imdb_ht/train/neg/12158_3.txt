.... may seem far from looking ... but there really was a real life story .. of a man who had an affair with a woman, who found his place with his new wife stayed, and he killing his wife, making it look like a murder rape ....... <br /> <br /> in his arrogance he told everyone that the man asked him to marry him .. so he left his job in Wisconsin ... and moved to Minnesota .......... <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> has always set the "engagement ring." that he bought for himself ... and he told everyone he had bought for it. <br /> <br /> The events took place in a small town in Wisconsin ,,,,,, and the murder of the Minnesota ... Even though it was a story feature in magazine "People" ... Spring in 1988, I mean on page 39. I remember this as I was in college at the time, and a colleague I met the person at Hospital Security.
