This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen in EXTREMELY boring and lots of boring dialogues and has some pretty annoying characters and a creative looking creature. The only reason I looked at this piece of garbage is because it was about what 8 horror discs I got. The plot is preposterous and totally stupid as it is final. There is no blood that ever except a single bloody mark on the beast, and a couple of white bullet wounds. The act is terribly !!. Richard Cardella is terrible as the sheriff and has been extremely mockingly more character is annoying. Glen Roberts is the funny rescue and was not funny at all! Mark Siegel is very annoying and he's NOT fun! Bob Hyman is decent, but not much more then. Richard Garrison is harassed and he had no chemistry with Kacey Cobb what ever. Kacey Cobb is so so here and there was no chemistry with Richard. Overall Avoid this piece of waste at all costs! Bomb from 5.
