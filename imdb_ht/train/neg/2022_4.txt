Man, this gets a lot of good reviews of the reviews. Frankly, I found it too slow and unappealing right from the start. I kept waiting for her to pick up a steam, but never happened. This film is largely clicked. <br /> <br /> Shakespeare, and King James English, never appealed to me, anyway, so it might just be me. There is a fair part of the latter half of the movie as shown by Ronald Colman playing the role of Othello. The good points in the movie include - thanks to a restored print - some decent movies with a young, thin and attractive Shelly Winters. <br /> <br /> In general, this is simply too boring, too much repetition of some of the scenes look again. In addition, we all know that most actors are case-black, anyway, but the Hollywood kudos to demonstrate it here in this story.
