Normally I'm not motivated to write reviews. But this movie was so excruciatingly painful I feel. I cringed into the predictable intrigue scheme, the lame to act and laugh at the moment of supposed tension. Indeed, most of the audience seemed very bored and sought even at the "most tense" moment in the movie. Molly Ringwald stood out as the only performance of any merit in a tortured production. Even the "twist" to the end was not. I heard he said that the movie did not take it seriously; but I could find little evidence in the movie. <br /> <br /> Cut should be left on the chairs room off. Make yourself a favor and spend your time with money on something else!
