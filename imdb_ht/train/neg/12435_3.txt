Alex D. Linz replaced Macaulay Culkin as the central figure in the third film of the Alone House. Four spy industries find a missile driver computer system and transport it through an airport inside a controlled control car. Because of luggage confusion, Mrs. Hess (Marian Seldes) grouchy gets the car. She gives her neighbor, Alex (Linz), just before the spiders turn up. Spy houses are renting a house so they can tear each house in the neighborhood until they are located the car. Home alone with the chicken pox, Alex calls 911 every time he spotted a flight of progress, but the spies still managed to elite the police while Alex was being accused of scolding. The spies finally turn their attentions toward Alex, unaware that he was rugged in his cunning hiding-all his house. Home alone 3 was not terrible, but probably would not have been done, you can not just replace Macauley Culkin, Joe Pesci, or Daniel Stern. Home alone 3 has some funny parts, but I do not like when the characters change in a movie series, look at their own risk.
