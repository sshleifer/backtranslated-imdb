Oh hilarity a! Oh the happy! Another movie is so bad it is good! Or, so I thought. In reality actually, this one misses its "bad" good and goes, sadly, straight to "could be so bad to its good, but to aim it and to make it bad." /> For a start way it's too long. Cut half an hour and it might be more endurable. Then put in such ludicrous scheme as "the man who sabotages the mission to save the Earth, because it has all the food stored and it will be rich if the mission fails!". Duh!. Or the "pale bomb" device traces last to the Black Star view. Guess what .... just like the Dark Star, the bomb has a function ..... hmmmm. Added to an outlet of "we can not act our way out of a kindergarten game" and you have Solar Crisis in a Nutshell. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />, Goat around the desert and kid's father's phone gets pick him .... eventually. Between driving and ad, Jack relieves useless drivel and leers with many cackles, but contributes little to the story, as it is. In short, it is the best bit of the movie. <br /> <br /> My price for "the most Ironic line that delivers the right-facing" goes to Charlton Heston, who, when meeting her eldest son for the first time in age, comments that his son looks a little "out of shape" also he stands up with his gut inflated on his belt, and in dire need of a capricious Kirk Captain. <br /> <br /> Also fun is the bad guy henchman, who has a bright white hairstyle that keeps me thinking of Andy Warhol, for some reason. <br /> <br /> Apart from these hilarities, there's little to recommend this movie. The finish is a cheeky sequence of (but miserably shorter) sequels to end from 2001. <br /> <br /> Tips for enjoying this movie more, if you are crazy enough to watch it, like I've Do <br /> <br /> 1. Sometimes when the bomb speaks, imagine it called Tarquin (trust me, it works!) <br /> 2. Each time Chuck Heston is on screen and talk, pre- His emptiness does not recite a line from planet to the Apes as "Get your skin dirty at me!" or similar. <br /> <br /> 3. Each time the female lead will look insisted (this is most of the time) to keep hoping to hope that he has an aneurism and will die soon. In the meanwhile the "pirate shattered" scene, keep hoping the technology / engineers will spout a Scotty-like like "You cannae change the laws of physics!" or some of these. <br /> <br /> Other than that, do what it takes to get you in this one. I destroyed halfway through and shook to realize I did not miss anything, nor had the plot (mocking though it is) advanced any. So do not worry about tuning out for a few, you will not miss anything.
