I can not believe that people praise this movie here they do not think of some other films. I have prepared for the possibility that this would be awful, but the script (or lack thereof) makes for a movie that is also in the sense. On the plus side, the overall level of craft on the part of the actors and technical crews is quite competent, but when you have a plant's ear to work with you can not make a backpack either. Fans of Ben G should stick with just about any other movie they were in. Dorothy S fans should stick to Galaxina. Peter B fans should stick to the latest Photos Show and Target. Fans of cheap laugh at the expense of those who seem to be required to stick to Peter's amazingly terrible book, killing the Unicorn.
