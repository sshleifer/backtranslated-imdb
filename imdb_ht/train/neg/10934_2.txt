First of all, let me say I'm LDS or rather, I am a Mormon. So when I watched this movie, I automatically gave it the benefit of the doubt. I can usually find something ax in every movie I watch. And this one was no exception. It has its small roots. But they are few and far between. <br /> One of the first things I noticed that bothered me very much was that it seemed as though Halestorm was disappointed in our Church! In the Church of the LDS, the congregations called "wards" and the basketball court are in "cultural". NEVER ONCE either in the two mentioned names. The Church never refers to the name and the "standards" is as far as it goes on to mention what our Church believes. <br /> It makes me wonder if the directors really are LDS or LDS wannabes? This movie has a lot of potential! He could really show our Church in a positive light and helped the public to see not only what we have to offer but also what we believe. Instead it was only mildly fun and left much to be desired. If I had not previously been LDS, I should leave Mormon thinking that they are stupid, idiotic and disgraced in their beliefs. <br /> It's not a movie I'll recommend for my nonLDS friend. <br /> <br >> Sorry Halestorm. You can do better than that!
