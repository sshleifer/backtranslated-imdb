Sometimes doing something weird and contemporary does not always work everyone's advantage. While I'll admit that the set design and concept of the movie were rather interesting, the execution of these ideas into one congruent story just did not work. This movie was so comfy and pointless, not even Robin Williams could save this garbage. It's obvious Barry Levinson dreams fell flat on its face, but it should have warned the rest of the world on this slope.
