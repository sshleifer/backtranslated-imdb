I was so affected by the real foot at the start of the movie that I felt sick of my stomach and ended up closing the movie there. How can anyone give this movie more than a rating of 1 baffles me. I know the film's intent is shock, but showing actual footage of a dog who has been skinned alive (holding back vomit as I type) - PLEASE! I close it after the scene and the baby is decomposed. I had my eyes covered most of the time up to that point. No wonder this film was found in bin bin of HMV. I really have no idea to see any other movie of this Uwe. Anyone who likes this needs therapy. Period.
