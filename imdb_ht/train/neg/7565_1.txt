This film is the biggest garbage of nine dollars that I spent in a very, very long time. If you knew how often I went to the movies you would probably say, that's hard to imagine, but never-less-it's true! After seeing the trailer for this movie, I knew that I saw it! If you are a fan of mystery, mystery, and suspicions, why would not you? The trailer is nothing less than intriguing and interesting; Unfortunately, the movie is not one of these. <br /> In movies, in the script, in the act, this movie is a complete flop. If you read this, plan to go to the movie awaits some emotions, mysteries, actions, horrors, or anything else than a waste of an hour and forty-five minutes I'm scared you are in for disappointment. > <br /> "Why is it so bad," you might ask yourself. Let me tell you. The movie is neither mysterious nor thrilling. There is nothing about the movie to make me bit at least "on the edge," scary, or curious. The script was at best scratch. There were many times in the movie where the dialogue was just so ridiculous I started writing it about as funny relief only to find out a few seconds later that it did not. The act was absolutely obnoxious. I love Nicholas Cage but this was a miss. Without exception, each performance in this film was incredibly lower than average. The cinematography was terrible and not one moment of suspense or mysticism. Finally, the story is completely transparent. You can see the end of this movie coming a mile away. <br /> I'm not usually a very difficult critic. Frankly, when I go to see a comedy I want to laugh and when I go to see a mystery / suspense / horror, I just want to be surprised. This film was boring, wrong, wrong writing, and an overwhelming disappointment. Make yourself a favor and go see something else.
