Rosario Dawson star as a girl who is dating raped and then starts a decent in darkness until given a chance of revenge. While its clear why Dawson has taken the role, a chance to show that he acts acts and makes a little independent, decidedly un-Hollywood movie, it is also clear that aside from stunning good looks, Dawson looks out of place in the role. Forgive me I simply could not get it. It's not a mistake, as I felt, I had no idea where it was. Yes I know it on the screen, but even though I've spent the best part of two hours looking at it she does not leave any impressions on me that forever. I blame the script for this since other than the finish, not a whole whole of a lot that happened on the screen seemed to make any real sense. People seemed to have more posture than real and what does not seem to fit together. Forgive me for the wave, but nothing in this film, other than the end (which I would like to talk about but it can not cause it would spoil it), and the image of Rosario Dawson as nothing more than an image, stayed with me .What I can say, this can click with you, it may not, for me to read when I can not get back. For Rosario Dawson fans only, even though they have been warned there are several real reasons why this is NC17. (With Rosario - please, you are a better actress, choose the best scripts)
