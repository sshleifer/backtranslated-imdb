This movie makes Peter a Leprechaun in Robin Hood costume instead of a human boy in probably-by-Robin-Hood-suit and ignores all the character features of him who really is having trouble. This movie makes Wendy a floating idiot. And poor Captain Hook a TOTAL START. And of course as every Disney cartoon must have a character that had too much hit in the head, being one of the boys lost one. The only character that was not disappointed in this film is Tink. The only star is for her. The story itself then? Parents Darling do not even get the time to notice the kids go !!! Probably one of the most important points in the original story and broke it! Also the famous nursery scene between Peter Pan and Wendy is a stunning piece - There are no thimbles and no acorns - one of the little things that make the original story as a unique one. It's a wonder he even lost his shadow and he helped him stick it. (Even if his shoes are not making any sense for me.) <br /> Rinse a great story like this just to entertain children should be illegal. So know now if you have not known it before - this Disney version has nothing important in common with the original story - which is not really a child's story, but just a great, great story. That's just annoying me at no end.
