Absolutely one of the worst movies ever. <br /> <br /> Given the value of production, the story of terrible stories, the bad script, the mediocre act ... and I can not even come up with a decent way to describe how Joan River's poor direction is. I know there is a special place in hell for those who finance this movie; Prolly straight down the level of reserve for manic generic generation genes. <br /> <br /> This movie is a coach. <br /> <br /> (Terrible) x (infinity) = rabbit test. <br /> Avoid this at all costs. <br /> <br /> It's so bad, it's not even funny how bad it is.
