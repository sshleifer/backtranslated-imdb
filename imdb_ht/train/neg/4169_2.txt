I gave it a 2 just because Natassia Malthe (like quintana of vampiress) looks sooooo sexy in this movie. <br /> <br /> Certainly there are many logic of this movie, but that's the most of the sci-fi cops Vicki. The film probably tried too much to break away from the traditional vampires stories. Unfortunately, he went too far and made the whole story not just reasonable, but ridiculous. <br /> There are too many gore and too many rip-off-the-body scenes that made me feel sick. A good vampire movie should be more sensitive that you do not need to see a lot of blood - we all know when a vampire jumps on someone he / she will do what a vampire will do. A few newspapers or screams are all she needs to describe the scene (like the one at the end when Quintana tries to sexually excite Rosa, all she needs is a bit moaning, the rest is your imagination). Anyway, it just tastes my personal.
