This movie was based on actual facts? I sincerely hope not! <br /> <br /> We get to see what appears to be a lot of dummy cops an equal amount of weapons in the 2 men who just plugged the rifle. This is a great idea; aim for the gun! ... excuse me, but how about these very unmistakable fat or their legs to cry out loud. Or did they have invisible tanks to protect them? were they from Crypton? Do I miss something here? <br /> <br /> This movie started out decent enough but after 20 minutes of shooting-out it really took a boringlane turn. That documentary style did not work for me either, but that's just something to get likable or not. <br /> <br /> Very incredible thing that makes it hard to see it in 'until the end. 3/10 for the fine correction.
