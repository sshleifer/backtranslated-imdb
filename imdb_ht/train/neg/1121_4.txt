In the first few minutes of this Dutch thriller, we learn that Krabbe is a gay literary writer who sleeps panties, fantasizing about his roommate, trying to steal a magazine from a news stand, and lust after a man young students meet at the train station. And he is the hero of this nonsensical film that is all the dresses (except for the Krabbe at least one scene too much) but he has nowhere to go. The basic draw is very simple, but is dragged out of almost two hours before reaching a pointless conclusion. Verhoeven has a beautiful visual flair but resorts in the wild halloween scene, bra meaning, and free gay when it runs out of mind.
