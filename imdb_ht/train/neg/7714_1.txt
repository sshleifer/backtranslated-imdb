Awlright, damn it, the MooCow will grudgingly admit the truth: I'm kinda like this cheap, the cheesy 70's cheesy. The idea that the vast hordes of killer tomatoes to destroy the U.S. is a great idea, and in spite of itself, the moovie gives some decent chuck, moostly the eye of fearful addiction runs far away, obviously fake tomatoes. This film, along with the Kentucky Fried Moovie, is one of the earliest attempts of parody, which has become so popular in the 80's and 90's, thanks to hugely aircraft! This one, like moost parasites, is very poor. Many attempts at humor are breakfast failure, and will induce many plainly. But thanks to the quiet hordes of the hordes, the sick "Love Truth" songs, and the awesome awesome awesome scene, attacks of the killer tomatoes give some merchandise, though largely for wrong purposes. There are sooooo things that are wrong with this movie ... and so right, it's hard to explain. People alone must also liked it as Tomatoes have made a comeback of 2 moore films, with a cartoon series !! The great rock of the past is very dainty tomatoes. And searched these 70 dresses, dude !! ; = 8) This tomato is tired of cheese, but worth a chuckle or two; The MooCow says grab a pizza and pop into the tomatoes !! : ??
