I saw this movie in DVD format. My copy was affected but I was disappointed with the lack of menu screens for the DVD. I'll say my first reason for watching this film was Claire Forlani. While fun to watch, I feel he did not live up to my expectations that I was too far to get into his other movie. I actually was equally happy to see Arkin turn into a comic performance. Two other actors I have not been very familiar with so I can not compare their performance, however they were fairly enjoyable too. The act is only endearing quality of this movie in my opinion. The story line, while some may say a bit compelling, missed the direction. I feel that the main problem stems from the script and not the direction of this movie. If you enjoy any of these actors in an exceptional limit then I recommend this movie, but otherwise leave it alone.
