I read this Thornton Wilder play last year in eighth grade. I was also forced to sit in this weak translation of it on screen. Let me tell you, it's not a play playing terrific, it's easy to surpass, but her man deserves a better shot. The act was really lacking, the honest-looking landscape-looks like it was born out of cardboard by a group of three-year-olds. As if it could not get worse, the sound quality is disgusting ... there's this self-numbing 'buzz' every time a speaker speaks ... and I myself could not help but notice that The chemistry between George and Emily, well, is not existing. The actors all seem very comfortable to be there. There is no music. It is in black and white, which should be OK but it carries out the cheese in it all the more. In any case I think if you're going to make a point of viewing this movie, which I'm not really recomomend, then do not target your expected high. The game, as flying as it is, is probably best.
