What a complete waste of time. The movie starts as a script in the Saw series, but with even worse act. Melissa Joan Hart is absolutely awful. The finish is ridiculous and the story has no twists, does not draw surprises and just a bad valley finish. I loved some of the characters and I was hoping for everything to be tied together in the end. It just does not happen. It's a total "Wrestle" finish with any of the good acting. I can not believe I spent the time watching this. It's not "fun" as some people put it. A guy in a mask kidnaps people connected with the forces of his face out. The connection is a stretch and should have shot the main actress first.
