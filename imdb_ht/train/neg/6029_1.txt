If you are wondering where many of the conspiracy theories and paranoid ideas about the United Nations, Israel, and international affairs come from, look no further. This is not a Hollywood movie leaked film based on some biblical passages. Instead, this film was made by a company (Cloud Ten Photo) and a political and religious agenda. As a movie, the result ends at times more like clips from a televangelism program (complete with family prayers and light breaks in church windows while playing guitar). <br /> For mainstream viewers, it can be hard to believe, but many believe in this stuff literally, as presented in the movie. And that, perhaps, makes the movie important. You probably will not find a more concise display of the scarce views of a significant number of your fellow citizens. So, if you see it, view it as a social / cultural document. If you are in any media savvy, you do not need to be warned about the reckless attempts at propaganda and manipulation of the movie.
