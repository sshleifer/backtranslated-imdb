Lines No No Sleeps is not a bad idea, and the subject is in quite a bit of interest. But in all of this movie, we said loudly, "These filmmakers go to the problem of finding good places, the lighting is good, makeup and hair are good ... why the sound is so bad? " Throughout the movie the sound was repeated, sick and many in the dialogue were unimaginable. <br /> There are some good acting in this movie, and I think Jim Thalman is really a good actor. This story, with some of the same actors, would be worth doing as a high-budget film. <br /> I just can not repeat enough - if you have a limited budget, dedicate more to good sound. Sound is as much a part of a movie like the image, and it's worth doing the right thing. Could have earned a 6.
