I got Mirror Mirror mostly because Yvonne De Carlo was in it (I thought it was great in American Gothic) but sadly she did not have a very big role in this movie. It starts with OK and the pace is moving along nicely ... but in the end it starts getting a bit tiring and dull. This does not mean that this is a boring film, but it's just very average and nothing spectacular. I did not like the side of "posession" in it and there was no decent Gore decent. Plus the 'main' story was very confusing and the finish did not make much sense at all. I did as the story surrounding the Gothic girl and how she revenge on his tormentors. <br /> I would not particularly recommend Ice Mirror fan horror - it's nothing to wet yourself on.
