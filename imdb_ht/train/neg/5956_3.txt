Another horror movie in which a teenager goof-ball fights a fool with his supernatural sidekick who wants to take over? Yes, but the fact that this one came from Canada gives it a slightly different feel. "The brain" has nasty teenagers Jim Majelewski is getting put into a treatment that has led leaders from a cult leader to help with a great "ugly" brain. Did Jim stop her? I guess that since our northern neighbor has accomplished all that has been accomplished, they will be able to make at least one ridiculous horror movie. But still, they will probably want to be known to have national health care and everyone. The bad guy had a brain. Why did not people make this movie?
