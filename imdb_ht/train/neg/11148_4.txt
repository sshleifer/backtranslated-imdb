This is the first example of low budget, winning on what would be a good story line. Let's bring Samir Armstrong (he saw his work on OC I know he can do better), then get a better script and budget. The special effects were so bad, and especially bad computer products, that it almost lost me and the first time the wild beasts were seen on the screen. And the Samaritan Armstrong (alerts!) Changing in a werewolf made by reducing it to first in a bad GCIF face before it even started to change (Final Fantasy people, as well as Pixar's made these ridiculous, thinking of the face as a Barbie Naked Doll). <br /> The story was interesting, though the idea of ​​bloodline in werewolves is nothing new. As it also received the balance between evil, (perhaps) not so bad, and the possible end of man-kind should be the two lines mate. Subplot of a "book of werewolf linage" has been effective in some of the other characters in a spell-like manner as temporary was effective, but could have expanded further by explaining what has happened in the past. <br /> Bring to a better script and direction, and I would return again.
