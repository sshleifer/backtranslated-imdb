I think that any such novel as much of a downer as Moby Dick would not find much favor and audience of depression that had enough of their own problems. But any resemblance to the classic Herman Melville novel is a pure coincidence. <br /> <br /> In fact half of the film is a prequel to the main story as we know it, not too much of it kept for the movie. We first met Ahab Creely (she had a last name and a brother) as a joy happy soul with two feet and intent to marry Joan Bennett who is Mapple's daughter. That brother Derek, played by Lloyd Hughes, also wants to marry Bennett. John Barrymore is Ahab at a top performance. Barrymore did not properly master the soundtrack and gave out with all the egrogens of the eras in silence plus a voice that would shake the booths in any movie theater this movie has played in. We see Ahab loses his leg Moby Dick's big candle and I said the ampoule scene was very naughty. Of course this was all before the Code. Still I'm sure 1930's audience tangled. <br /> And the story of Ahab's hunt for the candle that he thought made him unsightly in Joan Bennett's eyes. This is not exactly Melville's motivation, in fact, there is no female character of Moby Dick as he wrote it. <br /> One of the things Melville did was to invest the crew of Pequod's flagship Ahab and personality. Other than the Queequeg harpooner Kanibal names have, but not their personality. Starbucks and Stubbs can as well be Smith and Jones. <br /> I would see this version of Moby Dick strictly for curiosity and nothing else.
