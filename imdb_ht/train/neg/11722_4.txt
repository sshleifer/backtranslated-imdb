The problem with the CONTRACTER summed up at the opening stage. The CIA wants an international terrorist death so contact the Black Asss Assassin James Dial. The terrorist will appear in Bailey's old London court which begs the question why they want to strike a terrorist if he will spend the rest of his life in prison? It will come from either direction. Does not the CIA have a chance before it was arrested? If not a few chances it gets a guilty verdict then kill him. There is no logical reason to kill someone who will spend life in a maximum security prison. <br /> Since the citizen sets the story a hearing might choose to ignore the plot hole but the assassination of himself poured fuel on the fire. The Dial Colle has been killed by a police officer and the taxis are driving in crash but Dial managed to escape. So, the police were close enough to shoot someone, but too far to arrest someone in a car crash? This film is comic to draw. And Dial finds a police inspector displaying a gun in his saying "This airport is surrounded by armed copies" again Dial managed to save very easily without explanation. The whole movie cheats its audience does not rely on anything that has never been explained. This includes an important supporting character named Emily Day. Why does it help Dial even if it is saved? You guess is as good as me <br /> <br /> This is a poorly-throttled thriller and should not be taken off by the "big name" cast. Wesley Snipes was used to qualify as a movie star, but he killed his career by starring in more and more films inconsequently. Charles Dans also appears in the big Hollywood budget production as the latest HERO and ALIEN 3 action but yet he is a better known person to appear in the direct DVD DVD ticket these days, and he has basically played a role as a whole way. Love of Lena Headey can go to become big players in movies but they certainly fail to put the contractor on their resume
