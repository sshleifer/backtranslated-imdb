What ever you do not waste your time on this useless. movie. A remake that did not need to be retold. Everyone from the theater had the same comments. The worst movie I've ever seen. Save your time with money !!! <br /> Nicgolas Cage Cycling, swimming in black water and rolling down hills while being attacked by bees but still suits it still perfectly pressed with white circles until the very last stage. Although a good cast with Ellen Bernstein and the acting cage was just as incredible as the movie itself. It's amazing how good actors can make these cinemas bad. Not to find a copy of the first script. If you still have any interest at all in viewing the movie at least so much to read out on DVD.
