This is a movie where actors are indeed, especially Brigitte Bako and Erik Palladino, in a movie where every one of the three couples meets in a feeling that verrrrry feels forced to be either beautiful or to put the story in motion. In other words, it feels like they are scenes movie scenes, not as real life. Even though women who work in peepers ever go out with one of their clients, it just does not seem realistic along the way he writes in this movie. Also, when one of the characters meets women overweight in the movie, it feels artificial, the way they look at each other seconds after discussing. Again, the actors are indeed, and the moment the movie is beautiful, but overall yet another indie who could have used some rewrite before production rolled.
