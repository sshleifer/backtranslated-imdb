Brainless movie about a good looking but brainless couple who decided to live their dreams and take people on diving tours. The pair almost immediately makes the wrong choice of customers and get mixed up with some people seeking to restore the items that we see falling off the ocean floor during the opening credit sequence. Large looking video films could be so much better if it was not so interested in primarily looking good. Performance is the service and the plot is actually not bad, or should have the director and producer by redirecting the entrust to making sure we see many people in bathing costumes (or in what I guess the reason for "unrated "moniker a few breast leakage). The movie never generates any tension or rise above the level of a forgettable TV movie. If you get roped in this view you will not hack your eyes since the eye candy is beautiful, but we really need to stop producers from making films that excuse to have a paid vacation.
