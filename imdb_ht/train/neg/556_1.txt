In my book "Basic Instance" was a perfect movie. It has been outstanding acting on the parts of Stone, Douglas and all the actors supporting the role of Demi. It has beautiful photography, music and the noirest script ever. All of it adds up to a movie that is as good as it will ever get! <br /> <br /> This end is the exact opposite, it can not possibly be worse, badly acting with a lame script, combined with totally stupid direction, this is really bad, boring, annoying . The only thing that a bit keeps focusing is the relatively short wait for the next stage that is an exact copy of the re-publish of the original. These copies are so bad they make you laugh and I laugh much in spite of myself, because it was like watching her demolished in a shining monument. The only thing that is good in these terrible mess is the extract of the Goldsmith Jerry score in BI1. Michael Caton-Jones and half-wit responsible for the same script included "No Smoking in this Room" dialogue in the scene of interrogation and yes he sends his lawyer (who is now a jurist) away! <br /> I'm sorry I've seen this terrible movie that should never have done! It does damage to the original, so bad is it. The only payback value is the realization of cosmetic surgery (and I'm sure Ms Stone gives the money the best seller can buy) can do a good job but it can obviously not restore the perfection of the original. And what concerns the human body applied to film-making, too. There should be a law: Never make a sequel to a perfect movie!
