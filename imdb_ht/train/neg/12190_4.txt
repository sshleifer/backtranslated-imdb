One of the worst Scorsese. An average thriller; The only thing to recommend is De Niro playing the psychological. The final is typically in this genre on-the-top, and yet another almost invincible, immune-to-pain cruel. I did not like the original 60s, and this version was not much of an improvement over it. I have no idea why Scorsese wasted his time on a rumor. Then again, consider how her recent movie movie (I refer to her Buddhist film her mat and those with her new favorite actress, the Blonde Girl Said Caprio) this is Not even that bad by comparison. And considering Spielberg wanted to make the renewal ... could be far worse.
