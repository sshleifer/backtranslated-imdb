Let me first state that I love Western & Civil War history. I am also considering John Ford as an excellent director. I also had the same high sentiment for John Wayne and the ability to act William Holden. <br /> I can not remember if I saw this film when it first came out in 1959. Last night was the first time I saw it since then as with my 4 rating, one can say I'm not did love the movie. <br /> I'm currently trying to say some of its imperfections. <br /> <Jan Lee Mahin wrote scenario of Harold Sinclair's novel, was a very gifted extreme & wrote many good scripts, this script is badly written & seriously done. They mentioned the terrible condition of Andersonville's jail, at the time of Andersonville's film was not in operation. They also used rifles that were not used at the time. <br /> <br /> John Ford has been directing film for over 40 years & won 4 Oscars. It should be sick while doing this. Normal style it was missing. It might be that this movie was in the south and east and not in Monument Valley. He normally had a stock company in the player he used in almost all his films, MOST was missing this time. This time only cowboy miners star Hoot Gibson & Ken Curtiss have the role & of course Anna Lee has a small role. There were no other familiar faces except for 3 stars. (see below) Mr. Ford stock company made most of its classic films; Sadly missing here. <br /> Now we reach the main star John Wayne & William Holden. The Duke also was sick, he looks out of place here. This sort of role usually fit her style perfectly, it was just adequate here. Wiliam Holden did the best she could, but nowhere as good as she usually was. <br /> <br /> She asked for an actress of this type of movie. Here's her first big role (second film) is Towers Constance, a very handsome, but not really an actress, she still has the role of television. Let me be good and say that she has a long career, more based on her looks than acting talent. Also in Caas as Ms. Towers servant is Tenis Star Althea Gibson.I am pleased to stick to tennis. <br /> <br /> The rest of the production credits were far from the standard high standard of other John Ford film There were a few military military songs supposedly made by the rider market, not good at all. The scene of the action was good but the end of the film. <br /> <br /> Evaluation * 1/2 * (from 4) 47 points (out of 100) IMDb 4 (out of 10)
