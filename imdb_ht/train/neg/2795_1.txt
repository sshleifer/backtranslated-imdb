Cassidy (Kacia Brady) puts a gun in his mouth blowing the back of his head out of Neal companion (Jason Dibler). Cassidy was the lead singer of a band of "demons and deaths" that could not shake the sad feelings of neglecting her boyfriend towards her (you know, I can find other reasonable ways to solve this other than wearing a bullet in mind). He returned, however, owned the soul of Dora (Jill Ti) his friend who replaced him on the song so that the band could end up the album suspended due to Cassidy's death. But Cassidy made a deal with the dark one and the soul must be picked up .. it was burned by this anger towards mostly Neal, but all the band members or anyone in the music studio found dead when falling prey to which they believe is a rather detrimented Dora .. by Cassidy returns for payback. <br /> <br /> Louise micro-budget horror cops looks cheap, there's a cheap throw that should plan in another line of work, and there are so many cheap-kill scenes that are not 'effective one bit.
