Boy, this was one lousy movie! While I have not seen all of Burton / Taylor's collaborations, I can say with confidence that this is the worst. This wealthy, but sick woman (Taylor, of course) owns this beautiful island in the Meditteranean, a decision on a laid-back employee when she was suddenly visited by this traveler, platypus lips. In fact, the whole movie is just a talk talk, and many of the talk does have no sense. Even in 1968, no one could make a head or tail in this idle pretense, and the passage of time made that even more clear. If it was not for the beautiful movie and scenery, it would be worth a negative rating. The only thing this movie is good for is unintentionally laughing at the expense of the stars.
