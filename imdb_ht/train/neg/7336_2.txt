This is a very bland and inert production of one of Shakespeare's most vibrant plays. I can only guess that the intention was to make the play as accessible and understood as possible in a hearing that was not exposed to Shakespeare before. By doing so, though - do not make every clear line with all the obvious intentions - they have poured the game into life and turn it into a flat cartoon. Somehow, it's actually boring - a very difficult feat to provide such wonderful material. <br /> <br /> The act is the best forgettable - Sam Waterston as Benedick and Douglas Watson as Don Pedro. Others, however, do not make good tickets. The April Shawnham hero is a pouty, relieving airhead that often induces winces. Jerry Mayer's Don John is a non-sensitive cartoon character on the Snidely Whiplash level (though Snidley was more enjoyable). <br /> Murray Abraham (you know, the guy who killed Mozart?) Not in this version, unless he was in disguise and his name was removed from the credits. <br /> <br /> Given that the producer, Joseph Papp, is basically a god of theater, this production is not only disappointing but self-scratching as well. <br /> <br /> Do not bother with that. See Branagh's Many Ado instead - her version is overflowing with vitality and humor, to say nothing of wonderful performances.
