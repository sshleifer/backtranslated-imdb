Well, because I'm a musician I thought, maybe I'll check this movie out on TMC, nothing else good about. One of the worst mistakes in my life is so far, and it's just half done. I seriously thought he was one of the soft core movies and scams and scams, acting movies, and movie effects. But, I do not even enjoy it. Even the "musicians" were not good. I was hoping for perhaps some laugh, but I was not sure if they tried to throw in one-material or not. But now, I have to sit here and watch the rest just until Pulp Fiction begins. Or maybe something better. And now I get to sit here until I have 10 lines
