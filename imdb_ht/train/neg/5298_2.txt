I rent this movie because I was browsing in the horror movie section for those movies that no one heard and could be a gem possible. I saw this, and, since I'm a fan of violence and gore, I got it. It received EM rating which means: Extremely mature. Thinking that this rare and high rating was totally meant for violence and everything else, I got it. Warning on the box said: Extreme Violence, Extreme Langauge, and Nudity. "Extreme violence" hit my fancy. The movie ended up being a very flicker flicker flick. He has one or two scene performances but I've seen worse in a PG-13 movie. Of course the amount of gore in a movie is not all that counts, right? You have to draw too. Well, the plot was boring and nothing really special about it. Do not rent it. I speak the truth. I can not imagine how one would really enjoy it at the point where they said: "I'll rent that again." She had her moments where she kept you going but I would never see that movie again.
