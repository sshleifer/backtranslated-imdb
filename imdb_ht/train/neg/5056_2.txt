*** SPOILERS *** Let's start with the "good" of this movie - acting in Cynthia Rothrock and Richard Norton. The rest of the act is terrible (this is not supported by the atrocious script). The worst culprit is the villain, Buntao, the head of an Asian crime union (played by Frans Tumbuan). I laughed myself as he expressed his "anger" about losing a bunch of money; hunger performance. Patrick Muldoon is not the best, and he "it's a hostile control" line (that's the rest of the title of this movie) has been saved as seriously as one might do it. There is no other main character, but no other actor / distinguisher he / herself in this movie. We come to the scheme. This should tell you all you need to know: In the original "Rage and Honor," Cynthia Rothrock, who plays Chris Fairchild, was a professor of the inner city. Now it is a C.I.A. silver (or it was some other government agencies - sorry, but this movie was so bad that I did not even remember). Hmmm ... I can imagine what C.I.A. The application process was like. Interview: What past work experience has you? Chris: I was a teacher. Interview: Okay; you are hired! I only give it a "2" because of some decent decent and a nice plot twitch at the end (even though we know that Tommy (Muldoon), the secret cruel, will hold).
