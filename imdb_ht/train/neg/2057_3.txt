I'm sorry to go against the sound but I thought this film was unrealistic, boring and too long. I got tired of looking at Gena Rowlands long-tough job with his head and the crisis he had. Perhaps the movie has some cinematic values ​​or represents an important step for the director, but for the most amusement value I wish I would skip it.
