To be honest, I did not like "Executive Decision" - which was obvious to the model - many, but compared to this piece of crap, it looks like a masterpiece of art. <br /> Not only what people are moving in the movie (the theme actors would be a reproach for all other actors) should go to more acting classes, the guy who built the environment does not even see an airplane out far. It is so ridiculous, that about a 747 only 3 presence of the flights aboard, but this is just the tip of the iceberg. This film is filled with illogicalness (eg: use gas-sleep, then do not use it, then use it anyway), which falls to my rating at the bottom. <br /> You can have more fun in replacing your socks drawers or drilling a hole in your knees and filling it with letters.
