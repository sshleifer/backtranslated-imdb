This is undoubtedly Rajnikanth's worst movie ever. The first part was held in place with solid comedy from Goundamani but it progressively got worse and worse and completely logical. Our hero also takes a dig of the Holy Name with the same name (Baba) in a shark and net litter one-liner. The first half has Rajni uttering its normal array of oneliners and style and in the second half, becoming a quaint saint after a beggar taking it to an Interim Himalayan portal where Babaji (by the famous saints he took a dig at earlier) give it special powers for any apparent reason (other than karma). This is really starting to get interesting now is not it? The rest of the movie is about him wasting his gossy monster and power and fighting in politicians and related black magic. The habitually familiar predictable and hilarious application. Oh and black magic has never worked on our hero because he just happened to have a Vir param ... he .... Shakti chakra with him. The bad guys and bandits are normal politicians are clich√©d, too much work and in the end, completely insignificant in the plot that itself does not go anywhere. But despite all the flaws, it was fun to kill time with and calling Baba-related One-Material during public events. It is also fun to watch other curses on this movie. AR Rehman said he had composed the tracks for his movie on the cell phone. That's how important it is to consider it. <br /> <br /> Rajni is very popular in Japan and it included two characters (one called Keiko ... why not Samsung?) Of Japanese origin in this movie just for the sake of it. But the way they describe, dressing and treating is absolutely pathetic. The Japanese can stop Rajni's movie after seeing it. This movie was probably promoting material for Rajni entering politics but the results of the film itself would have killed in any of her political dreams. <br /> <br /> Fun if you turn your brain though.
