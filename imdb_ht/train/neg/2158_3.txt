I can clearly see now why Robin Hood shed quickly. The first episode of it is probably the worst thing ever BBC has revealed. The open scenes were about as intense, meaningful and clever as two fighting monkeys, Robin Hood had no character, and the sword battle was just ridiculous. The worst part of the episode was Robin Hood snogging some cowls in the make-up at the beginning of the episode - how many people were wearing eyeliner in the 12th century? Nobody is. The series could have improved drastically since then, but this first episode quickly puts people down hope, and it is essentially a pile of CR * p. A great hero in England was disappointed. <br /> <br /> "Do you tolerate this?" I will not, that's for sure, unless the BBC begins to understand what is a wise investment. 3/10
