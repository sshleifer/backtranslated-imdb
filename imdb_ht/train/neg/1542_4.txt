Does this time meadows first act in a movie? The character, leon, is funny enough but shortly after the sexual jokes and humor are too mute to listen again. Some movies can get away with the sexual jokes, and the audience base knows that right when the advertising comes over. some movies that do this are American films and scary films. The scary film was stupid, and American pie didnt did well without the sexual jokes. The only role, besides leon, which had some humor that followed was going wild. The character really was mute and that was all, the mute humor was all that I was looking at. The film was ok, and nothing else. I do not really understand why people who are dying are leaving the show always getting a movie based on a character played on the show. The skittles last for about 5 minutes, and if they can make a movie about a 5 minute skit, then what is the world coming in? Molly Shannon had superstar, darling had a scary movie, but it was not a leading role, and they will have elf. but that was good, but he did some mute films, but I cant remember, with myke's myers and the wayne world. How does the crazy TV team never find movie deals? seeing one guy crush in, but only in movies like 2 and a TV show with Andy Dick. but that guy relies on comedy for his life to continue, funny or not. This movie is not good, but there are some positive humor. what a waste of films and people's money. (D D-)
