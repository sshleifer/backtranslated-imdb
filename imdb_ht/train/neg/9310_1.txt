OK - I ADORE this movie ... I'm going to credit this movie - alone - to make me like a dead-hard horror fan. I can never watch this movie alone. I also heard many stories of the effect he had in his original release in theaters, on his viewers. Incredible masterpiece .... Terrible, psychological crisis pants on me .Oh bless the hearts, anyone who made this awesome movie. I love it. I thought the movie was all decent and interesting. This movie is SO scary - this is the horrible film I've ever seen in my life! That's not happening in the movie and the idea of ​​the movie are not scary enough, but what still got me - fabulous acting Brendan was. Best movie horror ever. Nothing can ever be this scary anymore. Halloween looked at its evil.
