Five years after the original Creepshow, another superior horror was reinforced by George A. Romero and Stephen King: Creepshow 2. This time there are only three stories instead of five. None of the three stories are really original or distinguished either. The first story is a horror stoppage, storytelling story of an Indian statue seeking revenge against the killers of his master. The effects are really clean in this story, but it's just too familiar to be compelling enough. George Kennedy and Dorothy Lamour play the senior owners. The second story, "The Raft," is Stephen Stephen's Story. It's about four adolescents who unwittingly spend the day on a wooden palette in the middle of an isolated lake. Soon children will scream for their lives as a pate of water to make each of them so there is no apparent reason. However, rather than being suspicious, children are saddled with malicious dialogue and dopey-led behaviors, preventing us from really caring about what's happening next. There are also some unintentional humor in this segment. The third and final story is the "Hitch-Traitor", which is actually a retread re-adapted for Creepshow 2. The original story, by Lucille Fletcher, was filmed in 1953 as a film film film suspension. Then it fits for a famous Twilight Zone Episode featuring Inger Stevens. The "Hitch-Hiker" works the best from these three offerings, but it does not matter either. Lois Chiles plays a cheating spouse, who ends up running on a hiker-hiker, or so he thinks. However, we do not know if they are sympathized with or condemned. As in many average stories of this type, the characters exist simply tell stories and twists and so on. Wrapped in the story with the bullies seems somewhat out of place. Tom Savini appears as the "creep" at this steak. The good thing there is no more. * 1/2 of 4 stars.
