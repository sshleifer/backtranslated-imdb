How this movie was made with so many great stars is beyond me. This is a horrible movie movie 'packed and worst of acting any of the actors ever made. It really surprises me that many of these A list stars would agree with this movie unfunny. What's even worse is the fact that it's made almost 100 million here in the states. She goes to show however that big stars can pull in the bucks even though the movie is terrible. I was sorry for everyone involved in this hate-fest. Billy Crystal tried his best with what he gave and the rest of the stars seemed to be walking through the motions. Whatever you do, do not fall asleep because nobody can save that.
