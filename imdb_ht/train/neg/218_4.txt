*** LIGHT SPOILER ALERT *** The story sounds good and if you read the novel, then you're probably waiting for a deep and intense movie that might offer some insight for some interesting human relationships and inconvenient. > <br /> True enough, the script is trying to do this, the director tries to do that, but the main throw is miserable. Maria's acting is so dry that anybody feels too, the most intense moments it seems almost funny. Sometimes it seems to have nervousness due to the camera. She only really feels the scene is near the end where she gets drunk by her girlfriend. <br /> <br /> Ioana seems even more tense than Maria and even worse, it does not seem natural at all. Maria had the attitude, though she was artificially pushing towards being obvious, but having her and her character got some credibility. And to make matters worse, we do not have an insight about it: where did it come, how did he get involved with the relationship, how has the relationship evolved? We only get some bits from her parents and the relationships just seem to 'be' there: it has a content and then ends, but there is no beginning. Like her Maria partner, she has only one scene that is truly touched, the scene where she depicts Mary's character Kiki. Tudor is the only person in this movie (aside from the owner, great acting) that manages to prove some talented acting. He has his character's mood and suits him. Only once or twice it seems to be gall (the stage of feeding its parents, it tries to be obvious when it was not needed at all). <br /> I love the story, Tudor Chirila is OK there, owners actually act and Puya rescued her couple in line with style, but this does not save the movie. Too bad, the whole environment has a great potential and the novel cinema could use a movie on this theme. <br /> <br /> Strangely enough, the interstate relationship between siblings seems to be more credible than no-no no-feel Foundation (well, the interludes talking Maria is a nice try in this direction) lesbian relationship Maria and Ioana. I'm sorry to spend money on a ticket, but I'd rather watch it out of my room comfort.
