This movie was a real disappointment for me. I was a fan of Gram Parsons for a long time, and when I found out having made a movie about it I was very exited, I got the movie on VHS when it came out, it was sick by what I saw , This film was not about his life, it was about the consequence of his death. I thought he would be a movie descent on grams of life and music, but they made a movie about his death. I was tired of hearing about his death in books and movies, I wanted a movie about his life, not his infamous death. I was very worried. I wish people would look into his life, plus then his death. The only good thing about this movie was its band. This movie is a disappointment for any Fan Gram Parsons.
