The Bloodsucker is directing the Dance - what a traumatic title, it's so completely misleading. It's not surprising that the movie-makers try and deceive us though because this is one terrible movie. <br /> <br /> The story basically involves a murderous mystery in a mansion on a remote island. Very little happening in this movie. But when something wakes up the viewer from his stupor, he invariably is involuntary comedy in the form of atrocious dialogue delivered by a hopeless voice-art group. These guys are so bad to have the actors deliver their voices to appear as a group of over-the-counter corruption. It's really hard to determine how bad the action is when you're waking this wrong. But voice-artists can not blame for the script. It's a travesti. Unintentionally funny at best, the worst pathetic. The story in general is, to say the least, uneven. Women's characters are particularly idiotic; The guys either creepy or tedious. <br /> <br /> Smok are the whole enterprise in exploitation of the audience. It does not remotely save what he promises and even when the murders (finally) begin to pass, they all reach the screen. All we get is a few half-hearted cuts off shots. <br /> <br /> A few people said that this movie is a giallo. I can not agree less with this opinion. Anyone who enjoys Italian exercises should give this movie a wide berth as there is nothing remotely aroused about it. It's basically a soft-core porn movie with a horror angle. But it's not very erotic either. <br /> I can not recommend this to anyone.
