my friend bought the movie for 5 ?? (it is not even 1 cent worth), because it was written as American pie. but we would soon find that there is a long way out of American pie that cracked pieces. It's not even a comedy, it's more like a really really documentary documentary. Not only the story is bad, the picture and sound are also absorbed. They put in some alcohol, chic, nose and drunken teens. and the result is a disaster. if you see this film by buying it, rather spend your money on something else, and better. If you are going to torture yourself, then do not invite your friends / s, unless you hate really much and you want to get rid of them.
