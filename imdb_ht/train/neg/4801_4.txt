I really wanted to like this movie. He has a beautiful prison environment, conspiracy theory, bloodthirsty zombie, a perfectly 80s-touching hideous and is a direct effort by the actor John Saxon, who also plays a bad (or guessed it) a bad guy. He reminds me of some (dear) Italian cops. But the direction is very sticky and there is no nightmarish moment in there. It just goes over, and over and over, and then it (logically) has the end. More suspense and more daring visuals and destiny as a classic class would have been sealed.
