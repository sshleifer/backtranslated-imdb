I was hoping a lot better at the Battlestar Galactica franchise. Very boring prequel in the main series. After the first 30 minutes, I was waiting for her to finish. Characters make a lot of talk about religion, computer, programming, punishment, etc. ... There are gangsters, types of mafias, who carry out strikes. However, Caprica does not have action in the original set to offset the parties slower. Let me give you some useful tips when watching movies: As a general rule, if there is a lot of excessive titular explanation, then you know the movie will be a Dude. Caprica has many things. The director / writer usually attempts to compensate for his poor ability by sending in some naked bodies. It never works and everything he does is addictive to the actresses (very) genes involved and I feel sorry for them. The principal / writer who does this should be banned from the business. <br /> If you want to be bored for an hour and a half, by all means, rent Caprica. There's (free) porn on the Net if you really want to see naked bodies. Otherwise, move along, nothing to see here.
