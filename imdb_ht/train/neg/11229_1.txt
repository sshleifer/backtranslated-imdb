They made me look at this school and was awful. The movie is obsolete. The episodes have become confusing because reality is combined with fiction making the story more interesting. The schools talked about it as a treat but really it was a great experience to please. I've read that many people appear in this actor, but most of them are doing what they do in the movie in real life. This account for cheating acts very often. Also, the story often becomes outrageous and far-fetched. I do not like the way some of the lines were written and wanted to have more meaning. Though, it was written to be education, funny, thriller, and hip, He ended up being boring, dry, far-fetched, and old. I hope that no one takes time to watch this movie because you should just fine not see it.
