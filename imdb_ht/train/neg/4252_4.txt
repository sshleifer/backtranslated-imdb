*** Possible Spoilers *** <br /> When I saw this today I had some expectations of how he would like, not too high but not low. This was nothing like I expected at all though, it seems to me as the movie makers could not make up themselves in the kind of movie made. <br /> At the start of the film it's a bit mysterious and kind of interesting, but that will soon change into some ridiculous scenes - very obvious scenes ... As I've seen more I almost fell asleep a couple of times. The finish is the most ridiculous of all though, almost splatter / comedy ... <br /> I do not say it does not have some good scenes in just that the movie never becomes "whole". / 10 Movie Man
