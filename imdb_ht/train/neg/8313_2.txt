I watched this on a whim because it was available and I would hear the thumb films were funny. This one was not. The majority of jokes were based on the physical "Geranium" and, in turn, the Kate Winslet. I think it's really domestic to the Thumbtanic creators to stave so much to make aromas of an actress respected just because he (the heaven forgiveness) does not starve himself to the model of modern beauty ideals. My favorite was the line that goes something like, "Hey, I have a great idea! Let's swim on this funnel boat that no one else seems to see!" The third game of entertainment comes from a movie 26 minutes by rendering its value.
