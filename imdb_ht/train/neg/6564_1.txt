This is one of the worst movies I've seen on the date, the best part were Christian J. Meoli "Leonard" trying to act jumping up and down the bar, kind-like I wanted to do on the DVD, The rest of mankind agony in watching this movie shitty. She has a great cast so you keep watching looking for her good, I mean and Sean Astin "Andrew" (played her part perfectly, did a good job, too bad she was in this movie ), Kyra Sedgwick "Bevan", Ron Livingston "Chad", Ren√©e Zellweger "Poets" (to put his name on the cover he has a total of 1 lines and less then 4 seconds in the whole movie ... <br /> <br /> If the cast was any worthy, they would go out and buy all copies of this film and burn them together with Writer / Director George Hickenlooper and writer John Enbom
