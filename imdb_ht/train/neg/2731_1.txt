Surely the bad and easy episode I've ever seen .... ever. They tried to do it without giving it, 'we know we're doing that' routine. That would be funny if it was not for the fact that the 'Simpsons' had already made it. And still would not make up for her if they came up with the idea in the first place. <br /> <br /> flashbacks have taken place as part of the usual character (especially the J.D) imagination. The flashbacks were not even at the current event held, just the compilation said, J.D dropped on or, I do not know .... Elliott falls off. If I wanted to watch a scrubs compilation I'd go on youtube and did not waste half an hour in my life. <br /> <br /> Scrubs have finally fallen into the trap that most sites-coms have, and it disappears me, they manage to go 5 and epic a quarter without an episode like this. I was hoping that scrubs would not have the kind of sit-com. <br /> <br /> And just as a past thought, why the hell was DrCox bald?
