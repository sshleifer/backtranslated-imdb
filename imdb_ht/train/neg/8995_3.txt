I miss the start but I've seen most of it. A friend got it on DVD in the cheap room of FYE. <br /> <br /> The skits are all very short, and yet most of them are still too long. The majority of them seem to have forgotten to have something funny! Quite a lot of racism / sexist / omofob humor in it, sketch based on stereotypes, or skit that uses racist terms for people. <br /> I'm trying to remember anything I thought was funny in it, and I'm having trouble ... The logo for the Tunnel Vision Network is a lipsticked mouth and an eyeball in it. The mouth is open and closed on the eye like the eyelids. Types of Creepy. <br /> What a disappointment. Most of the actors went to the best of things, and this lucky bomb did not catch them back.
