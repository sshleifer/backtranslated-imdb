This movie is about a victims of victims of rioting / comic women from New York who decided to get away from the terrible city's huge glamor and move to a room, run down the small town where he finds shelter in a single-wide trailer on a dusty many lands in the 12th and nowhere. The townspeople are mentally ill, yet so it's time to invite the fool to his trailer. Teasing is the fact that it has the ability to do exactly the right thing to place itself in harmful circumstances after harmful circumstances. DB Sweeney's performance was high school at best. He is one of those cute-young actors and a sweet grin. Unfortunately career was not the kind and nature of the mother who was good at pulling. In the commentator before stating that the act was "so real", well I agree. Actually it did not act. The two main characters are really pathetic, weak and incapable of making mature, healthy decisions. In brief, this film absorbs like no other, renting it to laugh at it. Real crime scene? The wood trumpet paneling of the trailer - enough to make me commit murder. And finally, she's an artist / writer, so she could not afford a double-wide trailer and something else than a sun-yellow Chevette Chevette for the love of God!
