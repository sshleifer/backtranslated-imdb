Honestly before I watched this movie, I heard many people say this movie was a shame. I did not believe that since Morgan Freeman and Kevin Spacey took the role of this movie, and watch it not my own. Apparently they were good. I was really shamed and asked all the time during the movie - why the hell I watched this movie. <br /> Of course I was not expecting much of Justin as he really does not belong to the movie / theater business. But Morgan and Kevin? I could not stop asking myself why they agreed to take part in Edison. To be honest, their role is rather stupid. Well you might think if players suck, then I should pay more attention to the story. It is true story is the core of a movie but guys ... trust me ... this is not a movie you want to give a credit for its history. Imagine this, a smart-ass journalist (Justin Timberlake) wrote a story against the system and at the same time learn how to become a 'real' journalist from his boss (Morgan Freeman). This is all supported by one agent who always has the heart of justice (LL Cool J) and a brilliant investigator (Kevin Spacey). In the end, they beat the system with a happy ending story. <br /> <br /> Jeez, I could not even carry on this. Just recall the movie is getting sick already. I advise men, do not look at that! Please save your money and time for another movie.
