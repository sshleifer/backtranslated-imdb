I can not believe that this film was allowed to be done. These people should be drugs out and beaten with blunt objects. They should be tortured. This movie is an abomination. It's nothing but footage from the movie first. Whatever is original is churning and making no sense too. It's like some sort of drug delusion. So what's with the laying on a naked ice therapy. Also, whatever moron patched along this turdle did not even bother to watch the movie first, because they kept calling Natalie's favorite Natalie character, when she's Lacey. I felt like shouting in the screen, "IT'S LACEY, IT'S LACEY !!!!". I give it a -50 out of 10. I LOVE !!!!
