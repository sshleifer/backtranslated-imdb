One of the worst movies I've ever seen with Robert De Niro, the fan is a free cliche of a slasher flash drill. It tries to turn or twist the genre and luggage precautions in a crazy fan of turned psychotic - the movie meanders in nothing. (spoiler) We will believe that a fool who has touches has access to and murder a baseball player in a lavish hotel with no witnesses, security, or cameras? The movie is nonsense trying to tug in our hearts-strings in the baseball hoopla ending mockingly strengthening and gimmicky. Not sure what all the actors were thinking of getting this edgy razzie. This is as great a Dude as they come. Stay away if you prefer thinking of your movies
