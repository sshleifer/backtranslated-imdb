This will be the most useless comment I've ever put down, but again I have to do it to warn you about the movie atrocities that "Freddy's Dead" is. It is not only the very worst chapter of the nightmare series, but is right up and the worst horror end of all time! It was boring, freewhat, and almost death free. An upright 3-D finish with over-head-top CORNY kills them enough to drive this "movie" to the ground. However, it does not stand there, just adds bad acting, a terrible script, and a cheesy cheesy number and you've got yourself this pile of guano! He does not ask why Freddy, as always plays by Robert Englund, made two postmortem appearances. I would be too if I had gone like that. This is a movie strictly only film, not looking at our shame.
