A surprising misunderstanding from Larry Cohen's usually serious (God tells me too, Q, etc.), Full Moon High tries so hard to be funny and miserable, even with decent turning by Ed McMahon (!) And Kenneth Mars. Alan Arkin looks embarrassed at all his performance with Adam's son simply seems annoyed. This Wolf Wolf looks like a classic comedy.
