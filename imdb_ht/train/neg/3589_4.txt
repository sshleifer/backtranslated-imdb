I attracted this movie when I watched list cast, but after I looked it I must admit that I felt a little ashamed. The main problem in this film is that the actors are not able to keep this movie back. Why? Because of bad script. Although Dillon, Lane and Jones try very hard to take this movie on another level, there is no innovative storytelling and the direction is too ordinary. So for Matt Dillon fans this film is just like the adorable Diane Lane admirer. Legend Tommy Lee Jones is still great but this is not movie for her; far below its level. So if you get hooked by this great look it's look but do not expect anything big or extraordinary. The only thing that you will remember about this movie flick is Diane Lane Scene; The rest is pretty forgettable.
