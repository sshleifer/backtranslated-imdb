I saw this film in 2005 Festival Festival Film Toronto. Based on a novel by science fiction author Brian Aldiss, this film attempts to tell the story of Tom and Barry Howe, twins who are hacked from their family by an impresario in order to form a rock band. /> Almost deliberately gimmicky, the movie is also too smart by half (if you will forgive the pun). By mixing genres, styles and humor, the directors (whose film has previously been the excellent documentary lost in La Manche) wandering very quickly. I've never been whether I meant to take it all seriously or not. Flatback, sequel to dreams, it's all just a little bit. Plus, the promised stone and roll just did not move me. I recalled a bit too much at times in Hedwig and the Angry Inch, a movie I found original and moved. But in this case, the songs just did not look good, nor were the main characters sympathetic. A more favorable comparison would be just as disappointing to the Goldmine Velvet.
