This positive adaptation to a classic classic is very dear to its intricacies. Timothy Dalton has absolutely no conception of the different nuances of Rochester's character. I get the feeling he never even read the book, just sauntered on the set of his too tight peel and was handed a summary of characters who read "grumpy, broody, quiet past." She plays Rochester not as a character or as a real person but as a ridiculous head that never cracks a smile until after she gets engaged at what point she miraculously mops into a bandage. There is no chemistry. The only essence of this excited adulation I was incredulous and also liking to Charlotte Bronte's most definitely turning into her grave. Go and go to the book. ROCHESTER has a personality. AND BY THE WAY: A "PASSIONED" scene does not mean you have your own food.
