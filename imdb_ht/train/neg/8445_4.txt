For me every piece of art must be judged by the following criteria: Fitness, Function and Meaning. Guernsey seems to be dedicated to shapes: beautiful and sometimes interesting acting. The long UPS suggests a function that the viewer can fill in itself. Because lacking text history becomes a test. Someone introvertly suggests having depth, but sometimes it turns out it's nothing to say. This movie acts as an introverted person. If you have not read the Summary you can not see that it was the suicide (and the question unanswered why?) That changed Anna's view of life and made him suspect. 'Why did not you talk to me? 'ask Sebastiaan. Anna does not answer, she just starts looking for a long time in her without saying a word. What is the injection function? What does it mean? My question is like Sebastians: What does this movie mean? What is meant by this movie? The answer to me: It shows us a handful of people who have the passion in a glass of water. The history of life is simple and boring. Motif behind action does not show up. The rest is: skins, houses, landscapes. Nice and artistic make, but meaningless without having to throw in 'use instructions'. In my opinion this film was made for fellow artists, not for the common viewer.
