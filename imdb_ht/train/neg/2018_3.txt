Do not make me wrong, this is a terrible, cliche movie, but it is a pleasure for fans of Olivia Hussey - quite possibly the most intoxicating beauty ever favor the silver screen. A poster stated that it was unpleasant to look at - I wonder what ideal woman it looks like - Paris Hil-Pig? Blockbuster should truly establish a sub-genre of this type of film, as Fatal Attraction scheme has become a genre of itself. When will the blockbuster adopt the "Adultry" section? It will fit neatly between the drama and action section, right? This movie turns around Olivia Hussey, who spends a night of passion and an unstable yacht owner who could have killed his ex-wife, which looks remarkably like Hussey. This ne'er-do-well continues in the blue Olivia tree and thus makes his life a living-hell. I love Olivia Hussey, but I have no sympathy for characters in movies that cheat on their spouses, so I'm really not rooting for Olivia doing it out or stinker alive. (There is a violence in the film of Don Murray and Anthony John Denison participating in a Fisticuffs when Denison says he will not stop seeing Olivia's wife Olivia, because he's just too good in bed .. Olivia also gets busy shooter and can get weighing in a round - I'll let you look). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />! ). <br /> <br /> History: $ (We've seen this first draw - one hundred times over, and often doing better. Guilty, when trying to discourage why this movie is a dude, is William Riead. The man's dialogue is sophomoric and moron.The man has no history-telling and negligible ability to build belly human reactions on the field. These people in the upper-class society speak like middle school kids - with a habit to sleep during English classes. I've put Riead on the list never seen-again). <br /> <br /> ACTING: $$$ (The act did not telephon in "as the insiders say, but it has prevented a great deal by the Riead juvenile script .. Olivia Hussey resorts called Anthony Jonh Denison" strange "and" crazy "in his face when he starts treating.Houssey, which is still beautiful, delivers the best performance here but Denison was equal to the task of displaying a dismantling, love-stolen stalker Don Murray was basically just there is - his character is not outdoors, and Edward Asner, a terrific actor when given something with substance, it is ill-used in this movie).
