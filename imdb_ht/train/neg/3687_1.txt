It's not just that this is a bad movie; it's not just that four of the "best" Mexican filmmakers in this movie; and not only that the script is terrible. It's just that ... this movie sucks ... great time. These people are wasting money in terrible scripts. It should be a criticism of Mexican society but we are fed up with these types of films. Is bad language supposed to be funny? I did not find it. Mexican cinema is in great trouble if this movie will continue to play (and was written and produced). Please do not think that this kind of movie is well received in Mexico: We hate them and do not reflect.
