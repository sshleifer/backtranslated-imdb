Granted, this seems like a good idea. Steve Martin, Goldie Hawn, and Jan Cleese in a comedy Neil Simon. Where can you go wrong? Watch the movie, and you will find out. <br /> In truth, Martin, the lead, is mis-cast. It does not make great slapstick it was known for, from movies like the "Jerk", but instead plays a sort of in-between characters that do not work. No, no one to play in, is terrible. Cleese is member of only partially funny. <br /> <br /> At its head off, the plot is very stupid. I can not tell how much of it may have changed, but the characters seem to miss the slightest bit of common sense. They are disturbing in New York, doing nothing right, and unfortuneatly, nothing funny. Not only is the quote completely incredible, it seems to the message that people who do not live in New York are not very bright, a term repeated throughout the movie. <br /> In summon, instead of seeing this, go the original rent "odd couple" again.
