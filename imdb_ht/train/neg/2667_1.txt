California is confused. I believe there is no reason for this story to be said. It is neither fun nor social value. Technically, the movie is very well done, the performance is top grade and first grade. The story develops in an intriguing way that keeps interest. But at the end of this movie is sick and it is abhorrent in despair. I recommend Californie no.
