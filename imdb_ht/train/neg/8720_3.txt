Save as a repeat from my doctor's home, and a desperate family (new) to look at this one. I do not know exactly what plagued this movie. I never thought I would say that, but I want 15 minutes to fame. <br /> Script, Director, I can not say. I recognize the active actors (the usual suspects), but thought Herbert Marshall was a class addition and sat down for a good cheese fried. Boy, I was wrong. Dullsville. My favorite part: where the "office girl" does with the keypunch 029 and puts the cards in a sorter 087. LOL @ "the computer". I would like someone to identify the next device - a 477? It's before the dinosaur. <br /> And our dinosaur does not have that much time to waste.
