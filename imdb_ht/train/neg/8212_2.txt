I have read all the comments on this movie. I'm a great admirer <br /> <br /> Dalai Lama. As such, I read the book on which this <br /> <br /> movie was based. The film is an ugly and addictive fiction of the truth. I do not criticize it for <br /> change small details or events for dramatic reasons; It is <br /> <br /> not a documentary. But the script suggests the impact, reaction, reality, and change of each main character. It largely transforms real relationship between Harrar and the young Dalai Lama. <br /> From the ridiculous rivalry for a Tibetan woman (that demons <br /> culture of Tibet) from Harra's musical boxes, in the Harrar <br /> change in heart, everything about this movie is fake - except <br /> <br /> for the amazing photography. I understand that the shots at <br /> <br /> Potala (the palace) were smuggled out of Tibet. However, <br /> change a real story of the relationship between two people, <br /> one of them is very important in this world, in order to build a star <br /> Star movie is sad
