When I decided to watch the barbarians, starting these twin bodybuilders, Peter and David Paul, I thought it might not be wrong because the movie was directed by Ruggero Deodato, who has a reputation for creating smile movies but well make smile movies. Well, barbecues are remarkably garbage action / movie adventure that wants to make another BARBARIAN CONAN, and fails in every level. Looking at the movie is all wrong. There are some scenes that have been well shot, but the tone and schintzy, tacky "disco" look at the clothes and the hairs are decorated and just makes no sense even for a low budget flashlight like this one. <br /> <Richard Lynch looks like an old woman with that haughty hairstyle and costume. It was supposed to be menacing, but it came across as a buffalo. And it's funny to see Eva LaRue Callahan, one of the stars in all my kids, appeared in his first movie, walking around in the little bit. I'm sure he wants this dreck to disappear from the face of the earth! The so-called twin barber is hugely as the muscles tied heroes but it is almost impossible to construct a proper criticism of their act because their role, like everything else in this mess, is really ill-conceived. The only way the movie tries to differentiate one twin from the other is no one twin wearing a hangover that covers his ass, while the other twin wool barely covers his muscular butt. I do not cry! Do not ask me who's though. <br /> <br /> Deodato must have been really desperate to agree to make this movie. And his depression is reflected perfectly in this flick of films. It's just bad.
