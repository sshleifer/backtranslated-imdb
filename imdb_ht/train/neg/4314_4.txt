I firmly believe that the best Oscar ceremony in recent years was in 2003 for two reasons: <br /> 1) Army Martin Martin was in his wittiest wittiest: "I saw the teamsters helping Michael Moore into the trunk of it's Limo "and" I'm better not to mention the gay mafia in my case I wake up and poodle in my bed "<br /> <br /> 2) Surprise winners: No one was Adrien Brody for the best actor (genuine applause) or Roman Polanski for best director (genuine gameplay and boos) but they won <br /> Last year's award ceremony was not too bad but there was little in the way of surprises and I was happy to see Returning to the King has swept the awards even though it was not the best of the trilogy (FELLOWSHIP was better), but leaving the BBC cover down Jonatan Ross was getting a few of his cynical hammer mates and pretending they were hilarious when they were nothing but. So when I heard Sky made the cover for British TV I was expecting Barry Norman and Mark Kermode to make their ties, but instead we ended up with Jamie Theakston and Sharon Osbourne! Oh gawd if British TVs are desperate for movie critics (obviously) I'm sure both Bob Moo and Theo Robertson will happily jump over in LA to give honest opinions about the winners and losers <br /> Chris Rock was not too bad, but it did not have Steve Martin while the place seemed to resemble a sports hall and chairs set off! Not much of a glitzy terrain in my opinion. The main problem I had with the ceremony was the format and the "miners" Oscars were handed out to the winners who were sitting in their seats! There is no such thing as a "minor" Oscar and just because the award is for the best animated short or best costume costumes are as well worth the Best Picture or Best Director. All winners should be allowed to walk up to the podium. What a great many arogan snobs academy will become and I agree with the comments that this format is ashamed and if it was not for surprises that could possibly be the worst ceremony in history. As for the awards themselves <br /> Best Supporting Comedy - Cate Blanchett. There is no big surprise for a competitive category <br /> Best Actor - Morgan Freeman. There is no real complaint since Freeman is one of America's largest actors living there. <br /> Best actress - Jamie Foxx. Most predictable awards in the night. Men <br /> <br /> Best Comedy - Hilary Swank. Big surprise since everyone thought Annette Benning was going to win simply going down to politics academy but Swank had deserved it and gave the best speech of the night <br /> Best Director - Clint Eastwood. Big surprise since everyone thought Scorsese was going to get the award simply because he never won one. Actually I'm happy about this because if she does not deserve it for taxi drivers, RAGING BULL or GOODFELLAS she did not deserve it for the AVIATOR <br /> Best movie - MILLION DOLLAR baby. Again another great surprise since everyone thought the academy would split the awards for best directors and best photos while I thought the Hollywood friendly draw of the AVIATOR would make it a seven dead for better photo while The MDB's controversial content has turned many voters into what these awards may be illustrating is that this year voters have decided to ignore Oscar policy and truly give out prizes to those who deserve it something they have not done in the past, I mean THE BEAUTIFUL MIND beats the grandeur of the rings for the sake of the gawd! And time can be voted by the academy instead of their hearts
