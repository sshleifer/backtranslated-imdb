What is this film well combining action with horror and comedy and drama in a unique way that furthered the emotional mood of the audience than an ordinary horror movie. Unfortunately and telling stories, frustrating holes, and contradictory scenes of this film mostly caused me frustration and is hardly "the monster movie ever ever." <br /> <br /> Let's start with the good thing: comedy, acting with special effects. From the get-gone, this movie begins to cut fast paced and cheeky. The opening scene - the origin of the monster - is campy and quick, paying homage to the classic 'environment' catastrophe that gave birth to many other monsters. The rally is fast, a welcome welcome from the opening stage and often dramatically dramatic from other monster flicks and allowing the movie to jump right into the action. Within 10 minutes you get 'why', 'where,' and 'how' in the animal and are ready for action. In this film of salvation. After another brief sequence and the character's character characters: the lazy son and his preciious girl, grandfather, singer and singer (aunt) and, of course, monster. Characters are presented in the context of each other and the controversy is immediately apparent, allowing the audience to feel when the monster shows up suddenly they can hurt havoc in the riverside areas where they live and work. <br /> <br /> The Monster It's Yourself Looks great: Alien again familiar - like a dog and fish pooped out of a squid. The effect of the creature is second to none even though it seems strange it is credible and at no point in the movie you might see his strings. Even the movement of the monster was horribly unusual, as a growing and excited rottweiler on linseed monster barrel in the crowd, slipping over the surface, breaking down and eating people in his path. When the monster's path intersects with the family and the tragedy is truly a painful moment, and you may feel the need for revenge, but in out on out the movie's appeal begins to unravel. The film quickly loses concentration and continuity. The draw-lines are presented, then abandoned, characters change their positions for no apparent purpose, and comedy is interlaced in dramatic scene intriguing scene, while obstacles appear and disappear seemingly at random. <br /> As for the comedy, let me say this: I want to accept that a lot of humor is probably cultural. I'm not familiar with Korean humor so maybe things have been lost in translation. However, as a major Asian science in college and as someone who lives in Japan for the last 5 years (still here) I would like to think I have a better but humorous Asian than the white-guy's average. That was said there were so many parts of the movie that I understood was supposed to be funny, but for me, did not. <br /> <br /> *********** SPOILER ************* For example: after the initial attack where the young daughter loses the family is in funeral; Everyone complains. A new feature presented - a fee - with tension raised even higher as it becomes evident that the two brothers are in luck with each other. They both start to harm the loss and wind up competition with each other on who is crying harder. This competition is, in its core, funny: two non-flu shotgun brothers are even competing in a funeral - it shows the pointed nature of common family love in Asian comedy. This slack-bust comedy poking fun to family and ritualizing sorrow is supposed to be funny, but seemed really out of place in the context of a lost girl. ************** END SPOILER ************** <br /> Then become the draw hole. There are many points that have been brought to this film that have never been explained, or, worse, to explain and fretted about only to be relevant and pointless to prove to the end. Finding an obstacle is not an obstacle can be a good thing for a character, but you would expect some comments in nature. Instead, the audience is packed by the anti-CLIMAX moment when the problem is 'no longer' and no one indicates that it has never been a problem to begin. So I ask you: why even bring it in the first place? <br /> <br /> This was prevalent in the film as problems gave rise to new problems, and suddenly the world of the movie is full of opposing forces that never settle to each other. Of course introducing new issues with bigger is a time-tested story that tells traditions, but if the introduction of a new driven driving knife is forced into another you would expect at least that the new arch gets full explanation. Not in this movie. Instead, it was as if you found several stories, each only explaining 20% ​​of the path, and, in the end, the parties never conquered the whole. <br /> Again, I want to accept that a lot of this might be 'cultural.' Maybe its in Korean history-say to put comedy inside a tragedy. Perhaps it's normal for stories to go all the other as a child who colors out the lines on each page, but never ends one. Perhaps it's OK to present a problem in order to develop the draw, but then removing this problem randomly without any apparent solution or quarry. Or maybe these are all features of sloppy work and bad rampant stories in a movie that seems to have a better reputation than what it deserves.
