I have read this post about Wonder Women's costume for this TV movie. It should be pointed out at the time the movie was made and did not bring its traditional outfit. The producers were actually sticking to the comic book's comic book of WW for the early sixties. <br /> <br /> As for the movie itself, I must agree with many of the other posters here. Snoozefest! I was a kid when she appeared on ABC in 1974, so I was at the right age to appreciate a movie about a comic book hero. But I was so "pushed" and the draw, I stopped watching her three quarters of the movie. Of course, I was not at the right age to appreciate Cathy Lee! :-)
