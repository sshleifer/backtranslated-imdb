I bought this movie into a car boots, so I did not expect it to be a horror movie on the same level as A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984) or the Hills Have Eyes (1977) but I Was think it would always be enjoyable Justice to look. However, he proved to be not at all enjoyable, but rather the acting and the film was mock-able, as the 'unsees killers' murder killed by his victims and how all of the people killed just happened to them be young blonde women. It was a stereo horror movie. I say that for the following reasons: <br /> 1) Three blonde women in danger, the majority get killed. 2) A survival does not pull around in the darkness while being chased by the assassin. 3) Surprise surprise, help reach the form of a shotgun! <br /> When you use three simple points, I've saved you two odd hours by solving this poor excuse of a horror movie, so you are now lucky enough to have no look.
