Sometimes a quote starts out good, but because of the demands that have to go further meet the demands of a hearing suffered from attention-losing disorder, it devolves in an incongruous mess. And for three well-respected actors who did better work before and after, this is a deadly shame. <br /> So let's see. First: a loving couple who lives in a beautiful home threatened by a bad cop. Interestingly to say the least. Make the cop kick a little disturbing, why not. He was well done by the CRADLE ROCKS and white woman only, and is a proven ticket to a successful thriller. <br /> Now here lies the dilemma. Create a disturbing story that actually trammles to bring some true threat to its main character while never going so far to look ridiculous, or throw any pretentious fact, amp up the traumatic factor and make this cop for extreme - an ultra malicious variation of all other super-villains who have hit cinemas since silent age. The producers, and directors, chose the letter. So the resulting film - seriously made, and the actors are trying to donedest to make themselves or the roles they have been excused before, and there are not many very few of them.
