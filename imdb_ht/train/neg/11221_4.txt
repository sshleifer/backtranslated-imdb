Lolita is a rebel and he will share in our great open eyes some little sex history, between sci-fi and fantasy ... Well, this Surrender Cinema production is not very good: very bad acting, awful music and a line story without any history and any lines. But the sex scenes are very nice to do, lots of lesbian scenes, and Jacqueline Lovell, as beautiful as the exotic home of wax, offers us a very good final show and very hot strip. For Lovell's fans only.
