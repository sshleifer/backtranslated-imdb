I saw this film on mystery science theater when he called "He lives at night". This title is much less misleading than "Batpeople". In fact it would be best to call Batperson. This film is about a doctor who studies my stomach thinking because he wants to make a better cure for rabies. This is not really clear. What is clear is that he and his wife take a tour of a cave and it gets bitten by a stick. Why a scientist needs to take a trip to study baton is beyond me. Should not she be able to attend alone. Well after biting him and his wife goes on the bees where he begins to adapt. They go to the worst physician ever. The guy left the hospital and killed a nurse. At the end of the killing guy 3-4 and his wife stood beside him, and you are supposed to be rooting for him instead of the sheriff to investigate the murders.
