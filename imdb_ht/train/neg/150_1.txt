Dude, really !!!! Where did you have been the guys for the past 20 years, this is shocking in all sorts of ways, horrors? This is a joke, nothing is wrong with being budgeted, but this is a laugh, If you want to look into the classics, Freaks of Death Browning, the victims of Dracula and Frankenstein, the Undying Monster, Ernest Thesiger , The Paul Wegener Golem and the passengers of the Holy Train, you can not compare it, giving it a bad name, bad acting, bad scenplay etc. total kidneys of money and free time, they watched a lot of movies like horror is my favorite ever, i really is speechless, nothing more to say that please do not make the effort to look something like daft, please understand
