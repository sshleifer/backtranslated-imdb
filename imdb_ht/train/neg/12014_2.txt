A spy mystery somewhat awkward and a predictable plot on Second World War Two. The mystery is whether Jane Graystone (Nancy Coleman) has amnesia. The best act performed by Raymond Massey as Dr. Ingersoll, a good doctor back wrong. It is head of a spyware to try to find information from Amnesiac Jane, coding information related to allied activities. Does he say? Can he remember? Moroni Olson (as Mr. Goodwin) convinced as an accomplice for Massey. The role played by John Garfield (as Dr. Lewis) is nothing short of disaster. It seems so bad miscast that the casting has to be classified as one of the worst in movie history. It is unfortunate that so talented an actor is bloated to a role that does not befitting his talent. The movie is worth one look, despite being a half-spider and half-gangster movie, and despite having a parade of stereotypes. It's easy to forget this one, amnesia is not needed.
