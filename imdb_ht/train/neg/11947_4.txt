An interesting change from the first one. there was more mystery of this movie then the first. Even when he finishes asking yourself what happened to who was the killer. Some good parts of the movie, the first half start to slow down and then in the last half of the selected speed. All the movie up is enjoyable. The story is 22 years after the events that happened in the first movie, Norman Bates is from an asylum and back to the Bates motel, but when a woman turns up claiming to be his real mother, things start to go wrong . Perkins plays a normal Norman norm again and the stage at the end was excellent, it swang throatly awfully tough.
