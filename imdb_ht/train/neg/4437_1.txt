The "triumph of love" does not triumph over anything. It is a plodding, ponderous, 4 hours of torture. Actually it's a little less than 2 hours long, it just seemed very much again. It pain me even thinking about the romantic performances of these fine actors as Ben Kingsley and Fiona Shaw. Players are supported by quite as horrible. Perhaps they tried to be on the top, so as to be clowning, but if so, I did not see it that way. Mira Sorvino does not make one or the other impression. He (he) is just there. I guess it is, playing in the same name, written by Marivaux some 270 or so years ago, is best. It might not be any worse. Clare Peploe, the writer and director of this film, was inspired by a recent production of the play. I do not know what he thought when he created this bomb. <br /> <br /> Maybe it's all lost in the translation.
