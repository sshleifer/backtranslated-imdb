I watched Cabin by the Afternoon Lake in the USA. Considering this film made for TV was interesting enough to look at the end. So I tune in for this tonight tonight and was very disappointed. I knew I would not like the movie, but I did not expect to be embarrassed by the use of DV (digital video). This movie would be pepper if it was not for these juxtaposed digital shots that seemed to come from nowhere. I hope the line draws to be tied in with these shots, but there seems to be no logical explanation. (WARNING: SEPARATING A PROJECT !!!!) The end of the Cabin by the Lake was unacceptable, but the end of the end is ridiculous. I can only predict the Return to the Cabin by the Lake they were able to watch if the movie was shown to be anything but infomercials at 4 o'clock in the morning.
