As a poker enthusiast I was looking forward to seeing this movie - Especially as she had Scotty Nyugen in it. <br /> <br /> Basically, Scotty Nyugens's spots in this movie are all gone for it. > <br /> Characters are unlike the annoying, the band is terrible and the draw, well, no one. <br /> I was honestly getting a headache and found myself reading the bar number on the DVD box after twenty minutes I was bored. It's actually ashame that Nyugen was in this movie as otherwise I would not waste $ 16 buy it on Ebay. <br /> Take it from me - Avoid like 7 2 Unbalanced! Dire. :(
