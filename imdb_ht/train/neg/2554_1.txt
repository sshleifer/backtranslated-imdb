Honestly I do not even play it joking when I say that this is one of the worst movies I've ever seen! This force dose't have a single ounces of originality in its demarcation dialog or its lines blatantly plagiarizing history. I can not even begin counting the number of things in this film that obviously worn off from the "omen" and other movies like it. For example the "Lucy" newspaper in this film is actually one of Satan's devils sent to guide and protect spawn of Satan ..... this sounds a lot like Ms. Baylock gives anyone else. Another thing is that the orphanage was first got the child to burn to the ground just a few months after it was adopted, just like in the "omen". However chuckily a priest survived the flame and escaped and burned throughout his body .... again another coincidence ?????? And by itself all of the burning priest will stay in a hospital room with pictures of Jesus all over the walls, much like the priest of the "Ommen" whose pages in the Bible grind on the walls like wallpaper. Please do not even find that I started to draw a comparison between the end of this movie and the "Ommen" for you because as I stated above has so far been much mentioned here.
