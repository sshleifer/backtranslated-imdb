Following the successful (shocking) Gilligan TV movie reruns movie, a number of television cinemas were made at the 1980 meeting meetings from classic shows. Most of these movies completely missed the ship as far as recreating the humor that made the shows for special. REVENGE MOUNSTER is among the more irritating because it goes for a Laurel and Hardy style comedy style that really was not in the original series. Yvonne De Carlo, a wonderful and essential comedy of the series, is completely wasted - she has less time here in this film 90 minutes than she did in any 30 minute episode. And since the roles of "Eddie" and "Marilyn" in this movie are nothing more than cameos, what was the point of making them smaller and recovered? With very little rewriting, they could use Butch Patrick and Dont Pretty. Although seeing some of the Spooky family of Munsters was a nice touch, I did not enjoy southern Caesar as the crazy crazy scientist especially because there is too much of him, and not enough of the underused munsters (ironically as many years, 1981, old Caesar's partner in comedy, Imogene Coca, also was cast into a big part of a TV movie meeting RETOUNEN to the BEVERLY HILLBILLIES). Another strange inexplicable bit at the beginning of the movie has the Munster family represented as wax face in a local wax horror museum. Why should they be when they are supposed to be a "typical" (if weird) American family, not popular monsters? This last Munsters project featured the original cast in the roles, had a terrible revival in the late 1980s series with a completely new cast and a 1990 film film playing DeCarlo, Lewis, Priest, and Patrick in roles as a family meal.
