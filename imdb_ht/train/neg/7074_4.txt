My God this movie is terrible boring. I'm a big fan of Gina Gershon, when I rent this movie I hope a romantic drama, with some great performance from Gershon. Gershon is great as always, but it's not the right actress for this role, it's too good for Serade Rade. Romans between Gershon and Serbedzija's character is too convincing. And I absolutely hated Serbedzija's character (a lover organizer), it's not good at anyway in the movie. How does Dr. Lauren Graham (Gershon) was beyond my understanding. Perhaps Sean Connery, Robert DeNiro or Harrison Ford would do a better job on this role, but they do not have the European-I guess I guess. Either way, I was so bored druing the movie. If you are looking for a good Gina Gershon movie, check out Bound, her best movie too far. If you are looking for a romantic movie about a younger woman with an older man, try some Harrison Ford or Connery Cinema movies. Gina Gershon is so melee, and she deserves better luck than that, wishing to make the best choice in the future.
