I never posted a review before, but I did it for this movie! This movie is SO bad, I find myself trying to justify how bad it is by trying to think of it as firefighter or parody. But it's NOT. It is really, un-self-conscious BAD. This is a serious attempt that flops gloriously. Other reviews have targeted many films, so I'll try not to repeat these, but I encourage you to see this movie. During all that I was either speaking, literally gasping and disbelief, or rolling on the floor of hysteria. I did not have much fun watching a movie of the year. In fact, I'll try to find all my friends to see it because it's the kind of movie that needs to be shared. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </a> The preacher's office with his cartons and pronounced crayons of Christ - Of course, the famous wedding scene with palm trees and forgotten rings (what narrative functions play this play?!?) - The ex-wife's lips to match and Ben finds his weapon possession - the detailed sequence where Arthur killed the preacher; He apparently burned it up with this incredibly tile match - Yes, the gay brother-religious fan with his whitened hair and WeHo mod - And, my favorite, used in Joplin in the "artist" as the band opening with the "Canon Pachebel's Big D" as the band closes! - The list goes on and on - a must see !!!
