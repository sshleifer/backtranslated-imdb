Thinking me about the movie, 9 <br /> It was not good, not good at all. Visually, it was great. I was happy with the rhythm, the camera angles, etc. However, the characters? eh, somehow. Draw? She asks. <br /> This movie seemed more new than crap than anything else. Religious organizations feature as hunting and scary. Science does not describe any better. It creates a monster gun that kills everything ... but "soul" has the power to destroy monsters and bring lives? Really? <br /> This is something that bites my ass a bit too. Here we have a CGI film ... created with science ... and are using it to us the message that science will destroy the world while promoting the idea that spirituality will save us? At least the decent has one of the characters asked, <br /> "Okay, so now what's that?" (or something similar). I could not hear it too well because of the crowd immediately getting up and resting for the exit. It was a "okay ... it was just barely fun enough to sit here for the movie but now let's get out of here as fast as possible!" type exit. <br /> <br /> This is one of those movies where you can not think if you want to enjoy it. Just look at the visuals and shake yourself prettily. Anyone thinking about, "what's that point?" will suck you out of disbelief and make your eyes catch the exit and desire to see ... <br /> <br /> Okay ... SPOILERS follow .. So basically, a scientist creates the "car" that is capable create other, intelligent, robot life. These people misuse it as a weapon. However, the scientist realizes that he is also in fault. He gave the car his intelligence, but he did not give it to his heart. <br /> <br /> The car goes on Skynet on collective human donkeys and wet towels all over the world, finally slowly drifting down. However, the scientist managed to survive and create market socks-puppets. Each one, with a piece of scientist scientist. <br /> <br /> The last one, # 9 wakes out to know nothing about the world. She sees a strange device nearby and she selects it. He is satisfied with another like himself, # 2. <br /> <br /> Well, # 2 gets captured by a recent robot surviving in the car. # 9 gets more like himself ands lying on to rescue # 2. <br /> <br /> # 9 notice having a matching hole that fits the device perfectly. He inserts it with the car back to life ... pull out # 2 of the soul into the process. The movie then continues with action scene and # 9 trying to rescue his soul-yanked compatriots. <br /> They eventually succeed and destroy the car. They released the souls of fellows, who went up into the clouds. It then rain and we see life returning back to the planet. <br /> <br /> Which makes no sense. None at all. Why did the scientist want to split his soul into 9 homunculi? What did he accomplish? Was it designed to stop the car? All these things die! The car died! Why harass? <br /> Why did he expect nine small creatures to succeed when there was nothing else? Why not create a second intellectual machine, but with a "soul" to fight first .. at least that would seem like it would have a reasonable chance of success. <br /> <br /> Why were the souls sucked into the device by the machine and then destroyed the machine and then released the souls in order to bring life back to earth? Why not just wait for the car to power and bring life back without the rest of the crazy steps?
