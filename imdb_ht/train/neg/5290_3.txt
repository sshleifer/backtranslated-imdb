I'm not usually one of the slate of a movie. I try to see the good points and not focus on those bad, but in this case, there are almost no good points. In my opinion, if you're going to do something wrong, why bother? Part of the film is taking and shots in Anne's face while breathing deeply, with violin music playing in the background. The other part is filled with poor and wooden acts. Rupert Penry Jones is the expression. Jennifer Higham plays Anne's younger sister and modern styling. Anne is described as being gentle with self, which is fine at the beginning, but she remains the same throughout of the movie, and you see no reason for captain Wentworth to fall in love with her. Overall the production misses no sense of period, and excessive mistakes must be overlooked, such as running from the concert, kissing on the street, running over the streets with no hat on (why this scene of the movie throughout The scene of the book was one of the most romantic scenes written.) Her psalm, a terrible movie, is very disappointing.
