I liked the initial initials of this movie which is what led me to hunt it out but the problem I quickly found is that one very beautiful knows what will happen in the first 20-30 minutes (double they're from behind the mirror and take everyone). <br /> There is no real twist (which is fine), but revealing the final does not make a great deal of sense either (how it can be prey and uncertainty and fear of whole movie, if it is a bad id from pi away from the mirror?). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />! Skrip more engaging, stacking atmosphere atmosphere and on the top scary design for 80-90 minutes does not really cut it, in fact it gets quite dull.
