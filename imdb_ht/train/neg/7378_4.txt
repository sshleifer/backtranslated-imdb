Steven friends, you remember when you said this: "Try to find the path of least resistance and use it without hurting others. Live with integrity and morality, not only with people, but with all beings." <br /> You did not do that, you've died wounded your fans and morality with these "films" I would not even have to worry if I did not know you are so much better than this, I've seen the videos in you teach you are so much better than this why why why ... <br /> <br /> steamroller output was steamrolled i promise bro i am not afraid i will tell You have the truth in your face so we can fix it. <br /> Well, I like some others falling asleep 90%, but to just have I been tired and had a great meal just before Sensai, what are you doing. 12 million dollars? really? Do you have an idea what we could do with $ 12,000,000 It could be in theaters with a knockout hit, if you wanted us to give money out of the big profit in a homeless shelter or something. Those post production will charge you to the choreographer's man who did not exist, we can do better people, the bright stuff from the guys in black movie, I half expected to be smith appearing or Lee Jones's tommy tell you they were gills by eyelashes. <br /> <br /> Your Seagal is a Master Aikido, why do you do this in mind, for us? When you came to the scene, you had such a cool direct style, and it was obvious you are a teacher causing the way your movements were so clear and dry, watching the first three movies I felt like you were teaching Me something, now I feel like you are just being torn off or something I feel like I need to save you friends, this time you are the one who died and I'll go and get revenge so you do not help you make the movie the best ever. bro I know who you really, I know the truth about the movie Nico. let's talk. <br /> <br /> contact me someone i had some fresh ideas i'm a nit picker I swear you will not be ashamed of my attention to detail and we will do it for the fans, fans you deserve Well, we're hanging over, but the beach is about to snap. I swear I will not let your movie out of the door and one mistake in it I'm still trying to figure out if that was the best duplicate ever, or have larynge, but I promise you I can make an impression The better your voice than the lame **** does not even try. I assure you that you are pursuing him in the nuts as his payment. I can come up with a story with a plot that can match your revenge to death in your niche / daughter / wife / dog / home and I promise you we will bring you back, I promise, also I want to go in the direction , which makes people think, if you let me in my promise we will make a movie that people will walk away and have a discussion about it, a serious thinking thought, perceptions to change experiences. /> Steven Seagal This is my official writing permission for IMDb to publish my contact information for the purpose of reviving one of the best martial arts heroes I've ever seen, for the hes hesitated by Italian, hes Irish and Jewish so you call it bad act I call it terrific act, because you believed for 20 years that Seagal is Italian :) kind of change your perception.
