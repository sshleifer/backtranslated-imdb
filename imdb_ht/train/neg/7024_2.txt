I borrowed this movie because not only because its gay theme but thought to play the role of my intrigue. I was pleasantly surprised that he had shot in San Francisco since I was living near SF. And of course it was nice to see shots in the Castro district (although Castro in me really welcomed more gay men than girls). But other than I can not really recommend this movie. The characters do not really develop for me to care and when they finally started to get to the "role play" I was already bored out of my mind. And the role play scene that I saw was a bit embarrassing to watch. Act to leave something to be desired. Needless to say I did not finish the movie. I would skip this one.
