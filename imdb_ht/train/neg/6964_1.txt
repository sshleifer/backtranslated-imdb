I usually check out the MTV movie awards to watch a witty, entertaining show that delivers a unique award show (Chewbacca has a successful life achievement award as example). So, this year was not different. While I'm not a fan of Justin Timberlake, Seann William Scott was always funny-alway stupid-for me. I laughed at Stiffler in both American pie movies, and even loved him in dude where in my car? But the MTV movie awards were simply horrible. There was nothing that was coherent, funny, or fun. Justin Timberlake should stick and dance; it is sure that hell can not act. <br /> I'm curious as to who the writers were for this show. Last year's performance by Jack Black and Sarah Michelle Gellar was extremely funny (the Lord of the Rings parrot alone was worth watching the show all), but this year was completely different. Is anyone who understands Timberlake reviews about Luke Wilson and Kate Hudson ("They're staring at a movie together, but they're never met!") Where was the joke? Kate and Luke just entered the lame dialogue, never made a reference to the "joke" by Timberlake. And Seann was totally wasted as a talent, not even causing me to smile, but alone laughing. And what was the point in Ford's one-Harrison Hardware? Did they make any sense for anyone? Perhaps MTV writers figured out that the young viewers would only know Ford's aging as Han Solo, Indiania Jones, or the President of Air Force One. I'm baffling. What if someone told me the deal with Adrian Brody? How old is this guy and how old he thinks he is? The guy looks like 30, trying to act 19 again ... give it, show some classes (as in your best academy award speeches) and act your age! <br /> I give this show 1 star from 4, simply because of the speech by Gollam for better visual performance. This was very creative, very well done, and caused only the genuine laugh in the whole evening.
