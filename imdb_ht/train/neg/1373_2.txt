This was one of the worst movies I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> I usually praise any movie for some aspects of its production, but the intense intense behavior of more than half the characters made it difficult for me to appreciate any part of this movie. <br /> <br /> The most common was the inference that blocked the building that was in fault an avalanche breaking it. It's okay. <br /> Also, trying out skiing a laval style lava will not work. Running 10 feet in some trees will not work. His misery is here. As mentioned before the dumbness of natural and absolute sort of some character is ridiculous. In a closed space, with oxygen limited a four-year old could tell you to start a fire is not a good idea. <br /> <br /> Anyway, about 5 minutes of the movie redeems itself and buys some appreciation. However, if you have a modicum of intelligence you too will find most of this hard film tolerated. <br /> It's my pain that quality stories go unproduced and yet someone pays for things like what to do. <br /> Oh, I mentioned the last five minutes? Well give you a hook you have to keep watching them in order to see the latest in avalanche techniques. Absolutely priceless.
