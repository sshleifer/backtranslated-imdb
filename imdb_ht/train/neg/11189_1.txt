Always enjoy great films that deal with the super-natural and think deep in the spiritual world. However, this movie just turned me as far as its production and direction. There is nothing to go into deep discussion about what this story says; All I can say is that it was a great waste time and effort to put it on the big screen. The actors, namely, Mark Addy, Thomas Garrett, gave an outstanding performance to his native England, and we saw him in "standing still" a TV set. Heath Ledger, played the real wicked dude and we just saw him in "Brokeback Mountain", '05, gave a great support role. Shannyn Sossaman, (Mara Sinclair), did a great job in seducing a priest from a church not recognized by any faith. Do not waste your time, you'll be sorry!
