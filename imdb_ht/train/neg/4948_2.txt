I have always been enthusiastic about drama period, an art form in which the BBC has been excelled in the past. The presentation of "Byron" was incredible. Incredible bad! The script was obnoxious, acting in inspiration, and all the characters are terribly insipid. Apparently Byron was "crazy and dangerous to know", and put the all-a-flutter hearts. Not in this production. Here he appeared as a tawdry fly-up little inject instead of a fire hero of women and the Greek struggle for independence. He said that Byron walked with a bump. This painting of the man was just bumpy all over. <br /> I watch every two and a half hours waiting for something to induce. Not a splutter, not even a glimmer. It was pronounced Tedya, if not bored, since they began to finish. <br /> <br /> Having the opinion that no one is ever better Bard of Avon, I believe that Byron's revered poetry and my mind should leak on the back burner , and this dramatization in his life should accord the same treatment. <br /> I think the BBC loses its nostalgia with this one
