Does anyone else notice whenever they are in the car whenever the camera takes a new angle to change the route. Like in one scene it is a line of residential and sidewalks, next to a multiple line of highways and a divider, next to one of road lane roads and double yellow lines. I can understand a low budget but just work thin film. <br /> I also reviewed the other and agreed that it was a bad movie. I think if you're a fan of Paul Reiser and her comedy then you can enjoy this movie. If, however, you get to work / not funny then I would recommend staying away from this one.
