SWING! is an important film because it's one of the Black Film Live Productions and Acting in the 1930s. Many of these films have simply deteriorated so badly that they are unbridled, but this one is in fairly good form. It is also a wonderful chance to see many of the Black Artist's talent in the period just after the great day of the glory of the Old Cotton Club - a time all but forgotten today. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, while the movie is historically important and has some nice performances, it's also a mess. The main draw is very similar to the Hollywood music in the era - including a donna peaked who will ruin the show and the surprise unknown that appears from no place to save the day. However, writing is just god-awful and a little trashy at times - and image projects in Black America that few can find a bit disassembled. This is because before the scheme really comes, you are treated in a bom no account that lives in his hard working wife (a popular stereotype of the time) and when he was caught up with a hussy (who, by the way in totally overplays this role), they have a similar battle to a scene from Smackdown WWE! And, one lady wants to cut off the other lady with a straight razor - a true trashy scene! Then in the movie, when the donna's will be abhorrent, her husband punches him in the face and everyone applauds her! It seems like the movie, at times, wants to appeal to the lower common denominator of the audience PLUS can not even do so well - and some of the worst act I've seen in a very long time. > <br /> Still, if you can watch past a lousy production in just about every way (with trashy characters, bad deeds and directions and write poorly), this one might be worth a look so you can see excellent singing and dancing - as well as keeping a glimpse of black forgetful culture. Just do not say I did not warn you about the act - it really, really bad!
