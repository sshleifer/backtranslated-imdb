Man would expect a movie shot and an approx. The budget of 300,000,000 U $ D should at least entertain you for the time you spend on the movie actually watching it. "Matris Reloaded" proves this wrong assumption. <br /> <br /> The "Matrix" worked out better, despite having apparent pits regarding logic of the story. At least nobody could explain to me why to beat a bot (aka agent) inside a simulation (aka martix) would misbehave the computer program in any way ... <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the Wachowski brothers Perform this "silver-bashing" the main thing in "Matris Reloaded": it's a beat 'em up o-rama. The battle scenes can work out enough (or even cool) to a 5 sec. trailer, but prolonged for several minutes, apparently being fake, choreographed and repeatedly over and over again it is nothing more than boring. Despite seeing the peculiar exhibits that promise nothing more than simple low-quality, unimaginable bashine has already seen (or better not) in the example. Van Damme 'movie'. The difference in post-production (etherything is 5 times faster, the camera floats around a lot and frozen on certain scenes, and this repeats for at least 5min) does not help here, all this has nothing to do with the meaning many of "martial arts". In addition to 'fight', all actors refuse to pay for: acting. <br /> <br /> What's up beside battle scenes? Some except Hollywood routines. The bunch of hippies that aspired to "Waterworld" are reclaimed as citizens of "Zion" (the last town on earth), and Morpheus's orders start to dance, 'this is a good opportunity to show a lot of barely covered tits and couple. The oh-so-so-so-so frog of the French aka frogs is talking to this "ne ne sais quoi" dumb accent, which waste his wealth because of a "liason d'amour" is bravely served. After that (and wanting to comic) the battle between Neo and the disaster followers of the 'frog', since it takes place in a Flyroy Erroy like enthusiast, luckily featuring a lot of sidewalks for decorating. For neo posing with the hellebarde, just add 2 stairs with a lot of status (to be destroiced, cast on wrong guys and the like) and you get 5 more amazingly, boring mines. in this junk. <br /> <br /> What to expect? The usual merchandising hell. And "revolution" that will happen or not - certainly without me.
