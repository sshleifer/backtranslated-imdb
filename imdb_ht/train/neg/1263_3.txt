There is nothing quite like watching giant robots fighting on a desert desert, and Robot Wars to deliver. Sure, the act is disgusting, the dialogue is sub-par, and the characters are a dimension, but it has giant robots! Special effects are actually quite good for the period. They are certainly not as polished as today's standards, but it has a minimum of computer graphics and uses miniatures, so it's fairly good age. Its shortcomings are easily overlooked by the short film exits, and it has a tongue-in-cheek humor in the part that makes it quite enjoyable. I would recommend this to any fan of giant robot or sci-fi cheese who is looking for a lighthearted hour of distraction.
