I rented the movie tonight because it looked like a fun movie. I figured that you really could not go wrong with a concept of ex girlfriend and super power. <br /> <br /> ... But the movie was confusing and pointless ... <br /> it seemed that at every turn the writer kept jutting in inches also the writer kept throwing in too many humorous ways toilets and sexual situations that only a young boy could love. It seems that it could be so simple to draw a story from heroes fatal super attractions .. but I guess not. <br /> <br /> This is not a fun romantic fun she has to publish to be. You could not take a child to see it and you should be embarrassed to see it date. <br /> <br /> If the writer could make a basic story of the high concept and clean it up - the movie might have a battle chance. <br /> <br /> A serious waste of time. <br /> <br /> B
