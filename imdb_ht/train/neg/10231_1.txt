Frankly I rather upset that on the basis of dense revisions attributed to Steven Smith I wasted nearly two hours on his first offer. Did they all write by their palate? The actions together, the music is disappointing and overused, the script is merely terrifying to the actors (with the exception of the field) mediocre at best. I think we should support the efforts of a young filmmaker but he says it's brilliant when he will not surely just encourage him to make the same mistakes again ... continue to keep writing his own scripts and using the same actors for another venture. Yes, it's his first film, budget budgets etc. - I find it, but it's also out there for members of the public to buy and it's just not up to scratch.
