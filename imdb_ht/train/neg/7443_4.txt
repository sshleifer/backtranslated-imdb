There were some scary scenes, which I still love more than straight out Gore, but otherwise this movie was rather weak. They were too many questions left unanswered, and when they tried to explain anything in the movie, it was still rather clear. After watching this movie I always seemed to lose in a lot of ways. It's sort of reminded me of Silent Hill some years back. This movie was also satisfactory, but still better than this because it tried to work and the story was actually meaningless. This one, not so much. The acting for the most part of the abandoned was decent, but the film dragged on an over, and never really gave any kind of satisfying conclusions. As I said above, there were some creepy scenes, but otherwise, this movie was a mess. Sorry, I can not recommend it.
