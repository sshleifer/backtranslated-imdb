It is incredible that with all the countless crimes that have been discovered and placed at the door of Marxism, from the Berlin Wall to the Gulag Cultural Revolution Archipelago in the Khmer Rouge, one still finds admirers of communist communists in Hollywood and they always doing propaganda in favor of it. It just shows the moral corruption in Hollywood. In this particular film is a psychotic murderer who has been glorified. Needless to say, neither his crime nor his psychotic proclamation was included. That both the director and the actor expect the audience to sit in this film propaganda indirectly demonstrate the vision of the tunnels that they have in considering the objects of worship.
