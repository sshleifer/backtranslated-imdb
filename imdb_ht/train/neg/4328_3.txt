Any movie with "National Lamp" in the title is absolutely guaranteed to die a death in London, England, Paris, France, Rome, Italy, and anywhere in Germany. It can be an institution in the US but it is practically unknown in Europe at the largest audience. "The European European Vacation" is unlikely to correct this situation. Griswalds are terrifying are just that - arrogant. They're not funny. Clearly Mr Chevy Chase thinks it funny, after all Miss B.di Angelo laughed in much of his joke, but he got paid for it and did not have to fork out Â£ 2.50 for the privilege. The section set in England is typical. Even the old same old television performers, Mr. Idle, Smith, Coltrane, Miss M.Lippman trot out the same old Old Clarke tired, Mr Chase gets lost in the hotel corridor .... yawn, Huge, yawn .. Task - Ham Palace, Big Ben ... I feel cheated that we have never seen bobbies on two-way bikes ..... .... rosie cheeks on the chill little - Do I need to go? The English are buffoons, the French Yank-Haters victim. The Germans are firing and inflating up, (not to mention the war, Clark), and the Italians are lecherous bottom-pinchers.Have I forgot anything? Every possible "funny" situation worked in death, Mr Chase gurns desperately, Miss Angelo's sweet eyes, children are embarrassingly bad. The fact that this franchise has run as long as it has to be comforted to those who propose that you never lose money by underestimating public flavors.
