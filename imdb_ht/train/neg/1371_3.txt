I can not figure out how anyone can get a budget for this bad movie. It's like the TV station desperate for anything, anything at all. They are buried under a lot of snow, the electricity constantly shining over and over, yet magically has a background light that remains constant. Where is all this light (fake) out? That, with all that stupid bridges between the characters. They seem to be more interested in complaining each other than attempting to invent ways to survive. It tries to create that feeling of urgency and helpers. But because it's like driving and acting, you will not be Florence Nightingale arranged with this movie, sorry. I join the negative feedback, and I agree that this is one of the worst movies ever.
