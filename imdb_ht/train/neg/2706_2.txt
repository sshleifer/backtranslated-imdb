Yes, people are racists. People are racists in college. This is a good point, and the problem of racism has been faced with many times before in countless films. What sets higher learning apart from the package is that it deals with the problem of racism in the most effective ham-fisted and predictable way, oh yeah it's also college. <br /> This film deals with this problem of Frankenstein style racism deals with most issues, it bashes you over the head repeatedly in a brutal and sluggish manner. Most of the characters are cartoonish, one dimension, caricatures (feminist lesbian, foolish black), which reacts to situations as dramatically and predictable as possible. Instead of challenging stereotypes this film is overpopulated with them. Angry black people feel cheated, feminist hatred men, etc. (one feminist even holds a sign that reads "Dead Man is not rape." Look what I mean?) I do not want to give anything away, but in that the movie if someone looks like a cereal or a rapist date they will probably behave exactly as you expect them. Changes to these characters are going to seem obvious to everyone, but the people of the movie. The great fault of the Guns draws on whether the violent neo-Nazis are acting as violent neo-Nazis. I'll guess you'll just have to look at what's going on. <br /> Another problem I have with this movie is that it's supposed to be "fearless" and "hard-hit," but to make the Nazi bad guys. I agree that the Nazis are wrong, but that's my point. Everyone thinks the Nazis are bad; we do not break any new earth here. The Nazis were described as bandits since the 1930s. The film does not challenge any input or bold statement. It just deals with issues we all know about in a clumsy, after-school-like way, way. Being anti-rape, anti-racism, and anti-Nazi is not exactly a difficult position on a controversial issue. <br /> <br /> Higher Learning is predictable, cartoonish, and in a stupid word. Avoid all costs.
