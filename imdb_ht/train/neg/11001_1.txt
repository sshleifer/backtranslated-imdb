I have never seen a comedy that has been so much of a chore to sit thru ... not one laugh at it. Ok, maybe a little chuckle for Michael Clarke Duncan bit as big, black, gay girl. But the rest of it was shockingly un-comic. On top of being canceled in any street "skit" go on forever! Steer clear of this one if you appreciate your time and money. DREADFUL !!! Worst !!!
