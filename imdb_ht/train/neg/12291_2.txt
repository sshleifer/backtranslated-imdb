Humm, an Italian film created by David Hasselhoff and Linda Blair, I did not wait a lot, to be honest and in fact, I took even less than I expected. It does not mean this movie is the worst I've seen because I've looked at things worse than this but the plot was most of the confusing and refreshing times and some good Gore scenes are the only thing that's saving . Apart from that you will love some special effects, they are really cheesy and bad. Now I only want to look "Trol 3" by the same director, make sure it will not get worse.
