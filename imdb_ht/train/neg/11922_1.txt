Some illegal what is called asylum seekers come to Stuttgart and finds that the Germans are "racists." This is just another already forgotten steam in a long list of post-WWII anti-German anti-German films, aimed to make German feel "bad" for not welcoming every and every degenerate country so it can chase the German blonde and sell young adolescents. <br /> If you are looking for German films in General, see "Der Tunnel", "Der Untergang", "Europa Europa" and "Lola Running." But not this. <br /> Also, "The Experiment," and even the male actor from "Lola Running."
