Each film from the thirty is dated, but if you watch only John Ford movies it would seem more dated than if you watch other people. The Gran Hotel is comparatively modern fashion model. With Ford, there is still hard-selling of someone's nobility (Abe, the Joads). Still on the emphasis of some heavily bad. Always the scripts are poorly fabricated, awkward and obvious. This is no exception. It's just a rather belabored device to deliver feelings. And feelings are all that will be for him. What Ford does here does not make me appreciate in Lincoln, it just makes me wonder how states have ever stayed in the full moron population shown here. Ford went on to make decent movies. This is too late to be anything but bad. It feels entirely false. Henry Fonda and a fake fox are scarce. And no one from Illinois would pronounce the 'S', or say "Shonuff!"
