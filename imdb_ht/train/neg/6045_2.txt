This is an interesting idea to go bad. The hidden concepts of art leave as indications by an intriguing sound assassin sounder, but the execution of "Anamorph" is excruciatingly slow and without much interest. There is no other way to describe the movie except boring. The death indications are only the interesting part of "Anamorph". All connections are tedious. William Dafoe provides a credible performance as the investigator, but he has little to do with a script that stretched to the limit. Several actors supported are wasted, including Peter Stormare as art expert, James Rebhorn as chief of police, Paul Lazar as the medical examiner, and most notably Deborah Harry, who featured on the rear of the DVD case, again Only have a couple of lanes talked to a split door. Not recommended. - MERK
