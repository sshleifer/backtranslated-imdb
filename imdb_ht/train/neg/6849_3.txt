This film J-horror follows a young woman as she returns to her hometown on the island of Shikoku to sell the family home and meet up with old friends. He finds that one, the daughter of the village priest, drowned several years earlier. She and Fumiko (another childhood friend) then learn that Sayori's mother is trying to bring her back to life with black magic. Already the bond between the deceased and living is getting weak with friends and villagers to see ghosts. There was nothing that was exceptional or even very good about this movie. Contrary to the great J-horror film, the suspension does not really build, the result does not seem overly threatened and the boundaries end up on the absurd. <br /> <br /> This movie is like white rice rice cooked a bit too long that it is bordering on mushy. Sometimes you get to this poor Asian restaurant or cook your own white rice a little too long. You end up eating it, because you need it with the food, because that is Chinese or Japanese foods without rice, but it almost breaks the food because of gummy, gooey the taste of it all. 3/10 http://blog.myspace.com/locoformovies
