The movie has a lot of potential, unfortunately, it came apart because of a weak / implausible story, miscasting, and general content / content. One of the most obvious faults was that Sean Connery, who played an Arab man, did not know how to pronounce his own name Arabic! This may seem a small flaw but it points to the lack of effort to pay attention to details. Quality acting was equally well below average. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> So, with a French song (I do not remember the title). In general, it was a very bad movie where Sean Connery was visibly miscast.
