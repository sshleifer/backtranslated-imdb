If you've seen so much films less, this might be a big one for you. If you've seen lots of films, this is a joke. The real hero acting is described very seriously. Not to mention, there are songs, there are plenty of flashbacks, and most importantly, the fighting scenes are stupidly born. New character, good direction, would do a better job, but since it has all the bollywood / heroine era, you can predict what will happen next. You do not feel sad when something happens, the embarrassing emotions are terrible, especially because we've seen this actor in 1000 movies of other movies. He supposed to be a realistic film but failed to show. There are times when you ask, you have thousands of army vessels filled with soldiers moving and Pakistani are bombing in them and no bombs are hit. Is the park really bad at targeting or the director makes them look stupid? There was only one character of some act that was very good, but so far it concerned and drawn action, it is wrong to direct. This movie could be short if they took songs, flashbacks, sticks to the point.
