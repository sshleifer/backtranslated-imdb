Falling people start archaeologists Matt Fletcher (Casper Van Dien) in the desert discovering the remaining mummified a giant 42 feet high, now there's something you do not see everyday. Matt works for the Morton property developer (Robert Wagner) who wants to build a holiday resort in the country and calls to fellow Angela (Kristen Miller) for reasons I have not finished. Anyway, both try to figure out what they were about to do but when some of the team went missing, Morton calls at Amon Security Guy (Navid Negahban) to handle the situation. During the time the ancient text translator Eli Eli Schmidtt (Tom Bosley) translated some ancient texts (as it would) and is shocked to learn from an evil prophecy in which these giants will arise and take over the world for the fallen one , or something like that. It's up to Matt to save the day & the whole planet. <br /> <br /> Writing & directing by Kevin VanHook, who also has a small role in the film as the leading warrior leader at the start I personally thought they were being a horrible movie & it's as simple and straight forward as that. There are so many things that are just plain bad on the snapshots to fall both on a technical and conceptual level of expression, the script does not make a lot of sense & it does not really go through until 20 minute odd by that time I was almost losing my will to live. The character is awful & as screenshot as you like, the dialogue is bad as in very, very bad & the movie is all predictable, I mean it will not come as a surprise that Casper Van Dien is going to save the day is it? It's not a big surprise that the mummy giant is going to go back to life so why wait until about an hour in the movie when most of the audience will be in some sort of state comatose. This is bad, very bad. You warned. <br /> <br /> VanHook Director does not impress, the fighting scene is absolutely awful & why dress up your bad guys up in a terrible shade of purple? They look naff. To give it a bit of credit to the special effects on giant mummies in itself are actually good although there's not many of them since it does not make an appearance for more than an hour, there are also some normal mummies size that their look has come straight from the series of mummies (1999), unfortunately these are not used in any major effect & in fact they are wasted as some funny relief. The mechanical mummy was a very good idea but looks amazing & there is no way on Earth that all those inside could work in synchronizing with each other to operate it, actually the more I think about the more ridiculous idea is. Forget about any crisis, tension or atmosphere & do not even think about any war or violence because there is no. <br /> <br /> Technically falling in hand is nothing special and apart from giant impressive Momi effect has little to get excited about. CGI of ghosts & the terrible effects of water, it's made-for-TV & it shows. The act was poor, Wagner looks puzzled & this is probably the only thing the love of Dien & Bosley can find these days. <br /> <br /> The snapshots are a bad movie, there's no way around it as far as I'm concerned. Not recommended on any level or in any way, one to avoid.
