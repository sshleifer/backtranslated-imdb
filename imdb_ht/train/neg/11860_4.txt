If you have not figured out what will happen in this movie in the first five minutes then give it a couple more minutes. Lilia is a widow. He left the shelf for too long and wants to burst out. She has a teenage daughter who only emphasizes that she does not get any less. While checking up on her daughter she discovers a world she never misses ... The cabaret, where she can dance dancing in outfit girl dry while people throw money into her. The movie is very misogynist. It's painted in boys is involvement. Which is rather odd like Lilia stoops jiggling around for them, not for money but just for the hell of it. When he succeeded in excitement, he felt like a woman again. He does not want to connect with them but it is addicted to the attention. The other dancers are all mostly aging women who look like people in dragging and realizing their time in the spotlight is short live. Not short enough I say. He finds romance, however short, and you guessed it .... No surprises here we did not see coming. Even if the end is good you realize that it can end up no other way. Perhaps this movie just is not targeting my demo-30 Male
