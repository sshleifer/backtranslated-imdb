The Jan Goodman program was very awful, but this was just plain stinks. The single and single thing of this mess that made me smile recognized the voice of Patrick Starfish as Frosty. The story is hopeless, written by someone who has blocked memories of child rebelians but has never become any adult in perspective of years to intervene. Paranoid rule of the world is dark that these characters live. Everyone is unpleasant, and for no reason. The plot is predictable, but the shows lurches from one inexplicable, unconnected scene to another in such a freaky way is no pleasure in watching it. The worst thing is nobody in the production crew seems to have never seen snow!
