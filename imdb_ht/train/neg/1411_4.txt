This movie was the first time I saw it, when it was called "lost in translation." But somehow Bill Murray turned into a black man who was played by Morgan Freeman, Scarlett Johansson back to a Latino renowned woman played by Pegas Vega, and Tokyo, Japan back in Carson, California. Instead of meaningful and silent conversations we enjoyed in Translation, we find meaningful essence of 10 Articles that are annoying about annoying. Instead of being brazen and introspective characters like in Translation, we find characters that spew pointless tips on the topics there are no signs of. How can a character who puts hundreds of T-shirts and never been inside a department store store expect to give advice to a working-class woman about how to prepare for an interview work as an administrative assistant? Do not think that stop him. If she does not give her advice, she tells her what she should eat. The most annoying part of the film for me was how supposedly they were in a hurry to make an appointment, and yet the characters kept finding time to run something else, let's wash the car, stopping at the arby, or just Listing off the list of 10 items or Less list of things to love and hate. I kept wanting to call to say, "Did not you say you were somewhere to be? What are they doing? A minute ago you were practically late, now you are eating stinking beef and meditating on life you! " Until I saw this film, I never really understood how something could "insist on himself," but I think this movie does exactly that, and uneservedly so. The dialogue makes the cheese characters and impotence ?? with the exception that I felt sorry for both of the actors to sign on this project.
