This movie is "fixed" but in many similar ways a car crash is fixed. It's hard to look far. In general, this film has nothing more than an incredibly irresponsible social experience - with a useless, partial experience. Creators are manipulative and seem to have no problem going for the lowest possible denominator. The way money is presented for Ted is good OS. The intervention stage that the tornado filmmakers participated in (meeting with so-called experts) was empty and devoid of any solid attempts to connect to Ted. Instead, it's painfully obvious that they serve to cover the cinema's posteriors and more exploit Ted's situation. The worst part is that filmmakers stop these Ted after 6 months; and seemingly cut off between the subject being followed so well previous months. If they care, they would get the best "expert" to help Ted. If they really want to see what Ted would do, then they would have let him spend the money without any intervention. This film is at best a great-breasted Jackas cascade and not a documentary. It's sad to think that the amount of $ 100,000 might actually change the life of a homeless person he has put in their right hands.
