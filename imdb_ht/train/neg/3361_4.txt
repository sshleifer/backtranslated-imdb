This movie was one of the greatest movies ever made, ,,, it has everything to do a great movie. Incredible acting, effect effects effect ...... oh wait I must think of a good movie. Well this was not one of them, it's just plain aspiring. <br /> <br /> What I want to know is, what kind of bone head would think that this movie was a 10. When I cast my vote there was 206 out there, God knows what's going on at their head. Now, as for any other vote, an 8 or 9 was even too high, but a 10 ??? Come on, what makes this movie sooooo good to give it a 10? I know these are the same 206 who thought Jean Claude Van Damme is a great dramatic actor.
