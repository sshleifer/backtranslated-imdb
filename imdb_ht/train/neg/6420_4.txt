OK I'll admit, it started out pretty fun and good, but then it just dropped downhill, I can not believe Sarah Michelle Gellar could even finish reading the script after about 5 minutes of the movie, the reason Only I actually sit in the movie, I wanted to see the twist of the nad, and my surprise, well, as I can not even tell you if there was twenty one, because the end just left you confused, and then , the role of credit, I was like that hell? This did not deserve a theater run, I'm sorry, but it did not mean I was horrible, only in rasa I gave it a 4 is because it had a few jumper parts ... thats it! you can watch it, im not tell you not, hey you might even like it or even love it! but if you hate him, do not say I did not warn you!
