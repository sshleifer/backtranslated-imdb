Wow, my first review of this movie was so negative that it did not exclude. I'll try to tone this one down. Allow real !!! No one wants to see a movie Chuck Norris where it is not the main character.There was a good battle scene at the end, but the rest of the movie stank. I need to ask if old Chuck just can not hang and the best of any more. Is it so slow that it turned out junk like this with the hope that his reputation will bring him to the entire movie? Chuck is an awesome martial arts, and as we've seen from Walker, Texas Ranger, a fairly good actor, but the trick is to combine both of these qualities in his movies, and this one does not so. Extremely deplorable for our fans of Norris. Chuck, remains as the main character of your movies, because this does not work for you ... Gary
