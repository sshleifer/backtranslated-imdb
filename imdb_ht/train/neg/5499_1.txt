I saw this bomb when he hit the theater. I laughed the whole time. Why? Because the sort of it seemed to have made me go crazy. I looked at it and realized there was not one funny thing in the entire movie. At night there is nothing intentional. It is awfully funny that Lizzie cn grinds a piece of Nurplex and becomes a monstrous, carnivorous demon ... yet her dress litt-bitty little is perfectly intact, despite the fact that it is now hundreds of times larger than it was when he first put it on. Or the type of movie where a man can be shocked with a defibrillator and only falls unconscious, and returns to awareness without any medical attention. And do not let me start over the ridiculous fate of the "villain" that they decide they need to create "conflict." Uh huh. <br /> For people to complain about Disney only targetting their children-Raunchy puppys part of this film seems to disprove this statement. Do we really need Daryl Ana to accuse Jeff Bridge of having fun videos? You make sure you are Disney and you are out of mind for the movie appeal of the above-8 crowd without writing a more smart script! I am quite convinced that Disney pays to the evaluation board so it's movies can get away with murder and still get family-friendly appraisals. <br /> What a waste of the DVD format.
