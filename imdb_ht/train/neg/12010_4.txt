Acronymic "F.P.1" means "floating platform # 1". The film portends the building of a "F.P.1" among the Atlantic Ocean, to be used as an "air station" for transatlantic plane flights. Based on a contemporary Curt Siodmark novel; He was filmed in German as "F.P.1 Responded by" (1932), in French as "I.F.1 Not Responded More" (1933), and in English as "F.P.1" (1933). Soon, technology has made travel that does not stop the oceans much more favorable. Stars Conrad Veidt (like Ellissen), Jill Esmond (as Droste), and Leslie Fenton (like Claire) found love and sabotage on them and on the Atlantic platform. Karl Hartl directs. Mr. Veidt is more enjoyable to watch; but he does not persuade the "love triangle" with Mr. Esmond and Mr. Fenton. The youngest co-stars were the wives of Laurence Olivier and Ann Dvorak, respectively. Both the concept and film are not good at all. <br /> <br /> **** F.P.1 (4/3/33) Karl Hartl ~ Conrad Veidt, Jill Esmond, Leslie Fenton
