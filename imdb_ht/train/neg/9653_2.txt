I just wonder what is the purpose of making movies like this? the profit? with whom are they referring to what intelligence must use your brain to look something like this crap? This movie will look at less than 3 years of age if you are adult not trying to watch it. That's why I think Hollywood has started using cartoons in movies and actors like this to forget about the art of cinema, make sure you will have tons of pop pop soons to spend until this movie ends up getting hamburgers The lot of your laptop or cellphone this movie can be used easily in a restaurant, but for sure not in a theater, my dog ​​is still next to my family when watching a movie leaving the building. That's sure is that this film is referring to people who have no demands from the cinema art. That's the only thing that this movie can be used is to watch it when shopping the supermarket. I am giving 2 stars to support India's film effort but for nothing more or less.
