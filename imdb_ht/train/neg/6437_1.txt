Spoilers. <br /> The first, nothing really happened in this film, other than a woman bleeding inexplicably. Second, it was not scary. Thirdly, she had the worst sound of any movie ever. Let me elaborate. The sound has been modified by either Beavis or Butthead ?? I'm not sure who, so let's just go with Beavis. The film gradually becomes more and more quiet with the people mumble and mutter, forcing you to turn up the volume (I look at this house). Then Beavis excludes some sounds really loud and supposedly scary / shocking images, forcing you to quickly lower the volume again. This happens several times until, thank you, the movie ends. I can picture Beavis laughing vulgarly from behind the two-way mirror while watching the frantic test group reaching to the remote every time. If you have kids and prefer to watch scary movies after falling asleep, this one is a big mistake. But then it's a big mistake anyway. Here's a thought ?? If you're going to make a horror movie, at least add a free cutsuit, a 19-year-old blonde girl who screams at the top of her lungs just before she can take off her sweater, the shadow on the wall of someone They ate lively just from the camera series, being a cat being thrown into the camera to scare the audience, some awesome drifty and a maniacal laugh, or a monster that looks like a scene but is covered in aluminum foil ( lost the TV in space). These people did not even try to scare me. They just wanted to hurt my ears.
