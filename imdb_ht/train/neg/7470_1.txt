In SÃ£o Paulo, upper adolescent teenagers Cristiano, Chico and Gabriel were just joined the university and on the eve of the opening class, they went to a party with drugs and bottles. On the next day, after the classes, Cristiano's last night came to his house with three friends to rape the girl. The girl dies, panic and decides to get rid of the body, but Cristiano's mother arrives, escaped with Gabriel and rolls the stairs, breaking her neck. The trio decided to throw and burn their bodies into a waste landfill, but on the other night tragedies came. The polemic and humiliation of "Cama de Cake" is a spit to pretend to the alienation of the youth, and is certainly the worst Brazilian movie that I've seen together many years. Deep, tragic and black story is actually a dark humor comedy of bad taste. The scenario is not funny, with stupid lines and dialogues, and boring, manipulative and comic footage and interviews with adolescent adolescents from the beginning and end. The act is awful, apparently and much improvisation, but there is no talent, and I was disappointed with the presence of the promised Caio Blat in this garbage. The camera, framing, cinematography and editions are amateur and in very low quality. The sound is terrible and in many parts it is impossible to understand what the actors and actresses are talking about (probably it is a plus, since this flick is absorbed). The gang gang is very realistic and used to promote this mediocre movie in a very poor marketing of sex exploitation. My vote is one (terrible). <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Cama de cake" ("bed of the cat")
