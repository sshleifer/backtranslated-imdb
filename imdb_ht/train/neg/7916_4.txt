Where to start? How about and the erroneous sinopsis: <br /> <br /> "X-Men Origins: Wolverine tells the story of Wolverine's winter violent and romantic winters, its complex relationships with Victor beliefs, and the threat X X." /> <br /> It's past epic violent turns out to be exceptionally non-violent. <br /> <br /> Its relationship with belief is so glossed on it's hard to understand how to have any connection at all. We are thrown from one point to the opening scenes that show them as the kids in the run, in a montage of war scenes that they fought in their lifetime, and finally at the present where they are part of a hardcore government team of assassins. There is nothing by way of showing their relationships as brothers at all. There is nothing complex that sets to believe is authentic or even like. <br /> <br /> The romantic component of the movie between Silverfox and Wolverine was forced and abrupt. We're thrown into a romance so fast that it's on you before you can blink. Having just introduced the character, Silverfox is killing about fifteen minutes later. We ask why we should take care of it. Who has read anyway? <br /> For an essential element in this weak revenge story, the romance is amazingly unexplored. He simply ran because he needed it. <br /> <br /> Strange enough, when Wolverine finds that his love is dead he leaves it in the woods rotten as he goes to get Sabertooth. Being romantic is that it is this character from him yet necessary to serve the plot of crawling on a very predictable surprise. <br /> <br /> As for the weapon X program, allow just say that after the plagued procedure Wolverine is up and running. Eventually it reaches the home of a long long-haired couple again without resistance. Amazing Ma and Pa Kent are not afraid when they find a naked sweat man in the loft. Is it any fate waiting for them? <br /> In the previous films and the comic books, the main reasons that Amphitheus 'Gloutin' plagued on his part flushed on the fact that he was being viciously wrong with Cold. <br /> <br /> Knowing this was the case ... he really wants to remember these horrors or keep them hidden and continue to current it's more positive form of battle against the bandits of the world and his teammates ? <br /> <br /> As inclined to X2: X-men United States when Stryker gives up in its secrets it is said that Wolverine would be disturbed if it was known to the wrong works they committed together. This movie sets the team fairly well not only does much of anything. No violent violence, no cruel action, they simply harassed some native foreigners for ten or fifteen minutes on screen. <br /> It seems that Wolverine was not an evil man under Stryker at all. Instead he was still trying to put an end to his Sabertooth brother who was then the violent agent we all thought was Wolverine. Eventually, it just leaves it all together. <br /> <br /> No duality conflicts here at all. <br /> <br /> Idiotically removes this conflict of character from the good and evil DULLED's story incredibly. They can as well give him rubber claws. There was a ton of other errors in this film that contradicts the X-men trilogy, including the introduction of one of the lusest Deus Ex Machinas in the ever-hit script. <br /> <br /> Magic memory-clears bullets. <br /> <br /> Really? <br /> <br /> Apparently they are the only thing to bring down the Wolverine. But this was apparently forgotten when silver agents were sent to bring it down with bullets and bombs that would surely not work on it at all. <br /> Another problem with this film is that he tried to focus on Wolverine while throwing in a ton of other mutants that did little nothing at all. Exciting characters were only dressing windows and doing nothing for the story. Most were in the movie for 5-10 minutes max and yet you find yourself wanting to see more of them and less of Wolverine. <br /> <br /> Fred chief (the pate but not the comic version) can punch a launched missile tiny and there is no physical damage to him at all, but a simple headbutt from naggin metal gloutin is enough to maze him? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> they do not even damn clothes. Adult sloth dress anyone? <br /> <br /> (Gravity Defying) The mutant gambit, instead of using his signature card, made of some sort of crazy acrobat. In one wrong edited scene it is struck unconscious by Wolverine ... Then amazingly enough a few minutes later it's about a three running Wolverine TOWARDS. How it blinds awareness, runs a few blocks, rides a building, then runs back to Wolverine and Sabertooth in the middle of a scratched match is a mystery yet to be explained. <br /> <br /> Some have excused this debilitating film by claiming it made out of a comic and therefore should be weak on character and heavy on flash. The idea that this film was a funny movie is flimsy and superficial because of this is incorrect. <br /> <br /> Comic book material source, the REAL origin of Wolverine ... is a story worth carrying on the screen. She does not make her past cycle clothes and treats the reader like Djenki CGI Djenki. It's a well-crafted story and although retold and rejusted over time, started with WEAPON X by Barry Windsor-Smith. A more intense and exciting story. <br /> This FOX movie should seriously be forgotten. <br /> <br /> Anyone who has magic weapons? <br /> 4/10
