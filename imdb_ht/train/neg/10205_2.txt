So, I wonder while watching this film, did the producers of this movie get to save money on Sandra Bullock's wardrobe by dragging out "first" clothes from Miss Congeniality? Did Mr. Bullock also find sleepwalk in the role of channeling Gracie Hart's "front"? As many evaluators noted before, the film is very formulated. Add to that experience of Van vu deja with the character of Cassie Maywether as a bit darker Gracie Hart and more history back and it quickly becomes a recurrence. <br /> <br /> Two bad boy killer series made first (and better) in other films. As the "good guy partner is trying to protect his partner despite the evidence" characters have seen before. In fact none of the characters in the leg film get beyond two-dimensional or try to be anything but stereo stereotypes. One last pee - using the serial killer term is false advertising. Kill one person - even if it's a premeditated murder - do not make you a serial killer. You may have the potential to become a reliable assassin, but you are not a serial killer or even a spree killer.
