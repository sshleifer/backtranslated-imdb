When you consider her pedigree, this would be a movie that is more enjoyable than it is. Even with a lip-smacking collection of antics in the cast - what aficionado would not hastily anticipate a film that brings together Lemmon, Lanchester, Kovacs and Gingold? - The whole event is dully rhythm, instant shot, and, more often than not, meaningless. Kim Novak's gift was not essentially funny, as he went to confirm in my Boo Stupid. James Stewart was a fine comedy, as he demonstrated in movies from the Philadelphia History of Harvey. I think it's best out of this mess than anyone else does. Except maybe the cat.
