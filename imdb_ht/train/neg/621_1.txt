Holy @ #% & this movie was always warm and juicy from the pile it was made with. I tried to watch this pile of rubbish garbage, but found it easier to cut my wrist and sluggish back a shooter in Lysol floor cleaner than hold more than half of the crap on my screen. I rank this well below anything I've ever watched on film or television, and what says something. I once witnessed a cow crap in a field. I watched the steamer steam for an hour and a half, who knows ... it may have moved or something. Well this was time better than watching this inhale. The act of non-existent, the plot was elsewhere passed on this film. I think I saw a cut early on the plot managed to escape and was riding in the background on the back of an old pickup truck in Portland hoping to become a Steven King shi77er. Please tell me the director of the medication he needs to desperately need. It is very clear he needs heavy medicine and I want the money needed for his lobotomy towing. Bah ... I can not give this review the punch it needs because nothing this painful can ever do justice to typing words alone. Let me just say that if you are looking for a movie flick over some time, and you see this Chilton on the rack, walk through your car, start the engine, then earn both your points straight to fans until it can not feel bone or vibrate again. Make sure you have your wallet at hand also because you went to cash trash anyway. You might as well have the privilege of wasting it yourself. <br /> <br /> By the way, I watch this after a "friend" I sent her girlfriend so I could see her. He came on, he was too. What's worse is that it has to look this $% & @ thing TWICE! I heard the couples now and came to visit her balls once a month. I hope it was because of this movie.
