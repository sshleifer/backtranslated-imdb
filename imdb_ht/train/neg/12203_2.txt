I think it's when John Rambo moves on with his life and tries to put Vietnam behind him. This series will become old and rambo is not a solid but a bloody bloodthirsty assassin. All the time it turns on the screen of someone dying. Vietnam was not a fun place to be and honestly I was tired of Hollywood making it seem like it was. This is not the worst of the films about Vietnam, which honors the John Waynes Green Berets. In any case John Rambo carries around a gun 50 machine guns to take on what seems to be half of the Congo Viet Cong plus a lot of Russians are a reproach to watch. What's worse is Rambos cheesy speech to the end ... Please !! Oh yeah I hear they're doing another ...
