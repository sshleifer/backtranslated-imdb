I can not say this is one of the best films I have ever seen. But then again, I can not say it is one of the worst I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> OK, so it's basically a girl doing skating, is good at it, wanting to go to an expensive school, can not afford it and she should take a helmet scholarship. He hid his secret skeleton secret from his friends. <br /> Personally, I did not like the actress Katelin play. She absolutely could not cry to save her life, just sounds like a toddler to pretend to cry to find her own way. <br /> <br /> Katelin was just an annoying person. How she tried to act all beautiful and helpful to people. Also part of where the skaters are calling her name and saying something about her choreographer and saying she 'drew the line' to make me cringe. <br /> We all knew where he was going to go with him and Spencer. The classics did not like each other and the sort of get together to the end was just typical. <br /> <br /> In general, I think this is a movie to watch if you like skating but if you do not mind the main skater being very annoying. It's good to kill time basically.
