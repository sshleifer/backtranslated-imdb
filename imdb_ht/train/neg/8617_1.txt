Having watched 10 minutes in this movie I was disoriented, having looked 30 minutes my toes were curling - I simply could not believe it: the movie is really awful. In fact it is so awful, that I've observed all of it just to be convinced (!). Meanwhile, I realized that he had reminded me of a bunch of Danish so-called comedians from the 60's and 70's. The model is as follows: Take a very popular comedy, making a script to put this comedy in as much as grotter situation as possible, adding a bunch of jokes (especially one-linen maternity), and spice it up with a couple of cute girls - the movie and you have a success! I would not know if this film was a success, but unlike the Danish tradition that died slowly (with a few great comedians) it seems that there is a market for this kind of film in the US.
