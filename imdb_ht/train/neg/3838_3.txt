Terry West had a good idea of ​​this movie. It just did not meat it happened. There are endless vaccines in the exterior climbing school that are going on forever and probably the long film movie running. Also in this school there are only 2 students. Misty Mundae is good as usual but this movie will always be part of Ruby LaRocca (which is the only reason to watch the movie in the beginning). If the script is centered on our exciting characters we would have a movie to watch. It's so gorgeous !! Good news for DVD buyers, Terry West's earlier (and best) movie "Blood for the Museum" is a special feature. One thing I would like to say is that this movie feels like someone who is not good at delivering the punch line at the end of a long joke for the finish feeling that same way. Then again, just watch this for Ruby LaRocca.
