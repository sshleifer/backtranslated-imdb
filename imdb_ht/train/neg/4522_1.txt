The most misogynistic movie of all time? Not to mention that '68 should not have been moving beyond the white people in the wild "Indian" face? My favorite part though should be when girls are giggling with blush as the cyclists dragged to gang rape. Rape is fun! Who knew? Let's see, then there's blatant rip-offs in the "Hustler" (bold strong bass play actually plays pool while complaining to destroy the Indians and the rebel leader dude), the terrible act, these-on -The-might-like-well-have-just-told-you-that-to-think music signal, the lack of any actually American Americans in this movie. With whom should we join? I must tell him that Quentin Tarantino likes this movie. Though its movies tend to be strong women champion, I've heard from at least one source of real life it's a misogynistic idiot. Why did I look at it, you ask? Do not ask.
