I look forward to watching this movie and then realizing that any hope of a coherent dialogue between the actors has been tied to the oath necessary. Now, I'm not a pride in any way but to call obscenities to each other by a good movie making. Ewan Bremner is arguing one of the worst actors in the world at this time (witnessing his performance in the Terrible Life of Stuff) & his accent "Cockney" is almost as bad as his Edinburgh accent. Avoid. How many more of the movie "Kiss Kiss Bang Bang", "beautiful creatures" we must suffer before the movie makers realize that the word f-word, the word etc. does not replace good dialogue.
