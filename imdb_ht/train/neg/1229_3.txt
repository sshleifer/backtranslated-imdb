Sorry, but aside from Kim Basinger doing a great job acting fear, this was one of the worst stairs I saw in a moment. Logic is thrown out as 4 young guys terrorizing this woman outside a crowded mall then shoot a security guard. But no one likes to notice. Then instead of screaming for help or racing back to the mall, he drives off and ends up in the middle of the woods and guys in hot pursuit. I can not even describe how amazing she sees this woman who escapes from 4 delayed luggage, carrying a box of red tool, screaming for God to help her, and then having sex with one of them after brutal kill the others. Please trust me this is bad and a bit tasteless as well.
