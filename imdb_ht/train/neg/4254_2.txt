I can not believe the guy even led this crap with Dracula 2000. Dracula 2000 was innovative, cool, and well written, if wrong. <br /> This pile can not even claim that. It starts with the defeat of Dracula at the end of Dracula 2000. Then ignore the narrative after describing what happened next. After the narrative was quite able to do this a good end somehow, but Craven chose to go in the style of his greatest movie, with no tie but good name to the main villain. Even the actor playing Dracula was different (go to Dark Hair in Dracula 2000 in a blonde here). <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie if you have any respect for your taste in the movies.
