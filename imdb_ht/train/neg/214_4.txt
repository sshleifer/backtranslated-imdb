Considering that this film had a reliable and successful launch campaign, I would expect something to be worth the fuzz ... from the opening stage on (in which the two "sensual" brothers caress each other, put naked in a bed) it goes swiftly ... nothing to get the attention, not an idea-catching thing in the whole sketch, baaad baiting act (a few minor exceptions, but artificiality is at its best) . Inquisitions and madmwazisms promise themes, but the script analyzes not one of the two in depth (the idea that a possible excuse of musicians, saying that they aim for a subtle movie would be hilarious, unless subtle and superficial means the same thing la ...). Spectators are too curious will not find any interesting scenes ... at this point, which could save some of the movie ... so you can imagine how bad it is. Many other things could say ... but please watch the movie yourself ... I'm an egoist and I would like as many people as possible to wasting about 1 1 / 2h of life ... like I did :(
