And a self-admitted to boots. At an assistant point point the physician referred to himself as Igor. <br /> Working with the idea as increasingly as possible that computers can be used to replace or reconstruct brain functions, this film does not spend enough time exploring the site. Most of the time the screen separates between girlfriend-in-a-coma workout conflict and chase the brain's donor assassins. She tries to make a Sci / Fi / Drama / Thriller but neglects to save on any of the three. As a Frankenstein noticed this one is missing everything that made the original good. Nobody calls the fool or even threatens to kick him out of the hospital. The transformation scene consists of a coma victim open one eye and the amazing computer that makes it happen is not even shown. When the experiment works no praise, and when it starts going wrong there is little reaction. <br /> <br /> Any suspense on who would be the assassin killer by progressive showing him in the same room with all possible suspicions. Finding the killer is as easy as opening a file and interviewing one person. <br /> <br /> San Francisco as an environment is both overplayed and underused. The opening opening of the Hammer home point that this is happening in SF, a cable car plays an important role, driving them live in a Victorian top hill, Pier 39 makes an appearance, and the final showdown happening at Golden Gate Park . More specifically along ten stalks of side cliffs in the park - just enough to keep the bridge in the picture of all time. Once the obvious scenery bases are rounded no other attempt has been made to explore the city. <br /> <br /> The act is the only save here. Keul Dullea shows a good series and pulls on a couple of really emotional scenes. Suzanna Love shows recovery in a good coma. Tony Curtis only gets a handful in line with twice as many guys stares and most of the Frankenscience explains far by his assistant. The little young blonde hit her signal fairly well. <br /> I also gave him one extra star for the scene where the husband drove south from the bridge and cut off a U-turn into an associated parking, and then he was immediately back on the bridge leads north. It takes a lot of something - courage, ignorance, deadline - to try and slip one by the viewer during one car in pursuit of salt.
