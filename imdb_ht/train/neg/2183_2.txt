This movie was really bad if you took it as a sci-fi movie, like a single horror or even as a comedy. The whole thing is ridiculous. The film looks (and is) definitely cheap, the actors have no idea about what act is and the script shows clearly that he did along with the shooting. It is obvious that the monster in the closet has been added because the living head did not fear at all-it was even nice - and thought they needed something more impressive; They fail here too (make up is terrible even for late 50, rather funny). The film shows clearly why Director Joseph Green's career as such and also as a writer never literate; It was really bad at both. Even go to the actors, leading and supported. <br /> <br /> "The brain that would not die" most successful is its short run.
