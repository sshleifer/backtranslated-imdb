I went to this film hoping for the best. I love music during the war in general. Dick Powell and Lucille Ball did a good job with their roles; However, the writers were given a razor dialogue. Love-interest between the two was not given any real growth; just suddenly she was there. I did not think much of the music; The best number was the snippet we heard of Spike Jones and the "Face of the Fuhrer." The single complete number that Spike Jones did little in his great music comedy; wonderful tame, even with the monkey. Berti comedian Bert Lahr was indifferent. The parties enjoyed: Lucille Ball was quite a looker, and had a good selection of bit players who really deserved more time on the screen.
