The year 1934 was when the Shirley Temple played three major cinemas and really began to make a name for himself. Unfortunately, the studios have been experimenting to see what's the favorite public here. Two of these were singing and dancing. Another was a short, exciting film that kept people's attention and received the spirits of the Depression. You know the other keys in Shirley's successful film. <br /> This film achieves none of the above, despite the star presentations of Gary Cooper and Carole Lombard and despite a very good director of Henry Hathaway. In addition, there are too many parts of here that are merely boring, with too many arguments between a Lombard and Cooper. At his head off, you did not get normal feel-good finish that is what the public wants. I guess they learned later this movie.
