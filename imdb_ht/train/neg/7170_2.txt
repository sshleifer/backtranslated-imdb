Yikes made this movie blow. Characters were weak, the weaker scheme. I figured this would not be too bad because it has Christoper Walken, oops. He had to do this because he was bored and needed the money. The characters were supposed to be Irish but noone had an Irish accent. I desperately trying to find something nice about this, I can not except Walken did a fine job with a wooden character. Finding something for her, or seeing discovery, never seen this movie.
