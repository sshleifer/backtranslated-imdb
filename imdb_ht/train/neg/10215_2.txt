A horribly free and, worse, boring movie. Stranger Than Fiction has nothing new to say about anything, no character beyond the most unimaginative stereotypes, and relies on a central clunky concept that is neither particularly original nor faced with in a vaguely innovative way. Ferrell is totally wasted in what he presumably hoped to be her response to Jim Carey's Truman Show, and replacing his usual crying routine (Admittedly very funny if you discount Talledega Nights ) for, well, pretty much nothing. Emma Thompson is no more than mildly disappointing (as some comment I read here talking to her for an Oscar nomination is ridiculous) also Maggie Gyllenhaal performs a working beam with a very weak script that lets nothing beyond establishing his character as an ancient law student who had fallen from Harvard to become a bakery because he likes to make people happy. Please. That it has fallen to Ferrell's 'character' is absolutely funny. Marc Forster's attempt to jam up the movie using computer graphics only served to highlight the unenspired material he worked with. > <br /> I had the choice to either go to look at the Prestige for a third time or see this. I wish I would opt for the Prestige.
