A lot of themes or parts of the story are the same as in Leon, then other parts have felt like some other films, I do not know who, but have a familiar feeling about the whole movie. It was kind of beautiful to look, but it would have been fantastic! if the story would be more original. The girl's theme, Evil Killer in Leon, is just tweaked a little. The opening scenes are really good :-) It is strange that people love to fight in the kitchen, in the movies :-) The biggest problem I remembered was that party was from Leon, Nikita and if they were from version of French or American. If you have not seen Leon, then this is a good movie. If you liked this movie, then I can recommend Leon. <br /> <br /> Best Greetings / Rick
