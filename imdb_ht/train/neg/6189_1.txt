I bought the DVD version of this movie on the recommendation of my wife who liked the version he had seen revealing on television. But the DVD set version was a disaster. The illumination was poor to non-existent and the scenes were simply excised. In one instance Adele was put to bed, and we immediately cut off another scene - coming in to sentence sentence - where it's the next night. Characters like Grace Poole and Mason never even presented, leaving one wonder if they would be diverted off for a few minutes during the movie. DVD DVDs we've seen were produced by Platinum Disc Corp and even at $ 6.32 it was a gip. <br /> <br /> Be careful what version of this movie you buy! We're sending this one back.
