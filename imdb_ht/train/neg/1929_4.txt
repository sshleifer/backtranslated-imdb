Some were praised - Atlantis: The Lost Empire - as a Disney adventure for adults. I do not think so - at least not for adults thinking. <br /> <br /> This script suggests a start as a live-action movie, which strikes someone as the type of crap you can not sell to adults anymore. "Cracked employees" in many major adventure movies did well before, (think the dozen dirty) but -Atlantis- represents one of the movie films worse in this motto. Characters are weak. Even the background that every member of the trots looks like the stock and the best left. An MD / Man Man, a Tomboy mechanic who always wants to be a son, if we do not have at least seen these before, we've seen mix-and-match career before. The story of how a companion, Vinny played by Don Novello (Fr. Guido Sarducci), went to the totally compelling demolition flower shop. <br /> Only the main character, Milo Thatch, a young Atlantis-obsessed academic voice by Michael J. Fox, has any depth of it. Milo's research for Atlantis continues at his grandfather who raised him. The opening scene shows a younger younger Milo giddily perched on a knee, as his grandfather put his helmet on her head. <br /> But while the characters were thinner at best, the best part about -Atlantis- was the talent of voice. Commander Rourke loses anything she's heard by James Garner. Although Rourke is a very good military type, Garner shows his ability to live breath in character simply by his delivery. Vocal performance sticker is high point. I'm sorry to say that King Leonard Nimoy's death is nothing more than mandatory. In addition, Don Novello as the demolition expert, Vinny Santorini, was also remarkable for one or two well-done, funny lines - but I still loved Papa Guido Sarducci, anyway. It was the Computer Animator. The HACKGROUND animation, that is. Animation character does not do anything if it does not make flat characters appear even flatter. Aside from landscapes, buildings and cars is not much impressed. The draw was the worst. Some say that rebellion or trite. I'm not so sure. Any scheme servers can do something new with the appropriate treatment. Shakespeare often started out in a known and drawn story and was famous only for putting on a new coat of paint. So, the treatment is the thing. And -Atlantis - obviously lacking. <br /> I can not start going through all the logic gaps without a spoiler section. The plot was bad. The snap bridge snap-like snap and the finish does not make sense. To add to this, the script and animation are peppered and annoying sloppiness. <br /> <br /> ** SPOILERS ** <br /> <br /> Right at the beginning when Milo reveals that Symbols or Celtic symbols have been misunderstood and the "Coast of Ireland" should read "Coast in Iceland ", we begin to have problems. The writers of the script would need to know the British take for Eire or Eireann as "Ireland", and completely ignore the greatest, Latino term Hibernia. But more than that, they need to know the Vikings plots called the Island of the Vatican Island and the Greenland iceland. By making it a problem in a mis-tranliterated "letter", the writers have finished themselves in requiring a runic version of English and a post-Roman date on the script. Since this is long after Atlantis was supposed to have sunk into its cave on the sea. And without any indication visible and less technology than Milo was, made the inscription far confidently. Shepherd's Journal could not write before sinking in Atlantis, or she would know anything about the cave or the crystal lying "in the eye of the king." It must have been written down, but without the same technology that Milo's expansion, how the heck made anybody find in the Leviathan. So, how can he know more about anything afterwards? And why should he write in the Atlantic? <br /> <br /> Automatic writing and clairvoyance or astral travel can explain things. However clairvoyance and Astral travel do not require to be written in Atlantic. So it has to be some sort of automatic writing. Since no-one left of Atlantis can read, it must be the spirits of the brilliant crystal messages to the surface. This would make more sense. But could also be explained in the movie: Milo could shepherds have discovered that this power was called her all her life - appearing in dreams, etc. This needs to be explored in the movie. Atlants should simply not be able to understand modern languages. No one hopes that the Indo-Europeans might converse in Europe, again than the Romans would understand that hard "c" or days have become French "ch" s (pronounced like "sh" s, no less! ) <br /> <br /> The current Atlantic was alive before the cataclysm - when apparently they * could * read, yet now they can read what they used to, or operate similar machines. Mass Analiterite points out an important flaw in the movie. DO NOT seem like this culture. It seems to stop at air until Milo can save it. Though it appears that life is not a constant struggle for survival, no-wishing poetry compositions or writing novels and maybe it is a combination of Atlantic school systems going down to the end and the lack of good fiction that caused Atlantis to fall into Analysis ... Kida may apologize for not knowing how to operate it or operating the car if it was so young when the Cataclysm in the sort put - but any of it ** HARDLY ** qualifies his father for deification! The Kashakim is a fool that almost single-handedly wipes its people out of existence. Kill a lot of cataclysmic, has progressed progress (not much killed here, but has overseen a massive slide of culture and progress) until someone could take the crystal to kill everyone, if they did not boil first lava because The Giant Robots did not have to protect them. <br /> <br /> A bolt of blue electricity would have to break Kashakim's photos, when Kida tried to get into his father's image in the circle of GREAT Kings of Atlantis! Even if Milo was the only one who could read Atlantis, Rourke and others knew enough to look at a book of gibberish and found a page on a crystal - which he knew to be a crystals and not some styled astrology or the "phases of sun" diagram. <br /> <br /> If Milo's grandmother told Rourke about it, she still does not explain how Rourke would suffer from milo reading as part of the book. Curtain out the page - which was dog-eared from the Rourke, though Milo found no signs of a worn page of the book apparently - only had tip to the viewer that "something was not quite right". Unless the word "crystal" would put the alarms on Milo's head that someone would attempt to steal, Milo would have been suspicious of anything. It's just thick-headed predicted. <br /> The "Double-Cross" crew was not a character change. We've learned that Vinny, Sweet, Audrey and Cookies have gone along with Rourke in the beginning. However, "change of heart" falls flat. It was a change, and needed to be best motivated. Hard to do with characters that have not been given anything to start with. <br /> <br /> Niggling little that the lava flows over the bowl, instead of filling in the rest of the area that we see the sequence from It's fluid; it will not leak over the protective bowl until it fills all the lower areas. <br /> <br /> STINKS are finished! - and makes no sense other than appealing policy correctness. With its poweruss restored, Atlantis is not a weak power, which needs coddling. Guardian giant robots and sky-sugar to shoot blue lightning suggest that they are less afraid of us than they might be. Technology is our superior, and definitely early 20th century. At the end of Milo needs to teach the Atlanteans to read, for what? The whole idea is to leave little quiet, chastity culture alone, by sending it to hyperdrive. <br /> <br /> ** END SPOILERS ** <br /> <br /> Perhaps, the lost world scheme and the turn-of-the-century environment should give me a hint that this is more a homage doll. The chances I get with the movie agree with this idea. But I am at a loss why I should pay to see thin characters and draw draw simply because many dinner novels had them as well. And pulp stories are part of "crap they can not sell adult again," anyway. We have become a bit more sophisticated and we need to grow too. Adventures in the Lost Lost Box No of its pulp feel and avoiding many cruelty. <br /> 4 out of 10 - the movie is enjoyable, but as I think about the draw, it's a couple of times lower.
