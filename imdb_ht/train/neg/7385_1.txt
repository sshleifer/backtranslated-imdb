The film is boring, the characters and scenarios are unrealistic, incredible, the action is hilarious. This movie is a big mess. It almost seems like when the action music kicks off, the most impressive cascade is running. Either voice armed with Mr. McGregor or Steven has sung a lot and has changed his voice. There is a way too much dialogue in this movie, and very badly acting on behalf of everyone. The film is great sleeping therapy. The battle is mockable. The effect of changes in eyes on drug drug drug users were decent. The main villain was a joke and his character was poorly developed. The main villain was used to explain the story through interrogation, it would just throw random plots into such a (spoiler) "CTX (his designer drug) going to the water supply" that never addressed the conclusion or even mentioned again in the movie. This movie is highly recommended to pass.
