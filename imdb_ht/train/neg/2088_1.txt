What a terrible show. Fans of science fans seem to look nothing like quality. It shocks me that something outstanding like Firefly lasts a season, while garbage like the Battlestar Galactica renewal spawns a turn. This cut is debilable in all aspects of the show. The act is youthful and uninspired. Characters are cardboard quilts in everything that has ever been in a bad sci-fi series. The story is bad. The dialogue is worse than a soap opera first time. The direction is fabric and the horrible layers. Caprica is a waste of film, a waste of time and a waste of effort. This is one turn that should never have done.
