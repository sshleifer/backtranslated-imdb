Honestly, I was disappointed in the "expiration date." Super smart titles and interesting quotes, but I do not think it delivers. What was it about? Desire the main character to reconnect with his native roots? Or, most likely, he needed him to overcome his fear of death. But he was not set up as a person who lived his life in fear - it seems as if his life was fine, but since doomsday is approaching he should now start worrying. I did not buy it. Meanwhile, the characters supported in the film did not seem to have blended needs in a great story. They all just do things, running parallel with the main character. Also, what was treated as a "curse" looked more like a coincidence. Who cursed the family? Why? When? Finally, why did not she just plan on staying in her apartment all day on her birthday? Those are my criticisms, but I liked the vacations in Seattle, the cinematographer was beautiful, acting good at those times he was not exceptional.
