I have confessed that I am very serious. <br /> <br /> This version can in no way compete with the version of 1995. The reason why I watched it was that I was not entirely pleased with Ciaran Hinds as Captain Wentworth and thought Rupert Penry-Jones See more like the Captain I was imagining when I read the book. And he was too. <br /> Unfortunately this is just the quality redeemed in the movie. The rest is as un-Austen-like as possible. Miss Elliot would never run on the streets of Bath like this. It was not in her character and she just was not done by a lady at those moments. Anne Elliot in the book was a lady and she was dignified. There are other analgesics that hurt but that was the worst. Although there are 3 important quotes in the book, they are entirely inappropriate, warning people who know the book that yet another important part of the book is either missing or completely changed. <br /> And although this version is not shorter than the other one, it feels like everything is running. Very little care was taken to present the characters, displaying their disposition and their motives. The important scenes were missing. How might they have been tired of final stage in this way? A disaster! And it was not far away as beautiful pictures as the other. <br /> No, no, no. If you love Austen, then do not waste your time with that.
