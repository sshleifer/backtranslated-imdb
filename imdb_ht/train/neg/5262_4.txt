We went to an appointment, so we turned on the DVR to the finish file. After it was over, I looked at my husband, saying, "Do you have a clue?". He shook his head no. I said, "So you make me look at the end of this movie and I have no sign of what's happening." He did not "do" me, but you know. The movie body itself was quite good. There was a lot of suspense. He kept you asking. Then finished the finish. The finish was ... well it just end up. You have not left in on what happened or why. Right up to the credits I kept thinking that something would happen to explain it, but it never did. So I came here to expect someone to figure out it out and I just did not pay attention. Nope. Here are four years later, I am as clueless as tom sawyer. <br /> I still have no signs that went through. I'm just glad I did not waste any $$ to buy it because I'm sure they were crazy. <br /> <br /> OHHHHH! I found it! The end of the movie is what's missing! ROFL
