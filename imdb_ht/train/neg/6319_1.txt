This film reminds me of how college students were used to protest the Vietnam War. As if, when some children were done without cheeseburgers at Cow Dung Collehe, the President went to immediately change all US foreign policy. <br /> <br /> The worst thing is that, while dangerous, the concept of a policy based on whether the USSR and US have gone to war it might mean the end of the world worked. The US and USSR never go to war. <br /> <br /> There were only conventional weapons, the notion of yet another war, a "win-able" war, in Europe and Asia was not misfortune. <br /> Not that I think they should get rid of this movie. It should be seen by film students as a splendid example of "How to Do a Movie." <br /> It should be 0 stars or maybe black holes.
