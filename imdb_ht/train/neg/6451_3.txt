"Steve" (Chris Hoffman) gathered a group from high school for a meeting in the cabin place where Wes his twin brother was missing. While there, a reptile creature in the form of a man (reminds me a lot of the Gillman from creation out of the dark egg) waiting in the desert to choose the right time to choose apart from one by one. A biker, Ellen Ripley-kind of bad-donkey time, Kat (Chase Masterson) has a bunker military underground she practices the experience, while she also serves as a safe place in the stuff of rats. Maps know more that he says (he also suffered the loss of a child), but there is another gift twist that the group has no idea of. This animal might just be more human than it is achieved .. and it's ancient identity might shed some light on a deception just another person who was hiding since Wes' death. Maps keep the key to the many mysteries that unlock as the group stays close to the cabin. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, a large part of the movie stays away from the cold air in the air while we also see a varnish of greed when we look in her eyes. The film has Dawson's Melodramatic Creek that often prevents any real tension that needs to be built into a little monster movie. The direction is very bland that leads to a relatively dull experience instead of eligible crisis. The cast is rather life-less and refreshing. Pretty Maggie Grace (Remark of FOG) might be the only draw for this movie.
