I'm not looking for good quality; I'm just trying to get into the 74 famous video nasties that was banned in Britain. This was first initially prohibited and re-released in 2001 with a whole 10 seconds cut. <br /> <br /> Some children in college spend Christmas vacation preparing a dormitory for renovation. Some characters clamber over cache along with four children. Which of them is the slasher? The real killers are not very spoiled, so nastie this video is not really embarrassing. There is a glimmer that targets the phobias, but it does not have anything to do with college kids. I had a suspect very quickly and I turned out to be good. Maybe I've seen too much of these. The finished end was clever; I must give the writer credit for that bit of originality.
