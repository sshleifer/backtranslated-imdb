I was so looking forward to seeing this when it was in production. But it turned out to be the biggest down. A far cry from the fantasy world of Dr. Seuss. It was vulgar and unpleasant I did not think Dr. Seuss would approve. How Grinch stole Christmas was the best. I understand he had some subtle adult jokes at hand but my kids still catch on. Whereas the cat in the hatched screaming hat to hold a lot more than I would like.Growing up with Dr. Seuss It really bothered me to see how this classic timeless was trashed on the big screen .Lets see these Do and Horton hear someone who I hope this one is Dr. Seuss some justice.
