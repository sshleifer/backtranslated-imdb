This should be one of the worst films I have ever seen, the ridiculous graphics, and the script scripting and the biggest question is how this rather low noise has trough the selection process. <br /> I love all kinds of movies from the deep play of more men oriented to kill everything you see the movie type, so I can not say I'm picky. I had difficulty finding something to compare it to, but I just could not think of something to match this, perhaps troop travelers 2. Witch in my opinion makes the cries cry and I think about sending DVD players I, but compared to this its effect is great. You must award the superb and superb. You know when a movie is bad in a funny way, as this is not one of those people killed your soul minutes by minute.
