I was totally disappointed by this movie. I have read some of the other comments here and there were higher expectations. I hope a drama with more intense character development. But that never happened to the movie. Daniel-Day Lewis is a good actor, but not as good as some reviews here would believe. I thought he had repeatedly the same set of 4 or 5 movements in the movie. I would miss her performance 6 out of 10. <br /> <br /> Actress: 6 out of 10 Directions is 5 out of 10. The script is the worst: 2 out of 10. <br /> <br /> I delete the movie from my DVR in 70 min. in the movie. Many better movies are out there than ...
