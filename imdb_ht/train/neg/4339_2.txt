This film was totally not what I expected. <br /> <br /> if this movie was called something else no one would even notice the difference between the two. <br /> <br /> it's really weird because I can not see the point. The prequel and end allow just say no make sense, not even the match. Maybe I'm naive but not a 1 & 2 vol 1 means to match up. <br /> <br /> Carlito was imprisoned in the 1st one and died in the original, and in the prequel he lives and does not go jail. <br /> <br /> <br /> The plot was OK but should change round some actors and some of the story line with the movie name and it would be a good movie. <br /> <br /> I really hope it ends as the other started. <br /> <br /> if there is an individual who has an opinion on this post, please.
