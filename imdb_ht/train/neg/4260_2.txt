Yeah, right. I spent the first hour of waiting patience for the movie to take off. It was horribly boring, and made mostly of people randomly mounted around the hills with no apparent direction. Then the hero comes to the picture. He was born as an Asian, but when he grew up, he became white. It is obviously white. It was not even close to pass for Asian. It looked like Justin Timberlake. It was very distracted, and the story did nothing to help the cause. Pointless battle sequences and lame dialogues. It's been an hour and forty five minutes long, and in the end I was trying to eat my own face. I watched this because of the video store where I'm still wondering if this movie is good. Now I have an answer. It goes something like this: ahem. "NO GOD! You can not do it!" I would recommend another film, maybe one fun. "
