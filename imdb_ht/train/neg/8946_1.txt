I think the shots and lighting were very poor. When I looked at her for the first time I thought she was the old version (1956). When I really found the true year of the movie I was shocked. I did not know that such a movie could be done lately. That's really all I meant. This movie has a good scheme though, nothing you could not miss out if you would simply read the novel that George Orwelll wrote. Everything I really meant was already said except for this: I can not believe that this movie could possibly have received many awards and nominations. I gave this movie a Youn (terrible) because I felt that It was very seriously done. Well that's all. So long ago
