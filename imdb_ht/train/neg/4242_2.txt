Men, do I love the police cinema filled with action, shooting, chases etcetera. <br /> <br /> Boy, I left down after watching this short and unsatisfactory movie. We've seen it all before, the hostages, the bank, the surrounding ... But 2 bad guys shot down multiple officers and innocent people just staying in the line of fire - without getting hit due to some Kevlar . <br /> Not just a few shots, no, hundreds of shots. Go back to the bank, where the mute hostages did not lock the security or door when the guys went out. How stupid did the director think we should. Okay, the shots in between fake a documentary were good, but after seeing the movie I was just thinking of: why did not get the police a decent shooting course? And why where there are so many cops and being swat on a real time break. Surely bad.
