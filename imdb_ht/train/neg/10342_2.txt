Jameson Parker and Marilyn Hassett are the most incredible couple of couples since John Travolta and Lily Tomlin. Larry Peerce's direction has been spreading uncontrollably between clear black and Roman tragedy. Robert Klein certainly thinks she is the former and self-centered performance in a minor role outlining the total lack of balance and chemistry between the players in the movie. Normally, I do not like to let myself become ascerbic, but Bell Jar is one of my favorite books, and to watch what they did and it made me literally crazy.
