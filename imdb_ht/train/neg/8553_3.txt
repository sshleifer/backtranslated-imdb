This is actually a very bad movie. The ideology is not as bad word as in these films Collins did later. However, my main mystery about the movie is that it is implausible and quite frankly boring for a long time. The whole concept of an old SAS man joins terrorists for no particular reason is not very compelling and you can not help wondering why a group of very organized groups (who later become very clueless) fall for it. The movie begins with a very powerful scene but then meands for quite a long time to build towards the big finale. In general, I think people with wins could be an exciting 45 minute episode of the Professionals, but the story does not bring a feature film. Although reasonable success at this time film insists on the collapse of Collins' career in the eighties mostly made cheap and dubious soldiers-of-fortune or movie films. Mercy, because it's actually a versatile actor but at the end of the day Martin Shaw has chosen his roles more carefully and has a still successful career.
