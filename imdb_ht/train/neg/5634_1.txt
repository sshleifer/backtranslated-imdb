The poster called this "Plotless and Pointless" literally took the words I would use in my subject line. The only thing I would add is "passionate." For a movie made by a real married couple marriage and featuring lots of sex scenes this movie manages to do what would be a hot situation in one cold ice. Dafoe and Colagrande look bored during the sex scenes, and the viewer might as well take a Valium and did with it. Also, the women at the hearing saw VERY Widespread WAY of the Time, and any guy turned around when they saw William Dafoe pulling a blood vib of his wife's vagina really need to get therapy. <br /> I think the key to the movie (if there is one) is the restaurant scene where a man explains the ever-sleeping Peaf Dafoe Dafoe that a "jambalaya deconstrukte" is. (All the ingredients in the dish are still separated rather than blending together.) This film is a "garbage disassembly". All the elements have: spooky, isolated houses, dead spouse, giripon climb on the note, weirdo card readers who come and go as he pleases, auto accident crashes and near death, character and a past secret. Basically every cliche you can think of, but NO comes together. All things just sit and never mesh in a coherent draw or even a mood mood mood. In the restaurant, Dafoe passes on the "jambalaya deconstrukte". Prospective tenants of this disruption would do well to leave this comedy deconstrukte on the video store shelf.
