When I was a teenager-ager watching this movie for the first time, I thought she was one of the best movies ever to do. Of course, the reason for this is Bo Derek and his various states of the film in this film. However, now that I'm older, I can honestly say that this film is awful. Mind you, Bo Derek is absolutely incredibly beautiful, and she and husband-director John Derek make sure you see a lot of it. But when you take aspect from the movie, it gets one big dive ride. And Tarzan, well, it's all muscular as you think it should be, but when she sees Jane (that's Bo, of course) for the first time she does not know what to think. This despite the fact that Bo is wearing a wet-see shirt, and her breasts show obvious. Tarzan would be the only primitive man on the planet who would have this problem. If you are looking for a slobber movie about a beautiful naked body, then this might fill out the ticket. If you are looking for a thoughtful, entertaining and well-being movie, go elsewhere ... almost anywhere else in this !!!
