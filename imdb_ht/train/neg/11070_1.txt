This was a really bad movie. Character "Cole" played by Michael Moriarty was the biggest reason this flopped, the actor felt that conjuring up an unbelievably awkward dragon that would make this character more wrong, he did not. After 20 minutes I wanted a speech therapist to make an appearance, that would add some sincerity. <br /> <br /> - 1) seriously acting - 2) unsympathetic characters - 3) razor thin drawn line <br /> <br /> Yuck! <br /> <br /> /
