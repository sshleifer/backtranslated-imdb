This movie was positively the worst movie I ever watched. I could not sit in the whole thing. I also think writers have to have some strange fetishes for women peeing puking and spitting ... I mean that was all about! I cant believe this was even made and I'm lousy of being #nold a Â£ 4 rental fee. The quality of both photos and sounds is awful, acting ... does not exist. It was a poor excuse for a movie and the scenes of pip, crap and wounds were reminiscent of 2 girls 1 cup. Urghh ....... AVOID ALL COST! The girls seemed like they were being picked up on the street and only got the party's party want to persuade them ... While these girls have their beautiful body certainly did not make up for the fact they were Call was awfully convincing with a pain in my ear. This was like (possibly worse) than a production school ammateur without any proper direction and hey has no need for a series as it all looks like gravity around a car? <br /> <br /> Definitely not one of buying genres. I'm sorry if my comment first is great but I could not find anything positive and I would like to think I can save someone else wasting money as I have.
