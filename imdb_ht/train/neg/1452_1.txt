This 1919 to 1933 Germany looks hardly like a post WWII Czech capitol. Oh sorry, it is the Czech capitol and it is 2003, how funny. This is one of the most terrible stories in the nearest time. Röhm is a head above Adolf and seems slowly good, Göring looks like 40 when he just is 23 and the "Führer" seems to look like 56. And the buildings, as even the buildings were young, sometimes. Especially 1919 was a lot of homes in Germany almost new (the WWI did not happen to Germans!). No paper plaster! Then the Reichstagsbuilding. There have never been urban canyons around this building, never. Then it sounds like you all like a miracle: in the year 1933 Greater Berlin fire brigade owns a lot of cars and engines, some even with ladder turning, but no and a hand pump. Last thing: What kind of PLAYMOBIL castle was this in the final sequel? For me this was a kind of "Adolf's Adventures of Wonderland"
