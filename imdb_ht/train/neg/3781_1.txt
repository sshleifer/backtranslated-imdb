(There are some deficiencies possible) <br /> I'm not too sure what dreamworks thought when they decided to dive $ 80 million down on this very tired and lame cats animated. They probably thought the spectacular animation would be more than enough to bring audiences (mostly relatives) to seeing him in droves. Well it seemed to work for the opening weekend, it made $ 26 thousand, roughly and made $ 38.1 thousand. total (an estimate for this weekend). But I think the audience that came over the weekend saw pretty much the same thing I did when I saw and spread the word. This is one primarily lame film, apart from anything else the animation, especially the script seems to be done by a three year old. The film is only about 80 mins. long, but it feels like a three hour season. A little sticking point for me, quite annoying narration is one of them, and it's obviously written. At one point he escapes from some catchers and even though you can see the horse is obviously scared, the Pops narrator (the voice of Matt Damon's talent) clear all misconceptions (which would only happen in the simplest of spirits. <br /> Another person is the constant pop of Bryan Adams singing, now I'm a fan of his music, I think it's good, but come on to make Dreamworks really think audiences would be able to handle 8-9 at singing it at all as a short movie, I certainly could not finally and here's a beckle, a horse getting shot in space blank space by a member of the calvary, no less, he (the horse) then , falls into a raging river, Spirit (focusing in the movie) trying to save him, but they both go on a waterfall that must have at least a 50 ft drop, later in the movie near the end we see that horse This is alive and well. I know this is a movie of children, but even that little amount of realism is acceptable. <br /> <br /> To sum up, this is a re So lame wi, I'm not telling the kids will not enjoy it, but anyone else will check the watches just waiting for this ending trip. Definitely about the top 10 worst list of this year. - ** from 4 stars. <br /> <br />
