No scenario, bad actor (poor Melissa Gilbert) ... Beurk Beurk Beurk ... <br /> Give a budget what they do ... In Belgium, we have the ten films that have all the cost in Cannes and this . <br /> <br /> Last time I saw a like NULL-Film was Hypercube. But scenario was better. <br /> <br /> Is anyone who knows if the director has graduated from the school movie or a cop? <br /> <br /> The best thing in this film was the word "End" .. Why authorized to sell this? 1c is expensive. <br /> I paid ten dollars to buy that. <br /> For me, paying for this was my great mystic millennium. <br /> <br /> Too bad. <br /> Next time I'll break my arms, but buy this type of sh * t.
