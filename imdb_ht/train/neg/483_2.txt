I did not think the French could make a bad movie, but I was, clearly, very wrong. As previously said, this film essentially uses its title character as a point of departure; paint it in her life and people have little or nothing to do with the real Artemisia Gentileschi. The script is awful - pretentious, vibrating, and stupid - and rewriting it in reality are very offensive even in a genre that all too often make living it does not distort, rather than telling, story. Along with some decent decent justice design, Valentina Cervi's physical charm is the main advantage of this film, and it is obvious from the beginning that the filmmakers were aware of this too; Garbage has no time to compose various "erotic" compounds that have far more to do with past titles and draw or character development. Unfortunately, the appeal of seeing a beautiful girl in a state of expired sexual fianc√© can not, and not, sustained this movie. The act is unremarkable, and the score is all too generic despite an exciting or two rope. The camera is OK, and there are some nice colors, but there are also some very ridiculous sequences using the distorted-lens effect more suitable for a 1960s freakout movie than a costume drama. In any event, the script left the camera to stay all too often on the body of Artemisia, and all too rarely painted it. <br /> <br /> All said, a near-complete failure. It's not smart or tastier enough to be a serious movie, and it's too slow and firefighter to work as soft-core porn. So the French can fail, after all!
