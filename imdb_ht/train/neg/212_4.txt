Closer to reality and with more depth than "Breakdance", Stan Lathan's "Beat Street" is still a pretty dull show. Again, this pic really is just cashing on the arm of rest 'but at least we get a little bit of fun of the plot, which concerns the lives of three young friends and a small brother, all growing up in Queens, New York . Each has its own unique talent. One is a hustler, one of DJs, another artist who creates 'burner', while 'little bro' Lee is a hot 'hip hop' dancer. <br /> <br /> Lathan is able to generate any real audience interest in the story though, and cast its young as well as fighting with the characters. Therefore, it leaves almost entirely in the funky music and 'cool' dance to save the day. <br /> <br /> Choreography again sharp for both clubs and street scenes, but this alone is not enough up "Beat Street" in the biggest heights Unfortunately the film really falls flat late, after them Finishing a glimmer of hope that it just can get interesting.
