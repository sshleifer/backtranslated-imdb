I stopped by BB and picked up 4 flicks of the zombie watch over the weekend. Now I understand that the effects will be cheesy, the act will be sub-par, and the sets will be suspicious. So I'm not waiting a lot. But it should at least have a story. History does not cost anything except time ..... apparently, they did not have any time either. <br /> <br /> "Nation Zombies" had 5 zombies that appeared near the end of the film that all seemed to wave new wave. The picture of the zombie on the front cover never appeared in the movie. It was absolutely agonizing to look and nothing to offer the genre. <br /> <br /> Time to run is only 81 minutes, but it felt like 2 hours. According to my wife (who can only hear the movie since she was on the computer in another room), she sounded like zombie porn .... that if you think about, sound something gross ..... but it was not even that good. <br /> <br /> The only suggestion I can do is that perhaps the writer tried to do things too much and ended up with an incoherent mess. <br /> It ended up being a free rental and I still felt torn off. I rated it a 1 out of 10 because IMDb will not allow I to use decimal.
