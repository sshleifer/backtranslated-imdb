As a great fan of the cracker series, I was waiting for 7 years for the next addition. This episode I'm afraid just do not live up to the legend. Fitz returns to Manchester after 7 years for her daughter's wedding and gets involved in a murder investigation being a soldier, suffering from flash back from his trip to Northern Ireland, go on a killing spree. <br /> <br /> What I do not like about this episode is the very good way it is all set up and how fitz is leading to the murderer. It is all fat to look far. <br /> There are however some good scenes back in Northern Ireland that are great filmmakers.
