An intriguing scheme, refreshing and sub-parody characters (they say at least) the calamity of this television production that would hardly have been interesting even with a billion billion dollar budget. Characters are not credible, in their motives, their actions or professional occupations. The plot reads such a bad dungeon with dragons (TM) hack hands with plasma rifles and field forces. There are serious continuous issues and the degree of freak interaction between the characters who have this author, at least, wincing. <br /> Avoid it as the epidemic. Watch any episode of black angel and you will have better acting, dialogue and conspiracy. Yuck.
