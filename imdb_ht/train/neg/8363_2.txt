I gave her a 2 instead of a 1 because I think the "Wild Women in Wongo" is getting worse. This is an exercise of patience. It's like having your teeth cleaned by a bad dental hygienist. There is no draw. There is no logic. There is certainly no act (although the shark has some quality dialogues). We do not ask anything about anything. We do not know how people received the places they received. It's still amazing to me how things like this even get released. I agree with the previous writer that it is not even funny. I know. It's about 90 minutes time and will fill up on that much space on a DVD collection. It's like a paper. Or a bad paint you bought at a starving starving star. He covered the crack in the wall.
