First of all, the big actors named were needed for the money ... the surgical scenes were mocking ... and surely to know that people with little knowledge of medicine would get this absurd whole. ... anesthesia does not leave the room during a heart transplant .... nor does the surgery into a small devoid of muscle instruments, heart lung equipment and sterile techniques ... just a joke ... could not focus on the story line because of all the operational scenes stupid ... there is no blood, no personal and then the hero doc come in and take over ... it is not a movie for adult thinking. Also, the budget was limited ... The street scene was OK, but was advised in techniques .... Like it was headed by a fool person .. Save your money and wait until it comes out on DVD and they do not rent it
