I was forced to watch this whole series of films like a toddler and I said they were REAL! Talk about child abuse. I would have less scared of Dracula or Frankenstein. This series is only good for those who believe in this ridiculous and those who want to indirectly the children to believe the same. In addition to the obvious problems associated with swirling and inducrination, there are also acts of bad, bad writing, and BAD "special effects". They are just all around terrible, terrible movies. Yes, believable (and terrible) to a kid, but I can not imagine a buy-up buy in this butcher. Although, I must say, that I would be interested in seeing them today, as an adult. They may have a certain movie / cult feeling.
