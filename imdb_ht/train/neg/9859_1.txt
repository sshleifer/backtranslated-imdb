This film is just lame. A total waste of time and money. The jokes are predictable, the characters are so clich√© and how it talks about RPG gamers is not funny as well. The problem is that the writers seem not to know how a RPG game works and, most importantly, how to make jokes about this game. Of course, there are a lot of losers who play rpg like freaking delay and total losers. But for me this is not the foul way to joke about this game. The story makes no sense at all. Who cares about how long a game has been played? The greatest problem in this film is that the writers and actors did not even try to figure out what RPG is about to make jokes about it. I felt ashamed when I watched this movie.
