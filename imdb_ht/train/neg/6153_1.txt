So let me start by saying that I saw this movie as part of a bargain. I really bored a fine of 1997 days and so I biked about in the movie movie store. I asked the clerk who was the worst film she was in stock was. Without hesitation he walked on to "Lucky Raid." He told me he would waive the $ 1 rental fee (he said it would be wrongly charged more) if I promised to watch the whole movie. So watch it I did, for free ... <br /> <br /> This movie is terrible. God-awful even. I do not need to go into the details of the draw and read the other reviews. The jokes do not make any sense. The act was terrible. I know it was supposed to be a comedy, but the sort of main character was tedious. You might try to watch it as something to laugh at, but it's so bad that it's not even funny in that way. Avoid!
