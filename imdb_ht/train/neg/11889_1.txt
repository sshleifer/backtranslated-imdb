Very funny to watch the "Beretta Island" as a kind of natural-film waste. It's like the kind of Jess Franko's kind of b-movie.Bodybuilders strikes back (! Face off!) Pushers.The very pretty stupid strike! Action: Unbelievable badly directed shoot (shooting) scenes look even better than hand-to-hand fighting. Chase ridiculous scenes.Save cute scenes incredibly stupid.Erotic scenes are very unerotic.The main chances of film are beautiful landscapes and festival scenes. Do not miss: Arnold Schwarzenegger's joke at the start of Franco Columbu's film and film list at the end. Special attraction: nude bosom.Almust forget - Franco can sing!
