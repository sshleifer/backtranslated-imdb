Warning shown predictably about a man who killed his wife by cutting him when driving and claiming he was blacked out. Why was he still driving a car? Why did he still feel he can drive a car that killed his wife and one? This question has not happened to the writers. The story then scratches on a psychologist and his marriage fail that is tied to the marriage to the weakening of wounded-powered driver. A homonymous mother and one size children are thrown in for good measure, and the whole builds up to a predictable denial and final collision. Is psychologist so easy to take in? Deadly writes that the actors do their best, but they end up in failure. This is about a par with a Harlequin Romance. Do not waste your time watching this one unless you aim for.
