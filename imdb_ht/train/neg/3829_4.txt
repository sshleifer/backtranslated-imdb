Train thief in jail near Yuma broke free chain-gang and head for the retired sheriff who is responsible for killing his wife (as well as a hidden coupon of gold left to hide from the senarist). Trying to bring west-to-date genre to 1970s-style violence and brutality is not even in the same league as some of the new-fangled west that came from the end-60s. It is impossibly simple and square, with the female characters simply around as punching bags and victims possible rape. As the former sheriff returned in order, Charlton Heston gave one of his younger, lesser-inspired performances ever (he had a good time, tries to read a letter and fumbling for his glasses). James Coburn, as half-crossed half-crossed, is very beautiful on self-pilot as well, but Coburn has a way of turning the same hoariest dialogue and situations into something shock and unnerving. It shows him all the way. * 1/2 from ****
