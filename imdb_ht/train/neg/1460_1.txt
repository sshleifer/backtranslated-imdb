If another Hitler has ever arrived, he will thank the party of nonsense like this movie, which spreads the absurd statement that he was a newly disrupted patient from the beginning. Far from such a person and choosing it to the highest office in the country, the sane people could cross the street to avoid him, and he would die in a cave, nameless and unknown. He talks to Hitler's close colleagues - the autobiography of his secretary Traudl Junge for example - will be hit by the fact that people have found him a sweet, smart, generous man. It was also a brilliant speaker, and the fact that his speech seems to block and ranting in modern ears ignoring the times of doing, when strutting pomposity was common in political speech. This is the exact anti-Semitism, which was neither a central stick of the Nazis early - especially anti-communism - neither uncommon nor unusual for the times. The film makes it look as if Hitler's only ambition since the beginning was the Holocaust. <br /> <br /> If you want to identify the next person who will cause deaths of tens of millions, you can ignore the single-lipped single-lipped ravers here. Look instead of a good man, charisma who has convincing talks inspiring the entire nation, and whose political works are visible and beneficial to the country. I'm afraid his personality will be much more like Barack Obama than Fred Phelps. <br /> I hope so much here, and got nothing but cartoon. The fool who did this perpetrated a crime against reality. This is the historical equivalent of 'Reefer Madness'.
