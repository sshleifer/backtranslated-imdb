This film is based on novel by John Fante. Could someone please tell me why? I see absolutely no reason why this book should be adapted in this way. If you want to make a romantic melodramatic Hollywood production with Colin Farell and Selma Hayek, then how could you possibly make a connection to the Dust (the novel)? - If you wanted to make this story in a movie, then why would you want to do it in a romantic melodramatic Hollywood production with Colin Farell and Selma Hayek? I did not find it. <br /> The adaptation of the story is wrongly done, and if you have read the book and love it, I'm almost sure you will not like what Towne did with it. <br /> In the beginning of the movie you'll probably find odd in casting, the bad act and the cinematography just a bit late. But you hope for the better. I really hope so much during this movie. I actually wanted it to be good. But it only gets worse, and it's as simple as that: If you read fantasy novel or not, this is not a good movie. Just another romantic melodramatic Hollywood production combined with bad acting, lack of structure and - of course - lots of shots at Colin Farells naked butt. <br /> <br /> I could complain a lot more about this movie, but why wasted my time. I saw it. Well. I saw it, because I love the book so much and was curious. And I'm very disappointed. <br /> <br /> 1/10 is the little Colin lamb little at the end of the movie. So sweet ... Had torn it all the time, I would give it 2/10.
