The first movie movie movie, 3 young ladies destroyed their car and ended up with a creepy family. YAWN. Look 36 minutes to a priority in pursuing the OJ car with a white sedan instead of a bronco. YAWN. An old lady with hot and cold request to control her daughter ... YAWN <br /> 23 minutes of watching the food actors - YAWN Try to identify what they eat to eat ... OK might be a drinking game here ... ne - YAWN <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> random killer and inspiration ... YAWN <br /> End ... dude! which psycho is disturbing - why could not the rest of the film be like the past 5 minutes ... unfortunately it is it - my advice - fast forward five minutes past and watch it and then , put a good thing in the player - for me I'll go back to sleep.
