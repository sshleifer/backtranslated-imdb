Well, when I came to the board for this movie, I was really waiting for people to have fun in it. I was surprised to see that the 7-year-old loved it. I loved the movie ... but only b / c me and my younger sister (that is, in fact only 10) made fun of the whole thing. <br /> I'm sorry to Jordan, but that act was terrible. You know that a movie is directed to the bathroom when the lead can not act. And he did not even have a good script or draw to redeem it. I also thought that Pamela's character was very blame ... border-lined pathetic. Even with what they said, I thought there were a few good actors, such as Gorgeous Spencer, Hollywood, and Ronnie. Still, not enough to pick up the movie. Two things on this movie I can not find: <br /> 1.) That guy Spencer would fall for her. Okay, eww. I look at the dates and while in fact, it is only about four years older than it, the difference in "Go Figure" seemed to be larger. Jordan is a very beautiful girl, but at GF, she looks like 10 or 12 ... it looks like a kid! Jake Abel (Spencer) looked like a college student. <br /> <br /> 2.) There is no way that Kristi Yamaguchi would just come to skate for a girl. I mean, I know that Katelin is good and everything, but it still seemed so easy that Kristi would go to a boarding school that did not even have a scholarship scholarship, or that a school would have worked coaching coaches and such connections ... Not all this movie said ... it was not the worst movie ever known, but it was not very good even by DCOM standard, which I consider very low.
