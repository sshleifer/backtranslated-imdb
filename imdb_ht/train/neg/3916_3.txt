We all know a movie never does justice fairly in the book, but this is exceptional. Important characters were cut out, Blanca and Alba were essentially mushed into the same character, most of the subplots and major components of the main draw were eliminated. Clara's clairvoyance was very downplayed, making it look like a much more deep character than the one I knew in the book. In the book we learn more about her power and the important effects she has on many people, which in turn was a key element in the life of the family. In the movie it was no more than some special ladies. The relationship between Esteban and Pedro Tercero (Tercero-third, by the way is the son and thus comes after Segundo second-) with its connection to which between Esteban and his descendants from Pancha Garc√≠a (by child, who he also recognizes) is cut in half and its importance downplayed. One of the most fundamental things about the book that the movie is all but the strip: this is called "House of the Spirits." Where is the house? The story of 3-4 generations of a family is assumed to be gravity around the "big house on the edge," a line declared many times in the novel. The home is fundamentally in the story, but the film unjustly relays it to a series only. <br /> If I did not read the previous book, I would never guess that like a vampire, movie films could be based on such a rich and fun novel.
