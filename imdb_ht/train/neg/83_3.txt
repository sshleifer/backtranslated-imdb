Jill Dunne (played by Mitzi Kapture) is an attractive, beautiful woman, on-whelmed by a smart-young daughter, Book (Martha MacIsaac) and a little, two-timed husband, Sean (Rick Roberts) Both of them were tediously self-centered, and obnoxious. <br /> <br /> This was released as a troubled family tight by a crazy killer during a relentless storm. <br /> <br /> The storm does not even come up to the last 5 minutes of the movie, and then it's nothing to send anyone to run in the storm. <br /> <br /> The trap, the same does not get intense until almost the end of the movie. <br /> <br /> Most of the movie we listened to Jill and her objectionable daughter, Book, discussed until I just wanted to calm down the daughter next week. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Jill's problem with Books is that she took up with Zack, a boy of skeptical characters, and are still doing out - in fact Jill comes home to find two of them on bed book la. time we spend listening to husband Jill at Sean Night at Jill or criticizing her. <br /> <br /> Sean was not at all appealing - since her face is so covered in freckles you could play connecting points. The story begins with Jill being advised of a bill out-stand on their credit card for a hotel he never was, and that he thought Sean was never in either. <br /> <br /> Jill goes to the hotel where she meets the owner & manager, Richard Grant (Nick Mancuso), a very beautiful, older, divorced man, who is sympathetic. In fact, when she spits her husband again, she phones Jill and her tips off. <br /> <br /> Jill returns to the hotel, seeing Sean and another woman. He is upset, leaving Sean to see him and doing absolutely nothing. In fact, she did not say anything to Sean when she came home. This made no sense to me. <br /> <br /> Jill gave Richard his business card, and so he calls it and is apparently in real estate. It shows it a condo. After that they have a drink, and things get cozy between them. <br /> <br /> Richard and Jill are getting it on, hot and heavy. In fact, it looks a bit more aggressive than necessary, when Jill suddenly decided to cut out. <br /> <br /> Jill and Sean have a confrontation about how to cheat. Sean whines about how Jill had left him since his father died. Apparently lacking in any moral is all his fault. Eventually, Jill acknowledges her own shortage of morality and near Sean adultery - and of course that's all her fault too, as far as Sean is concerned. <br /> <br /> The little family decided to go to a travel-camp which means more vulnerable and vibrating among them, especially the spoiled daughter. <br /> I was so rooting for the Stalker to get everyone, but Jill.
