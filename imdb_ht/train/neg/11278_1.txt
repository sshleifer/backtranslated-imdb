This film is quite simply one of the worst movies ever made and is an overwhelming accusation of not only the British movie industry but the talentless hacks of work today. Not only the movie to find its mainstream distribution also features a good cast of British actors, so what's wrong? I do not know and simply I do not care enough to engage with the debate because the film was so awful it deserves no thought at all. They must warn and stay away from this waste. but apparently I need to write ten lines of text in this review so I might as well as detail the scheme. A noble one is setup by his evil friend and co-worker from his father's company and thus leads to a meeting with the Russian mafia and dodging accessible and stupid, very stubborn draw / device twists. I should ask for my money back but maybe still in the trauma of the experience. if you want a movie Crime good look at the usual suspect or the godfather, what about lock, stock .... that's the peak of the contemporary British crime movie .....
