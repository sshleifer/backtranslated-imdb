Where oh where to start off describing Neil's bad thingsBut the latest tent film making? <br /> <br /> There are many types of movie fans out there, but by far the most annoying and deep is Mr. Intriguing. Do you know Mr. Intriguing, not yours? <br /> It is the fellow who does not matter how stupid, lame, and incomprehensible to wear a movie is, he says "Gee, I do not know why everyone hated it, I find it intriguing. " It is kind of guy who finds the smell of penguins. Especially when it embraces it in the form of a Hitler mustache on its upper lip and march on the house ranting on the brilliance of science fiction that features distinctly minimal reference to Greek mythology. It is also the guy the version of the Wicker man made for. No other person could stand there.
