OK, the story - a simple wheelchair enters into a life of bored of young chick deaths and kid's kidneys and cockroaches in their lives - is a little interesting one. Anyway, the ideas have nothing (everyone has some ...) - the execution is everything. <br /> <br /> This is what bothers me with this movie flick. And he bothered me very much. The rhythm (LED, correction) was slow, the pace was uneven and the highest point was expected. We saw these high frigging highways, six, seven times - why? Norton's character problems were seen as a childhood toy, not enough funds to understand his / soul / blah problems and roots for or against. Is it a loose, a manipulator or just a knife? The reference to "taxi drivers" was ridiculous and unnecessary and certainly not in favor of this flick (or E.N for that matter). <br /> <br /> And IMHO, it is loose loop to the end. Cheap emotional tricks for teen lovers somewhere in South America. This guy should kill the kid, blaming the father, creating a big wrong. Or, the kid should have killed the dad at the end of etc., but no, we've gotten finished cheese where the kids miss the crop, the father is believing on his own life and relationship with them with the knife, of course, die. The dysfunctional family remains unharmed, safe and happily bored again so we could enjoy our corners, quiet. <br /> At this stage, where the loop comes into the movie, my God, I should think long and hard to find something stupider than that! You do not shoot like a scene with a hidden camera and hidden crew. The creator of that film probably thought it was a good idea but it was more annoying. Again, if you are a 16 year old girl somewhere in Kansas nowhere or whatever-and-dream about sex with a crazy man twice your age, OK, then you might enjoy this movie with its "message".
