This romantic adventure must have seemed shocking subversive in its day. A wealthy English upper-class English, cemetery and manipulating all around it for its own satisfaction. He uses his privileged position to engage in secretive secrets of an anti-social kind. There's a clever gender-role interval as its activity proves to be more daring and superbly than most of the male characters. But, of course, a stranger, black and beautiful holds the love interest, and this cruel lady is not backward to come forward when it meets the right man. <br /> <br /> The neglected and gullibility of every other character makes the plot compelling in the extreme, but those thirsty for Romance will neglect it.
