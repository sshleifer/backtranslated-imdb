Well I'll start with the good points. The film was only 86 minutes long, and some of it was so bad it was funny. Now, for the low points. The first warning sign came with a real "warning" on the movie. When it began these "warnings" appeared: "The movie you are about to see has graphic and disturbing images. Because controversy with popular belief that killed is not fun, beautiful or romantic." I should save myself 86 minutes and turn it around. The first movie was: "I'm in the glue factory." She had some talked about her phone, and she was referring to a home nursing home as a glue factory. I do not know why. So the base of the movie is some kid is obsessed with the zodiac killer and begins to imitate him. The budget for this movie was at least 50 bucks and had to use the cheapest cameras they could get. The act was worse than I read right out of a script. That's like they did. The script was awful, and the great "twist" was that this guy who wrote a biography about the zodiac assassin was actually the Zodiac killer. Of course they tried to show this subtle but did it totally evident in the first 10 minutes. Without any more painful details of the plot, here were some awesome online games in the movie. They try to make the Zodiac killer compare himself to a "army of one" because the soldiers are really just murderers. Then they tried to make an attempt at "Adoration Satan" by showing some guys in black hood at a meeting. The big "hacker computer" was able to find the kid's address when someone gave him the kid's name and phone number. For some reason it had hack in the FBI to get someone address. I do not know why he did not just watch it in phone book or use whitepages.com. There was also a random allusion of 9/11 for no reason. I also learned that no matter where you get shot, blood will come out of your mouth in seconds. So, if you like really bad acting, sub-par scripts, bad camera work and an obvious draw, you'll love zodiac killer!
