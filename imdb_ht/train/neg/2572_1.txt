this movie delivers. The best thing is when the young adult turns tired away from the babysitter and in the background seems to have never been anywhere near a bicycle in his life as he tried not to fall. Do not stop there, when less than 5 minutes later it delivers a scene of nothing, but an arm reaches a fence and in a cooler pull out a beer. <br /> <br /> Stereotype grilled patio, several plot lines that go nowhere, with an ancient seaQuest artist and a bluetooth cell phone all add up to make this perfect Saturday night at home.
