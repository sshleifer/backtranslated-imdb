UM .. I was quite surprised that someone actually gave this movie to high marks. <br /> <br /> Allow her face ... Tori Spelling is not a great actress .. and this movie just proves the limit of her "talent". The film scheme was weak ... I bet the dork that came up with this concept was some perverted peeping tom. If there is a good thing about this movie, I would say it to Tommy Chong's daughter, just for the fact that she's her daughter ... and then is that soap-Opera-Ish lead men The decent good looks a bit to make it attractive, but stops its dramatic ability. * Why IMDb requires at least 10 lines? How many more ways can you simply say "This movie absorbs"?
