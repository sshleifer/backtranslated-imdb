.... because if I was, I might have wanted it to have me been crucified on wooden cross! I'm still trying to determine the plot of this movie - and I was "generous" that there was even a draw to start with. As already mentioned, it's a misnomer on the cover of the DVD that Richard Dreyfuss is actually the star. He was barely in the movie. But if he was indeed "frustrated" as the back cover indicates he was, well, that's probably because he said yes to be in this disaster in a movie and could not come out of it! The movie really seemed to focus on Jared Martin, and what was his role in the movie assumed, other than the extreme close-ups, was not such a great a mystery as to what role Barry Gene has actually been - or not t '. And talking about "big" ... whatever had the bright idea to fit Gene Barry in the Dumpty Humpty attire, which featured his pants literally pulling up his chin, should be sentenced in hard times by watching this film stones serious. I was able to go over and over on how this movie has emerged from the dialogue by matching the actors' lips (Thinking Clutch), in the irregular jump from the stage scene (yet, they were generous even calling the frames of "scene" pictures), in the lack of a draw .... However, if you are in bad there are 70 thoroughly early and if you're in a cottage in Michigan and there is nothing but this movie and a box of kid & cat photos, I recommend having a good wine bottle before embarking on this weird ride in a movie because you'll be grateful that you may not remember it the next day!
