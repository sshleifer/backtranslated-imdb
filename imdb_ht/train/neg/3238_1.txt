Devil's Experiment: 1/10: Hardcore porn movie falls into two categories that have a semblance of plot (Gee who is one lucky pizza boy) and bloody people (Anal Amateurs 36). Devil's experience falls solidly in the latter. <br /> It is of course the horror version of hardcore porn. A nearly completely completely less 43-minute wait for the money shot. Video Injection In 1985 it consists of three relatively non-written Japanese boys tortured one fairly dangerous Japanese girl. The turtles range from the banal (slapping 50 times, kicking it one hundred), the comic (tie it in an office chair and spinning it around), the fear factor (a bath in maggots and small boweles sheep) and finally the money shot. (A well-executed pink earrings). <br /> <br /> That's it, there is no scheme, no motif, just Blair Witch tree shots and torture. The girl looks bored with the exception of screaming, "no one expects the Spanish Inquisition" during the office chair scene I was bored unusual. Staring dumbfounded in the screen, waiting for the money shot. Just like porn hardcore.
