I rent this movie because it falls under the styles of "romance" and "west" and some grand canyon scenery cast in. But if you expect a typical western romantic health, forget it. This movie is garbage pies! The novel is between a girl who does not even go through growth with a MAN-WHO! The child is also lusted after by other male leering. It's wrong. Peter Fonda is described as being virtuous by trying to resist his attraction to Brooke Shields, and his character is especially the one who pursues the relationship. She tries to discourage her at first, but eventually she gives in and leads to as a happy, loving couple. It's rebelling. <br /> I do not see how this movie could appeal to anyone except pedophile.
