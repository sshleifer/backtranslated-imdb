It's funny. I saw a bunch of Fassbinder films and I found some to be very creative and interesting, while others are repelling and self-indulgent disorder - like this movie. For me, it's huge chain crap - without much in the middle. I know he has a lot of fans among the "sophisticated" but I can not help but think that a lot of his calls are pure hype. From my point of view (and I know I'll get a lot of negative reviews for this), she has done too much film too quickly and she was too self-indulgent. Gay or sex-bending films (like this one) tend to be really bad - sloppily done, sometimes boring (like QUERELLE and TEKRETE TEARS at PETRA VON HOUSES) and sometimes just gross (like this movie). Could not his message about the acceptance of someone's gender-confusion be occupied better than the show to get slapped around or watch cows being gruesomely killed? Show some sensitivity to the subject and make your character more human and sympathetic - then perhaps I would take care of these films. I'm honest at the point after watching this film that I could not bother with any more Fassbinder movie - the bad looks out-to-go good.
