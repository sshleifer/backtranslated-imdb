Lethargic direction breaks another compelling story of Zhang Ziyi's beautiful story, in an excellent role as a woman who joins an extremist group in 1928 China, just before the Japanese invasion of Manchuria, and reunited with an ancient lover who is currently working for Japan. Every bit of drama and forward movement of the story is aspired to circle by director Somnambulist director Ye Lou directly. Character stands still staring at each other for long minutes, saying nothing, camera but kept forever on the face showing unambiguous reactions way longer than they needed, edits repeating the same reaction is triple redundancy. We know nothing about the characters as the story begins and provide little new information as the story progresses, only silence and static shots of non-speaking lovers, who interact in silence but share no apparent intimacy emotional. A very insensitive to films.
