You know how sometimes you can watch a movie scam with friends and laugh at all the shortcomings of the movie? Well that was beyond that. I bought the DVD from Tower Videos because it was like $ 3.00 and I would hear this was a movie you could laugh at. It is really nothing short of pathetic. About 30 minutes in the movie, my friends started asking me to turn it around. About 45 minutes were asked. After an hour, we compromised fast forward, so we could see how the conflict was resolved (and because we watched all the time for Matt Walsh). Seriously, do not watch this movie. It is beyond painful.
