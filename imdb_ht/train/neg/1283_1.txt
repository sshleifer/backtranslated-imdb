I told the first I watched this movie was about 6 years ago, and I actually enjoyed it then. I bought the DVD recently, and over a second look I wonder why I liked it. The act was awful, and as usual we have the stereo-style clansmen in their fake suits. The act was terrible at best. Tim Roth did a good job as Liam Neeson, but I have no idea what Jessica Lange thought. The plot line was good, but the execution was just the poor. I'm tired of seeing Scotland described as this in the movies. Braveheart was even worse if, this film is only saving favors. But seriously, people did not speak like that in those days, why do all the actors have to accent Glasweg? Just another film to try and make sense of stereotype already tired and annoying. I noticed the people only about here that says this movie is good to Americans, and to be honest I can see why they would like it, I know they have a male warning in Kilts. However, if you're thinking of buying the DVD, I'd say to spend your money on something else, like a better movie.
