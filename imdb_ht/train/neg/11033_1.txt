The latest rumor going around is that Vh1 starts calling to love New York 3 in the middle of 2008. So, what does Budah or Tailor mean to throw New York or does New York throw the winner? I know the liking of love is coming to it in the 3rd quarter, so now with a taste of love 3 and a love of New York 3 ..... there will ever be a true winner ??? I also heard a few rumors that luck will bring back to the 3rd quarter of I love New York !!!! I have also heard that rumors that New York will especially be on taste in love 3. <br /> <br /> We wish that this was not too much in a shingle to end in I love New York 2 .... 'I just stating the latest rumor.
