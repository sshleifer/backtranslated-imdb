This movie was very wrong written. The characters did not have any depth. They should never make a movie in this. My 11-year-old son could write a better scenario then Hyung-rae Shim. The only actor who did not suck was the zoo guard. It was only one funny and credible in the lot. <br /> I love cinema and try to give them the benefit of the doubt, but this one was up to the list of my lame language in number 2. Number 1 being Demonicus. For those of you who actually thought this was a good movie, you are in serious need of brain surgery. <br /> <br /> Most of the creatures in the film are not even dragons ... So, why are D-wars called?
