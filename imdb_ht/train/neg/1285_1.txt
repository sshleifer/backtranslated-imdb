Born, raised, and educated in Scotland, I was amazed at this disgusting painting of a man with no more nor less than an animal rustler. Worse yet, the thread of the movie all had sex in one form or another, not implicitly or verbally. To see it, one would think that Scotland's 18th century was populated by a bunch of sexually transmitted sexes. Long was a joke that acted as "young" at 49's age but Liam Neeson was even worse! Taking a "bath" in a Scottish lake is not as much as it describes it - but it has given them another opportunity to demonstrate how sexually driven we were. Save your money and watch Pinnochio.
