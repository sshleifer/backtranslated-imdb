A doctor who tries to fill the medical dream of transplanting is to experiment with cache from the hospital and varied success. Her best last chance comes when she likes to finish her girlfriend's head in her jacket as she delivers her out of a burning machine. <br /> <br /> I was looking for cheese and this quote I believe I get it. It has everything that bad movie hunters look for - chest and brain surgery and surgeons are left with primitive white screen, unique camera angles (I still like watching the rider wheels behind cars), cheesy clarinet music decor, and one of the longest death scenes in movie history. But unfortunately the bad-to-be-good-time moments can not overcome their too-bad-to-stink stretch. <br /> <br /> As in the Pan bothered me, and monolithic droning it into a reindeer whisper, somewhat less than hate laughs, and the fact he kept alive with some Columbian cafes home coffee and 2 DD batteries. <br /> I could not even entertain myself with Horrid Dr. Bill's overcoming and straightforward moral right. Usually like Ham does a cinema to be seen in my opinion, in this case I was bored with it. The best part of the film in my opinion was the 1960 version of "body shopping" and I myself found myself sewn on that. <br /> Do not spend money on this one - have the best movies out there to entertain your sickness sense of humor.
