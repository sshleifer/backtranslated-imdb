This was the worst movie I've ever seen in the theater. It was just a compilation of recycled materials. People getting hit in the head is not funny. Recipient people are not funny. After the third time a guy was kicked in the balls by even less audience members laughing again. It just was tired fast. <br /> I went with my younger sister. She actually laughs at the King of the Hill but this Cinemas chief bored it. I'm not surprised. The story is very lame. A midget thief robbed a big diamond at what was definitely the easiest heist of Hollywood history. Then she hid out with a family pretending to be a baby. I know it sounds interesting, but that's the whole story. Say these two lines over and about for 1.5 hours and you will find the picture There were predictable jokes. I really felt torn off after seeing that. I did not wait a lot and I was always disappointed. I wish Keenan would just hire some decent writers to write jokes and / or his next script. This was even worse than white whales if possible. I saw high school play that was the best, and cheaper. There was nothing positive about this movie. I do not like my entertainment to be dumbed down.
