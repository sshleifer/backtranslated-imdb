I would put this at the top of my list of films in the inert garbage category! There are bad movies, but the worst kind are the ones that are constrained, but you are supposed to love them because they are supposed to be good for you! Sexual sessions, so shocking in her days, could not even excite a rabbit. The so-called controversial policy is strictly high school sophomore nightlife entertainment march. The film is self-consciousness in the worst sense of the theme. The photography is in a purely black and white purple. Some scenes come from focusing or taking in the wrong angle. Even the sound is bad! And some people call this art? <br /> <br />
