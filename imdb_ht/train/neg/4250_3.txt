It's like what other Dracula movies do, the minions of Dracula still on Dracula's side, which is what shame me to the finish. Whatever the person wants to stay a vampire or not, I'd like to see something like the first movie that the minion fights against his master. It is very interesting (since you can almost predict how the story goes) than just the priest or D. winning the game (we need some surprising plots!).
