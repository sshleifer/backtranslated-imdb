Thunderbirds (2004) <br /> <br /> Director: Jonathan Frakes <br /> Start: Bill Paxton, Ben Kingsley, Brady Corbet <br /> <br /> 5 ?? 4 ?? 3? ? 2? 1! Thunderbirds are gone! <br /> <br /> So started Thunderbirds, a favorite kid. When I heard that they were going to be a Thunderbirds movie, I was ecstatic. I could not wait to see the Thunderbird 2 rumble in to save people, while Thunderbird 4 would plunge the valley? You get the idea. I just could not wait. Then came August 2004, when the movie was finally released. Critics have prevented it, but I've always wanted to go. After all, as long as the heart was at the same place, that was all that related to me. So, I sit in the theater, the only teenager in a crowd of 50 ?? All others were more than thirty and ten. Well probably the experience of the most awesome theater ever I've ever had ?? The film (intended for a prequel) focuses on Alan Tracy (Brady Corbet), the youngest of the Tracy family. She spends her day wishing that she might salvage people like the rest of her family, but she's too young. One day he finally gets his chance when the Hood (Ben Kingsley) traps the rest of his family up on Thunderbird 5 (the space station). This involves having Hood's outsmart henchmen and rescue his family in time before the Hood can steal all the money from the Bank of England. Trust me, the plot sounds like a regular episode of Thunderbirds when you read it on paper. Once it gets put on this movie a mess we have on our hands. The first, the movie was designed for kids, much like the original show. However, Gerry Anderson treated us as adults, and gave us the scheme that was fairly advanced for children's programming. That's the other hand, dumbs down the plot as she tries to make herself a Ripoff in the Kids Spy Franchise. The final product is a movie that tries to appeal to fans of the Thunderbirds series with kids, while missing both entirely. Blame blame, cartoonish sound, and stupid antiquity that no one really finds entertaining all over this film, and I'm sure Jonathan Frakes wants to have never directed that. <br /> <br /> Over all, everyone gave a solid performance, considering the script that they all gave. Ben Kingsley was outstanding as the hood, playing the party very well. My only complaint about the characters is about the hood henchmen, who are reduced to the rest of the food from old cartoons Looney tunes, bumbling over as, amazingly enough, the kids take on with ease. <br /> <br /> What's odd about this movie is that while I was watching the movie I had fun. But once the lights went up, I realized that the movie was fairly bad, I was $ 8 lighter, and two hours I was now gone. A guilty pleasure? Maybe. However, Thunderbirds are a forgettable mess. Instead of being a big "go," I'll have to recommend that you stay away from this movie. If the rest of such films were as the first ten minutes of it, it would be an incredible movie worthy of the Thunderbirds name. However, we find a movie that only dead-hard Thunderbirds fan (if you would like to look at your childhood torn in pieces) or the very bored should be bother with. My rating for Thunderbirds is 1 Â½ stars.
