This is exactly the reason why many people are homeless. . . because stupid producers pay their money to make such horrible films instead of giving if they can bother! <br /> This movie is even worse than white chic! Little Man has an apology for lame to present a character hatchet as a baby. History is terrible considering it was written by six people. The idea still should not be too bad though, if it was original and not a rip-off of a cartoon episode. It has funny moments but some of them are over-made ways and some are just stupid. The act was very, very bad. So the ledger. Anyone involved in this movie should be disappointed. It is racist and very offensive in the middle. I mean, instead of showing their sympathy, the movie makers make fun of them! It really degrades me how to do it. They see the middle being just like babies. And for a character that is a midget, pretend to be an abandoned baby just to get a diamond from a certain family. This is his disability to show something like that. It just was not worth it. Do not watch this movie. It's a great deal of time and money.
