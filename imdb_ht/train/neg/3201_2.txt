Joe Don Baker is a great good actor in the role of small here and there ... he was well at Goldeneye and made a great Bond Bond bonus at the Living Daylights and he appeared in various other movies. One thing he can not do is bring a film as the lead, which he is in this very bad revenge movie in Malta. Joe Don's partner is killed to kill the killer's brother and the assassin's assassin in Italy, but some guys cause the plane to land in Malta and the killer gets away. The rest of the movie will see Joe Don pursuing the assassin here and there, Joe Don is being taken to various times, Joe Don tortured a bartendar and they were cut and so on. The film is quite bad and you will not find yourself exactly pulling for Joe Don's character. You will be amazed at how often Joe Don the hero gets out of one punch and how incompetent it proves to be. Part of the crowning of the film comes when Joe Don chases the killer all over Malta with the killer in a priestly dress and then they get into ships and chases them all around Malta. This film also features one of the worst line closes at the end of a movie ever.
