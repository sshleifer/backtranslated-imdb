After seeing the poster in the movie Smother, I knew I was about to live one of these intolerable film experiences that made me want to take my eyes out. However, I felt a slight optimism because the film was There is a solid cast that I thought he was going to rescue the film. Unfortunately, it did not happen. For women is a horrible movie, but it is not exrable. That's the best I can tell about it. <br /> <br /> The scenario from Smother (written by the same guys from the Wed Wed, something that explains they are nothing but talent for writing movies) is all cheap and predictable humor. Seriously, i did not laugh even once watching this movie. Besides, the solid cast I already mentioned is absolutely wasted.After the large number of garbage it has involved (like sorry monsters and exuber Because I said so) some people which may think career from Diane Keaton is extinct. However, it is impossible to forget the excellent performance it brought in our previo decades, including films such as Annie Hall or Baby Boom. On Smother, it strives to better and performance he, but his character is so horribly writable he can not do anything with it.Dax Shepard has left on me a good impression and his solid performance on the baby mama films and idiocrity.However, he does what he can with his character .Mike White also made a good effort, but it did not happen too far.It is a very talented senarist (as it was shown on film like the good girl and the Rock School), so I'd like to see it was one of the screens out of this movie, instead of just acting on it. Tyler's tribute to the same situation throughout the actors mentioned : they were wasted. <br /> <br /> The worst bankruptcy of Smother is being absolutely boring and unfunny.Its scenario is nothing more than a forced scene collection and the situation we've seen on sit-coms.Stay far to the comedy.
