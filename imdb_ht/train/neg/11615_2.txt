Though not a fan of Sam Rockwell, I was surprised when I saw his name in the credits of the opening of 'Joshua. 'Heck, I did not even know he was in' Joshua 'until I started the movie. So it goes without saying, I watched the movie on the base of the movie, not driving them. A sort of Baby Rosemary, 'The Ommen' or any other diamond kid 's kidney' Joshua 'was billed to company. Unfortunately, it fell flat. Slow, incredibly slow, and flat. But I continue to see how this would all settle, hoping beyond belief, the final point would shed some light on the subject. Well, I admit, he did (a bit way), but what a close stale. And what a low-low budget film, or at least that's how it's done. Someone dropped ?? you do not see the drop, you see someone lying in the blood. Someone gets hit by a taxi ?? you do not see it, you see someone complaining, holding a bike. I'm not sure if this is called "style" or laziness or simply, lack of funds for special effects. We have a "rich" family with a crazy mother, a workaholic father trying to balance everything, a kid ?? Joshua, who can / can not be the Antichrist and a new baby girl born that wept. She weeps as much as we see how many days she lives ?? and what was on? Is there any rat above or is it Joshua? Is her mother black? Is Joshua crazy? Is it merely jealous for new people in the family? Will it grow to be Michael Myers? Or does he drive his family to the brink? I do not think so. They were black before, and no "so-called" act can make me believe otherwise. Unfortunately, barely any questions have been answered, barely any open doors closed. I'm sure that might have been the idea, but for the sake of the Pete, give me something. Anything. There are many better kid-go-movie movies to explore. Joshua is more like my mini-mine in the Antichrist.
