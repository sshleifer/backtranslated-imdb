Amen to Magsel. There was a lot of confusion going on. First, how do you know which movie you are buying? Henry Cele star in each one of them. I bought this movie to think it was the miniseries ... WHAT IS A FILE !! It would be a comedy but for the girl being raped. David Hasselhoff (spelling?) Is OK for popcorn TV but was not credible in this movie (where was English accent?) And what's the LOVE story ??? The film was supposed to increase a young man in military power - by the Captain Ship's Captain getting jigly and the English girl looking for his father ... <br /> If I was paying more than $ 7 for this movie , I should call the police - because that would be a crime!
