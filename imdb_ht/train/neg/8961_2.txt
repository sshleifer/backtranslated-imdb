This movie was yet another waste of time ... Why oh why I keep renting crap like this? ... someone please tell me ... * sigh * Oh well. Back in the movie: Cube Zero is probably worth it if you really enjoyed the first movie, (like I did), and just want to check out what's up to the last movie (hopefully) scratching together just holding some poor actors and screenwriters work, then of course this is the movie for you. But if you are looking for a good movie and good act with a fantastic scheme ... * grin evil * then this movie is definitely for you :-D .... OK i lie ... At best this movie sucks. OK, I must admit that certain elements of it were cool .. well .. coolish ... and I laughed quite a few times, prolly in the wrong thing, but somehow I was amused. :-) But all of the few things that barely make the "ok" category is not enough to make this movie worth it at all .. Unless you count "Manos - but in Duel" one of the top ten movies !
