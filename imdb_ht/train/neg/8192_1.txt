Well, I said, this movie was so bad that I would walk out if I had not reviewed it for work. And the worst part is, I wanted to see it so bad that I drove all over the city, paying $ 10 parking twice because the newspaper lists were wrong. Vince Vaughn plays the guy he always does - the only time I saw him play another person was in that movie with John Travolta. Anyways, the plot has potential - it sounds great in the glimpse, but it is full of totally ridiculous, predictable, weak point turning leaves. And I was hoping this would be a single Christmas movie where Christmas Did not have to be saved, and that Santa did not need a replacdmetn, but nope.The cool part was the sleigh rides, and the young The bladck goat was my best character if that movie would be great for toddlers, but for adults it is so lame that it's chore to sit down.
