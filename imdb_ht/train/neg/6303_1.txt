I had high hopes for this movie. I thought the site was interesting. I stuck in it, though I found the act, save Helena Bonham Carter, unremarkable. I was hoping to expect the time I spent going to pay, but in the end I let myself ask why they even bother to do this. Perhaps in George Orwell's version there is a message that is worth transmitting. If this movie accomplished anything, it inspired me Orwell's classic. I find it hard to believe her story might be as disappointing as this adaptation. If the movie maker's message is "the life of the living is worth living", well then they have succeeded. I would recommend this movie to no one; 101 minutes in my life wasted.
