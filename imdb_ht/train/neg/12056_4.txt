This movie is a good example of how to manipulate media you can sell a movie that is no more than a very unfunny TV sitcom. In Puerto Rico the daily newspaper with the broader traffic was continuously written about the gems of this movie, almost silencing all others. The journal's accent and second largest traffic are part of the same owners. The weekly CLARIDAD is the only newspaper on the island that has been analyzing the movie's films and content, and has shown all its flaws, clicks, and bad writings. Just because a movie makes a portion of the street laugh and joke easy and obvious, and because someone can recognize actors and scenery, do not make it an acceptable movie.
