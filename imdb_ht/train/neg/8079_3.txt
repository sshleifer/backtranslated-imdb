But another movie with an interesting site and some nice side effects fall right into the trash can. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />! <br /> It's amazing to look at Heston doing up to his usual parody, how really bad this film is. He even plays in a sub-draw that kept me interested just to see how he tied back to the main line of the movie. The way they finished settling was that they did not. It simply falls on the end. <br /> <br /> Really. Do not waste your time on this one.
