I can not say I liked this movie very much. It has some fun moments, but it does not seem unable to make up itself if it is a comedy or a drama.it does not really work as either.it is too light in the tones Be a drama, and the fun moments are some and away between.it also do not make much sense.things seem to happen for no reason.and it's also very convoluted.i feel like they just did things up as they was gone.If they just took a while to explain things, that would be a better movie.I would say the finish was anti-climatic, but that would mean the rest of the movie was actually built in a thing, which he didn't.it just kind of finishing, and that is.i did not find it boring, really, but as I said, there is just not any point. i will give winter a cursing and weak 3/10
