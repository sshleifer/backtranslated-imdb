One stinko in a movie featuring a shopworn plot and, to be kind, acts in less than Oscar gauge. But I am the worst fault is the total mispresentation of a jet plane, and especially a 747. Some of the major errors: <br /> <br /> 1. There is no Flight Engineer (or even a station engineer theft 2. Mis-identified the F-16 interceptors as the F-15 (no resemblance too.) 3. Charge passengers to a "gold aget" ring accessible superbly in the cabin - Though such a compartment Existing, putting lots of weight far off would make the plane unflyable ... 4. Hollow points point out that "will not hurt the aircraft." 5. The entire landing procedure was so bad I wanted to correct SR-71 (in all the aircraft) and a stamp seal seal 7. Open an outdoor cabin door - in the wind - in flight !! <br /> Ah black, it was just a really disgusting movie. The list is under 10 of the year.
