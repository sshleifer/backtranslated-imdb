Breakfast, clear, bad scenario, poor photography and direction ... all at all very obviously a sick-design first commercial effort to make films by the good people of TBN. <br /> TBN Photo has been very successful in the past to help bring "China Cry", the story of Nora Lam, to the big screen. But the "Omega Code" is an unfortunate unfortunate. As a Christian who supports TBN and a lot of his programmers and those who like "China Cry", I still find it impossible to recommend this movie to anyone. They do many good things with the ministries, but this is not an example of it. Do not waste your money ... go to rent "China Cry" instead.
