This movie shows Ruth as a grueling, drunk, gambling, jumping sports figure and a little bit thrown in. Babe Ruth's life was very interesting and this was for all intentions and goals being abandoned in this movie. Also, Lou Gehrig was barely covered and this was a well-known relationship, good or indifferent, it should have been covered better than it was. His life was more than all bad. It was an American hero, an icon that a lot of great baseballs modeled after life. I feel that I was just the memory of a big baseball player that this movie is completely ignored. Shame on the musicians of this movie to capitalize on his fault, not his greatness.
