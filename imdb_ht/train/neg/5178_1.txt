I feel it's my duty as a guy in the hot movie horror others about this horrible movie and very bad movie "movie". By wasting your time or money on this movie, the act is bad, the story is just one of the worst I've come across and the script was just awful. Nothing on it was good, you finished thinking about why I watched this crap. The plot had so many holes in it and never clarified to the end, it was just so bad, I do not know how a movie so horrible could do. As I said before I loved horror movies and I was so left down, it was a 18 but you saw little blood and no crises or jumping at all. Also what annoyed me was how stupid things happened in the movie that had no point in the plot all like the kiss and sister kiss, why? it's all I can say. Just do not bother, there are many bigger horror films out there, just do not waste your time life too short.
