During a night sleepless, I had to change the channels & found this troublesome in a movie. What they thought? If this is life after "Remote Control" for Kari (Wuhrer) Saline, do not be surprised to go nowhere. <br /> And why David Keith take this role? It's sad! <br /> Anyway, I turned on the movie near the end, so I did not get much of the plot. But this must have been the best part. This Nerdy college kid brings this domatrix-i girl home ... this scene is straight from the comic books - or movies to cheap pornography. She calls mother's mother mother and kisses the father "Oh, I did not expect language!" Great lines! <br /> And I've seen how it ended .. <br /> Well, of course, this bitch from hell has a helluva past, so the SWAT team is upstairs. And yes ... they surround it! And WI YES! The kid out his brain out !!!! AHAHHAHAHAHA !! <br /> This must-see television. <br /> <br />
