Never ever considered looking this excuse excuse for a movie. The way he shot, lit, act etc. just does not make sense. it's all wrong it's hard to look. loads of clips are repeated beyond boredom. There seems to be no 'normal' person in the entire movie and the existence of 'outside the world' is, well, it just does not exist. and why is this bald guy becoming irresistible all in a sudden? This movie is beyond sort. zero.
