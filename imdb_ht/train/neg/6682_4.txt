This comedy is really not funny. It 'a romance that plays a lot about stereotypes it does not make any impact. It's a movie that is so desirable - yes, even back then - it's no snap. <br /> <br /> The throw is adequate. More that it's hard to say. However, what is good is that players are accustomed to. In MGM, this would have starred Robert Montgomery. Woman in a businessman with no time for anything but work could be any number of actresses. <br /> <br /> We can be grateful that this small film is being peopled by today's gender sex makers. And their production value is not terrible. But it does not make any real impressions. <br /> It's a generic knockoff. And who wants this?
