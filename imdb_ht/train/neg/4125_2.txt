Ghost Crap! What a terrible, terrible horrific Spanish! I had it for about four years and finally started to read the other night. I watched an hour or so before he went to bed. I was very intrigued by the whole thing. I finished it last night and he could not believe where I stopped it overnight. Literally, I stopped reading the second before the movie went completely down. <br /> As I said, I was very intrigued and curious as to where this mystery went but stopped it right when Simon received the package of bar. I pick up when it opens the package to reveal a laser gun and then play a "menacing" game in laser tag. Whew! Then the big reveal is that the whole thing is a terrorist draw by playing role playing nerd. WHEW! You can say that the Spanish industry was definitely behind the director Mateo Gil (co-writer of the hit two of the first two hits). There is an excellent note with great photography. But this scenario reeks of silliness. How anyone sits in the last 40 minutes with a straight face is beyond me.
