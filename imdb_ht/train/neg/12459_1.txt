Considering how much money was budgeted for this movie, you would expect more of the story as a whole. This would probably be the most worthless movie I've ever watched. There was no real advance in anything. Character Development, Minimum. Advancement to draw, maybe. Enjoy, no. I'm not sure what points they were trying to do. If you want to see a movie where the terrorists are a good good guy, American CIA bombs everything that does not agree with our opinion, all the corrupt capitalists, and you like to see something similar to a storyboard advancement accompanied by a death, they are in. For those of you who realize that he does not kill a good guy makes a point, we'll stick to other movies. In summary, this was a scandalous attempt at a 'Ocean's 11' style-to-draw-so-human-gen-thought movie because not only do you know what happens, nobody made the movie did either. Home alone 3 was a better piece of cinema.
