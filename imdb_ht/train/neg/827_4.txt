Sudden sensations! It's a fight between two brothers (Dennis Quaid and Arliss Howard), both of whom can fire fire mentally; are squares of children's differences, and dippy love-interest Debra Winger keeps in the middle. Director of the Glenn Gordon Caron (television-kid's kidney rear "Moonlighting") smothers the dark-rousing comedy of Vince Gilligan's scenario with a slick presentation, the film resembles an entry from a film-to-a-student film enthusiasm about a fifteen million subsidies. It has the peak energy energy of a great commercial feature, but a stileless style that carries nothing out of the characters except the exotic kooky. These are not the same characters, they are functions to draw. The barely-released theater, the film is a disaster, although prohibited as an example of style on its substance look good. Less is just stand-out of a seemingly puzzling throw. * 1/2 from ****
