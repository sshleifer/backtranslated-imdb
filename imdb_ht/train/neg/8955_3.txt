As far as the film goes, it's a science fiction science film. It has a lot of cool stuff in it, with some quality scenes. That said, is not that good, and some of the things are very far away ... <br /> <br /> As for calling this another cube-movie is to utter and fill bullsh! T. This is the very definition of treating a great movie or inventing original films ... the whole feeling in it may be a bit translated into the core of the first, but the introduction of people / androids as part of " The team "behind the cube itself is a bit of a stretch ... <br /> I gave this a 3 *** because of the original backstabbing. This should have been sterile in many parts of the movie that has no place or time to mention all ... <br /> <br /> Watchable for those who have not seen Cube & Hypercube, but not advisable fans of the series ...
