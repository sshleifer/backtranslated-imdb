This movie looked promising but it was actually pretty bad. The first was O.K, but the plot itself was awful. The actors tried their best and limited material, but they could not lift up the spirit of the filthy films of this fake college movie. Jason Schwartzman was once again very disappointing - even more so than in Rushmore, the rest of the cast was well-meaning. Scenes that should have been fun turned out to be off-set & incredibly juvenile. Trying to have a Road Trip / American Trip, but failing delicacy on every level. A total waste of all time.
