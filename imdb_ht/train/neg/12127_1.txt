Forget Fulci fans, but I could not get into this one. The soundtrack was about as annoying as it came, the current was unturned, the story was made and done, and the non-existent direction. <br /> <br /> Masak honestly looks like a children's movie project. But I've seen some of these, and they actually look better than this was done! It seems they were so underfunded they could not afford ... ANYTHING! Not a DoP, not a director, no one even remotely had a sign of acting. It was a very poor cinematic experience; one of my worst. <br /> This was the worst sucking-fest I've seen, next to Toon Terror which is second only to killer clowns from outer space. I have nothing else about it. <br /> It rates a 0.1 / 10 from ... <br /> <br /> The Fiend:.
