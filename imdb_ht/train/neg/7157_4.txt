1st Look 5/26/2002 - 4 out of 10 (Dir-Michael Almereyda): Strange stories about a witch druid that tries to take eternity by inheriting his grandson's body. At least I think it was the relationship. A kind of unusual quality occurred throughout this movie by unlike Stephen King in the shining. The difference is that Nicholson's campiness was not at all in this movie. This is all taken very seriously until close to the end when some litter-lined material and attempts to fight up the mood do not work at all. Performances are not the problem here, but the story is. Everything does not seem to come together very smoothly and the viewer leaves with a lot of pieces of information and has no real understanding of what happened in the movie. There is a very small performance that is not little by Christopher Walken as the uncle of the daughter who, of course, gives him self-bills in an attempt to sell the movie. Do not buy in this gadget and avoid this movie. <br /> <br />
