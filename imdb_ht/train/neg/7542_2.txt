This film is supposed to be a mysterious, seriously serious about a man looking for a missing girl. However, 30 minutes in the movie, he gets into a funny, unrealistic story with annoying characters and random scenes. I can not imagine anyone who does not laugh when Cage randomly karaots kicks off that blond girl or when he "brings" punches to old ladies. The lines, characters, and acts are all wrong done from the get-go. I still loved Nicolas Cage as an actor, but he did some terrible movies this year; this being far one of the worst (again ...). <br /> I would not recommend this movie to anyone who wants to watch a story-catching thriller. If you really want to enjoy this story, go to the original lease. However, if you intend to look at it, ready to laugh at some of the lines and end scenes rather than taking them seriously; This is the only way you enjoy this movie.
