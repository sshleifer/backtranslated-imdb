This film is so bad, it made me want to vomit. Poor product, a free street area free of charge. Why on God's name would you parody a movie that is in a degree a parody (with one humorous humor) as it means? Together they are ridiculous, the effects are so bad that they are not even mockable, and acting farcical. It's a complete mystery why you would even consider watching this leak in waste. National Lampoon once made Animal House, who always considered to be completely and completely hilarious. Now they have relocated to making TV movies like this one lump of ****. Your explanation, and it might be used accurately to describe this movie.
