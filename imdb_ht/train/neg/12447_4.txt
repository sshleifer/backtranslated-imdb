Sondra Locke feels in this movie, but then it was a terrible 'actress' anyway. Unfortunately, he dragged everyone else (including then = real life companion Clint Eastwood down the drain with him .. But what was Clint Eastwood thinking when he agreed with the star of this one? One of his in the script would have to tell him that this one was going to be a real sniper. It is an exceptionally weak story, basically no history or plot of all.Add to bored, poor act, even in the Eastwood virtually good.There are absolutely no action except a couple arguments and as far as I was concerned, this movie fixed up to the top of the pile of Wow Natural Waxing Enhancement! Could any BE be any more boring? I think it watching dry paint or growing grass can be more fun. A real stinker. Do not bother with this one.
