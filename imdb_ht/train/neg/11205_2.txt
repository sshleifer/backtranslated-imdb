Yeah, well, I'm definitely sorry about giving up my Saturday night watching this weird little, yet very long, movie. Apparently there was neither the main character for stealing two hours in my life. Here's the episodes of the antihero in 'No regret.' We have this jerk, so messed up, so wandering, so selfish, vigilant and incomprehensible that it was very difficult to get past the attraction of a raised-and-coming-son son, Jaemin, unless he was just that: physical attraction. She claims otherwise, that she likes. But after watching this, it's like Charles Manson's love because you dug the beard. (Well, it is not that bad, but still there is no real feature to deliver.) I can never get past the reason Jaemin endless footage of Sumin. It has never been shown, just said, that Jaemin loves Sumin. Perhaps it's something culture that flew to myself: crazy / follow = crazy likes about in Seoul. It has been, because a little over half the movie is one followed by the other and the last part is walking behind them and from the point I thought this was turning into a vicious comedy. I was waiting for a tiger named "baby" to make an appearance. Well, so Sumin works two hours while going to school, so far so good about someone trying best. But after his first taste of attracting his stalker, he gave up his work day for some types of prostitution rings. What? OK, well, as previously mentioned, the obsession does not stop due to changes in work / career and if you throw into a bunch of other angry characters you get one messed up movie where incredible incident just seems to happen without rally. Basic movie, not 100% awful, but you can do better with gay-themed foreign cinema.
