Cliff Robertson as a complaining husband marries a wealthy wife delivers a razzie-worthy performance here if ever been one; it's as if director Michael Anderson has kept screaming "calling him down; thinking zombies, only less alive" in his bull as he garnered Robertson's efforts. The rest cast barely better; Jennifer Agutter of LOGAN'S RUN fame is hardly seen in what should have been fleshed out as an essential role. If the quality of the act was three times better; if some of the more drawn pits are filled; and if they were joining to give a shot of adrenaline, then this yawner would be able to carry up to an acceptable standard in the TV channel forever TV channel. As is, its rating, so inexplicable high one can not help thinking chronic ensomniacs using freelancers to catch a little snoozing time. Perhaps televised late-night TVs lack a great opportunity not to shield it as such.
