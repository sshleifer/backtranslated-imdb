** Spoilers win ** <br /> <br /> I would hear from various sources that this movie was controversial and the ending in particular was terrible. What I did not expect was the complete change of sneaking and about twenty minutes away. What started as a typical cowboy / Indian western suddenly descended into a sweetly sweet 'comedy' romance on Honus (Blue Soldier in the title played by Peter Strauss) and Cresta (Candice Bergen) who escaped an offensive to the rider by the Cheyenne. The majority of the film then focuses on those two movements hence that bit of romantic comedy. Donald Pleasance then turned up and kidnapped them both for no real reason apparently. They then escaped with both turns (separately) at the rider base on the eve of an attack on the Cheyenne base. As Cresta uses to marry one of Cheyenne's chefs she rescues the rider base and joins them. So far so ordinary. Then comes the finish. After enduring well over an hour of poor acting involving a shrimp will be / are not found simultaneously, the film then transformed into the top exploitation that involves among other things a decapitation with a child being shot at back at the top. Similarities can be drawn to the wild bunch at this point in the movie but the wild bunch has kept the same tone at all and did not resort to extreme free violence. In some ways, Blue Soldiers remind me of Frank Perry's last season that has also completely changed for a traumatic end. I did not hate Blue soldiers nor find the end to particularly disturbing but just found it to be very dull and a violent ending. If you want to see a film and a really disturbing film of innocence, I would recommend Elem Klimov to come and see.
