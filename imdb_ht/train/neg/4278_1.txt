Just pick up this movie for a Buck at the National Liquidators Wholesale, and after watching it, I feel like I've worn-off. <br /> I do not know that I've seen a movie worse than this. Honestly. And I would never write a negative review of a movie I did not like enormous respect for the subject, that is, Stephen Foster and his music. <br /> <br /> First, what is it? Is it a music biography? Yeah, many of Melody's by Foster then interspersed here and there are those pseudo-Broadway-Jerome Kern-type numbers that smack over the Mississippi delta. I mean, someone received the written record of this drivel? Secondly, the REAL story of Foster is a fascinating one. Why not even come close to it? Third, what did they have on Ray Middleton's great makeover to make this movie? Picture of him with little boy ?? With communism? What a waste of a great talent. <br /> So friends in Foster, with the truth, and good entertainment, fear ... very, very, scary.
