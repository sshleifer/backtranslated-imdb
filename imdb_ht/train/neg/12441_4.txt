There are some things that need to be clarified. The picture of Mark Ferris is by Mark Ferris who starred in this film. I know that because he was my father. Please remove this picture. Also, Mark Ferris was the writer, at least one of them. I tried to find a copy or one way to view this movie again. It has years and if someone can show me in the direction of finding a copy, that would be great. The film was not all wrong, and tried to compare it to today's world of Star Wars and other high-tech science sciences. If you look it, just enjoy it for the erection and humor it owns. Blooming up on being smobs movie and enjoying some less creative and innovative films.
