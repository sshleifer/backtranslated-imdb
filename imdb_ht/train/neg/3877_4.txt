I just looked at the Incredible Man Fusion for the second time, and it was even more boring than when I first looked at her. I do not understand why it became like a 'classic cult' when it is so tediously dull. The opening scene looks promising, when the nurse fat drops the couch in blood and runs for his beloved life. And all that really happens is the melting around some woods and houses, also having ref√®back in his life as an astronaut. The makeup is quite good, and her fusion gooey figures seem fairly realistic. There is a cool scene where he launches a monster head in a river, and it floats until it reaches a waterfall where it falls on rock and bursts open. There is not much to wet yourself on, though, most scenes are shot in darkness and you can not really see what's going on. There are many gore, at least in the Vipco DVD I watch. <br /> No, the Incredible Man Fusion is not that great at all. I'll give it a brand for its cheese factor, but that's about it. If you want a VERY sci-fi / classic helmet classic, watch the deadly spawn instead!
