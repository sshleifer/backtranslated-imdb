This is the first of these "8 Films To Die" collection that I've seen and it certainly does not make me want to see any of the rest ... although I've heard at least a couple of them are decent. I do not know, this was not terrible, but it did not really do much for me. Your cannibal family home is in the suburbia type of stuff, mother & dad dies, the family sells the garden & moves to San Francisco (?) Where they continue to bring home food supplies whenever possible. The best part of this was the Got Creepy sister, who of course invited a friend on to school that never left. Anyway, of course we have a stuffy store in the basement and so on and so on. This family is sort of like the white-pen version of the Sawyer Clan, they are embarrassing & doing bad things but they do not go away with any soul. I see a lot of reviews from people who love this, and I guess I do not know what I missed, but I found it to be very mediocre & I would not recommend it to anyone, really. 4 out of 10.
