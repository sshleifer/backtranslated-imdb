I'm part of a fan of Miyazaki work. I say "partly" because most of its films fall into two categories: glossy, and boring. Unfortunately this movie falls into the category later. This film suffers from the same fundamental issues as Miyazaki's latest film "Moving Castle". An intriguing site is set up, but then immediately reduced to a little more than a set of some unfathomable events that only serve to confuse the scheme rather than explaining it. <br /> <br /> The first third of the film reveals the post-world politics is the story set in, and actually looks like a very interesting story is about to unfold. From then on, these things went down the hill. Part of the film is mainly made up of ecologically-clear eco-propaganda, and is the heavier marble finish by the reliance on impenetrable type spirals that breaks a large number of Japanese animated films. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />. What left is something that is visually stunning (although the darkest version I've seen was a NTH-generation copy, and poor color - that gives rise to the common myth that Nausicaa shows under doing it when flying) but making little sense and finally leaving me confused.
