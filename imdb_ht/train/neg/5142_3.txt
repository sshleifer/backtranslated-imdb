After Chaplin has made one of his best films: Pat & Dynamite, he has done one of his worst: The nervous gentleman. During this first year of film, Chaplin made about a third of his films. Many of them were experimental in terms of ad-libbing, editing, gags, shooting places, etc. This one takes place in a castle where Chaplin and his friends attempt to get in without paying. Mabel Normand is there with his friends too, and Chaplin manages to rid himself of both his friends and the Mabel. He then mocks Woos in the grandstand with no apparent impact from his behavior. Many slapstick in here, but there are many other things to recommend to this movie for others then watching Chaplin develop. The print I've seen has greatly deteriorated, which could affect its fun. Charley Chase can glimpsed. * at 4 stars.
