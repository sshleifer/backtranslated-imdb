I bought Bloodsuckers on ebay a while ago. I watched party and judged it just too mute to review again. The amount of excess water at the beginning is just plain obsolete - not to mention the sound of "whip-around" wind. My friends and I made a super low budget film, and the effects always exceeded this challenge. <br /> <br /> As for the number of errors in this movie, there are too many ways to count. I knew one of the actors - believe it or not, it was my theater teacher. HA! <br /> <br /> Final verdict: Do not bother with this "horror" flick. <br /> 3 Stars (from a possible 73)
