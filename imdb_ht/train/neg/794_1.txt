Unless you are already familiar with the pop stars stars in this movie, save yourself the time and stop reading the review after you reach the end of the next sentence. <br /> <br /> Why You Ever FILM AND GO WATCH SOMETHING ELSE. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />! until you're ready to call. <br /> Nothing in this movie makes sense. It is an endless series of people who express various emotions, out of anger, out of happiness in tragedy, for no good reason. We can obviously see something incredibly "dramatic" happening, but we just do not give a CURRENT for 'cause no backstory. Since then this movie is over, you will be sick and tired of these stupid, lanky, girly stars' faces. You will be rebelling in it has passed all the time watching them smile, sneer, cry, look mysterious, be "serious," and any other expressions they slap on the faces. <br /> <br /> That some morons would ever go so far as refers to this piece of unsophisticated trash as the "soul" of any of its "actors" was to prove to you beyond The shadow of a doubt that the trailer and many adoring comments on this site will not tell you: <br /> Only the "convert," mindless minions will be like this movie, the majority of girls and a pathological worship for nothing androgynous. Freud would have a garden day. Unless you are one of these mindless "fans", stay away from this abomination hell.
