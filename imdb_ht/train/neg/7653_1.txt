The first I would like to say that if I was honestly skipping this movie from a 1 to a 10, then I would give it a -4. It's not that I'm a tough criticism, it's just that this movie is wrong. Everything from the story, in the direction of the correction is terrible. The story is not even half decent to begin with (you can not expect much since it is based on a video game, something I was not aware of going to the movie) but the directing and editing made it even worse. The movie cut to left point and go to stage that fully relates to the previous ones; Some, like a quick sex scene in the middle, do not even make sense to put in the story to see how the characters do not show any feelings toward each other. You could go to this movie waiting to see a pile of crap on the screen for an hour and a half and you would still be disappointed. Honestly, if you pay them to watch this movie then you're wasting your money, and if you do not pay anything then you still waste an hour and a half in your life. So make yourself a favor and do not look at it.
