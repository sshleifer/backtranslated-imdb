This movie is one of the most awful things I have ever seen. Not only is the dialogue terrible, it never ends. You will think it ends, but it's not. How long is it, 140, 160 minutes? I do not even know. I know I'll never look again. It's like having taken a romantic comedy, taking the comedy, then deciding the romance, leaving us with the pile of crap who managed to make his way to the screen. But do not take my word for it, find out for yourself how awful this film is.
