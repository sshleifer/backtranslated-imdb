Please stop Ben Stiller from acting in any movie. Record your studio, hell, write your local congress. I've gotten more laugh to going to a funeral then I'll watch any flicker stiller. Jack Black tries to do something about a comedy about disappearing dog dogs, with Christopher Walken, perhaps over of the greatest actors of his generation, simply seems to embarrass him to be there. Stiller is his own unfunny, but now even with someone bail him out, proving he's way overrated as a comic. He does not ask why this film was titled seriously, and was available in the movie movie theaters after only a handful of weeks. I warn you, and you must warn your friends, do not watch this flick, it's just awful, worst then Gothika (personally, I would never think I would say), Worst Plan 9, Worst worst, the worst then Golden Child. Please Hollywood, leaving Ben Stiller allowed in your movies, it's not funny, he's a terrible god actor, and he brings others down with him. This movie has been ranked 1 because no negative note is allowed, so while the board says one, I'll give it a zero.
