The first, the lead, Brad Dourif is a KOOK. If you are trying to take this movie seriously, then I guarantee it will break it for you. If you do not take it too seriously, then it's actually kind of fun to look. Like another review, I liked the scene where Lisa (Cynthia Bain) and Dourif declare their love for each other - in between dodging the planes of flames shooting out of his arms in the car. Another great campy scene was watching John Landis as a snotty radio show producer getting grilled and flailing in the room. In fact, I found the last 15 minutes of the film to be a non-stop laugh-riot - I'm just not sure if Tobe Hooper meant it to be that way.
