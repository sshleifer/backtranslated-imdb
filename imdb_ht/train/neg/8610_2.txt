As much as I love Rodney Dangerfield, this was a terrible movie. The plot was kind of a holistic holistic cut into various movies, but unfortunately they forgot the rip of any good jokes. In addition it was annoying and boring and being kind. If you are looking for a good laugh, rent a copy of the private party.
