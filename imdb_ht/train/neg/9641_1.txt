If you're watching this movie, you're a Fred Olen Ray fan, you've got it on the $ 4.99 shelf at Suncoast and she thought "what am I to lose?" Or you've turned around the video store with eyes Do you close and rent the movie first finger you touch. <br /> <br /> This movie is hysterical bad. It has everything a horrible film needs: a scenario featuring jaw-dropping dialogue and discouraging dyspleness of the scheme, wacky science involving psychics and other dimensions, continuity that seems to travel through wormholes in time and space, actors who not only Wood, but looks like borders on ridiculous nudity, gratuitous (not all of it is what you necessarily would require), and of course, a 5 'monster played by what I suppose is the Fred Olen Ray. It all, however, has something resembling heart - as if Mickey & Judy decided to get together all the kids in the neighborhood and make a monster movie (hey! my dad can direct it! yes! we can use the red paint but my dad's dad, and I know this old man who can act in it!). <br /> <br /> Look for the blooper coil on the credits - you get to find out why the final cut of the movie was so bad. <br /> <br /> Incidentally, Biohazard II ... The alien force is also worth a look, but there is not the same fun manicure this one to do.
