I absolutely hate it when a movie completely falls apart near the end, after you've already invested an hour into it. and that's what happened with this movie. I was intrigued by his actors and the fact that Malamud wrote his source story. I did not read this story but I can not imagine that it ended like this movie ends. Fortunately I did not pay good money to see or rent it because my library was read. ohhhh like a garbage of excellent acting (the particular woman was so perfect) .But milo o'shea as a Jew? !!!! now that was funny. I did not do research in doing it, but he played as the director loses his march or he died 3/4 in the way of the movie. Before that point, a story and character developed, there was a number of points drawn and did not waste too much time. but ooh that last 1/2 hour - if that was not screwiest, the most worthless sleep I've ever witnessed, I do not know what. I just hate her when one's faith is so destroyed like that; It feels like an act of violence.
