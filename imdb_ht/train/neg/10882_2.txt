This movie is one of the worst horrors movies I've ever seen. From the very first scene, I knew it would be a crash crash. It starts with a seemingly bad girl's bug on a mission. As it turns out, the people of it were owned by some random zombies. Well, some years later, some college kids pulled some commitments. Terrible acted out of commitment to the top jock. Things like the jock shouting in doing things in a way that is not shocked, and commitment to reacting and over-doing the whole "eager to be popular role" What really takes the cake and This one is the final battle. Absolutely horrific special effects and weapons. For example, guns make a noise that has no flash tile, and vice-versa. This is accompanied by zombie-suspended animation (why they move in suspended motion is a mystery), cheesy music, and about 40 weapons from nowhere. <br /> <br /> Overall, this movie is crap. Just like many others you can rent for 50 cents in the place where your movie movie is lower.
