Finally too funny and pointless. Yes, there is the Metaphorical Cage Door but probably most kids would miss that. Forget. Immediately. <br /> <br /> Animation is, as we have come to hope, super-real. The plot-line can best be described as thin but tough. Although the finish seemed to me arbitrary. <br /> <br /> The sewage environment is a disgusting hangover reflection in the world above, and, somehow, wealth and money seem to count for a lot as well. Oh yeah, and have a romantic interest with the girl being smarter, more savvy and go-to-get in the fear - this in itself is rapidly becoming a fatigue (anti) stereotype. Probably your kids will love it though.
