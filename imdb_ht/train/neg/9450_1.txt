Spend your time any other way, even at home is better than this movie. Jokes are not funny, fun rhymes are Dr. Seus are not there. A very disgusting way to wasting an evening. My kids 4-16 laughed a little at the beginning lesser were bored with it and left to play Barbies and that older left to play ps2 and surf the net. My wife left and did dishes. So I finished her alone. It was the worst "kids" movie I saw. If you want to watch a fun movie look like Shrek 2, that movie is fun for kids and their parents. This PHOTO AVOID. It's not funny, it's not nice, the makeup chat is about the only good thing in it and you can see that on the disc label.
