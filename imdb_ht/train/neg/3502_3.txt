Sarah Silverman is really "funny in the month" now. Is it really worth the whole hype? Yes and no. It is funny at times, sometimes hilariously so (its standing routine is actually very interesting, but not always funny). Other times, you're feeling cheated by the media for too much another scene. It is one of the truly beautiful comics that people especially flock, saying that they searched their intelligence and understanding. But if you are the corners, most people will admit that they just want to sleep with him, and that's why they look at him. She reminded me why many Wrap Margaret Cho and Janeane Garofalo, though neither of them are really "hot" now in terms of popularity. Sarah does not drink or smoke (at least cigs), so she should be warm when she's 60, so her fans (mostly men) can be happy. <br /> As for this show, it's so much like her comedy. When it works, it's hilarious. When it does not, it has full bladder bladder and very boring. The AIDS episode here is one of the best. It's still funny, and it has some pretty good satires in it. Brian Poeshn's character has an unhealthy mania and Tab in one episode, and it's hilarious to see her in a T-shirt Tab. But they never really go anywhere with it, and it eventually wears out its welcome. Sarah's character in the series is rather annoying, the gay couple (Brian Poeshn and some other guys) looks sneaking on and never really do anything for the show as a whole, and players support (including Sarah's real life sister , Laura, who does not look something like it) are OK. When the joke hits them, they're brilliant. When they do not, they're awful, and I mean really horrible. There is also an obsession with coprophilia here (aka joke poop), which seems to have replaced actual real and intelligence in today's comedies. So, should you watch this show? If you have a break over Sara, go for it. You can gaze at it and pretend it to you. As for her show, it's the absolute zero chain.
