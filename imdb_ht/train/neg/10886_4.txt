I just looked at the Convent for a second time. I liked it already and figured it would make for a good movie on Friday night movie, some gore, some style, bit of humor and like. I was sad to find that I can not really appreciate it. It seemed like someone had put out to review spice cheeseball as night of the demons for a modern audience but lost things that made the original refreshing. For the record I'm not even a big fan of the night of the demons, but there were some things I really searched on. The convent does the cheese but it's not so much good. Apart from the main girl (tellable performance from Joanna Canton), the goth girl and a sweet camaraderie from Adrienne Barbeau are very beautiful all of the characters were excruciatingly unlike, spanking at the absolute lowest levels of moronic, offensive jockhood. The film is then gravely hampered by the complete lack of gratuitous meaning that, given the terrible dialogue, it's hard to watch the characters and harder to appreciate the good points in the movie. The wrong nuns are original in design and get lots of good scenes, but not scary certainly the kind of cool, and the movie also field a fair amount of clean gore. Towards the end, when Adrienne Barbeau is on stage in the movie becomes quite fun to cause all the clumsy to die with her a malicious madness bashing madness. The directional styling also occasionally produces good results, although sometimes the camera just moves too fast. All in all, this was a movie where I shone the dots just can not make up for the things I hated. Those more fond of this kind of movie can well enjoy it a lot more, but for me it was not a good time.
