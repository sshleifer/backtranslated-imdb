Well, I just ordered that pay-per-view at home because I was bored and needed a laugh. I must admit I was chuckle a few times, but I do not even remember which parties were in. I do not understand why this movie was done. She claims to be a comedy but seriously, I do not get a penis song, or a nude 70 year old very funny woman. This film was trying to fit herself into the 'gross-out' comedies in recent years as American Pie and Road Trip, but she just failed miserably. It was way much gross-out then it was comedy. Also, why did the world make Cameron Diaz her name in this movie?!?! The only thing I liked about this movie was when Dave and Angela were in the pool. I thought it was sexy and enjoyable and well done. In addition, avoid this movie. 3/10
