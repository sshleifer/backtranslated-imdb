Please help the economy - spend your money elsewhere! The film's summary is: The First Lady has her husband killed because she was cheating about her. That's it. Those who do not detect, except Cuba and Angie, draw and apply a vast assassination plot that no one knows about ... and gets away completely free. Some specific points are mostly hilarious: While standing in front of the president, Cuba has flown the killer bullet ... which then goes into the back of the president's head. <br /> <br /> Cuba and Angie watch the movie in a news camera, and see ... a sign. They go in great length to protect the film, believing that they are the only people with a very public copy of this movie. Cuba talks to a presidential staff member. The PSM comments that there was no scheme. Cuba claims there were more than one involved. The PSM then joins the scheme including the FBI, the CIA, and the NSA. Gosh, I ask the PSM is involved. <br /> <br /> Ms Archer, Lady First, is a craptacular artist. Cuba can not make a painting, and says, "You're too close ... stand behind ... look at a different perspective, look at my perspective." Is anyone missing this sign?
