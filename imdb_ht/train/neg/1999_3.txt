At the end of this episode Holmes asked Watson not to file the case for posterity.For a good reason! The super sleuth left her little gray grill (sorry Agatha) in the house for this story. No deductive reasoning, there is no acute analysis of signs of crime scene. Holmes bumbles along fifty yards behind the plot. The CAM dastardly finally faced a vulnerable old-fashioned way in which Charles Bronson's heart could swell with pride-six bullets in the breadbasket. In a chase broke a pursuit to catch one of Watson's shoes .Mercifully the didn writer did not decide to read about the story of Cinderella stretched out the film. The Holmes and Watson, escaped free scots. Oh well, it's a bit of a change in the late Victorian end of London. A bit of sisgun law :-)
