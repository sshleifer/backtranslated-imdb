A bit of a disappointing movie, I would say, have acted to aim, somehow. In many cases, I just could not feel that the facial expressions matched the spoken words or the intent of the scene. An angry (or sad, cheerful, frustrated) character should make the viewer believe he is angry (or sad, happy, frustrated). This does not happen here. <br /> <br /> The commentary on the writers accepts you already know the characters were just. They do things and say things from nowhere: the character Andrew accuses his parents of sending signals to each other at dinner; Then he blows and storms out, says his father "Do not touch me, or f ***!". Perhaps, if we see the prequel, we would understand where everything comes from, but there is no prequel, so we're a bit off the sea as the reason! <br /> <br /> One odd, original thing that Andrew does is to go to an old stone quarry, sitting on the corner overlooking the "still water" below; Then he came to his jeans and extracts a pack of cigarettes with one light. He did the same thing for three times during the movie; I guess we should see this as some tortured action being alone and upset? Perhaps once, but three times? It might even have been four times, I lost count. <br /> <br /> To be honest, there is the fact that he has recently found that he has adopted; This occurs very early in the movie so there is in essence of any dramatic change it might undergo because of this discovery. It's not really clear if that's why it's so bitter or it's about something else. <br /> I think there's a sort of Lynchian feel of the movie, but would be a first-time director really trying to scale such a hill so early in his career?
