Too bad, I really love Kristen Cloke and Gary Busey. But the director failed to put this together. There are a lot of actions, a lot of promises, but it all comes hokey. The director did not do his job. Promoting action comes at lame. So, looks very compelling in a desperate attempt to save the movie. This version of the "rage" (DirecTV credit as 1996) is simply not worth the time to look at it. Another director would do a better job.
