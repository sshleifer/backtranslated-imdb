I started watching this movie with high expectations. However, after one hour I gave up on this movie as it only instilled many questions unanswered about me. This has already begun in the opening sequence and only got worse. Why would Hollander be buried under a statue? Why have a comedy Italian gift? Why farmers' wife saved the Hollander? Why was he, when saved, not running for his life instead of starting to make love for the farmers' wives? Why farmers' wives do not save the Hollander at a time when the farmer should not be around? Why did farmers know that they were illiterate to Italian? Why was the Italian comedy known about the Hollanders gold? Why did he hide it in the cesspool in the middle of the farm's poor property? These and many other questions have popped up, and none of them seemed to find answers in an acceptable way. So I guess I totally missed the point in this movie, and I'm not connected to the story in any way.
