... that is not exactly a ringing endorsement. In general, "DinoCroc" was a better movie. Sure, in that movie, Matt Borlenghi played a complete wuss-bag that had filmed the movie all over his little brother to eat by the DinoCroc. But the special effects of "DinoCroc" were better, the graphics lines were best, and the act was much better. Here are the issues and "Blood Surf" - 1) The killer crocodile looks like a kid model with a retractable heels. 2) The plot is ridiculous. Matt Borlenghi & Co. found ships on a desert island, in which they encounter a rabid group of authentic Ugly Filipino who try to force themselves on the women in the group. That was a complete waste of 15 minutes of film. And 3) have enough time to bend. There are a couple of types redeemind to "without sailing" - the pretty actresses and Matt Borlenghi come to feed in the hook towards the end of the movie. But if you are on your deathbed and only have enough time to watch one movie Matt Borlenghi / Crusader killer, skip this one and fire up "DinoCroc" instead.
