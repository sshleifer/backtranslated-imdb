This movie is terrible. Give me the dentist at any time! Can you believe that one of the main television stations here in Arabia was this as their Christmas movie! I can only assume they expect to entertain the crowds with Dudley Moore rather than this. The last time I watched my hot water bottle, she had more acted, better trace, more drama and a lot more interest than this waste of seluloid. Do not even watch it if you drink it!
