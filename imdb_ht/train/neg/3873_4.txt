Alicia Silverstone (pre-"Clueless") plays a modern-day crime-obsessed teenager trying to solve the brutal murder of a local girl. Pat Verducci has written and directed this B-flick, which is not specifically designed but is, however, surprisingly serious-minded by considering its leading character. Silverstone is appealing to the success of clicking out an interesting young woman here, despite the kitschy photo animal. Throwing in support (including Kevin Dillon and Michael Bowen) is not bad, though the violence of the act goes further. It's not a can-do cheese, but nothing is exceptionally memorable either. * 1/2 from ****
