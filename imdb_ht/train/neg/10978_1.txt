Usually when a movie receives a vote of one it is because someone simply dislikes it and is annoyed it does not have a lower rating, and so decides to drag it down as much as they can instead just give it a rating. low. This is not the case here. Bonesetter is a perfect example of a movie of 10/10. She does nothing right and she does not have the chance because she does not really try to do anything. There are strings of a bad D & D style novel plot that does not hold along with a complete lack of any kind of act at all. It is clear that nobody involved in this project has given it any kind of serious effort, because even a fully patented untalented job would hardly amount to. A really horrible movie.
