This movie kind has become old hat by now, have not it? The whole thing is the syrup nostalgia back in on itself in some kind of feedback loop. He sure sounds like a good idea: a great cast, some good gag, and some drama people that could / could. Unfortunately, no central events are bound to them altogether, as there was in the "Big Chill", one of those seminal movies that spawned copied films like this one. You end up wanting to see more of one or more of the people instead of coming out on everyone. This superficiality creates not only annoying, it's crazy. The below average script does not help.
