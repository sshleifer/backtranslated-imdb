please save your money and go see something else. This film was like piece of crap. I did not want to go, but I had to think I would laugh at least once, NOPE. Not a single laugh, it was that terrible! Chris Cattan will never find a good comedy role after this and "One Night at the Roxbury." This movie is completely evident, there is no smart humor at all, and just repeats itself over and over again. listen to me, and lose away from this movie as you possibly can!
