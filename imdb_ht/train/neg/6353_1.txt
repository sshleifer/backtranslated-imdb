For a comedy writer, Woody Allen really allows the viewer to pay down with this lean attempt of character development. There are some fun moments, but no more than one would listen to the tumbling tennis circle history. <br /> <br /> Does Ferrell waste his time in this movie that failed to show his normally unusual delivery. Amanda Peet did well, but again, did not have the room to move in this otherwise corpse like films. The movie is so heavy and dull that it can not bring, but if it's brought, Radha Mitchell has done it. <br /> If you enjoy movies that go on and off in one scene and do not really accomplish anything but show that the writers can write a few lines of snappy dialogue on occasion, then you'll love this movie.
