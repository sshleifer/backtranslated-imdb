This movie sounds like it might be fun and interesting from its description. But I did it a bit of a down. Very slow and difficult to follow and see what happened. It was as if the cinema took individual pieces of film and threw them into the air and made them spliced ​​along whatever way they landed (definitely not in order sequence). Also, nothing of any consequences has been filmed. I've seen quite a few different Korean films and have noticed that a good portion of them is good and requires some thoughts on the part of the viewer, which is different from the typical Hollywood movie. But this one befuddled me at no end. I saw the film a second and third time and still did not do anything for me. I still do not really understand what the movie was trying to convey. If he just showed a normal part of a person's life, I guess he succeeded. But I was looking for more. Needless to say, I can not recommend this movie to anyone.
