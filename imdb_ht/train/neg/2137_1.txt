Even the first minutes of this film were awful. It is hard to believe that anyone by John Cusack would put money into that. With an anti-military string / anti-war movie cinema that is already destroyed in the box office, it is almost unbelievable that a studio of any kind would want itself associated with this script. <br /> At first, it may have seemed like some kind of politically motivated derivative of Grosse Point Blank and Akroyd and Cusack (they) all over again. But only about 90 seconds in the movie, it becomes evident that this is a talentless attempt at DR STRANGELOVE. <br /> I loved Cusacks movies that I thought I would risk seeing the DVD in this one. I was told that I do not know if Cusack is lukewarm for me to look at another feature of it again unless someone else can pay for it. Cusack looks so irreparably damaged by hating him for George Bush and Iraq's war that he is willing to commit suicide career. Tom Cruise had never been close to being this far away. Do not even close.
