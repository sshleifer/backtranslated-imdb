The only reason the "Norliss Band" deserves any star is the presence of Angie Dickinson in the cast. Other than finding Angie Baby in a pre-"Police Woman" performance, nothing else is worth seeing here. <br /> <br /> SYNOPSIS: <br /> <br /> *** MINOR SPOILERS ** * David Norliss is tapped to write a book about the supernatural. One day, she tries to disappear after calling her publishers and suggests that she stumbled through something that put her in mortal danger. The entire series for which this misleading pilot was apparently intended to be a series of flashbacks across the "Norliss Cassettes" - a series of audio tapes recorded while investigating cases in the supernatural. In the pilot episode, a rich sculptor died - but not before buying an ancient Egyptian scarab ring from a local occultist who assured him the bauble will give him immortality after death. We soon discover the ring itself by granting immortality. Instead, he only reanimated the sculptor's headband, allowing him to save his crypt so he can run around town to drain beautiful girls in their blood. <br /> <br /> Blue-faced, yellow-eyed and grin from ARRRGHHHHHHs or Haven has not heard since you last viewed "Scooby Doo" cartoons, the sculptor attacked his wife (Dickinson) one dark night. She survived and, through a mutual friend, Norliss contact reached her assistance in solving the mystery behind her husband's late husbands of her assets. <br /> So, is this guy a vampire? No. There is no vampire in this story despite what you could read or hear. The sculptor does not drink his bloody victim - he collects it. How? Do not know. We only see him attack, never collect. Why? To accomplish the second part of his offer for immortality. It turns out the resuscitation sculptor will only be able to live forever if it builds a life-size statue of a demon called Sargoth from a mixture of clay and blood. Once completed, Sargoth plans to live the status, using it as his gateway to our world. <br /> <br /> The final analysis: <br /> "Norliss typing" was not collected as a set for a very good reason ... it was trash. As you can see in my Summary, the story is a pity, ill-conceived disorder. The act and dialogue offer no better. This is not even a contender for a "so good it's good" Award. Sometimes bad is just bad. After years of hearing underground rumblings on the great merits of the "Norliss Band," I was very excited to find it on the Fox Film Channel on 10/15/03. I wish I did not set myself up for the fall. <br /> Do you have this screening strike for the first time two days ago, I can only assume any applause you've heard so far from other IMDB reviews is coming from people who review the show based on memories tithing and the nostalgia of youth. Or maybe they are simply loyal fans of Dan Curtis. Either way, they have offered you misleading review of the "Norliss Broadband." Pauly Orchid - October 17, 2003
