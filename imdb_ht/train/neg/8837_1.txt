This movie is terrible. I was really looking forward to it, as I thought "Lantana" was great. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This review may include * prevents * <br /> <br /> ***** <br /> <br /> First, good things: it looks great, some The performance is OK. The bad things are all about it. <br /> The story, as you possibly know, is about some blocks that go fishing and discovering a body, with the twist that they find it on Friday but continue fishing and finally report it on Sunday when they get back in row mobile (cell phone). However the movie takes its time (boy and takes its time) getting in this central event. <br /> <br /> In the ensemble of character (about a dozen), not one seems like another one (that is, I suppose, consistent, because they are all unjust). I was very frustrated by the failure to properly explain how the characters are related, and it was not until near the end of the movie that I could vaguely construct the family tree. <br /> It's hard to think of a movie we're unrelentingly lousy, which is a failure in the structure of the story, as life's character looks just as bad before the fishing journey as after. Once you have set the bar so high, it's difficult to upset it all to commit suicide. <br /> There are amazing scores of logic. The assassin dumps the body of the lake, and then it somehow drifts miles high into the mountains. Fishermen walk out Sunday morning, but for some reason Byrne gets home late at night after his wife goes to bed. Then the first thing in the morning cops bang over the door to get him down to the station. They have not heard of the phone? Down to the station, the media know the whole story, less than 24 hours after reporting the body? <br /> <br /> Totally lacking in the story is the block block debugging had to get the body. This is a mystery - everyone asks them "how could you do that?" and the audience will ask the same question. (The debate about what to do with the body is the key scene of "salvation"). I know exactly what I would do in their situation. Someone needs to walk out of the car, drive through mobile rows, call the cops, wait, and guide them back to the place. If others are waiting in camps and fish, who cares? <br /> A lot of all this looks like fake. The only thing that was true was that, as the girl was black, local aboriginals were amazed at the seller's actions as racists - "would not do it if it was a white girl." While there is a curious indifference that could have killed the girl (I think the subject is mentioned once), and no mystery, as the audience sees the killer in the scene opening. /> <br /> So I sit there at the same time bored and confused, when there is a twist - not in the draw, but the theme. Suddenly it gets on the quiet dignity of the lost aborigines that leads to a funny finish and some incoherent things about black-white reconciliation. Huh? <br /> This is Australian movie "of its finest, according to the Age.
