Doc Savage: The Bronze Man is a horrible movie. Worry scripted, over-acting, and just plain unusual. What they said ... it is actually an enjoyable movie on some levels. This movie means to look at a group with a sufficient supply of cheap beer. It's one of those cinemas like "Santa Claus Conquest Martyrs" or "Yor, the Hunter from the Future" ... so bad it is almost good. If you have the right group of people this movie is a blast to watch. It's in camp. It's fun. It has a theme by Sousa. If you are looking for a good movie though, look elsewhere. 3/10. <br /> BTW, I've heard some studio rumors exploring the possibility of a remake ...
