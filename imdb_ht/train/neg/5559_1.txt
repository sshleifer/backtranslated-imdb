This is the worst movie I've ever seen. The Avengers held this dancer honored ?? but not yet. Acting in the "Jill Ripper" is terrible and it was only eclipse by the plot. This film is as intellectually interesting as Telletubbes. He does not know if he wants a S & M sounding movie or a really bad comedy. Just look at extreme brains or if you're chewing bed and need a leather cover distraction. This script should be reworked in a porn, it would not take much effort and would have a shelf life again. A pornography, even a bad porn, would not hurt Dolf Lundgren's career in the way that this movie has.
