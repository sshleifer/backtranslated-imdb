Yeah I saw the rough cuts. The sex scenes scene. The scene cut off. Almost on a par with the movie 'Need' for terrible acting. This movie is bad as bad movie gets.the bad bad, bad acting, bad effects, bad locations, bad waterfalls everything. The best 'actors' of the movie were the peaceful dancers hired for the vampire extras! Sean Harry, 'the foppish actor' as someone else puts it, makes a matchstick look talent here. Its amazing ability to seriously drive a car, when it is obviously being shaken by people on the helmet (check out the reflection of the window), its inability to turn left, which is the class. Oh and do not forget the sex scene. more use its use in a toy gun that the props guys could not even bother to disguise as a real weapon. Other actors on screen could barely deliver their lines. It was as if half the time they were waiting for a line that was not there! <br /> <br /> 'Special effects' were soooo good at the point that the guys made it real names in their credit! <br /> If you want a laugh at a party then rent this movie ... then again there are many good comedies that are just as funny and do not give money to those who do not deserve it.
