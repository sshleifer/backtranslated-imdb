DEAD HUSBANDS is a comedy that is a bit comical about a wide-ranging woman who conspired to hit all the husbands of others. It does not mean embarrassingly bad as some comedies I could mention but never fufils its potential. Imagine how good this could be if we had Brother Farrelly who led Ben Stiller into the role of Carter Elson. <br /> Oh is Carter-based Jerry Springer? Just curious because the phrase to catch on Dr. Elson's show is "look after each other and keep talking"
