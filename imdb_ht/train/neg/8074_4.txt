Like a relative who gives you a bad gift, Soul survivor has its heart in the right place, but walks up with a bad execution. Stephen Carpenter writes / directed efforts to free borrowers from other, best films, such as the guy Jacob and Abre Los Ojos (Open Your Eyes). For those who do not see one of these films, I will not give in to the home; Suffice to say it's not as pretty busy here than in those two superior films. <br /> <br /> Melissa Sagemiller stars as Cassie, on going to college. His current companion Sean (Ben Affleck) and former Matt Bentley companion, both friends, and Annabel (Acerbic Eliza Dushku) are in a car crash after being chased by two assassins (?) In transparent masks . She survived the wreckage, but while going to college has vision of the hospital's provocation and the dead appear and disappear, leaving it in a state of confusion total: who died? Who is alive? What's Real? <br /> <br /> Survivor soul has the look of a bad te-gen, doing-this, gore-filled, blood-splattered, body-stacked youth blast cops. True, he has part of the killers-killer scenes (abundant, repetitive, and mind-numbing), but at least it tries to build suspension of ideas rather than clicks, unfortunately instead unsuccessful. It elevates confusion more often than joints, as the story gets jumbled, dirty and incoherent near the key point in the mystery (predictable as it is). <br /> <br /> horror fans who pick up a copy will have no idea they are in for a movie that is more concerned with building a comfortable facade in reality than delivering a body count. Credit goes to the carpenter to try to create something beyond a movie movie teen derivative; Too bad he created a dramatic derivative. Sagemiller also deserves kudos to show the strength of the central performance, actually develops his character and suggests some sense of emotion as Cassie's unraveling. It's great filmmakers try something different, but the movie ends up a mixed bag and failed experience. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10
