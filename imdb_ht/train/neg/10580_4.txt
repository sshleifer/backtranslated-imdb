I saw this last week after riding the cheap DVD. I wanted to see it for ages, finding the plot very intriguing plot. So my disappointment was great, they say the least. I thought the lead actor was very flat. This kind of party requires a performance like Johny Depp in the ninth gate (in this is almost a complete rip-off), but I guess TV budget does not always stretch this kind of ability to act. /> I also thought the direction was confused with dull, serving only to remind me that cafe had not made a decent movie since the mouth of madness. As for the story - well, I was ashamed to have as well! There was no way she was able to meet my expectations, but I thought the policy and explanation were poor, and the way it finally got the anti-climate film to say the least. <br /> One of the main contributors to AICN, and you can say he likes his movies, but I would like a better result from such a good first initial. <br /> I took the DVD back to the store the same day!
