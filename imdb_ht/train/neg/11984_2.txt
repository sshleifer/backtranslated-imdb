Ugh! Another of these is "fooled by the cover" DVD. I hope some kind of action at least with bears, cats, and those on the cover. I got nothing! Bad movie! .. I force myself to look this all the way into thinking that somehow Something would happen ... there is no luck. <br /> Now, the reason I gave this a 2 is because of the landscape; otherwise it sucks. <br /> <br /> The child was horrible, talking to himself (although I suppose they could not just run a movie with dumb music and no dialogue at all), hating his karate hacking in a tree stump tree, threatening a raccoon, munching on glass, and (what a dumbass) kicks off a pickup. And he should not pull these compressions that are easy either ... they stick like fishhooks. At least he fought the bear (weak) a couple of times. <br /> What was up with the flashback stuff? He made a bad movie even worse. I wanted to see a movie survived, by some dramatic bits about a divorce kid. <br /> <br /> What else can I say? Well, maybe they should have had the bear feeding the kid or something. At least that would be more interesting. <br /> <br /> People, do not waste your time on this one.
