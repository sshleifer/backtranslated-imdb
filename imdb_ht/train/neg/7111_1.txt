- A newlywed couple moved to the home of the husband's ex-wife wife. It's not long before the new wife begins to have the feeling that someone does not want him at home. He sees all around the house. But when the husband investigates, he can not find anything. Is someone trying to drive him back to the asylum that he recently discharged? Or, is the ghost of the deceased wife trying to find the new wife out of his house? <br /> - This is the first time I watch Skulling Skull without the help of the MST3K crew. And, it's going to be the last chance I watched it in this way. Can you say dull? I do not speak ordinary dull - I'm talking to watching grass grow dull. There is great stretch of film in which nothing happens. The screen has gone blank and I would have gotten a lot of entertainment out of it. The bee characters on and over and the most monotonous imaginative conversations. The screaming skull can probably be marketed as a sleep assistant. <br /> <br /> - The actors do not help much. Most of the lines and condemnations are usually reserved for a classroom play. I did not watch it, but I would be shocked to find that anyone associated with this movie ever appeared at anything in cinematic value. I will not even go to the script the actors give them work with them. Let's just say that the characters are given some of the most idiotic lines ever to say about film. <br /> <br /> - You've been warned! Either avoid this at all costs or, at least, seek the version of MST3K.
