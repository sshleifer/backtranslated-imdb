The filthy team did not have good access to the occupied territories, so the Israeli side was dominated by the Israeli side. I was struck by the almost completely opposing points of their mothers. Israeli mother loses a child who has the potential of a life in the early days. Palestinian mother lost a child who was only the possibility of a life of privacy and despair. With these views completely different, any meeting had no real chance at any meeting in their minds. The word "peace" did not have the same meaning for each of them. Palestine peace was free. Israeli peace was security. And as a deep, is this sort of movie really worth much? I ended up with the feeling that I was looking at useless propaganda - both sides were convincing.
