It's not really about gym; Swap out the occasional training sequences and it could just be as easy for on archery, or microbiology, or a booger-flicking tournament. Instead, like every other Rocky / Flashdance derivatives that flooded the 80s market, it's about victory adversity and stick-to-it-invenir, rendering all social / personal irrelevances from your lonesome - with love interest in the neck. Ronald Reagan's head down, in short; So, as a piece of movies it's down to the details. Some of the actors are original enough living things - especially the love interest, brought to by any other than Mr. Keanu Reeves, warmed up for Ted; The heroine of Olivia D'Abo's alcoholic lovers and big-hair stepisters are more interesting than the sick or fully inactive bitch-nemeses / teammates, one of whom seems to be made of porcelain. My instincts are to be surprised by the comic-relief of black guy, but on the other hand at least they're in the movie. But D'Abo is not quite convinced of his left-girl shtick, and in the absence of any other concentrated narrative lack of interest in the gym themselves really matter; It's all just hurtling around, and not only is the result of the great tournament a foregone conclusion, it's all made by a double obvious.
