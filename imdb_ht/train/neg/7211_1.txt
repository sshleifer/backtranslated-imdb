I grew up watching gadget inspectors. It was, and still, is one of my favorite designs, if not my absolute favorite. I've learned a lot of geography and stories from Field Field's exit to the turn-off inspector. I wanted to slip over a banana peal and become the greatest detective ever. <br /> But the movie has ruined the reputation of the wonderful cartoon. <br /> <br /> Matthew Broderick, an actor and potential, was definitely NOT the role of Gadget Inspector. The first thing- in the movie, Gadgets Inspector is smart. Not so in the design. In the movie, gadgets solve the mystery mostly by itself. In the drawing, it was almost always penny, brain, and the awesome book (I always want to book it!). If gadget resolves the mystery, it was not crashing. Gadgets in the movie seem to be a competent detective, but in the cartoon was dumb beautiful, where the humor was from. Another thing is that it's too much "Good Guy Vicious Guy" in the movie. It's not just meant to be a comic Saturday morning cartoon. Also, gadgets should never have a love story, but Disney Corporation is full of idiots. <br /> Also, I miss the true gadgets that gadget was, and especially the gadget machine. In the movie it was a chic convertible. In the cartoon he was a sedan police car and can turn into a van. He also barely had any gadgets and was mostly there to get him out of place in place. <br /> But if anything, the one thing that was terrible on the movie was that it was a feature film. Gadget Inspector was a comic Saturday morning cartoon. The movie was too serious, too much, too much of a plot and it was not even remotely as funny. <br /> <br /> Tip for people who do not see it: NEVER see it. EVER. See the cartoon, it's a true classic.
