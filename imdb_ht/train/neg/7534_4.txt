A mummy tells vignettes about men, women, and gender between them. Huh? In the beginning, the mummy randomly asks the viewer, "Imagine having sex with this girl. Imagine having sex with this boy" about 37 times, while flashing half of the young fashion mod mods. And said mods boy pelt fashion girl and ... vegetable? If you ignore (or fast forward) in the mummy rambling, the shorts are not bad at their own right. I found a few of them rather funny. My favorite one is the one sexually-confused man trying to persuade a girl to have sex with her while her lizard sits on the bed. This is one, well, scarce film.
