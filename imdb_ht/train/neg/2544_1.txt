Gung Ho was a good idea, however it is very much demanding American viewers to understand the dynamics of American jobs and foreign competition. In this movie the main character Hunt Stevenson (Michael Keaton) goes to Japan and convinced a Japanese auto company to come in America and help him die in Pennslyvania. Two things come to you. First why would a Japanese company come to America to make their car when they do, and well in that? Secondly, can anyone understand that American companies in all kinds of third-country nations have products that have made them save American labor costs? He cited the movie then that the Number One maker of cars in the world would go to one of its top competitors (aside from Germany), and put a plant there as unrealistic. Keaton was still in her comedy fashion by this time. But he gave a credible performance all the same that he could prove he could go from comedy drama to a matter of seconds and still does not embarrass himself but Director Ron Howard can not keep this from becoming A television movie that it ends up was anyway because it gave the story an easy ending to ending politics and problems in Japanese and American relations did not resist. Gung Ho has a Happy Day with Laverne and Shirley feels like the producers of both TV shows have made the movie and then made the TV version of this film as well as giving the film it 'light feeling. The Japanese manager gets to love his American worker and feels it with other Japanese people to learn Americans.If No.2 Saito man supposedly does not like Americans all that many do not think so.I prefer all the Japanese characters like Saito passed the soft goofball the characters made the Japanese out to be.It would have made the movie more interesting.
