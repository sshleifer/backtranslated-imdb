This "film" is a travesti. No, wait - an abomination. NO, WAIT - this is without a doubt the absolute worst movie ever made to introduce beautiful characters created and established by other actors. <br /> I think "Cluster Inspector" and Alan Arkin (!) Instead of Peter Sellers were funny and sacrilegious, but even daring to "Renewal" Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy are assinins and grubbing money. Laurel and Mr. Hardy have died, respectively, since 1957 and 1965. Why anyone would even begin to imagine that the latest approval for L & H would be in the character of Bronson Pinchot and Gailard Sartain is beyond me. I tuned to completely wait to be frightened and embarrassed and I certainly did not disappoint. Everyone involved in this domestic, mental, shame should be blackballed out of anything and everything associated with Hollywood and film-making. THIS PHOTO AVOID IN ALL COSTS - YOU WOULD MUST WARNED.
