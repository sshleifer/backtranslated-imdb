So it starts with a beautiful old house in the country. You have a group of people who are required to come to this house and (not surprisingly) riders still shut the gates at night for no apparent reason. Anywhoo, people are laughing, jokes etc. This doctor tells them a spooky story of this woman and some kids. They find fear, they start to feel things. Oh no, a girl sees in ghosts. Some more talk then this great ghost comes with etc. etc. This girl finds that this ghost has been killing small children and that he must free the soul, yeah yeah, blah blah. He hands, oh no, he died as he does. And go to heaven while this evil ghost goes to hell. Two people survive and escape the house. The script is awful because a guy gets himself off cutting and Elanor (one of the dead children's children) says "oh no". The act is wooden, the effects are crap and the series is a couple of rooms used over and over again. Basically if you like laughing in films seriously making her look, but if you are looking for a scary then definitely give this movie a Miss. I was very disappointed when I watched this. A great deal goes down. My sister (who became sacred very easily) was bored in this film she is appalling.
