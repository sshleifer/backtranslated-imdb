The only reason I was looking at was because I found it in my local library (and they would be berate to be sorry to have wasted public money on it), and despite many of tits and ass, it was not take time to realize that fast-paced buttons were my friends. Terrible direction, work pedestrian camera, the bad effect on the market, chinty effect, and one of the worst grime I had the scorn of seeing brought to life (as it was, typically crippled and hacked) in a long, long time . Best laughs actually come from "doing ..." featurette, in which the poor SAP involved in this HDV attempt justifies the efforts of mankind as if they were working on something special, instead of something that will not be completely forget next week. Tann! Except for the fact that somehow someone has attracted the Tippi "birds" Hedren, in all, to do a bit of party, along with the Kane "Friday 13th" Hodder! How that happened, I will never know, and to be honest, I'm not really carefree. Look at your own risk, and you do not say you have not been warned. This movie is made of firefighters, worst. It only gets a 2 in my hand to have some good-looking women naked, and even then, just barely.
