I was very impressed with Cinderella 2 and Jungle Book 2, but this is perhaps worse than both titles. First of all, I did not like the animation, very Saturday-morning-cartoon, only worse in some scenes. I love some of the characters, namely Thunderbolt and Patch, but the other characters, like Cruella being mediocre. Cruella was really angry at the original, but she lost her quality to the end. What he said was not anything at all to write home and animation he was kind of ugly. Also his companion Lars Lars was a joke to be honest with you, and Roger seemed to quit overnight. The voice talents were very good if especially Barry Bostwick as Thunderbolt, with the exception of Jodi Benson, the accent was losing it for me. There were some good times, but the whole plot seemed uprooted for me, and very suggestive of an extended TV episode. All in all, a hugely disappointing end to the most memorable of Disney's 60s movies and Jungle books. Sorry, I can only give this a 3/10, it just was not my cup was. Bethany Cox
