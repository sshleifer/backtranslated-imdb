Not suitable. Rating PG that gets this movie is yet another great misstep by the MPAA. Whale Rider gets a PG-13 but this movie gets a PG? Please. Parents are not deceived, taking a primary school child for this movie is a big mistake. There were many times I found myself being uncomfortable not only because the humor was appropriate for children, but also because it was totally out of the blue and unnecessary. <br /> But all that aside, the cat in the hat is still a terrible movie. The casting and overall look of the movie are only saved in favor. Kelly Preston is beautiful and always readable (or hatred in this case) Alec Baldwin are both good at their role even though Preston is almost too nice for a role like this. Children are conditioned and show actors, especially with Dakota Fanning. Fanning is just the human aspect of the movie that has kept me looking and not throwing things into the screen. <br /> <br /> Did I mention there was an oversized chat in this movie? Mike Myers is absolutely deplorable. I did not like him like Shrek's voice, and I'm really convinced now that Myers should not be allowed next to the movies of the kids again. Painting it in the cat is a slightly tiny version of Fatard Fat and Austin Power. <br /> <br /> In the end, the cat should not come, it should have been far away, but it has come, though just for a day, it broke 82 minutes into my life 82 minutes in personal anger and content. <br /> <br /> The Cat in the Hat can be the youngest child's movie ever.
