* Spoiler Warning * <br /> First of all I rated this movie 2 from 10. <br /> <br /> The idea is good, but there are too many stupid mistakes in the movie, failing to do it The psyching drama that he might have been. First of all, he never fights alone. After a first unusual question from her mother (which is not credible when Mom proves to be so much support and love later in the movie) victim of rape is not alone. <br /> It is also unbelievable naive always falling into the strange crew's traps. My friends are incredible nasty. The most incredible thing is that Ethan failed to control the crew by changing his views. While many leaders of the crew (hey, they say so) and people seem to think the other guy is a jerk, but when Ethan changes his opinion he just does not manage to convince even one person of the crew that he's right that his ex-friends are wrong. Everyone just simply hated it ... why? The film does not provide any explanation. How has he ever become the leader? <br /> A funny note is that my girlfriend thought I was watching Beverly Hills when she came in. Two actors from the same successful TV series .... A cheap way to get viewers?
