I had a hungry visitor until I personally spent time helping to build a White House home, only to be sick to see the house a year later. All the beautiful stone gardens were removed, the gorgeous stone gorgeous and front fountain was removed, all the pine trees and pecan trees in the front were cut off, sprinkler systems were torn out. It now looks like a disaster area. They do not even live there more ... they live "in town" and out only for the weekend. It's ill I think throughout the hours that the great people in Oklahoma give these people and see the result. The story that we all saw on television was not completely the truth ... Do not believe everything you see and hear.
