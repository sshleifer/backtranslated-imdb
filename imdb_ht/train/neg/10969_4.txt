Maybe I'm out of date or just do not know what Electra is like in current publications ... But the Electra that I was far more manipulative and always seems to have a plan. It usually uses other people to perform their dirty work and more often than not some sort of double cross was involved. Just when you think you have it all figured he pulls the wool on your eyes and gets his way. <br /> <br /> This movie was fairly weak on the dialogue, the act was not particularly compelling, and the action was too high. I was really looking for something more on the lines of Frank Miller's book "Electra Killer." Which is darker than anything in this movie. <br /> <br /> Special effects where cool, action was interesting at times, but more often than not the story and scheme was slow or logical. Tha but was not menacing enough, and Electra was not ..... bitchy enough. It is the girl you love to hate ... but in this story, I just did not care either way.
