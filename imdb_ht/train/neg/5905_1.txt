do not see that. This was one of the dumbest movies I've ever seen. Its hard to be Mormon sometimes when there are movies like this out there. what a sad way in the lives of Mormon. I can tell you if you saw this movie that it is not all like this at all in a single ward. if it was I do not think I would have made it to it. It's too bad that most Mormon movies are made by a group of geeks who have nothing better to do. The act was so bad that my wife and I barely made it through. I guess you could say that he had all the signs in a movie B. or did he have C movies? Anyway ... I just thought this movie was sucked and it was full of cheese. I hope some Mormons would begin to make some quality movies.
