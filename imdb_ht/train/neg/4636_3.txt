The "Confidential" party has meant that piggy-back on the popular call of the lurid magazine of the same name, while the term Blackberry works tied in with investigation Congress of the day. However, despite the B-movie A-class and some good script ideas, the movie slips together for some 73 minutes. It's a cheap production-Jack all the way. What's needed to cut-set the poor production values ​​are some imagination, especially in uninspired director Sidney Salkow. Some vaccine where there are few days, for example, would help relieve the succession of sleeping studio sets. A stylish elongation like Anthony Mann can do something with the thick-ear material, but Salkow treated it just like another make-day exercise. Too high-typical Brian Keith style does not work here, coming across as merely wooden and lethargy, at the same time Elisha Cook Jr. go to the top as a wild-eyed drink. Clearly, Salkow is not acting director. But you've got to hand it to Sauu Little Beverly Garland number that treats her role and verve features and dedication. Too bad, it was not in charge. My advice - to skip it, unless you are in ridiculous bar-girl who does nothing else but hit back whiskeys in the typical 50-jacketed fashion.
