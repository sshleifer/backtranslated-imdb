Marilyn Miller made only three films before his untimely death - the wonderful SALLY (1929), his comedy MAJESTY LOVE (1931) and this trifle - SUNNY (1930). It is quite poor both as an early talkie and as an attempt at a music - although it has four dancing numbers, it only sings songs (WHO? And one person aliens). The rest of the note including the Spitely Titles titled melody, although we can hear the letter in the scoring background. Miller seems overweight and amateur here - no quality star at all. Even his dance is cloutish. The film is very seriously written, full stock of jokes and unfunny jokes and stupid situations. If you are interested in Miller as a scene, by all means, check it out, but for general entertainment, stay away.
