Honestly, I can not bother to spend time writing about this stage of cinema incompetence - life is simply too short. What I will say is that, alone in the black succeeds in only three things: 1. It will make you laugh, but for all the wrong reasons. 2. It manages to throw several useless plots into the air but dispose of them all. <br /> <br /> and <br /> <br /> 3. It's utterly shame the classic PC game on which it is supposedly based not being a complete failure in all aspects of making films. <br /> <br /> Doctor Bol, if it's true that you are (I think proctology here), what about your Earth doing in a director's chair?
