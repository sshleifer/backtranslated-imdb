I'm not sure what other HK movies have been watching, but the Eagles' Place is nowhere near the top of the pile of HK shares. Michael "Fitz" Wong should be happy that he can find work acting in HK, because he could not act his way out of a wet paper bag in English. Shannon Lee looks good and he is a fantastic fighter (even better with the fight ever than his father), but his skills also act sub-par. In fact, all the English dialogues (90% of the movie - even more than in Gen-Y cops) is so bad that I switch to Mandarin audio just to resolve my misery of delivering the bad dialogue and redundancies to the English aboard . Sure, some decent gunfights (but nothing we've never seen before) with good cinematography, but the cheese visual effects really spoil the action. <br /> <br /> That said, it's worth the price of admission to Watch Shannon and the Benny "Jet" Urquidez go to it. Spectacular, and almost worth seeing the rest of the movie for. <br /> <br /> Finally, you might notice some of your "familiar" scenes, and a shooting at an outdoor walk (think Matrix) and Fitz dive from a helicopter wearing black tissue (think MI: 2) . Guess someone thought at least a few things in this flick were worth ripping off.
