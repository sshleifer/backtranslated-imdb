The plot of 'House of Games' is the strongest thing about it: a successful author and psychologist is conned by a gang of grifters, but in discovering the wicked part of himself who enjoys the thrill of what to do, he finally becomes his revenge. This on the pitch: but someone has to take responsibility for it coming through being treated by puppets. She has the director of Mamet: Lindsay Crouse has a variety of highly-focused TV and film careers, so she can not do this seriously all the time. It was supposed to go in uptight, cool, controlling professionals in calculations, cruel young lady having fun, as shown in the change of costume costume dresses (which she looks to dress for three straight days, including panties) in floral floppy sundress. But everyone seems to speak the same lines off, precisely; I imagine Mamet wants to be sure not a syllable of scintillating script she missed. The effect is unsettling and spoils the atmosphere of mystery and suspense it is presumably trying to create. In time 'House of Games' lost any connection and how human actually behaves or speaks, and becomes just a mechanism to turn out the plot. The clunky vibes'n'oboe faux-jazz soundtrack does not help either. The ultimate result is that the only entertainment to be was to guess the result, and the sooner you do the earlier you will get bored with robots, two-dimensional performance. And they smoke too much !!!
