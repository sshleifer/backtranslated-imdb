God, I was bored out of my head as I watched this pilot. I was hoping a lot of it, as I'm a big fan of James Cameron (and not just since "Titanic", I might add), with his name in the credits I thought would be a guarantee of good type (then again, he also writes the strange day lead ..). But the thing failed pervading to grabbing my attention at any point in almost two hours. In the meantime, it barely went beyond its line of synopsis, and I would be very hard pressed to try to figure out any kind of coherent draw from all the chaos in sections that go nowhere. On top of that, I do not think the same outdated acrobatics in any regular "A-Team" episode. As for Alba, yes, it is gorgeous, of course, but the fact that she only shows one facial expression of one movie at all (pouty and wrong), making me also get bored of her "withe an attitude "schtick very soon. You can count me from this one, Mr. Cameron!
