What is it? A low budget sex comedy? Anyway, it describes perfectly people in Spain. They could come up with a better idea, I mean to make this kind of movies since the 60s .. and people like them! This is neither a teenage comedy nor one family (you can not let your 12 year old look 2 guys in bed kissing, he never wants to go to Spain). This should be rated "R", because only 35+ people are laughing watching: I'm really disappointed, maybe I do not like gays (which is quite an important part of the movie). /> Humorous humor is horrible in films (except Kusturica), wood and play! If you want a new comedy attempt Talladega nighted
