A young boy sees his mother dying and his father hangs himself. 20 years later she gets a lot of friends together to make an exorcism on her head so she will not turn out like her dad. All the stock characters are in place: the beautiful couple; The "funny" guy; The hood is tough (but sensitive); The smart girl (she wearing glasses - that's how we know); the nerd and two blondes that have no personality. It all involves some stupid wooden statues that come to life (not asking) and murder. I knew I was in trouble when, after a great opening scene, we went to 20 years later - all bad horror movies did so! <br /> <br /> The dialogue is atrophy, the act is bad (except for Betsy Palmer - why betsy?) And the killings are stupid and / or inimaginable. My favorite scene is when two people supposedly sex and the image knocks the guy on the bed to show it was totally dressed! A real bad, stupid film uncovered movie. Avoid all costs.
