Do not you just hate it when you order slice but the restaurant gives you chicken? <br /> <br /> These are how I felt watching this call "Battlestar Galactica". The arguments can be done on its quality but the reality remains, not the fans have ordered. Imagine if you were sitting in this proverbial restaurant I mentioned. You have been waiting for years to bring back the famous New York Sticks you loved. When your food arrives, you get to apply the New York Strip name to a chicken dish. You complain, but the waiter merely declares "hands hook, and really good zir"! Do you really care if the chicken is good? You wanted New York Strip - a STEAK! This man explains, "You zeer zir, ze chef wanted to do, as you zayzing, zomezing NEW. We felt that cheek eggs would be the most famous beauty we gave it the name of deesh before our delicious". You wonder if you will ever find the original New York Strip in the future menu but are informed that because the restaurant was a flat called "New York Strip" right now in the menu you will never see the original New York Strip - ever again. <br /> So is the case and creates something new and slapping the "Battlestar Galactica" namesake on it. <br /> <br /> * This mini series is an affair of all fans of original show! * <br /> It's a shame to the production team putting in charge of this new version obviously being despised for the original. The team put in the BG resurrection charge BG would like the original set - seeking to enhance those loved ones, not trying to sell this new set by using the Battlestar Galactica's name. <br /> <br /> If SciFi Channel wanted to give us a new show, then do that! Give it a new name! Do not use the name we justly remember in an attempt to lure the viewers. This effectively rob us of chance to see any pretend to the original in the future. <br /> We were waiting for 25 years to see what we knew as BG because we liked something about the original! We did not simply want the NAME and sales of the basic concept. There are things we liked about the original! <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, probably the best elements of the original were those who were omitted. Sure, the original BG was imperfect and could use some upgrade. This mini series, however, was not an improvement in any considering but the special effects (which were good, but nothing strange by today's standards). Many viewers will debate back and forth on this NEW show quality but we will not forgive SciFi and Ron Moore for destroying our dreams. What they said ... I will offer some comments on the merits of this new mini by itself (not in the original comparison): <br /> <br /> The battle sequences were the best part. Efforts have obviously been put into making the most "real" effects in appearance and less "wow - look at that effect". I would not say that the sequences were outstanding by today's standards yet being in keeping with the original cinema cinema. What was the deal with this "pseudo-live-cam"? Some opinions have tried to foil the effect of a "real" camera and lagging track and zooming stanza. However, it was over-used to consider there was no apparent sourcing of these cameras. The diverse intelligence series, Babylon 5, is the only example I've seen as "live cams" effectively used when we were supposed to witness actions from security securities. <br /> <br /> <br /> The script, you ask? The word felt as a child wrote, for other adolescents. The characters felt cardboard and stereotypes. Indeed, the whole story felt pieced together in well-known stereotypes. The only good features of the whole story were these few elements that were preserved from the original set. It was obviously "dumbled down" for digestion at your average TV audience. The human interaction was deplorable. Instead of drama-based subtle looks, expression and fine distribution, every moment of human tension was exaggerated to the point of being so obvious that they lost all the ability to move any refined visitor. These were obvious in any interaction between Adam and his son. The director should have tried to ensure that the most dense and sensitive viewer would not miss it even if he does not pay attention. Sorry, but real people do not behave as always. <br /> I would not consider this a show show that he had stood on his own. There is nothing great; It will never be revered by true sci-fi fans or craftsmen, but it would be watchable by the masses. I personally could live without it, though. I only watch her to see how she really takes the spirit of the original. <br /> How to keep in mind this mini series is such a symbol of how the storytelling quality has been cast aside for the largest number of calls. How even SciFi Channel has "dumbed down" its production to cater to the masses as opposed to its true niche market, the science fiction fans. It will be time we asked for installment and insist on giving us chicken, despite our complaints. <br /> I left you with one thought - <br /> <br /> NO "MOORE". <br /> <br />
