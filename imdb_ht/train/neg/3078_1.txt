I did not think it was possible for a horror comedy movie to fail so abysmal on both fronts .... really horrible. The fact that he does not take seriously (usually a good thing) works against him, primarily because the actors are so wild you really would swear to read the map. On the upshot though ..... the MST3K version, as always, has a few laughs ...
