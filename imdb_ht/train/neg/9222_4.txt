I really love the sexy action and sci-fi movie in the sixties and it's because of the actress who appeared in them. They found the sexiest women to be in those films and it did not matter if they could act (Remember "Candy"?). The reason I was disappointed by this movie was because it was not nostalgic enough. The story here has a European sci-fi movie called "Dragonfly" and the director has been fired. So the producers decided to leave a young aspiring filmmaker (Jeremy Davies) to complete the picture. They are one real beautiful woman in the movie who plays Dragonfly but it's barely in it. Films are written and directed by Roman Coppola who use some of her ancestors exploits from her early days and put her in the script. I wish the movie could be a tribute to these early films. They could have lots of gastos by actors who appeared in them. There is only one actor in this movie who was famous in the sixties and his John Phillip Act (Barbarella). Gerard Depardieu, Giancarlo Giannini and Dean Stockwell also appear. I guess I'll have to wait for a director to make a good homage to those films in the sixties. If anyone reads this, "Make it as sexy as you can"! I'll wait!
