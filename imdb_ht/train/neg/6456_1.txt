Well, what can she say about this disaster? I watched it because it was revealed on cable. I'm sorry to waste my time but at least I did not waste money. <br /> <br /> The beast is the cheesiest you can find! Please, you need to be very generous by getting upset by the Halloween Costume suit. Well, there are also shows in terrible acts, f / x, and dialogue. The confrontation with the beast is incredible, you can not find a more pathetic scene. <br /> <br /> This is the worst you can get from direct to video flicks. "Unknown Animals" make FULL MOON movie movies look like "Halloween". <br /> Avoid this one at all costs, please. Only "positive" thing about this garbage is the sexy women.
