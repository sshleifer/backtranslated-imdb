1st look 2/2/2003 - 4 out of 10 (Dir-Jim Kammerud & Brian Smith): Drab and un-spectacular supposed end of the classic classic animated `101 Dalmatians. Yes, the movie continues where it ends in the first one, but the problem is that it plays out as much as the original. One of the great things about the original was the rhythm of the story, which one does not have. The animation is also very un-spectacular for Disney and all we get is the same characters will be the same kind of story all over again. When Disney is going to stop our boring and ending with re-making etc .. etc. Probably when we stop renting or buying this mediocre ticket they are being driven out.
