The movie is just as fun as staring at the sun. Sheriff Pataki is a total retard who loves nothing better than sitting behind her fat making a smoke ring from her bulging cigarette and drinking bottle while the doctor acts like a zombie version of Nicholas Cage sucking up all that called "blood" that in fact seemed like Punch Fruits. Most of the plot seemed very sharply even called this piece of crap a movie. The rest of the characters in this movie is the total waste of time, the ending was terrible, explaining their cheese, and the scenes were terrible. What else should I tell your viewers out there? My advice should get your Rabies shot if you've already watched the movie. This film can give you the foam in your mouth if you did not get your up-to-date shots.
