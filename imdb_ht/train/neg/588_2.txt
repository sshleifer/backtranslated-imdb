I have to write a review of this IMAX feature as a way to alert others to your money savings. Almost any episode of Desmond Morris's "Animal of Humanity" or David Suzuki in "The Nature of Things" might have been the best material presented. Not only the director fail to use IMAX incredible 65 to 70 mm stock movie with gigantic presentation screen, everything on screen is very unimpressive to provide access to these programs mentioned previously. The viewers are presented in a pregnant heather, her husband buster, and niece and nephew. We follow them for about forty-odd minutes of eating, sweating, listening to music, etc. Although we provide access to scenes inside the human digestive tract and learn about natural baby diving reflexes, we really learn nothing more than the most school graduates? Are we remotely entertained by the transatlantic Heather? Are we busy? Avoid this movie all the cost. If you want to see an IMAX feature, I suggest the picture "India: The Kingdom of the Tiger" or the technically thrilling "Space Station 3D". Believe me.
