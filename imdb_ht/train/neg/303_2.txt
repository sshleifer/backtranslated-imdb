It is impossible to objectively consider this movie. Not that I have not tried, yourself - but I'm sitting, and I pop into the VHS of age, and I look at the opening ... and suddenly I'm five years old and hugging my very own Bear Care and Watching the movie with eyes open and a craving heart. <br /> I can see, objectively, that this film is a bizarre combination of baby cuddly merchandising-mascot and prepubescent climb of evil powers that has a thin story and refreshing animation. But my five year old interior goes, "Yay! Care Bears!" every time I think about it. So - I would only (cautiously, reluctantly) recommend this movie to those who have seen it during the early days and may call the awesome power of nostalgia while watching it (like me) OR these lovely Shameless Gen-X / Y-er who deliberately sought wonderful / strange (a category in which this movie ... definitely belongs). For those who are currently looking for a compelling movie or family entertainment: You may want to keep looking.
