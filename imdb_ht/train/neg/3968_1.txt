If you ever saw a movie by Brian Avenet-Bradley and compared it to the feedback she gets on IMDb, you know most of the comments and the false votes. TRUST ME: you will be bored! People in the production team write the feedback themselves (sometimes they even admit it). But that's not enough: They also click still "no" when there is a negative comment on the movie. That's why negative criticisms are still behind them hyped. The movie itself is bad, bad, bad: bad acting, bad lighting, bad script, bad ending. Believe me now! If not, you will believe me later! Brian Avenet-Bradley might be a good business man. Otherwise it can not explain that it is found who still funded his movies. (Okay, they're cheap, but nevertheless.) But as a creative person, it's a complete failure.
