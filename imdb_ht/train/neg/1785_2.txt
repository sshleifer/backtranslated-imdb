.... After seeing this pile of crap you will not be surprised that it has not been published <br /> <br /> !!!! SPOILERS !!!! This is a horrible movie by any standard but when I point out that it's one of the worst movies with Stephen's name in the credits you can begin to imagine how bad he is. The movie begins with two starred characters in a scene of horror: <br /> <br /> "My God. What happened here?" <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />! This guy's guy is good, someone hates cats with a deduction as he should be a policeman. Oh wait one minute, it's a policeman and when a movie starts with a cop to make an obvious observation oh you just know you're going to watch a bad movie <br /> <br /> The reason SLEEPWALKERS is bad is that It's very logical and confused. We eventually find the monsters in the title need the blood of the girls to survive. Would not it be better to look for a virgin in the western center of the west rather than an Indian coast town? Having said that at least we know of the monsters motives - That's the only thing we learn. We never learned how to be able to change shape or make cars become invisible to those jars and finishes that seem to have been stolen from the Terminator. Monster monsters walk around killing several cops with your hands or blowing them up through a gun but police but (!), But if its monster growth is immune to fire police power then why the animals need the ability to change shape or become invisible? The loss of living creatures is equally ill think out as there is killed by a mass attack of cats in the home. If they can kill by cats then why did the monsters do not kill all the cats lying around the garden? There was a whole horde of moggies sitting around, but the monsters never thought about killing them. I guess so the output team can come up with a finish. This was the start of my complaint filing films <br /> <br /> We are treated at several scenes where film director director like John Landis, Clive Barker and even Stephen King do cameras. I think the reason for this is because every time a striker acting unknown reads the script they immediately decided that no such issues were not going to appear in a bad movie so Stephen King was there Phone up his thunder friends in order to fill out the cast. That's how bad SLEEPWalkers are <br /> <br /> * incredible as it seems that was not the worst line in the movie. The worst line is - "That cats save my life"
