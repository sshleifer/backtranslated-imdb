OK. Not bad movie making it out of an original script. But not! <br /> What part of "in this story does not have any women, except for Foulata and Gagoola" introduced by Haggard did the producers, directors and writers do not understand? I mean, it is very clear English. I understand it at age 10! Beauty KSM is that it has a spectacular description of three different worlds, colonial Africa, the unforgettable desert and Kukuanaland, a hidden and isolated king. That would be more than enough for the most mediocre most of the producers to work with. But Nooo, they have thrown "romance" into it. Pathetic. Suggestions of all your soul poor who actually thought this would be close to the book. Give it. Until Peter Wanna comes along with "doing it right" you can as well keep Tome's re-reading. BTW, has a late book (actually a pre-quel) called Allan's wife. It gives background to the story of Quatermain. It's a bit crap but good.
