This was a terrible movie! Not for the subject, but for the delivery. I went with my girlfriend at the time (when the movie came out), hoping to see a movie about the triumph of the human mind on asthma. What we saw was 2 hours of brutal police ophthalmology, which has no rise to the end. The reviews and the ads have made no mention of this! Plus, for all they played up whoopi goldberg, my gratitude is that he was arrested and killed in the first 20 minutes! Again, the forecasts say nothing about this! (not that you would expect that, but it's just more of the problem). If I knew how depressed this movie would be, I would never have seen it. Or at least I would have been prepared for it. This was a bait campaign and changed, and I NEVER see this movie again!
