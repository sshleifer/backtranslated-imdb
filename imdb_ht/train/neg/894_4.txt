Just saw it yesterday at the Sao Paulo Intl Film Festival. Just before I came here to see how it was rated, and at that time it was 7.4, a pretty nice rate ... After 15 minutes I died to get out (never do that), but felt embarrassed to do so the film producer was in the screening. <br /> I did not like all, the dialogues are deep and lead anywhere, the characters are lighter than the dialogues, nothing leads anywhere, with the worst and worst: many of Siemens and organic advertisements on the movie. Despite the fact that I'm already paying for the movie and amusing myself, I still have to be bombarded by the main character discussing the internet with Siemens mobile popping up all the time on her leg-head; or another character with a bath or cut her hair just have organic shampoo appear enormously on the screen! All of this would be loaded if the plot, character, romance, nothing was good, but it was bad, really bad! A "does not know how to do" the sex-in-the-city. <br /> Do not waste your time or money.
