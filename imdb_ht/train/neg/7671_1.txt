The movie starts out with some scrolling text that takes almost five minutes. It gives the basic summary of what goes on. This could easily be done and hand acting instead of finding a scrolling effect. Soon after you bombard with characters that you learn a little about, keep in mind this is ALL you will learn about them. The plot begins to get on the ground and then crash into the entire movie. Not only the change is drawn, but you might even ask yourself if you are watching the same movie. I have never played the video game, but know people. From my understanding if you have played the game or not this movie does not get any better. Save your money unless you like to sleep in theaters.
