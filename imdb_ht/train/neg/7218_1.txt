There is a scene near the start after a shooting where the horses are running. If something red captures your eyes it is because a white wind is parked behind a bush in the trail. I thought I was bad but that's it. A white wind in a west. Do not catch this? Oh well, and pay the top dollar in the rental. It will make you want to grab your buddies and make them all put in 10 grand and make a better movie. The talk was so slow, the act was mostly OK, but could not take seriously due to the poor nature of the filming. There is a door of the sheriffs who looks like a door today with particular cuts. I say watching this movie, and moving Cabin Boy # 2 on the worst of all time.
