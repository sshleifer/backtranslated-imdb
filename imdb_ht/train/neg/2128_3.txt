Notice, and it can not come close to capturing the charm of the original. The extreme length that causes more than a few inducing seeds. This version is ridiculously politically correct. The movie lacks style, and especially it lacks talent, not only with the act, but the direction, lying, costume etc. are all below par. He had a disrespect for detail period. Vanessa Williams is the only cast member who shows any flair, Tyne Daly is not too bad. They should be left alone enough. The songs are good (Vanessa Williams) of the poor (all else). See the original 1963 version and skip this one. There is not much here to recommend.
