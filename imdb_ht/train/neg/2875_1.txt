This is the biggest piece of crap ever. It looks like they spent more time, effort, and money making the DVD cover than they did on the current movie. I really thought the DVD was changing out with someone's indigenous pornography until I recognized one of the actors from the cover. This movie looks like someone made it with a hundred bucks and a camcorder and spent half of that on rats. The picture is really clear, but that, with the very unfortunate lighting, cinematography, if you can call it that, output, act, if that's actually what they're doing, and script if they have one, do this to watch movie worse than an old porno. At least the old porn has a point. That's just like some PETA members have come together and decided to make a really disturbing PSA, freeware on animal rights and feelings. This is not worth the money or the time. It's nothing in common with the current BTK killer series other than the name of the killer and that of some of the victims. Those who made this movie should be happy not always free, or it may have come after them just to embark on this movie so badly.
