I can not say that Wargames: The Dead Code is the worst movie I've ever seen, as it has one or two decent times, but I can easily say it's the most transparent movie I've ever seen. Not once did a draw device present itself without my guessing it 10+ minutes in advance. There was no intonation anything the movie was doing, no obvious intelligence at all behind the scenes. Each intent of the lines that were spoken or typed was so clearly evident that it was impossible to "enter" the movie. <br /> I found myself laughing at originally thought out the draw line, and the attempts bumbled to claim the audience, far more often than I found myself enjoying the movie.
