After Highlander 2 (which I'm still in refusal), I thought it was impossible to make an end that would make me cry because it was so bad. I was guilty. I like the original Wargames, however, this movie is not correct with computer details and details of the original movie. The original wars at least had some hacks that worked. Anyone who wrote this movie knew ANYONE BEHAVIOR except for using a word processor. I doubt he even watched the original movie. The act is not even convinced. Please save yourself, without any circumstances watching this movie. I do not care if the channel is stuck on the TV and you can not turn the TV. THIS PICTURE will ruin your life.
