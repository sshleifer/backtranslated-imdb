There is simply no use to try to praise any part of this movie. <br /> It was straight garbage. At the very beginning you might think that you are in for a visually stunning piece of cinematography ... and then shortly afterwards you hit with a big bag (cloth) in FAIL! The battle is barely martial, the act is teetering on the edge of par, and the music is not worth describing. There is only enough in a story created an excuse for this movie being made. The decisions that the characters do and the ways they deal with their weaknesses, and they have done nothing but frustrated me. I think the only reason this movie came about was to act as a bit of fan services using Yumiko Shaku.
