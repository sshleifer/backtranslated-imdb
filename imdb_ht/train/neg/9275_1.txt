Humans IV (1991) was a bad make-for-T.V. movie. Since the 80s have been over, I guess the executives have experimented with the method (the drug of choice during the 90's) because there is no other reason to explain this travesti. Why did they even bother to do that? A t.v. movie? What were mulling about then one came up on the idea board? Did they even think for a second that this movie would catch on as. Perhaps they thought he could do it as a set? You will never know. But I know one thing. This movie was the main reason why I never bought trilogy in Ommen. They should be hit in a couple of bucks instead of wear out this "extra" disc. Humans IV is basically an American average rumor of the movie first. Instead of a kid kid kid kid, we find the spooky girl who is a totally brat all around her. If the family had much parenting skills, then none of the demonic events that had swept through the past films would never have occurred. These parents need to put their feet and make some real disciplines! <br /> <br /> Not recommended, best to avoid all prices!
