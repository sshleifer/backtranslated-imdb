Shame shame on UA ​​/ DW for what you do! <br /> <br /> I was scared. <br /> Do not let the kids see this movie. The humor is totally appropriate for children - the more they will be bored and humiliated. Certainly * we all * have read Theo's beautiful books and certainly we have expectations ... but that's pure waste. Dr. Seuss should be disappointed and certainly would never give his "thumbs up" in such a dastardly attempt to capitalize on a classic. <br /> <br /> What a pity. <br /> Spend your money on the book. If you own a copy, then buy the book and give it a Game for the Tots Program. This movie is NOT worth a "free" watch look. <br /> <br /> Stick with the book. The TV cartoon version works well if you want a visual painting - save your money ... seriously. SAVE your money - it will be on the cable by the saint patty's day. <br /> <br /> Shame on shame on what to do !!
