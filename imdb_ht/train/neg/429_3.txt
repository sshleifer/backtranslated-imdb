I was attracted to seeing this movie by its starpower, but ultimately that's all it delivers. It plays more like a Greek tragedy than a modern thriller on corrupt city big cities. Worse is its predictability and the pronounced lack of suspicion. We know who the bad guys from the beginning, and just follow along as they fall as dominoes. His credit film is abstract from gender and gender violence, but it has forgotten to replace good, clean romance or excitement in any other way. All the flavor of a good, caffeine diet dish. "Q & A", which also takes place in New York, is a far better alternative, as is "confidential".
