Thanks to a merely simply by Neil Simon, and substandard direction from Robert Moore, Chapter Two becomes a shrill showcase for Marsha Mason who received his third part of Oscar's two nodings for Chapter Two giving the same performance here that he gave at Cinnderella Liberty (73), Goodbye Girl (77), Audrey Rose (78) and only when I laughed (81); Only this time he does not have a baby to swim. Chapter Two is the third and last feature film for Moore's directed Neil Simon's The Cheapest Detective (78) and Death by Death (76). Caan is bad, the characters are mono dimensions, the dialogue is overly analytical, and there's virtually no detailed details. The first half is a less-than-fascinating, beautiful encounter, coy romance between a blinkered Caan and a chipper Mason, and the second half hole makes you long for the first half. Where NYCs and Joe Bologna, with a thinner heat of Valerie Harper, are not important, but at least they provide some distractions. And last and least, there is a terrible song playing during the credits.
