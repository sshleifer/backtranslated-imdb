I will not criticize the movie. There is not much to talk about. He had good animal scene action that was probably pretty amazing at the time. Clyde Beatty is not exactly an idolized event. It's a slight and not particularly good looking. But that's OK. He is the man in the lion's cage. We know that when he can not take the time away from his lion tends to his girlfriend, he will end up on an island with him and have to save the day. Someone said earlier that it is a story lesson. The scene of the circus is in another day, especially the kids hanging around. I did not realize that even back in the thirties, they took an erection of three mushed spoons. It looked like something out of 1860. I guess this stock footage was there. No wonder the thing got crushed. They are still talking about fixing it up. There's even a airship. He tells us a little about female male relationships at the time, a kind of giggly sererite. But if you do not take it too seriously, you can have fun watching it.
