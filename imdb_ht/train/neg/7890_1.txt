How sad has no option to post a brand below 1. I've looked at this nonsense and could barely believe what I was looking at. Each part of the movie was terrible. Music, act, direction, story, everything, simply everything. I actually get to laugh at the various points in the movie. I particularly liked the bit where our hero is fascinating in the hospital in soft focus soft movements, and hit the clipboard from the nurse because, well ............. well. Just because. Assortment products? Crucifix's (crucifi?) Everywhere. If you are a Christian convince and very easy to meet, you can love this movie. If you do like this movie, you really need to get more.
