Where to start, this movie started seriously and ended up seriously! It consists of extremely poor effects and unrealistic effects that I have skull in my place, seriously, my cats could have been acting better than this much. <br /> <br /> Some of it was actually mockingly because it was so incredible that I would have rated this lower but there was nothing else! So listen to my warning and unless you are bored or close to suicide and would like a good reason to continue with your suicide mission, do not bother with this one. I'm still in shock that this might actually be released to the public, this would be a crime and all involving should be arrested. I picked up you had the gift by now so I'll let it up to you decide.
