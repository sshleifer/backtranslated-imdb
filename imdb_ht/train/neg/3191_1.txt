There are terrible movies, and there are movies that are so awful to be long-forgotten and unwatchable. Also, many of the violence and bad things (not just cheesy things; you know what I mean) add to the mix as well. What is the result of bad movies and such raunchy content? Why, "Final Justice," of course! <br /> Remember "Mitchell?" Joe Don Baker was the star of this film, and that was riffed by Joel and the Bots on "Mystery Science Theater 3000." Now this time, and Mike takes Joel's seat on the Satellite in Love (but with the same bots), which trio has fun in Joe MST3K's second film, Don Baker, "Final Justice." Of course, many of the rogue stuff I mentioned have been removed for TV release, but still, I want to watch this episode (and "Mitchell" as well), because what Don Joe "hates" the most? Why, none other than "Mystery Science Theater 3000!" <br /> <br /> P.S. If you have a great many nearby, check out the store for the tape inscribed! LOL This happens to another user!
