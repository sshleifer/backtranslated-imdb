I really have problem rating this movie. It is brilliant, has obviously a lot of money in it. Managed with the intense dancers (although personality screen it could use a bit more definite and spying up), editing and cinematography are excellent. On the other hand, it's one really really sick place where one can not help but wonder if the director likes the scene scene specifically, and yes, one can not help but wonder how many copycats will be like a inspired film. /> <br /> In purely artistic terms, it is a 9, but I really have to ask myself who they are giving their money to producing such a movie.
