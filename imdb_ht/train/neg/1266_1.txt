If there is a hell, he has a screening room in which GRAND CANYON is playing on and over again on an eternal village. One would expect the presence of many wonderful actors - Danny Glover, Alfre Woodard, Kevin Kline, Mary Louise Parker - would help make up for their presence in Mary McDonnell (whose penitence is watching her own movie for all eternity). But no. Apparently they are injected these other actors with a serum made from McDonnell. The whole affair is firefighting, swelling, insulting (if you are deaf or knowing anyone, preparing for your blood to boil in the ludicrous scene performer). GRAND CANYON is full of people who are important, but it never gives us a reason to love / understand / sympathize with or even tolerate them. With rare exceptions, they insult insult that the youth pool would be better without. There is no scheme to speak of, no character development (these people will not always develop), there is no break-out performance and writing the most arch you'll ever encounter in a movie. The best thing about GRAND CANYON? Its titles. This is a great HOLE in a movie.
