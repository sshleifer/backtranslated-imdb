I think the biggest disappointment in this movie was that, just until the end, I expect the actors to act in the cast to break through and apologize for how the poor acting. Considering the powerful theme, the brilliant scenery and the effort made to create a wonderful set of spectacular images, it is a shame that little attention has been given to acting. <br /> <br />
