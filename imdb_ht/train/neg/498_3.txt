I saw this movie when I was younger and I thought it was funny. I've seen it again last week, and you can guess the result. There are some funny parts in it, very few and too long. The beginning is the only thing that's funny if you ask me. <br /> <br /> If you want a total b-movie this is a good selection but does not expect too much from dwarf alien size
