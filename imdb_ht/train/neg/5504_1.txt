There is no reason why I can understand why this movie was ever born. <br /> <br /> Why does Hollywood continue to crank out a horrible news of a classic after another? (That's the point: Master Magoo, the Avengers - terrible!) <br /> <br /> Christopher Lloyd, whom I normally enjoy, was so miserable miscast in this role. Her manicure portrait of our dear "Uncle Martin" is so unreadable to be unjustable to be almost criminal. Entering it, groaning, grimacing and histrionics gives us no reason to care for her character except as some 1 dimensional character .. The principal must think that fast, screaming dialogue and "one-take" Slapstick was some similarity to comedy. Apparently he told all ACTOR to act as though they had red ants in their pants. <br /> <br /> Fault must be interrupted with the irresponsible wrinkle script. I think the writer uses "It's a mad, angry, upset, mad world" as an example of a fine comedy script. As fascia as this classic 1963, it is far superior to this claptrap - in fact - suddenly it looks very good in comparison. What's sad about this movie is that it must have been apparently written to appeal to toddlers. I'm just not sure that her children did. Certainly no self respect, four-carries my children to know! <br /> <br /> If they have noticed my "Favorite Martian", why did not they add some of the timeless charm of the original classic? <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, IMDB.com can not factor in "zero" as a rating for its readers, that is the only rating that comes to mind in describing this travesti. Things came from this film, actors and crew were paid - I think.
