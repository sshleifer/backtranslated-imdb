This movie loses me with the RPG's (rocket-launch grenade). It was like someone cut and stuck a scene from Robocop. I half expected Beowulf to say, "I love it!" <br /> I watch this because I love Chris Bruno from the "Dead Zone" TV show and he did his part. He chose a strange accent, but at least he kept it consistent for the entire movie - unlike any of his costumes. They kept slipping into all kinds of speeches from English to English in English, sometimes in the same sentence. There are already many comments on how this film is different from the source material. However, even on its own, this film scheme is not good. It's just boring, which even the low budget does not excuse. Having a low budget means that you need at least have a good history, dialogue and decent acting. These people do not listen very much. Instead, they spent their money on half assing CGI and some decent costumes and sets. <br /> <br /> Life is too short to watch this movie.
