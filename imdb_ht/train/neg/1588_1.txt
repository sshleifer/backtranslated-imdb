This was the worst movie I've ever seen Billy Zane in. I understand that this movie was mostly featuring the latest, who was very good for newbies, but over all, the movie was not credible. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Even the penny being a bug on Sean was stupid. The Sean Road suddenly realized the coin is the bug, was not realistic. <br /> It looks like this movie was slapped together fast. Bad work. Find a Best Writer. <br /> <br /> The count down to the end was not in sync with anything. It took more time to fight. And what a coincidence that every time Billy went to Sean explosion, it would be out of bullets. Once, I can believe, but not twice. <br /> <br /> Actually, Billy's character was jumping. He was so stupid when Sean punched him from the end. It was such a comedy. Move! Move! Move!
