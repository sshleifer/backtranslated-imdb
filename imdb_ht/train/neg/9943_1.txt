The art covered (which features a man holding a pair of pellet weapons) would make it seem like it's a martial arts movie. (Hardly.) <br /> I find it interesting that the real movie title is Trojan Warrior. (Trojan is a brand of condoms in the US) This film is packed with homoeroticism. If you like things, then this movie is not that bad really. However, consider the following points: <br /> There are many pre-ups of injections and actors, (A same scene features each actor and an inflated stick in his pants.) The film is also immersed in color movements like lime , peach, and red. From the movie cinematograph, this film of a queen is dragging! Several scenes feature character stand EXTREMELY close to each other, occasionally touching as they converse. Also, the cousin of the hero loves women, and all other guys in the film trying to kill him. Is there a message here filmmakers want to transmit? <br /> Will I join the battle scene? (Yes, private parties get into one fight.) The martial arts scene is short and inimaginable. There is no fancy stuff here, just moving the standard you would see in an old Chuck Norris flicker movie. There is also a chase machine scene that can be the first ever LOW-speed chase to put on film.
