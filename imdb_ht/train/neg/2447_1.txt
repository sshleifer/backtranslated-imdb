After watching KHAKEE I felt I would get to watch another good movie but the sad movie is a joke and actually trying hard to introduce Really Afterall, his father Keshu is the producer <br /> RKS spoke so pretty about the movie While promoting, she tells the movie to have meat unlike film released this time, I wonder what movie she was talking about <br /> <br /> The movie is actually a movie masala film and loads of comedy, romance, all action jumbled thing <br /> <br /> The facility in which the children kidnap the family, is one of the funniest parties ever, Imagine kid Dawood's kidnapping children <br /> <br /> The end is a complete confused to unravel with sudden changes in characterization RKS gives her weaker movie until date, except some Bachchan movie scenes are a bit <br /> <br /> Music is boring <br /> <br / > Amitabh tries to assume the role of it all, it does belong to him well, but not his best even if it counts his face too much when pulling a trigger and looking a strange look while smoking sig The groove H is dubbing too is not matched well at times <br /> Akshay is there for a few minutes and just repeats its acts with ham <br /> <br /> Aryeman looks like expression, try too hard but overdo it in some scenes <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The rest are okay
