This movie raises a number of questions in my mind. Firstly, how does Jennifer Tilly manage to maintain academic success a film acting career for all the years based on that ridiculous voice executed and the very limited range of facial features his employee frame? Secondly ... what about the earth being the person responsible for making this film offensive and deeply reluctant? And third ... provided that there were people perverted enough to decide to make trunks like this, would not have had someone in the system - the studio, the distributor, or somewhere - sane enough to prevent it actually getting complete and publish. You really would have to search a very long way to turn another movie as very embarrassing as this ... and it's not even billed as a horror movie - that, as long as it can see what's any legitimate movie genre, it certainly is. The film runs from the beginning to end of sickness, madness and abuse, and has essentially no features to smash at all. I do not actually defend censorship (which I do not believe in) ... but I really can not see how anybody could imagine draw anything positive from watching a movie like this.
