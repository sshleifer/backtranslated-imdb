The plot of this movie is not strong at all, lots of holes. If you approach it as a movie car it's not bad, lots of big cars in this one. The reason I like it is because I'm out of the area where this was filmed. I enjoy the most enjoyable location in Saint Cloud MN and see how the city has changed since 89. It's an interesting historical piece for us locals. Looks like every time a movie is made here everyone wants some relationship to it. It is impossible to find a copy of any of the local video stores as they were all stolen once it was out on VHS. Found a copy from Japan on eBay I find it interesting how the path to the subway train is all over the city. I did not know that the director was from St.Cloud.
