This is perhaps the worst attempt of a zombie movie I've ever had to misunderstand. Terrible, terrible, terrible. Any review found on this site is obviously the work of either the film maker, the filmmaker family, or a friend of the film festival. How does this movie suck? Let's count the ways ... <br /> <br /> The plot? Inkojan. Dialogue? Atrocious. I will not slam the effects / gore, as I understand that this is low budget. But there was even one zombie who did not obese? C'mon! And for a movie set in Rhode Island, why is this sport truck a Massachusetts plate? Continuity, find some. <br /> <br /> The girl dances while the soldier "Stand At Attention". Please do not put your ex girlfriend or sister buddy in your movie naked. This was an ugly film filled with ugly people, and no business even mentioned Romero on the cover. The next time you decide to make a movie, do not.
