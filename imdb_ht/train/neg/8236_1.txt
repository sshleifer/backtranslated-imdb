I can not believe this is about DVD. Even less it was available in my local video store. <br /> <br /> Some argue this is a good movie if you take into consideration it has only a $ 4,000 budget. I find this funny. I would find it very bad regardless of what the budget. <br /> <br /> Still more funny, I read the following in another review: "Dramatic aside, if you love horror and you like something about the lines of duel (1971) updated with a story little more and some nice girls thrown in, you'll love this movie. "This is a shame comparing these two movies. <br /> I give a "1", since I can not give a "0". I just do not see any way this movie might be fun.
