I started watching this movie with low expectations, as a matter of fact I only noticed it because it was an adaptation to a S.K. novel (a novel I never read). <br /> I am glad my expectations were low because the film was not anything close to good, but it managed to keep you interested. What really drags this story down is the work done by the director and the actors. The film is overlong, there are no "beautiful" shots and no crises, the dialogues are mute and the special effects are crap. Only the good things are that, as I said, it keeps you interested (I guess the book is good) without using many horror clich√©s. <br /> My Vote 4/10.
