If I only had one camera that was accidentally stuck in the floor, enough film for only one taken at each shot, and then lost all the movies and was riding up some bucks to buy a few digital video digital, and was forced to make a movie more than 2 hours on the French Revolution, and also did not have any intercourse with having my 4-year-old autistic son paint their origins, and also the actors Only I could get those who did not audition in this year's soap opera, and I was also forced to use any music in the movie all, and also the pulling feature on the camera did work except for one time when he accidentally started zooming in and could not stop, oh, and if i hate my audience, then i might do something kind like this terrible, yet hilarious mistake , Hell-worthy garbage in time. Almost grand looking but completely fake looking backdrops have reminded me of some of George Lucas's latest creations, which made it more disappointing because of the whole movie, there was little glimmer of hope in the back of my mind 'that the movie would point to a fatal duel / space laser battle. I do not mean to spoil the film for those who have not seen it, but that's not how it ends. The only thing I can think of is wasting more time than watching this movie wrote this review. Peace.
