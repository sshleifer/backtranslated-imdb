Steven Seagal Cinema has never been Oscar's material but with each drop compared to worse and worse. This one begins with Seagal getting collected by the FBI because it killed a few people 'in his own defense' of active military so escaped from prison to rescue a stolen steal aircraft that will be used by The cruel 'cruel mechanic' that Hollywood is so obsessed with including those days. <br /> <br /> Enough to say the movie has terrible dialogue that almost always delivers with a cheating topping of cheese and lack of talent acting. The story is not interesting and there is segment of it that makes absolutely no sense and does not add anything to the story, the movie character as a whole like the 'lesbian' interaction between the two main women of the cast whose peppers for the titles can get viewers and yet it's not just a bit confusing title as it does not make sense of why it happened when he did not need it. <br /> In a little awful and bad dialogue, saved by sub-parody actors, boring and at times serious choreographic action scenes, and non-important parts that only serve to achieve the near-impossible and make the same movie worse. <br /> <br /> Save 98 minutes to your life and give this miss, even if you are the most staggering Seagal fan.
