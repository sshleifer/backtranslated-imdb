Recently they were trying to hock this late-night movie on TV cable advertising. Do not believe the hype. I was one of those unfortunate to see this stinker in the theater. This is, in my opinion, the worst 3rd movie of all time, just behind Mac & May (# 1 Worst), and Jack Frost (# 2 Worst), but I have to admit them all close and all TERRIBLE! Really, nothing in this movie is funny, or disturbing, or anything else it claims to be so do not waste your money. The only thing it is good for is to give your worst enemy. I do not lie about that. Someone you would like to kill or torture would be a prime candidate for this movie. It is so awful. If you do not believe me then you deserve to suffer from the misery in this view, which I doubt you can end up. Two thumbs enthousiasm down.
