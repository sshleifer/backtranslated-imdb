I kept this movie on a small test made by members of my college club club. We asserted that this would be "greed madness" in banks, and this movie is more than delivered. Tom Hanks plays Robbie, a young man re-starting college career after "resting" for a semester. What we are, the viewer, find out as the movie progresses, is that Robbie was hopelessly addicted to a role-playing game called "Maz and Monsters," a game that he gets re-acquainted with and after a gaming bank recruits 'for a campaign .. This film is ridiculous on many, many levels. A scene characteristic of the group "Gaming by Candle," which is probably the best way I can describe it. While I'm sure this was meant to be "culture" in some ways, as most gamers know, it's horribly correct. Most role-playing soles are made in well-lit rooms, usually on some chee-tohs and a quarter of soda. <br /> <br /> The act, while not Oscar-caliber, is not gut-wrenchingly awful either. This is one of Tom Hanks's first roles, and Buddies Bosom and Bachelor's party have always been a year or two on the horizon. Thrown in support, while not very memorable, still decent decent performance. <br /> <br /> Mostly the wickedness lies in the fact that it was a made-to-TV movie that shows the "dangers of banking" a look if you and your friends are planning a bad movie night.
