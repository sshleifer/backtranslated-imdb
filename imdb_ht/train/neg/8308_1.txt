Evening entertainment that has been going down hill for the past few years, but as of last night (Aug 17th 2006) was reached a new bar. <br /> In an attempt to hack up broadcasts, they decided to post photos of Jonebenet Ramsey's body of announcements last night ... and said "Pictures from the case you never saw before". The two images were graphic and very disturbing. One was on his face with head and neck and you could see clearly the rope that was used to trample him around his neck, and bruising on his face. This was so awful awful, I could not believe it. How did this happen with all remotely related to Hollywood Entertainment ?? There is nothing !! They dropped the levels of dignity and value to a new bar .... and it shows. This used to be shown in Premiere to watch ... and it's just garbage right now. <br /> I'll watch Hollywood Access from now.
