As big as a Texas grassland and equally as boring. Even Liz Taylor, James Dean, Chill Wills, and Dennis Hopper can not float this boat overbloated. Taylor actually looks bad - bad wardrobe, bad hair, and wrong makeup - a unique achievement in his remarkable career. Hopper provides the only credible performance, and Dean in the climate scene shows remarkable talent as something we usually do not remember him - a comic actor. Rock Hudson is his usual prototype of Barbie doll Ken and does one thing that requires a, say, Redford could do with the male lead. There is no discernible scheme that gives no tension until the end of the final minute, just a pasty of milestones with little relationships with each other. Except for Hopper, there is no character development, only a collection of Buddha boxes that pop up periodically for no apparent reason as random goals in a shooting gallery. For its credit, the movie tackles racism and sexism at a time when taboo subjects, and has size, make it an excellent choice for yourself to invite unwelcome home. People with the DVD version can spare themselves some of the Tedy by starting with the second disk. You will not miss anything of interest.
