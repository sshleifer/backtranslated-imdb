I'm spark to discover the amount of fans this show has. Do not say that Friends were, at best 'sitcom' average, and not as great as others were made out. Let's face it, if it was not filed in Courtney Cox Arquette, David Schwimmer, Matthew Perry, Lisa Kudrow, Jennifer Aniston and Matt Le Blanc, then who knows whether this show would be lasted for as long as he did. I'm very skeptical. Although as the series progressed, friends got more progressively predictable, lame and boring that I could not care less about the characters - who are the most overrated in television history - or in combat, neither of those who were asleep with whom. And it was going to be funny in the first four seasons periodically funny. And even when he had all of these A-Hollywood film actors in the movie world, I still did not bother writing the tune in Writing of Friends became stingy as I lost interest in this winter show in the sixth and As for the end, it was very predictable to say at least. What was annoying though was that this lasted for ten seasons, too some of my favorite shows lasted for only three, four seasons for example and were eventually canceled and off in the air for good. The show should have reached an immediate stop by the time the cast wanted the highest salary. In truth, as much as the series decreased, the show was larger than the actors themselves, not the other way round. <br /> <br /> When it was finished in 2004, I was relieved to see the back of this site. Now, there's talk of a friendship reunion coming in our screen TV very soon. And yet, for one will not be looking forward to it too.
