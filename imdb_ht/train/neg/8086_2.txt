When I first heard of "Solar Crisis" then there was a charge at the disposal, I asked why I never heard of a movie and like a big cast before. Then I saw it. <br /> <br /> For a movie that encompasses outer space, the sun, vast deserts and metropolis, this is a terrible crustacea and claustrophobic character; It feels like everyone is hunkered close together so the camera will not have to pull too far back. <br /> And then the effects, while good, are very underwhelming; we are talking about the imminent destruction of Earth's planet if a team of scientists and soldiers can not distract a deadly solar waste. But other than shout, sweat and a red light on everything, there is no real feeling of urgency. <br /> <br /> Do not get me started on the cast. What Heston, Palans, Matheson, Boyle, et al are doing in this movie without even bothering to act with any feel for the material is to guess anyone. Make you wonder who condos others do not pay for Hollywood .... And then as far as the end goes .... Well, let's just say it's tense and intriguing but it's too small too late in an effort like this. If he kept up the type of pace all in the movie, maybe I'd heard of "Solar Crisis" earlier. <br /> <br /> Two stars. Especially for lost opportunities and bad career careers. I remember how Alan Smithee kept his job as junk as this?
