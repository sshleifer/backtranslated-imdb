The director is trying Quentin Tarantino, screenwriters try Tennessee Williams, Deborah Kara Unger tries to Faye Dunaway, James Coburn late trying to be Orson Welles, Michael Rooker tries to have Gene Hackman, Mary Tyler Moore tries to be Faye Dunaway ( older version), Cameron Diaz tries to get out of the frame as quickly as he can (successfully), not asking about Joanna Ale. Eric Stoltz and James Spader try to hide their troubles with this crazy thing. It delivers endless, meaningless dialogue with many small actions. Tulsa is a city with beautiful Elevator Elevators, a church deco church by Bruce Goff and a beautiful, majestic castle by Frank Lloyd Wright. Visit Tulsa, do not watch this movie. It does not place justice.
