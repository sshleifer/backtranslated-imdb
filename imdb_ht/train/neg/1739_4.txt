Watching Lady Nan Ermine I asked what Betty Grable did in a project that seemed to be aiming for Marlene Dietrich to do. Someone on Fox's 20th century may have decided to single sex symbols is as good as another. Darryl F. Zanuck should know best. <br /> <br /> Betty plays a 19th-century Italian controller whose domain has been invaded by a troop of Hussars Hungarian captivated by Douglas Fairbanks, Jr. it's ghostly ancestor whose portraits hang in the palace hall along with the rest of the trees Distinguished family, see no small resemblance to Doug now with another occupant some 300 years earlier whom he faced when the army failed. <br /> In addition to that the current Betty was just married to Cesar Romero and the invasion came at a most inopportune moment, before things were consummated. This will give anyone a bad mood, I'm guaranteed. <br /> Well, good, all Americans Betty is NOT the actress doing seductive and mysterious. Marlene Dietrich might put this on, but with Betty she flattered than yesterday's presidential candidate. He and Fairbanks have no chemistry at all, though Doug is as good as ever with someone I can look at. Frederick Hollander and Leo Robin wrote the note for this movie and this is the moment that received an Oscar nomination for the best song. That Lady of Ermine's only chance for Oscar's glorious power falls into the bow and arrow. Ernest Lubitsch died midway during the movie and Otto Preminger finished Lady Nan Ermine. I can not believe Lubitsch was grable in mind for the lead here. Nor will you be sure to see Lady Nan Ermine.
