Killer tomato killer has this special kind of humor - you either love it or hate it. I personally love it, but in this movie the fourth feeling goes. Tomatoes are not the same, the jokes are lame, even the actors are not as funny. Because that's the only thing this kind of movie is supposed to be - funny. So, now follows the plot made in laughter, is annoying. They really should not be part of the fourth bloodthirsty killer tomatoes.
