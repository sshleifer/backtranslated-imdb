One, if not the worst film from Great Britain in the 80s. <br /> This tawdry story in a midfielder that 'seduces' the young scrubs that babysit for him and his faux-chic wife has nothing to deliver. <br /> <br /> In free, little, uncouth and unrealistic spin, this film fills the depths as it fails miserably in its attempts to be funny, provocative, intellectual and controversial. <br /> <br /> Maybe the worst thing about this movie is the way to cast the fortress of George Costigan, Michelle Holmes and Siobhan Finneran are completely sewn not like a lame script. It's no surprise that Dunbar Dunbar's only end was doing it on the screen. Complete and absolute trash on each level.
