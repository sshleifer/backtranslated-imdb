wow! I watched the trailer for this one and even though 'close, this one is not for me'. I looked at my husband and face of our friend during the trailer, and knew this was a 'boy movie'. i mean, hello! a bunch of chick dancing buddies - another striptease? <br /> <br /> Then I started watching her and did not look at all that bad. So I brought on watching. I look at it just to the end. what an awesome movie. if anything, this is a chick-flick movie. These girls have mood. It is really a feel-good film, and a bit of a love story. really leave you with a nice feeling. <br /> <br /> Basically, the story of a small town girl makes it big in the city, after going to the usual big city c ** p. There was a couple of these, it is almost a new urban legend. but it also makes you think of your life, and what you have achieved. Well, I'm anyway. I think it is because the whole working in a low scenario is very familiar, not just for me but for many people I know. Do not trust the trailers for this one - it is aimed at bringing the men to.
