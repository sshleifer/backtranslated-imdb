This movie has beautiful scenery. Unfortunately it has no conspiracy. In order to have a draw must have a conflict. This movie was no. She spent two hours painting a beautifule scene and failed to ever wear any activity in her. The picture tries to be artistic but failed to pay attention to the fundamentals of hard storytelling. If you love Montana scenery and fly fishing you will find some value in this movie just do not expect a story. No one.
