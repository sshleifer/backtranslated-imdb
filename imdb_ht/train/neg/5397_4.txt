I think this is one of the weakest in their work Kenneth Branagh Shakespearian. After such great efforts as many Ado on Nothing, etc. I thought this was poor. The cast was weaker (Alicia Silverstone, Nivoli, McElhone ???) but my biggest was that they messed with Bard's work and cut out some of the play to put in the music / dance sequences. You just do not do Shakespeare and then mess with the play. Sorry, but that's just wrong. I love some Cole Porter just like the next one, but jeez, not mess with Shakespeare. Skip this and watch the "Prospero Book" if you want to see a Shakespearean noise adaptation to the storm.
