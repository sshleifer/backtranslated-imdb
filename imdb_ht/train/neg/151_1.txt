This is really terrible. <br /> Only the catcher feature on this movie is that when the next time people ask me what the worst vampire movie I've ever looked, I'd have an appropriate answer. <br /> I think it is filmed about 35 mm so it's already tacky as hell. I would not have bothered comments but I noticed some fanboys (probably connected to the movie) claimed that this was the best movie since the uterus. Let me debunk myths and lies. <br /> There is nothing good in the movie. All yells minables. The actress is ugly. Choreography in battle is the worst I've ever seen. The scene of the unbelievable amateur fights. Imagine a girl flailing her arms around in a helpless circle and deliver weak kicks that would not hurt a kitten. Obviously, the director just pulled people on the street giving them the role of the movie. <br /> I know the director did not have much budget for the movie but still the best movies made on smaller budget before. Unforgivable.
