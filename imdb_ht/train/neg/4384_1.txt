The fact that someone actually spent money on such a bad script, is beyond me. This really must be one of the worst films, in addition to "Haunted Highway" I've ever seen. BAD actor, and a really bad story. There is no normal reaction to any event in this film, and even though it's Halloween, normal people would have greater reactions when witnessing their father died, not to mention gutted, people with tapes covered coverage They can not even breathe (in a room with at least 50 people I might add) and some people dressed as Satan dragged people out of his house, even an 8 year old could see the difference between a dolls with someone. Not to mention the fact that no one can possibly be that naive and dumb believe the reality of Satan and the emergence of Jesus on the same day, as this kid does. When I was 8, I was sure there was more brain than that. But the thing really stupid is that everyone else seems to be falling for this mute satane look-alike as well, no question has been asked. The question of the movie is, is it really Satan, or is it some foolish to murder every time it feels like it? Well, having hands, arms, build and whatever, so I guess it was supposed to be in the movie as well, otherwise they did a disgusting job to hide it. Then with this person being everyone and everyone, he could kill an old lady, a man and his mistress, 5 (!! ???) cops (all with weapons and training I suppose) , and some others. .... and obviously everyone just stood there waiting for him, or what? The whole concept and way of telling the story is absolutely the worst thing I've ever seen, and I would never recommend anyone wasting 1 hour and 30 minutes of life to watch this crap total.
