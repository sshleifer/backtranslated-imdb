"Back to Beyond" takes place at a dinner / gas station in the middle of the Austrian desert running by Tom McGregor (Paul Mercurio), a shy guy who suddenly finds himself in a place of trouble when some visitors unexpectedly arrive. We find that, first, confusing seems like a flashback in which he and his sister (though the other relationships best understood later in the movie) are speeding in the desert on his motorcycle. And he looks like a very quiet, and sometimes Moody character in the presence of the arrivals. <br /> <br /> We know one thing is to make sure that McGregor's sort of sense is spiritual, prospecting him in danger and like - clairvoyance him only slightly related to the story, the bulk of which concerns three diamonds The diamond in the car breaks down and rely on Tom to help them out of place without getting in their way. Of course, Tom falls for one of the thieves, a young woman named Charlie, and suddenly he's all three already ally suspiciously against each other. But not in a way that really results in anything of many mysteries or actions. In fact, the movie all the while seems willing to build something important, but really neglected to do so. Even the finish, which plays out like a fire campfire (and one that really reveals a lot of narrative faults), is almost as ridiculous. <br /> It can be worth trying if you do not mind the rhythm of the rhythm slowly but in the mood, at least, for something somewhat different than the norm.
