This would be a * big * silent film. Acting is really good, at least at a glance Ma, I do really great act! sort of way. <br /> Everything is great. Each line is PROFOUND! Each scene is shattersed by human tragedy! <br /> Mostly, I felt like gagging. But like any train trainer, I could not tear my eyes away. This dialect might have worked on the scene, although I doubt it. On the screen, it was cluttered, aroused, hackneyed and pretty much each other negative adjectives you can come up with to describe a really bad dramatic job. <br /> <br /> If you enjoy your melodrama in large, heaping dosage, you * may * enjoy the movie. Prepare to wait, however. For all that melodrama, this ensures plods together at his own pace. <br /> <br /> This script must've sounded very different when the actors involved were reading it at their heads. It simply does not work once they get around delivering it in front of the camera. <br /> <br /> IMDB makes us a big mistake, at times when using its computer goofy to control "balanced scores". Curse of the hungry class deserves less than one 1. <br /> <br /> Character driving factor is great, but when you develop your character does not simply push them into hoops that have no explicit explanation for their maturation or evolution, it is not 'by character development! Your character must have a motivation. They have been drinking for a while and waking up in a field is * not * character development. This is a plot compression. <br /> <br /> Stay away from this movie. Or at the very least, look it muted. Maybe you'll get some fun from all the arm-wav characters to do. <br /> Oh, and the wise word - to prove that this is really a movie artsy, you see James Woods at all as he was manson, "look-in-me, i-a-figurative -the-literal-representation-of-naked-vulnerability-of-man "glory. <br /> you have not been warned.
