I saw this movie first in the Soviet Union and many erotic scenes were merely edited from the censorship committee. But then, in Poland in 2000, I looked at it in a complete form. So, what? The plot is incredibly sane - 2 people survive the genetic disaster and find themselves on the full planet of feminist, straightforward and fundamentally feminine women. The guys now try to fight it and then the whole bunch of cliches are very funny follow-sex-drive, constant masculine desires for sex, feminists that are shown as complete idiots (you can agree with them or not, but idiots certainly are not), and so on. Even Jerzy Stuhr's stellar performance is here's wild and weird - it just pulls unfunny figures and repeats such phrases as "I'm in the elevator with a nude chick and I did not do anything to her!" . This was designed to be a comedy, instead, it turned out to be a stolen mascarade, full of predictable junk and under-in-the-thorn innuendos. Do not waste your time on it - this is just bad.
