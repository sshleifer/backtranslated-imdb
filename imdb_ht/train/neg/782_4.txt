Outside of the fact that George Lopez is a ridiculous pretense, his show is terrible. Nothing on Lopez has ever been funny. I looked up-up and never explained any resemblance to a laugh. <br /> <br /> Its thing comes across as retribution and animosity towards white people oozes from every single port in his body. <Brr /> <br /> I laughed in white man jokes from many a comedy and beloved of them. <br /> <br /> This guy has a rudge that will not end. <br /> feel bad for the Spanish who have only shown this to represent themselves. <br /> <br /> The show boards are always cooked with a Spanish accent. <br /> <br /> Grab the box in the dumbest and scene comments. <br /> <br /> Could that be why this show is still over at the 2AM replay.
