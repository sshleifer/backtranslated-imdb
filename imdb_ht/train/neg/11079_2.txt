Over the years of looking for a half-decent movie for my kids, I've developed a sixth essence for really cheesy spotting, direct-to-video really painful efforts to sit in (for anyone aged at eight) . I dropped the ball on this one and the kids spent half the movie asking me "what did he say for?" and "why did he do that?" and my eyes were hurt by rolling them every minute or so as characters did a really bad job by introducing changing seemingly random behaviors. And once someone decides that he has absolutely no skill with a sword is simply "bring realism" to a movie, please run them in with a dull butter knife. "Prehysteria!" was head and shoulder above this. Arrgh.
