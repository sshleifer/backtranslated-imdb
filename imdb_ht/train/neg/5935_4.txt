The saddest thing about this "tribute" is that almost all the musicians (including Nick Cave's incredible talent) seem to have missed the whole point where Cohen's intensity lies: does not deliver his line into a poise Almost stupid, Cohen transmits the full extent of his poetry, his irony, his all-round humanity, laughter and tears. <br /> <br /> To see some of these singer singer making complicated suffering face, launching their pathetic squeals in the patent effort called "I'm a singer!", is a true pain. It even feels the lot of you probably heard in some unusual versions of simple songs such as Lennon's "Imagine." There is nothing, simply nothing comes close to the simplicity and directly to the original. If there is a form of art that does not need embellishment, it's Cohen's art. Anbeli is thrown in the street looking like the taste of make-up of sex for sale. In this Cohen currency I found myself suffering from suffering from tribal sleep and terrible reinterpretations, all of them totally miss the ironi original of the master and, if the truth was said, several of the singers sounded as though they was recruited in some talented asylum shows. He Cohen makes a tribute to them by letting them sing his material, really, by the other way around: they may have been friends, or his daughter, he could have become very sensitive-hearted and in the mood for a gift. Too bad, it does not stay in the family. Fortunately, but only at the very end, Cohen himself made his majestic "Tower of Song", but even the blossomed blown in the totally incongruous background of the U2, all of them brought expression that bored children have when they visit poor father in the nursing home. A sad, really, and sad show if you really love Cohen as I do.
