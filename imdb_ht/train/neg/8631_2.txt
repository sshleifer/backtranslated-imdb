GOLDEN PROPERTIES: JOSTICA SAVITCH STORY <br /> <br /> Aspect ratio: 1.33: 1 <br /> <br /> Format: Stereo <br /> <br /> Bland, drama-opera dramatization of the rise and falling in the first America America TV anchor news.

A good documentary on the subject might be the best way to go. Typically strong production value in the movie conveyor belt-film film, but it's all as superficial like old fluff, and just as engaging.
