Christopher Lambert is annoying and irritating in his painting as GIDEON. This movie could have been a classic made by Lambert as well as Tom Hanks of Forrest Gump, or Dustin Hoffman as Raymond Babbitt in Man's Man, or Sean Penn as Sam Dawson in my AM SAM. <br /> <br /> Too bad because the storyline is important to us in life, the performances supported by Charlton Heston, Carroll O'Connor, Shirley Jones, Mike Connors and Shelley Winters were excellent. 3 of 10.
