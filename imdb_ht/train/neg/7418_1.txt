Oh god, what a terrible, horrible movie. There must be a comment on the state of society, it's just a reflection of the worst of the worst of television reality. Interiors hosted by Jason Jones and Don McKellar are the most regrettable parts, written in a tone that is perhaps meant to be reflective and insightful. Instead, these moments are numbing ideas as they talk to the camera and dialogue written by someone who has a love for insulting, condescending speech that shoves the "meaning" of the movie down the viewer's throat. <br /> <br /> Also, one point should be filmmaker: Long take and quiet scenes by equal art. Nor does extreme angle or logic reach the point of absurdity. <br /> If someone comes out interested in watching this movie, please do not. Seriously. Please. You have the best thing to do.
