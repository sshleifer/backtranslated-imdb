Snuggle down to your favorite chair and switch to the play station, as you send this to the garbage unit unit. Spend a useful 90 min. living your favorite game. Disjointed - sometimes filmed - non-junk. It takes a bits from several other movie films "science fiction" and seriously attempt to join the parties in a weakly efficient story. There is nothing new here, the filmmakers do not seem to realize that providing simple entertainment would achieve a monetary game, but a touch of intelligence skills and flair are required to turn it into a good movie. Any money spent watching this is a waste, and personally I would like my 90 min life back.
