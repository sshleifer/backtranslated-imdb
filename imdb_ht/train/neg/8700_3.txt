I really hope that Concorde / New Horizons did not try to make a serious horror, or even film action when they made Carnosaur 3. The movie is flat-out comic from start to finish. Even the humor of C3 is funny because it's bad. Definitely a high water mark of 'so bad it's good' genre. If you enjoy the worst of the worst, this is for you.
