I usually try to build reasonably well-reasoned criticisms of films, but I can not believe that this past the script step. The dialogue is populated, acting very hesitant, accentuates just awful, and the direction and rhythm is the best scrappy. <br /> I do not remember last time I saw a good movie this bad one. Joseph Fiennes, as nice as he is, could just have killed his career as quickly as he started. <br /> <br /> Island of Moreau doctor did not worsen than this waste.
