I can not believe how anyone can make a comedy about a problem like homelessness. Of course, Brooks has not made a comedy about _real_ homeless people. Not to mention drugs, prostitution or violence in the streets. The people we meet in this movie are homeless in Fantasy Land so the only difference between them and we are that they do not eat quite often. Brooks's films have become worse and worse over the years. This is just another nail in the coffin.
