Absolutely terrible movie. Utter waste in time. <br /> <br /> music background is so loud that you can not understand speech. Well if you really listen well, whichever talk is actually unimaginable. <br /> <br /> Work camera is bad, correction is not present, background notes give a headache, action is shoddy, the unimaginable dialogues, Actors are abysmal and well Kareena used to look like a wrestler, now read looks like a hungry wrestler. Hell you can slim down but you can not find favor. After spending three hours watching a movie I want to love, but this movie would not even allow me to enjoy it. <br /> <br /> Please, if you want to torture yourself, go ahead to watch this.
