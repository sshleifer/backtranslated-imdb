I'm sorry to all the fans, but this is a useless movie. The act is bad, even wooden, it's over-hypes fright-factor in the early, and does not exactly work. I think it was supposed to have a twist at the end, but it just ended up being maddeningly confused. What the Hell? The dude who killed everyone was one of the hunters? Try again. <br /> It is hardly original, and it's not even particularly good as a straight slasher. And this says something. <br /> I think anyone who did the half, who wrote the script, and anyone who thought about the concept should be pity to be fired and deported. this movie. If someone puts this on a party, throw the disc out of the window and put on a good horror movie, like the silence of lambs or the shining.
