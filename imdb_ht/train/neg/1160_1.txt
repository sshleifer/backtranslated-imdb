This has to be one of the worst movies I've ever seen. It is (I think) a story of a rebel college basketball player, his hard-but-just coaching, his girlfriend, and a fellow student (played by Michael Margotta) who have continuous nervous panels. The story goes now, there are zero character development, nobody in care, and performance, with the exception of Bruce Dern as the trainer, are awful. It is difficult to believe how a talent such as Jack Nicholson could lead as a horrible movie. Make sure you avoid this turkey.
