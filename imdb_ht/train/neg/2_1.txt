I saw the comment the kapsil said "big act." In my opinion, these are two great actors giving terrible performance, and zero chemistry with each other, for a great director of ever worse worries. Robert De Niro must have the most ingenious and persistent analgesic ever. Jane Jane's Jane Jane's performance is uncomfortable to cover all the cards as she clearly does not care about this character, especially because the character is so badly written. Molasses-like would be too fast an adjective for this movie's hit movie. Although the movie's intention is to be an uprising story of healing analgesics, watching it is a true "bummer." I give it 1 out of 10, really one of the worst 20 movies for my budget level I've ever seen.
