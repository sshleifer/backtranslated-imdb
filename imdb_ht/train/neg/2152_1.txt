This movie tries to be intelligent, and Tarantino-loving <br /> before you try that though, you need solid physics fundamentals. These include sound good, editing, set design etc. ... <br /> <br /> allows you to talk about the sound of this movie. absolutely atrocity. I've never been more distracted by a sound track, ever <br /> <br /> and before we talk about low budget, film made in Chile etc. allowing you to assume that these decent sounds are far more possible ever. anywhere. and more information about the available technique then ever before <br /> the sound of this movie is bad. Foley in particular is out of place and inappropriate at all, the atmosphere is even awful. I hear at least four loud clips during the movie, which is the result of poor sound editing. The sound inside car is terrible, the sound of closed car door is terrible. The sound of the singing song is wrong. Foley is either upstairs, or simply does not like the sound man just was bored and gave. space is not wrong. Everything about it is wrong <br /> and again, do not let the creativity limits get by the way, at the same time the movie tries boldly to be smart. for example the sound of the aquarium is used in the street scene. we hear sound when we do not suppose. sound edits come before visual. Every trick in the book is used, and yet the foundations are just not the <br /> correction-wise we have scenes using heavy cutting cuts, we have tinkering around with time lines etc etc. etc. All these techniques imitate with a very low standard <br /> <br /> overall the mix is ​​crap, the sound is crap. and so the movie is crap. how a film with many fundamental flaws can be considered for prizes and praise high? Cinematic new wave chilli? Best Creative Production Which Chile Has Offered? I hope not, and I do not think. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> My theory is that more selective and better Chilean talent avoids this film as the epidemic maybe due to its risk content. Equally, the film is likely to receive many unwarranted critical criticisms of so-called 'world-cinema' enthusiasts for the same reason grubby. they are lucky to revel in his trashiness. In critical film film seldom pay attention to technical details and quality <br /> this film is garbage. it's full of mouth and no pants and is never worthy of a rating 6.8. The film has all kinds of production in a cheap Tarantino, new wave inspired porn!
