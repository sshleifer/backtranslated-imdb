Oh, it's the movie - I thought I waited too long to take the dog ... I can not believe I watched all the stuff. I guess I was optimistic anticipating that he was going to get better. Horribly disjointed dialogue, pathetic action, and totally probable events. Like Toby's mother hanging herself in the time she took Col to walk upstairs and back down to a room with a 24 'ceiling and no seat, counters or anything around to stop stop it could possibly be used to ride on making himself in the little girl who played the daughter of the last family was the best actor of the whole movie, and the puppy at the first couple was a second close. The basic scenario has potential and a good script and director could seriously creepy a movie, but this version sadly is not it. I get more scared when I open my electric bill every month.
