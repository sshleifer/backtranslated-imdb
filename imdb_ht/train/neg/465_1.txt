When I was in the movie movie the other day, I spent Blond and Blonder, but something about it just seemed like she could possibly have a nice movie. What do you know? I mean, I'm sure most people stumble at Romy and Michelle before they saw it, Blond and Blonder might just have been another secret treasure that happened to them. But when I started watching it: Executive Producer Pamela Anderson, wow, I knew I was in for something scary. Not only that, but both of which were considered as the pinnacle of warm: Pam Anderson and Denise Richards, are not offended, but they have not aging well at all and are playing the role that I think they were more meant for women who are supposed to be in the 20, not 40 years. This story was just plain and obnoxious. Dee and Sunday morning are beyond your blunt stiffness, they really do not have a sign when it comes to what's happening in the world, it's just really sad. But when the girls are somehow making mistakes for killer killers, the cops are about their stories and actually call the engineering girls due to "ignorance is bliss" attitude. They set up to make a "hit" on a guy, and they think they're just going to "show him a good time", but the real killer is ticking and wants the case and kill the girls. > <br /> Denise and Pam just look very awkward on the screen and almost like reading the script the day before. I know that this was supposed to be the stupid comedian, but it was more than stupid, he was going on obnoxious and was just needed. Would I ever recommend this? Not in a million years, the girls are just at this point trying to keep their status as "sex kittens", it's more a sign of despair and blonde and blonde is a big blond BOMBshell. <br /> 1/10
