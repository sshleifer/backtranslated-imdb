Who is here talking about? I must have seen a different film than you guys. I was so bored that I walked out of the theater. What's up with this stuff. I only laugh at once and not even so hard. Anybody who believes this film should be taken out of the street and beating them. I always still find something I love in a movie, but this is crazy. "Slackers" made "by another teen movie" look like a classic. He ran up with the litter as "Body Shots", "Con Air," and "Conspiracy Theory" as one of the worst of all time. Avoid all money! I thought the studio should repay money on people as they left the theater as a sign of their apology, but they feared me that was not over. Looks like I'll never see money again or two hours.
