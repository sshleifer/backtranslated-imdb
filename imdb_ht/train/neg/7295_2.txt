First of all, the reason I give this movie 2 stars instead of 1 is because at least Peter Falk has given his usual performance as Lt. Columbo. It only can get 10 stars to try to save this attempt without losing any value in making a movie. <br /> <br /> I was initially all shot in it a commentary of a poster that Andrew Stevens in this movie gave the "performance of his career." For me, it was the sad performance by Stevens who absolutely lost this movie, and so I was all prepared to swing all sorts of insults into those who made the aforementioned comment. Then I thought myself, what else does Stevens do? So, I checked, and, you know, that person was absolutely right. In 17 years since this film was made by Kolumbo, apparently all one of the 33 projects that Stevens has ever been talking about is crap, so it is doubtful that no one even saw the rest of his career. <br /> <If you like Columbo, see each other in the 69 titles before watching this one. Make yourself a favor and save the worst for the latest.
