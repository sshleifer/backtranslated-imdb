Denzel is on the only thing that is right in this movie. <br /> <br /> Perhaps once at an early stage this was a better movie. Someone decided to cut some action and draw points at the beginning of the movie, giving away most of the story line in the first 5 minutes. This and damaging whatever builds in pace and the movie's rhythm might have been before. <br /> So first it confuses you and then it puts you there. The dramatization pushes beyond suspension of misfortune. Of course there is that feeling of great injustice and anger that movies like this potentially manage to infuse into viewers. Granted, it does so if you are looking for that ... hitting yourself out.
