* Spoilers * Some people claim that Natural Tater is designed to be brilliant criticism of the media mania and violence. But this debate ignores the current content of the movie. Oliver Stone has been able to show his serious assassins as murderers, initiating innocent people with this controversy with a morbid media passion. Instead he gave them justification. The movie shows just about every victim as someone who deserves to be hurt. Engaging in vicious stereotypes, Stone presents the victims such as unpleasant cartoons - mute rednecks, frog-English speaking immigrants, lazy people. One person who is homosexual lovbir is also a stereotype. Of course they befriend ancient, hallucinogenic-using the American - because they are trendy, dude? Let's make it an admirable character. Fat, Chinese clerks and "Hicks" are uncool, so let's make it look like worthy to die. Instead of waving, lovers who are corrupted by the demons, rampage them happier and more in love. Mickey and Mallory made their sexy and fresh and surreal visuals tied to the most impressionable people. Justice is mocking. The police and prison authorities are described as brutally, ugly and crafty compared to the GQ thieves. Again, this is not in the media reports of the movie, but in the "reality" of the movie. There is no nuances or intricacies of the film - just blocking and visual performance. The film says nothing new or specific about the obsession with violence. The evidence that the movie fails in his message lies in real real reaction to it. Some young people who saw this movie cited it as inspiration for the murder. The "message" movie is a failure because it inspires people in the opposite direction with the realm of real life. The smart message is nowhere to be seen.
