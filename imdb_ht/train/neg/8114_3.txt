... mostly because Ju-on 2 has a lot of outrageous minerals' material value literally taken straight from the first Ju-on - and when you consider that the end only runs for 76 minutes, which leaves you with 36 original minutes 'worth the movie. Ho-hum. I found that deeply disappointing - as if viewers simply would not remember the same! - Do not mention dull, have to look it all over again .. <br /> OK, that complains, the forline for Ju-on 2 was that it was supposed to explain a lot of questions unanswered from First Movie, which Frankly, about 36 minutes, simply do not go far enough to make any kind of sense of the original original storyline. There are, however, some really nice new horror sequences showing how good the movie might be, having had some time to develop; and some of the questions raised by the original - some, but not all - they respond. So, in conclusion - if you liked the original movie original and want to see some more development on the story, go for it - but just remember to keep your remote control in hand with your finger on the fast forward-forward button for forty minutes .
