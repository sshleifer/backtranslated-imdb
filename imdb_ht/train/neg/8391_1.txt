Well ... now that I know where Rob Zombie stole the title for her "House of 1,000 Crafts" crapfest, I can now rest in peace. There is nothing about the somnambulant or Script script performance that would increase the death of "House of Seven Bodies," but a grooulie ghoulie from his trail (ha!) Anyway, kill the enthusiasts without making a thunderbolt movie lease of his old stay! In Hell House (sorry, I do not remember the actual name of the residence), a bunch of mysterious, unreasonable deaths took place long ago; Some, such as Arthritic Lurch's stand-in John Carradine (with little role to give only the refreshing film time), his attribute of the supernatural; bellowing movie director John Ireland dismisses him as superstar hokum. The result is coming everywhere like "Satan's School for Girls" (titles, productions for TV values; intruding scheme) crossed with "Children should not play with dead things" (films to lease on movie makers to awaken the dead); Problem is, it's nowhere near as fun or fun. "House of Seven Corpses" is killed in one frame, and spends the rest of its 89 minutes to go into mortal rigor, dragging us together for every second blow.
