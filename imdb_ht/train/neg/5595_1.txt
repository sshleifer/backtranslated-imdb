Wow ... OK. So, after the cold here over, I decided I saw this movie for myself. This movie is horrific. I stopped watching it. I recommend cleaning a closet instead of watching this movie, you'll be more spooked / entertained. <br /> It's budget low and bad acting. is completely correct and should be neglected ... <br /> I'm not in any way connected to any of the other reviews. <br /> <br /> Simply put, this movie is not worth watching. > <br /> Very, very bad movie.
