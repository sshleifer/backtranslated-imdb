I was still a big fan of Lynda Carter-Wonder Woman so when the Sci-Fi Channel ran this movie, I saw it. I was bitterly disappointed. This is a Wonder Woman Wonder not only. It does not put right suit [it must have been denied or ordered the biggest change] and the plot runs like James Bond a poor person.There are not the things that made the heroine of comic book a success that means strength to pass normally or to determine will.It is just one long nightmare. I do not even think Cathy is all that attracted anyway. I would not waste your time on that.
