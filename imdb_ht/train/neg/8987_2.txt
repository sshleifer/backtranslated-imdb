Only the quality of redevelopment in this movie is the current scenario ... Otherwise, this movie was awful. The act was ridiculous, and the design was cheese and very tacky. The story was decent, but it was very difficult to watch due to all the unusual act. I would not recommend looking at this one ... Only the quality of recreating in this film was that the actors were a bit attracted ... Especially Ryan Bauer, the man who plays stars in soap opera. Some of the corrections have been well done, but there are continuous mistakes all over the place ... I just start getting sick and tired of watching gay movies that are bad ... Can we get a good moment?
