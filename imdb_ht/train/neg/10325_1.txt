This series just gets worse and worse. Word writing and just plain not funny! Mostly the excellent, but the inexperience of the writer is bright. Do not try so hard to offend anyone to insult everyone. Now, in the second desperate descent, they stopped lifting their arms over, and resorting to pretending, jumping, "Oh, funny" style that comes with a no-laughing script. They roll their eyes and shake their heads at each other as if they say, are not we? Is not that funny? Well, no, it's not actually. Gum disease is less painful. No wonder, with the exception of Fuel Corner, Canadians generally avoid Canadians Television. Come on your CBC you are supposed to be our leading station showing the best of Canadian talent. Pull the plug over this amusing disorder.
