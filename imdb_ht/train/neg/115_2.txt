Never throw patterns and playboy rabbits in your movie! Bob Fosse's "Star 80" on Dorothy Stratten, whom Bogdanovich was obsessed enough to marry Sister after his death in the hands of her low-life husband, is once more zombie than Dorothy herself on screen silver. Patty Hansen has no actress either .. I hope to see some sort of losing a Wells Wells chef but instead has Audrey Hepburn cavorting in jeans and a god-awful "poodlesque" hair-made .... Very disappointing ... "Moon paper" and "Show the last photo" I could look again and again. This clunker I could barely sit at once. This film was reputedly not released because of brouhaha surrounding death tawdry Ms. Strata a; I think the real reason was because it was so bad!
