Kiba Gooding Jr. is a secret service agent who blames himself on the murder of the U.S. president, I will point out straightforward that this is not the kind of role that is very talented actor noted for, and this movie shows us why. He teamed up with a persistent news reporter (Angie Harmon) to uncover the plot surrounding the death of the president, and so on, blah, blah, blah. Even with a cast of James Woods, Cuba Gooding Jr, Anne Archer and Angie Harmon 'Ends Game failed to grab your attention, plain and simple; Some of the action is good, the act is not all the bad and the story although clich√©s and ironing before could lead to a fun and enjoyable movie - well it does not! Write in the script and the direction to make absolutely sure, at any point it suck you in the story or give you the slightest thought of any of the characters. <br /> 4/10 It's boring, prevalent and dull.
