When I'm Deja Vu, I Deja Vu 'revealed last season, I was happy. Scrubs, I thought, doing something smart and unique in considering the clip-shows concept. Instead of replaying their feet, they're replaying jokes in a self-aware manner, and I really enjoyed it. <br /> I found it really unfortunate that I was wrong. A season later, they succumb to almost all sitcoms inevitably do, the clip show ... and it looked like it was put together by the work-experiment kid. Dr Cox's Dr. Jack's show just how lazy editors were in put it together, as it does not appear again until 'Long Goodbye I' some 4 episodes later. I can not imagine that a wig is extreme effort when it comes to maintaining the continuity of what was once a well-established sitcom. Who knows why it was flat, it just seemed lazy and out of place, reminding me (largely) of the episodes that have been revealed in the past year. <br /> <br /> Three clips of second jam and background music are an extra DVD for a (very) rainy day, not an episode of the first TV season.
