I saw this film on an American Airlines flight. It was so bad he actually did the flight looks longer. The plot has potential (who would not like a movie about a woman who accidentally killed all elvis Elvis she meets?), But it has gotten up a million dollars different times by really poor writing. Towards the end is an embarrassingly bad scene where a gang of Elvis impersonators is on the roof of a casino rephipping the sky thinking it will return, then a star group moves together to form a constellation "Elvis", which promptly shoots a bolt of lightning into the impersonators, send them crashing into the roof. Bad ... really bad. Which is the theme for the entire movie. I would avoid this one at all costs.
