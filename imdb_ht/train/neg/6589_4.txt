I'm afraid I do not like this movie very much. Apart from a few saving pills, it's nothing to write down at home. <br /> <br /> J-horror has shed for the past five years but the movies themselves have about more than one account being repetitive and carbon copy of a previous success. This is one of them. <br /> <br /> Basically this is a Supernatural Slasher movie. The start is promising and tight throws from a mog where a dead girl has eyes graphically sew together, but soon after you open them. However, later, he quickly descended for this movie flick. <br /> <br /> To be kind I will start with the things I love about "Gawi". On the plus side, the visuals are seawater and the movie looks great for its kind. For those who love cinemas to support their movies have a few nicely executed (no pun intended) murder scene. We also get some good suspension / set pieces suspensions. <br /> However, there are quite a few disadvantages too ... <br /> <br /> First of all, with my biggest complaint about this movie, is that the sketch jumps and jumps forwards and backwards in time and an alarming intensity. Usually it's not a problem for me, but here, where students look exactly no matter what their age, I was confused over more than one occasion. <br /> Performance is okay I guess (a little hard to say when you do not know the language), but looks like a little bit. And for a horror movie, I do not think he was scared enough. For a while I was quite bored actually. <br /> Being a fan of giallo movies, I was hoping quite a lot of "nightmares", but unfortunately I was quite disappointed.
