What do you get when you have bad acting, bad guys, excruciatly long scenes, terrible lighting, edible correction, and terrible effects? You get Jessica: A Holy Story looks like his shot on betacam, which is fine, but the lighting has complimented this medium. In this case it does not. There are a few CU where the person's face is entirely in shadow. A particular scene is the scene of the psychiatrists. It's a joke if you ask me. Some of the scenes were so long that they could easily have been cut in half ... but I guess then they would not have a feature film length. The main character is incredibly flat. He is the LEAD male, so he should have some element "hero" his character, but he does not. She whines and is scared the entire movie. I could go on, but I do not want to waste my time. Although the lighting was awful, I must say that they had nice camera movements. Too bad the lighting did not compliment it. The coverage of the DVD is beautiful, and that's where it ends. Just awful.
