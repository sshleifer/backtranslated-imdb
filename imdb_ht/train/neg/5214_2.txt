METAMORPHOSIS I am working on my way to Collection Collection Factory 50 movie packs and METAMORPHOSIS is the seventh film of the series. Published in 1990, METAMORPHOSIS looks like a rumor of the Atom Atom Vampire, which also featured a scientist to strive for similar results. Set in modern times, METAMORPHSIS is not my horror movie type. A university researcher is working to crack the human genome to create a serum that would prevent aging. Hurry by the administration to publish his papers; and, producing some results (or risk losing funding), the scientist decided to use himself as a guinea pig! At first think he suffered any negative side effects, he eventually discovered that the serum was indeed changing it in the most unexpected ways! <br /> <br /> The act is stilted; and, the performance left me with a lot of interest in the film. The note is hanging. And, the science behind the experiences and results are not just unfortunate; she absurd; it's ridiculous ?? at best. <br /> <br /> As others noted, the end came into a 30+ minute gag, which is seemingly endless. Without giving too much, I would call this one, "Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde meet Christian from the Black Lagoon to meet Home alone."
