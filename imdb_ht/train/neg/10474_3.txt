The Omega code was a cinematic inconsistency pattern. There was a bit (but costly little) in good act, primarily by the prophets and Rostenberg, who only appeared once and there was no line. Otherwise the act was decidedly bad. The plot was rather weak, and only partially based on previously questionable Bible interpretation. Certainly not one of the best years.
