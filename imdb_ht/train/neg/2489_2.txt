STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning <br /> <br /> McBain (played by Gary Busey, before the name became synonymous with Character of the Simpsons) is a (typically) unorthodox cop that gets the result but his superiors winds up something rotten. Avoid the stereotypes of his partner died at the beginning of the movie, the plot instead takes a different turn and sees him assigning to travel to Mexico where a top secret American super tank and incredible firepower and imaging ability was smuggled in only to be taken hostage, along with the crew, not a gang of terrorists. <br /> <br /> This cheap looking (even by 80s standard), boring little movie action was a rare career move for Gary Busey after making an impression as Mr. Joshua's lethal fireman in lethal weapons. She just goes to the motions with her cartoon characters here, edgy and zany as ever (and 'butthorn' being her trademark put down for the bad guys), but without the material to back her up . Henry Silva has the presence as a scary screen, but it is totally bad here as an Arab leader (in a red beret!) And the terrible script gives him some really clunky lines of dull dialogues that make his performance come off as the ridiculous wood. It is just one of a host of actor movie characters, including L.Q. Jones and Lincoln Kilpatrick, who pop up, but fail to add anything to the mix. After half a half half without much action, things are getting a bit at the end, but it's too small too late and none of it manages to work for any pleasure. *
