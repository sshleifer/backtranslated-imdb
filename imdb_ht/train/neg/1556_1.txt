I was China in this movie. I chose the Sheeba Alahani screen because I was modeled at the time of Italy and could not pronounce my real name correctly, so I chose Sheeba and then added Alahani since she looked like Alohalani. I never acted before (and shows), but it was so fun movie. They gave me "acting lesson" every morning (which obviously was not helpful). My voice was armed (salute). David and Peter were an explosion on the series, full of good humor and jokes. This film never meant to be taken seriously, it was a tax written on information inside. <br /> I give it a 1 because I have a sense of humor, but a 10 for the fun I "act" in it.
