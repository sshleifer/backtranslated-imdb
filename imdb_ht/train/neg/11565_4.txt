So far after two weeks of the "Lone of Beauty" I'm a little disappointed. <br /> <br /> Some of the good acting, as long as we except that it is only drama. /> I do not understand how people can feel that this DRAMA FICTIONAL is "real" protection in the years "Thatcher" - it's okay as drama, but I feel the awardbook is still best. <br /> <br /> <br/> I wish if the BBC will ever give you the follow and next part of the drama and the years that followed and "things can only get better" ended with 2006 and the fact that we always waiting! and promises from a full Government of Sleaze.
