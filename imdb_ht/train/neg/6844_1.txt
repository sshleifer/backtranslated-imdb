I have this copy on VHS, I think (TV Networks) should play this every year for the next twenty years. So that we do not forget what was and that we remember by making the same mistakes again. Like putting some people in the chair of the director, where they are not part. This film Rappin is like a musical vaudevillian, for those who can not sing, or act. This film is fun as trying to teach the 'blind' to drive a city bus. <br /> <br /> John Hood, (Peebles) was just out of prison and headed back to the old neighborhood. In serving time for an all-in-the-art crime in need, of course. John heads back on the old street and welcomed by old dog ladies and his comrades' home as they dance and sing all along the way. <br /> I would recommend this if I was sentimental, or if in truth someone smoked skin medication prescribed by a glaucoma doctor. Either way this is a wrong, scripted, acting and even product (I never thought I'd sit back) satir in ghetto's life and hood. Although, I think the reindeer party in the story, in the wannabe wannabe wannabe gangs and the dance numbers, her friends care about their neighbors and want to save the ghetto from being torn down and cleaned. <br /> <br /> Forget sonny spoon, Mario could have an Oscar for that in comparison to this Rap. Oh well if you find yourself wanting to laugh yourself funny and the three can be embarrassed, be sure to drink first. <br /> <br /> And please look responsible. (No stars, better luck next time!)
