Any movie that Brooke Shields out-acting a Fonda will make both an anomaly and a horror. Shields are actually only bad because it's juvenile, inexperienced, and clearly not well-directed by its co-stars. Peter Fonda is bad because, well, because he's bad. I love it in Gold Ulee, years later, but Lord above, it is terrible here. Not that anyone else is good. There is not a single performance (exterior Henry Fonda's) is the same beam. I have never seen a movie with this very bad performance. In the case of Luke Askew, the wicked man, it is clear that this is because of poor dialogue and direction, as he did good work in the past. But his partner, played by Ted Markland, is a nasty ham. Writing this is just very awful, and the actors can not be flawed for the terrible things they have to say. But they say so badly! Correct and the directions are worse than pedestrians. Vaccines are being held too long for no dramatic reasons, or cut before the impact of the stage can be achieved. This photograph was far worse than I would imagine and would have been totally forgotten (and probably never even done) without the involvement of a couple of famous names. Somewhat bright: The cinematography of the Grand Canyon is exquisite, capturing the beauty of this area in the same way as the big-screen Imax production does well. And finally: either this is a malicious version of Moon Paper, with a therapeutic pair of kind-father's daughter, or it's a bad version of Pretty Baby, and a considerably more icky romantic relationship between a forty-one stuff with a 13-year old. It suggests more of the letter than the former, and so is very disturbing.
