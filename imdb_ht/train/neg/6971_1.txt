All this garbage disorder in film stock need is Floyd Count Popping up every sixty seconds. Somehow they had Steve Railsback, Susan Anspach, John Vernon, and Joe Flaherty together on a series and could not find in five miles, about eight miles, in a current movie. BOY doing this thing sucking. There is not an original line, thought, shot, or effect from the brainless opening sequence of brainless shutdown. The magic, volatile Susan Anspach is five easy - boring pieces. Steve Railsback - raz. John Vernon - raz. The big bug - boring. If this is a scary film, Buttercream Gang is a thuglife documentary. <br /> <br /> Seriously - every bad movie has its own explanation of its bad thing. Usually it's the credit opening - "written, direct, and produced by" one guy. Or at the very center of the action are some talentless bimbos that you know have one and one reason why this turkey made. Here, you do not get out until the very last of the credits, where the cooperation on a dozen subunits of the Canadian government is grateful. <br /> <br /> Right now, I'm watching the MST take over animals in Yucca Apartments to get the taste out of my mouth. Ghod, what an improvement.
