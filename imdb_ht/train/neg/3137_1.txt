I, like many, saw this movie in the theater when it first came out '97. It was a lower average film at best, driver by the "prince" that all these "Titanic" fanboys like to make it out as. The first, DiCaprio is a terrible actor no matter how you look at it. People just like him because of his looks. Acting her "skills" essentially consist of saying a lot of cheesy lines and trying to act sexy. Secondly, the movie itself has a rather boring and simple plot: girls fall in love with guy, their boats are on sinks, lots of old love scenes after that. Anyone with an IQ above 50 will realize this is not inventive in any way whatsoever. Neither is it original. Plus the director felt the need to drag him out for 3+ hours. I could compromise it in one hour block 1 without losing any of the plot. In conclusion, "Titanic" is the movie overwhelming on date. Why he got so much attention and money is beyond me.
