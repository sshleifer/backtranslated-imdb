I'm currently watching this movie as I write this. . . If the comments "prove lack of my development as a true, artistic film maker", then so be it. . . <br /> But. . . I thought (I still think I'm actually watching) that movie. . . to put it mildly, very, very overrated. Again, very. <br /> It looks like a movie really, really bad student done by someone with more limited resources. . . and did not pay much attention to detail. <br /> I do not want to go over and over the different ways that I get this movie missing, but. . . well. . . I just do not get it (rememeber, I fully admit that maybe it's ME, idiot here - not the movie maker - for not getting this "piece of imaginative genius"). . . I rent this on a whim because the reviews were pretty, very exceptional. . . <br /> <br /> Sheesh. . .
