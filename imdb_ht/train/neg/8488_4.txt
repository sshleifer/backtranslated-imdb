Great virtual reality, computer-based potential, communication with the past, continuous struggles to express your identity to a constrained society, and captivating Ada Byron Lovelace described by Tilda Swinton captivating, this movie would be great. But it is disgusting, horrible if you consider the potential! The act - aside from Tilda Swinton and Karen Black - veers from the tolerable atrocious. The plot scheme is awkward to say the least - modern day programmer is a one-note character mat, but half the movie is spent setting up his character, and then when Ada finally appears, it is telling the events in her life, does not feature an engaging story (swinton almost pulls this off, though). You never get to know it as a real person, just an icon from the student's papers. <br /> <br /> The digital effects, such as a digital dog and birds, are lousy and distracted, consider it was 1997 and not 1985. And, finally, the script is just bad. Bad, often pretentious dialogue - especially the battle between the programmer and his companion, which made me squirm - cold and distant characters, and zero attempts to create a sense of wonder. The programmer successfully contacted someone in the past! Astonishing! But he hardly seems to surprise anyone, and his companion says, "Well, be careful." (Although we are giving no signs then or later why it might be dangerous, and it never seems to actually be dangerous.) Also, despite being computerized with Ada Lovelace and her love of math, it's clear that any person involved in the script has knowledge of math or computer - any references to the topics come across as complete jumbo mumbo that challenges any suspension of disbelief. <br /> A scene, towards the end of the film, is quite good, a monologue by Tilda Swinton expresses her sadness of vulnerability in life but her joy in this life. It seems to be falling from another movie. So I'm disappointed in this movie, because it's a missed opportunity for a fascinating little movie movie. If you find the topic interesting, you might want to rent it, but be warned. See Orlando for another, better exam role in gender roles in history and a great performance of Tilda Swinton. <br /> <br /> *** Counterfeiter / Question: * * <br /> <br /> At the end of the movie, Ada requires her memory not to be maintained (of what I thought was the best scene at the movie). But then the modern day programmer seems to do it anyway, transferring the memories of her girl (hence the title of the movie). Do I correct, the programmer violates Ada without even having difficulty? Or is it another confusion scheme that I have interpreted?
