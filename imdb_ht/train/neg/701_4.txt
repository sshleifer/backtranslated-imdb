More than Christmas breaks, a group of college friends is back behind to help prepare their don'ts to be torn and replaced by apartment buildings. To make the job a bit more difficult, a murder, psychic Chuck-set will lose the hallways in the dorm, preying on the group in various violent ways. Sign up as one of the 74 video nasties listed in the UK in the 1980s, the Dorm that Dripped has had a good reputation built before it's first seen. The 'nasty video' theme strikes in your mind some images of some explicit guides, violence, sex, etc.: All of this is a horror fan's dream. So, after hearing all these facts, I'm staying in Pranks (altitudes title) waiting for a slasher slasher experience. . . and that's what he tried to be, but failed pretty much completely. Visually, the movie is not great. Movies, Gore (except for a couple of scenes), and general direction all fail. It's simply not enjoyable to watch. The script oriented lacking and often launches random stuff without any real reason (such as opening opens). Some cool death scenes, including a beautiful pretty face (which can be seen on the poster), but that's about it for the positive. The act is very bad, the story seems to import, the killer is not cool or scary, and he suffered one major mistake that any flicker slasher should always avoid: it's a bit boring. In general, for a movie made by a UCLA movie student for $ 90,000 (which might be double today), the dorm that dripped without a total mess. She has a good couple of things, and she's just looking. . . But as a slasher cops looking to be on the movie level like the House on Sorority Rings and Pieces. . . it just can not be compared. Do not expect so much, and you can at least be entertained. I hate to tell him, but this is one of the few films I've seen that would actually be best with a remake. . . And yet, they go after great jobs like Black Christmas. Oh well. . .. <br /> <br /> Mandatory Horrors: <br /> <br /> - Submenre: Slasher <br /> <br /> - Violence / Gore: Some brutally kill cool, and Gore is okay for the most part. . . but nothing special. Also, some of the best guides were evaluated. <br /> - Sex / Nudity: There's a little unappealing (me) nudity, but not much. <br /> - Cool Assassin (s): Nah. The monologue ends (s) of the assassin made him / it is very uncool. <br /> <br /> - Heart / Suspension: A scary jump or two, but nothing is too effective. <br /> - Mystery: I suppose yes, but I simply did not care enough, and it's as obvious as the nose on the killer's face. / 10. Bah! Humbug! <br /> <br /> -AP3-
