0.5 / 10. This movie has absolutely nothing good about it. The act is among the worst I've ever seen, which is really amazing is that everyone is awful, not just a few here and there, everyone. The direction is a joke, the low budget is hopelessly evident, the note is terrible, I would not say that the movie was modified, brutally off would be a more appropriate phrase. It combines serious killings, voodoo and tarot cards. Dumb. Dumb. Dumb. It's not scary all, the special effects are hopelessly lame. bad move at all. The word was very bad. The camera is really cheap looking, and very true sometimes, and the camera-work is obnoxious. Again, that's really the movie is how many all actors are. Cheesy.
