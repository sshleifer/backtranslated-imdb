Summer vacation is the music forgotten version of Eugene O'Neill's Wilderness Wilderness and deserves that with the Broadway music adaptation to take me together. With the exception of the song Stanley Steamer, none of the other Harry Warren-Ralph Blane songs are worth remembering and even that one is questionable. <br /> It was right after the release of that movie that MGM left Mickey Rooney goes and I do not think it was a coincidence. The film was made in 1946 and released in 1948, so Mickey was 26 playing an Andy Hardy as teenager. It was just too old way for the 17 year old party that has affected radical ideas in a spirit of juvenile rebellion. Rooney made four films for MGM from 1946 to 1948, this one, Killer McCoy a rumor of Robert Taylor's A Roars mob, loves laughing at Andy Hardy with words and music. At all of them Rooney played an adult party. Even in the Andy Hardy movie, Mickey played an adult Andy Hardy back from World War II. Why it was in Louis B. Mayer this only knows. <br /> <br /> Rooney's good casting makes summer all the worst holiday because of the original Ah Wilderness emphasis is on dad's dad playing here by Walter Huston. And at the Broadway show me Alone who won a Tony award for Jackie Gleason, the big one played Brother-in-Law South Tides here played by Frank Morgan and that's the central character. <br /> <br /> Gloria DeHaven stage for Judy Garland as Rooney's sweet and adorable friend and Marilyn Maxwell play the show girl who gives Rooney an adult education. In O'Neill playing the original has it as a whore, but this was Hollywood in the Code for all Marilyn to find young Rooney Soares. A lot of people who are really talented have one hand in this one and they do their best, but Holiday Holidays Summer rather quickly in a frilly autumn.
