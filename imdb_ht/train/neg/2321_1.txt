I can not believe that this show still ratings a 9 out of 10. I could see if these votes were in the first two seasons, but what would anyone ever continue to rate it afterwards? I was a big fan of the first season. I was hooked - all the mystery, suspense, unexplained event. You never knew what would happen next. By season 2, I was still looking gloomy, but got a little frustrated that some basic things were still to be explained. And instead of giving you more answers, it just seemed like more questions. I LOVE suspense, but you have to throw a whole bone now and then keep watching. <br /> Now I can not even remember what finally turned me, but somewhere in season 2, I had enough. I'm not a big fan watching appointment - and you clearly can not miss an episode staying on what's happening. So it was not worth the effort I. <br /> It's a shame that they could not have been a little smarter and more considerate of the loyal fans. I agree with some of the posters that it appears ABC just got greedy and decided to see how long they can stretch this out show. Not to realize that in the end, they will lose more fans than they could possibly get.
