This movie actually manages to be mindless for 2/3 of the trip. Unfortunately, the movie ends up too 'confused.' While I know some of the conspiracy plots are the movie 'buddy cop' movie I've been tracing in the characters that made each other glittering fake, but at the end of the movie depends very much on sequentially chasing as a crutch and I lost interest. /> <br /> Filmists have done a great job of getting their own characters and doing their own things and getting them to see who they are and identifying with both early cops. We have formed our own opinions instead of strengthening foods to look at them in constant brike. <br /> <br /> In the end there is too much going on it he has treated so much from what might have been an enjoyable piece of escapism. Here's what about Joe Gavilan (Harrison Ford) at the end of the movie: <br /> <br /> 1. Its Real Estate Contracts 2. Its Affair with a Psychic Radio 3. It was investigated by internal affairs 4 The Homicide Investigation <br /> <br /> If you add to Casey's anxiety your fans want an actor and avenge her father's death. Now, some of these things come together and even come together well, but all the elements are drawn together in this chase pursuit which is so long and pathetic that I hardly have time to break my pet and give a crap on that that just happened. The impressive impressive acrobatics can not overcome the bad movie. <br /> <br /> As if a sequence pursued ridiculously was not enough bad, one with four separate sections and could last close to half an hour, was not bad enough, Joe Gavilan Garden calls on real estate deals while pursuing the perpetrator and a gun. All these constructive extreme-program labels and jokes make it absolutely meaningless to me whether the criminal gets caught. We have already forgotten or have no further care about the murder plot at this point because several draw-lines and eye candy in chases have been annoying us beyond all understanding. <br /> While I was able to go over on the chases and how to ruin a decent story, I will not. This could have been a very enjoyable movie formulation but it was getting too big for her upset and she returned to a redundant waste of time. Harrison Ford and Josh Hartnett actually did well with a small appearance by Gladys Knight worthless. Unfortunately none of the actors can help this movie emergency film from being forgettable. While this will probably be better than the love of the "Hulk" and "Lara Croft II" that still does not make this movie good. I heard once that Harrison Ford claimed only to make movies that eh thought would make money, I'm not sure if that's true or not. What's true is that to get big box office you do not need a big movie or a big actor, this movie is not in its lead role. My advice to Harrison Ford would be: wild Indiana Jones because at least you can still run.
