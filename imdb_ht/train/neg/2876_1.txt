I question the creators of this fictional account in the motto of the BTK Killer. Are they trying to show animal rights activists as sick monsters? Who is responsible for that? Do not they think the people involved in this monster are injured enough? What a lack of respect and exploitation of the victims! It was such a personality experience: What interrupted you more, the slaughterhouse or the human murderer? They use current names to some of the victims .... This movie was horrible, disrespectful and insulting! The creators of this movie have used this tragedy for their own agenda! People need to wake and redden the line!
