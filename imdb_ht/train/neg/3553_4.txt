The "Incubus" is a mixture of the good (an interesting murder mystery), the bad (a disconnected script, a sloppy resolution, badly made scene attacks) and weird (strong incestuous harmony, a strange scary sleep and stiffness by John Cassavetes - what character really meant to be so "wacko"?). Not nearly as offensive as it's reputed to be, but not particularly successful, either. (* 1/2)
