I watched anime but I'm not a hard death fan; and I do not read manga. I say this because many of the reviews are becoming lyrical about this movie seem to have that background. I saw "Saint John's Word," and although it is not a masterpiece of any stretch of the imagination, he has collected me "Shinobi," especially since everyone looks like it. Well, I watched it in the afternoon, and struggled very hard to keep watching. Yes, it's very nice - the scene of slow motion, the autumn leaves on the trees, even the earthquake majestic CGI. I loved the eagle, the costumes, even some of the battle scene, but in general this was dull as dirt. <br /> It seems as if someone takes "Romeo and Juliet" - the same translation mentioned by their lovers star lovers - and they cast into some "X-Men" for good measure. Two of the characters divert the Wolverine power - the guy dressed in a bear suit had his paws and the gray-haired guy had his ability to heal himself. Then you have the girl with a poison kiss - this poison ivy (from Batman). Why do these women be mute? Poisonous girls show her legs then kiss you to death. Man, this is a great power for you. And the other girl can create bugs in the yellow dust that he rubs on his hands. The other woman, one of the star lovers cross, has the power of a hypnotic fix. Wow. <br /> I sort of do it at the end of the movie, not soon send it, and saw a bit more tragedy than I expected. Some people compare this to "House of Flying Daggers" and "Heroes." Do not mistake. They may share similar terms, but that's where their similarities are finished. "Shinobi" is made by an amateur - the other films are made by an experienced cinema. <br /> I would say to avoid this movie unless you are 12 to 18 years old.
