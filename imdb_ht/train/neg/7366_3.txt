What is this F * @ # I just looked? Steven STOP !! Please! This movie is insatiable bad and funny. In a rare departure of action and adventure, Mr. Seagal is now fighting (obviously) want-to-be-vampires 'like' animals and super people. OK? Oh, with the eyes blinking sideways in an unimaginable way? Wow! Even in this film however, in awe-filled Seagals-have-to-be-the-last-punch-and-no-one-kick-kick I'm a $ $, it's somehow stronger past them. However, all the average people are getting shattered all around him. Come on, I can understand the bully of the bully or drug dealer, but these are super human forces. Oh and get this, Seagal goes to a brief poke of identity issues, because apparently he and his co-authors in the film think he is Wolverine! Oh GO I ... And Worst Than All! Yes, there is a worse than that. He has a voice on even changing voices among phrases while we are looking at his face. They obviously sounds nothing like him, I believe he can be one of the other actors in the movie. It was madness. Although I wanted to turn it around, I still watch a movie it ends. This is a never-ending bar for your direct video movie Steven. Angry! Angry! Angry! Two thumbs down! Type of reduction? Well I guess that, I'll just be in that aspect. At least some of the special effects were OK, and I like the choice of wardrobe for the actors and actresses. Women are all well-liked IMO. Still, and I said NO, it does not make up for the blatant X-Men, midi, (insert your favorite zombie, vampire movie here) Rip Off! The director, writer, producer, ALL should be bansihed & exile from the movie business. I think I feel the way most people feel about Bloody Blood (and just about all other Uwe Boll pictures) on this movie. That's all my $ 1.00 on this movie. See if you dare.
