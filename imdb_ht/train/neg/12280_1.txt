I saw one of the stage performances in Denver and never was less impressed. The word "vagina" tells it all. A body part. There is nothing shocking here. I could tell my doctor, "my left arm has hurt a bit after tennis" or "my cunt hurts after cycling" with equal or more social level. It might be the "tricep monopolists" for all the entertainment or radical comment I heard. The monologues were dull, but they were saved and drama, subjects were outdated, and I was vaguely bored and annoyed. Once I think I laugh but apparently it was not when I was supposed to. Surely this is not really a hit. Oh, and deflators: had a lesbians! - Oh, wait, maybe not, come to think of it. And proper fondling! And a crack Mama! That's about it.
