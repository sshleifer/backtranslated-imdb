When I finally had the opportunity to look at Zombies 3 (Zombie Flesheaters 2 in Europe) on an Import 2 Japanese dvd region, I was blown away by just how fun this zombie season is. The transfer is just about Immaculate, as good as it's always going to look unless Anchor Bay gets a hold of it. The gorie really stands out as it should and you can truly appreciate the excellent makeup and grooming fx.The sound is also terrific. It's only 2 channels dolby but if you have a receiver with Dolby Prologic 2, you can really appreciate the cheesy music (actually a very good score), and effective although the sound of the cheap sounds. It never sounds The sound is so good, and the excellent transfer adds to the overall fun. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />! (how come he did'nt burn the guy too), munching bowel, baby zombie and many more i lost track. <br /> This is no doubt for hardcore zombie action fans, especially in the Italian style. Some excellent set pieces and cinematography must be found, I think people do not give it enough credit, if you see a neat print, and not some copyable lurid pirates, it's a whole other whole experience. <br /> This film never allowed for a second, and I realized it's consistent plotwise, the dubbing is awful, the act is stiff, and the sense of irreverence is celebrated in grand fashion, but this is part of charm it's been. For me this is one of the best horror films ever made, you can not make a movie this bad, so good, about targets.The casual genius in the above order.It played it for its laugh would be a disaster, but played it straight as an arrow and the result is a terrific classical class that thumbs it into the nose of any and all traditional moviemaking standards. <br /> Tons of action action, exotic premises, excellent design series, charming, dummy of cinematography, cute cheesy acting, and complementary but always interesting draw, great makeup effects, beautiful women who can kick butt, excellent music, and sometimes hilarious, sometimes creepy, but always entertaining zombie.If you can go wrong with this movie, it has it all, a classic cult that stops the test of time.
