Enough enough ... sometimes they just have to stop making movies based on a long-dead concept. The first film of tremor was great. The second one was ridiculous. The third one was nauseating. The TV series was terrible depression. And this movie just drives the deeper pole. <br /> <br /> Basically another excuse for cheap computer effect and puppet, now we have the series set in the Wild West, in the 1800's, and fight graboids. Like a rehash in the first one, they have to learn how to beat them all over again. Little fun I suppose. Otherwise, this release-to-video release, just like Tomb 2 and 3, is just going way too far. Oh and I continue to ask how never have any records in these events taking place ... they just just forgot to record this unprecedented event? I think something like this would be story-making, so our pals in the first movie would not be so prepared. <br /> <br /> Movies like this the original ruin just makes me crazy. Avoid this waste.
