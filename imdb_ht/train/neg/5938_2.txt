if you did not live in the 90's or did not listen to rapper EVER !! This movie might be OK for you, but any for any fan or anyone who ever raped this movie was boring and there was no point in the movie where I said that interesting or I did not. know this. Another thing that my tool has he made it look like anything in his life he did was pretty easy there was no struggle he had to jail look easy, sell drugs, and even rapping it was not realistic. I think if the movie where delivered in about 15 years from now it might have more of a potential impact !!! Good tune in rap and cinema, get rich or dead trying not to mention
