I usually come on this website before going to the movies, as I like to see what others think of the movie. I read many reviews that said 'thriller by a horror movie'. This encourages me to give this movie a try. I really have to take issue with these statements 'suspense / horror', as it was neither! I almost go and ask for my money back, and if you have a lot of reviews enjoyed this garbage .... well you must be very happy! At the end of the movie, people behind me said loudly "what a waste of time" and I turned to and replied "I could not have summed it better". I kept waiting for something to happen ... but it was not. There was the potential for a lot of good crises (or emotions if you like), but no has happened. Williams acts partly well but I felt it was short changed by a poor script that was packing around to go nowhere. Save as money, this is a turkey that will be presented in a bargain 'DVD store' box near you in the very foreseeable future!
