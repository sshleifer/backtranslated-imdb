Check out the movie website, putting more time in doing this than writing in the script for this movie. It could not be more of it in twenty years. Original story? Originally? The script must be found tucked away from the old covenant, or legal face impact for that bit of cone-tooting. High-end special effects? Come, I could do better with a 7600 atari and a pitcher in earwax. Stylish movies? Oh yes, watch the American television home video is still a classic. I'm sure there was little money available for this title, so in the course of the sf is not really good, or somewhat bad now and then, or just plain hilarious, but it's the film-making story That's a waste of time and money. 4 stories roll in one and all of them brain bits in see-befores and make-up.
