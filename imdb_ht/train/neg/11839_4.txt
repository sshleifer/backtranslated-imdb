The "Meow Cat" has a few scenes that boost smart dialogue, with some fine performances, a few of which amazed me. Eddie Izzard is more effective than I hope Chaplin (partly thanks to an excellent hair and makeup work by some talented designer); Joanna Lumley is convincing as novelist Elinor Glyn; and Kirsten Dunst is like Marion Davies (even though movies never use real life life is difficult to explain). But these elements do not add up to a whole success. The screenwriter seems to have worked very hard on certain scenes - the meetings between Davies and Chaplin are particularly well-fabricated - but not so tough on the big picture. Several minor characters do not need to be there, and do not behave at all. The basic draw is illogic (for example, why Thomas Ince thinks it is a good idea to tell Hearst something he really does not want to hear?), And the scene of the repetitive and tiring parties. I would like to think a trip on the yacht of Hearst was more fun than the movie indicated. Davies is characterized as a standard Baby Flabper standard, which is not really accurate, and the idea of ​​the senarist on Chaplin and love are implausible. <br /> Strange, Bogdanovich, who seemed to connect to the thirties of "Moon Moon", lacking a similar attitude to the Twenties. He stressed the excellent costume designer using only black and cream, giving guests a very artificial look, and playing only the most stereotyped songs in the period (e.g., "Yes, We do not have a Bunch"). When Hearst stressed everyone "Charleston, Charleston!" It seems that if the actors had a ten-minute dance lesson just before shooting at the scene. <br /> <br /> The lives of silent movie stars can make fascinating movies, I'm sure, but not that time.
