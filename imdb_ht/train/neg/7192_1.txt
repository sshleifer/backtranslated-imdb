5 minutes from this film I was iperventilating, shaking, and writhing in pain. And it's not the right way. The story is about a kidney troubled child who calls cell phone calls into a psychic that is always a good idea. Turn out psychos do not like phone scratch appeals because within 2 minutes it is at the door to kill poor Williams and dad. Well jumping ahead 15 years and guessing what? Still screaming phone calls people. Yep you would think a terrible murder would deter them from doing that ever again but no. So, after about two hours later and too many ways my dreams ripoffs realized that this movie gave me nothing, but a terrible taste in my mouth and a serious urge to take my own life. This piece of crap is not even worth laughing in the arduous production, "acting", or Rutger haurs to reduce career. I love horror movie cinema but this is the most satisfactory piece I've ever seen. Just do not.
