Movie begins in 1840 Japan in which a man swings his wife and his girlfriend to death and commits suicide. It's a very spoiled, bloody sequence. Then it jumps to present day ... well 1982 to be precise. Ted (Edward Albert), Laura's wife (Susan George) and harassed the little kid moving to Japan for lobby's work. They rent a house and - surprise! Surprise - it's just going to be the home where the crimes have taken place! The three dead are around as ghosts (the makeup is hysterical hysteria) and makes life hell for the family. <br /> <br /> sounds OK - but it's really hopeless. There is a bloody opening and ending and does not happen in between. There is an attack by giant crab that is just uproarious! They look so fake - I swear I saw the strings pull together - and they are murmuring !!!!! There is a useless sexual sequence in the first 20 minutes (probably just to show off George's body), another one over 40 minutes later (but that was necessary to draw) and a really funny exorcism towards the end. The scene of fighting between Albert and Doug McClure must be seen to be believing. As for acting - Albert was OK as the husband and McClure were very good as a family friend. But George - as always - is terrific in a disgusting film. He gives this movie a great need - but he can not save it. I give this a 2 just for her and the opening upset and closing. That aside, this is a very boring movie.
