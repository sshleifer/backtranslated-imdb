One would think that a movie about a young person who comes to terms with his developing inverse would be anything but boring. Think again. This production should be bottled and sold as a remedy for insomnia because it's about ten times as powerful as any sleep aid on the market. It's almost as if the movie maker * counts * to make a movie, but was lazy and decided instead to run a series of random images (and randomly boring) and go-nowhere, dropping into a couple of current scenes featuring current Acting, pretending to be good lighting insignificant in the film-making process, and wrapping it under the auspices of an "arthouse" movie. This is exactly the kind of product that prevents it from making it easy for a lot of traditional film-makers to poo-poo the independent film movement, and which holds the general public from easier to film independent movies. You're interested in films covering this topic, you'd better do the tuning of some of the great short films available on the Logo or Renting Real Estate website. Better yet, it's Stone Butch Blues. Whatever you do, skip this long windy piece of drak.
