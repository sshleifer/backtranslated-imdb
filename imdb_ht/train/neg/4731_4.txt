A half-intentioned attempt to bring Elvis Presley into the modern day, but despite a small shower shower show little with a pseudo-playboy magazine subplot, Presley is surrounded by the same old Koy, Clone Clone. A woman chooses e.P. up on the beach and then the proceeds take on his life - and it does not seem to care! Dick Sargent is grueling in another framing, but Don Porter and Rudy Vallee (!) Try hard as Elvis' from the boss (it's Moonlighting, you see). Some of the songs are quite good, especially "Almost in Love", but if you want to see a looser, hipper, updated Elvis sex-comedy - look elsewhere. When Elvis and his Fatal Attraction come in bed together, there is actually a wooden board in between them! Find real. ** from ****
