Well this 90 minute in my life I will not get back. This film featured television shows "California Dreams" look like "Almost Famous". The act was seized with unrealistic scenarios. Not even finding I started on the current band at the forefront of this story, lame singing, watch etc. You believed that they were one of the hottest bands in the country, and there was not enough irony in the world to accept that one. The guitarist is seen to be a heroin user, is not I blame him, if I've been around as a lot of putrid and snooping songs and wooden act I should inject the horse too. <br /> <br /> If you take music remotely seriously, avoid this at all costs.
