1st look 8/26/2001 - 3 out of 10 (Dirty Tobe Hooper): Scary, yet sadistic (meaningful) paints in a family of the Marquis De Sade carry out the same sadistic acts and enjoy it supposedly his predecessor did. This film Hoobe Hooper really does not make a whole lot different than it's Freddy Krueger's movie and the same star (Freddy himself - Robert Englund) plays a double role (Marquis De Sade and his family). It also looks like it really wants to poke into Christianity, but then loses it to the very end of my troubles, but leaves an inconsistency of the movie. Maybe they were worse if the excesses were taken into sex and violence, but they tried to keep that in a minimalist despite some lousy scenes. My final thought was why Hooper wanted to make this movie. He obviously took a while to get distributed, then he had to publish Gruesomely and Hooper's name in the title to hopefully make some money on his name and gore it. It's obvious this did not work.
