I understand wanting to make a movie that is noble and different. I understand the comments before reviewing that this is a missing-understand movie. My point is as soon as this movie ended my first comment: "this is what happens when a rich princess wants to make a movie star and he has no talent" ..... he uses money The father made a movie he wrote, directed, and paid for ..... obviously close to the movie realized there was no character development and no direction as a start, middle and ending ... The rubber part was good and noble, but what was the point? I saw a woman go to a house, get some pictures, the caretaker, out on a very cold night (not credible) to check on noise and run on her caring lover. ..... as an educated arss ignorant me? I really want to know which point is .... what was the vision manager ..... why no development of the lover died? Why is there no background on the caretaker? What is the night vision vision? Which point in the lipstick on the car? Why does a caring person die? Why tell us about a mental patient / peeping tom? What's with the urn? Oh and the lamp is supposed to mean that 'this house is? Territory? Why? Why does the caretaker want to read her home? that aspect has never been pursued ...... as for William Defoe ... I rent this movie because it was in it and she knows for orchestra characters ..... write back and tell me what I need learn .. .. i'm just a mom among America who loves film .... Chris ....
