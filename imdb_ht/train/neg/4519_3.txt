Three Stooges - Rocket Rockets, Will Travel - 1959 This film was the longest star feature of Stooges' first star and it is very bad. It makes three grounds to go into the world of a DAZE (from 1963) look like a masterpiece. <br /> <br /> Stooges are rocky in a rocket place. They boarded a rocket and went to Venus. They encounter some things that include a fight like the bulls called "Uni" which are brought back to Earth with them. "Uni" speaks as an average, handsome person - 'Oh, hello. How are you? Lovely planet here. Hope you like it. ' Hilarious. <br /> <br /> Very few gags and lots of scenes are just going on and over and over. <br /> <br /> Stooges are coming back from space and the movie is about as far away as history, but no one said that in the film makers for the photo will continue for another 10 minutes or so in a part where there is nothing much happening. Stoog left the party and then the movie is almost over. Higher point in the movie - the end of which Stooges sing a little dapper song on their journey. Larry and Curly Joe hit the MOE in the face and two pi. Brital. Another writer mentioned fine music. Huh? The only music I even noticed is of classic melody - I'm going to take romance and have to go that song again, both of which are played on the party. And * that * really is the high point of the picture - music from old Columbia movie. The sexy blonde sexy was beautiful. 99 cents are only stores.
