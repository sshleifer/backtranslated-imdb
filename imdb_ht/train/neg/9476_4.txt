Pretty crazy whodunit featuring an all black cast trying to figure out who had murdered the key trumpet player who was just about to go to Hollywood to make it big. Was it his wife? His girlfriend? Should she be-girlfriend? His father? Butler l '? The newspaper guy? What do you know? And who cares? This result is just a little underwhelming, and the actors here do not really find me in an attitude of care one way or another to get out. Why is vein snake as a weapon? What do you know? Who cares? The music of this is okay, but there's little of it, and most of it is nice "let's get this on and" This is not worth the time. There are best-all-black casting movies out there.
