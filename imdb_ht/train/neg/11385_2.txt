Before I begin, let me say that my experience in this movie may have been influenced by the dubbing, which I picked up from other comments was the original one considered to be inferior by some. So it is entirely possible that subtitles or versions of DVD apparently would make a difference. I have not read the corresponding book; I am only familiar with another Japanese manga and may miss cultural context. <br /> <br /> I also love gently tinged science fiction stories (the likes of Army Rider, 12 monkeys, etc.), but I did not enjoy this movie at all. While it started out mildly intriguing, it became tired by the time it was only half way off. There are all kinds of problems; Let's start with what's probably the worst: the dialogue. The characters seem to be able to formulate sentences; If they do not mention each other for the time n-th, they usually grunting monosyllables ("Kanedaaa!", "Tetsuoooo!", "Huh?", "Grrr", etc.). This leaves most of the characters totally underdeveloped with two dimensions. It does not help at least that many of them find only a few minutes of screen time without anything interesting to say that would develop them away from the stereotypes suggested by the visuals. <br /> <br /> The grunting is increased by some random pseudo-philosophical technobabble that sounds vague and unenspirated even by standard Star Trek. There is nothing deep and meaningful here - it all looks haphazard, dropping along at random from various bits and pieces of stock Sci-stock stock with no coherency whatsoever. <br /> <br /> What little has to be in an intelligent scheme is no more than an excuse to begin the ultimate soul sequence including scenes of scrambling through destruction and destruction. Not that there is anything wrong with a pretty bit of destruction and destruction, of course; but in this case you will find yourself asking "what's the point of it all, and how long until it's over." Character development in the past 30 minutes or that consists of little more than Tetsuo turning to the Pizza Hutt so there is no reason to be clear. <br /> <br /> The finish looks like the one in 2001 - a bold string of images that, far from solving or explaining anything, leaving the feeling of viewer it just was looking at a kaleidoscope for two hours time. I'm sure some will claim that this sort of thing is art; but to me it was just a lot of imaginative admiration for use of color and shape. (Some of the music was also very interesting). Unfortunately it's all style and no substance. <br /> <br /> Tired of Disney? Want to watch anime movies cunning and term "adult"? I'm sad to say you're more likely to get that sort of stuff from "South Park".
