This movie was so enrelentingly bad, I could believe I watched it. LED, editing, production, and script all seemed as if they were made to high school students who do not know all that much about movies. There was no narrative leak that did any sort of sense. Huge emotional moments and climaks (as early as between Heath Ledger and Naomi Watts) and character relationships (as one hint at the very beginning) comes completely out of nowhere and does not set up as they would a much more darling and effectively made films. Characters are unfortunately underdeveloped, making it difficult for us to have any sort of connection with them. The act, surprising, is not totally bad, but the terrible writing cancels out their performance relatively convincing. The movie plays like a T.V. particularly bad west / season, and sadly reducing the fascinating (true) story that it tries to say. I read a lot of reviews that defend the film being important to Australians because of the subject. That's all pretty well, but just because Ned Kelly is an important iconic Austrian historian does not make the movie good. No one says that the matter is not good, just the quality of the movie itself. Pearl Harbor was on a very historic American event, but this does not mean I will defend the movie and say it was good, because it was still bad. A failure all around, though Heath and Orlando are beautiful to look at.
