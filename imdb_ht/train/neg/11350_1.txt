As long as there was 3D technology, (1950 I thought) there was an animation made for it. I remember especially, a cartoon Donald Duck and Chip and Dale in it. I do not remember the name at this time, but the draw was that Donald worked in a circus, he nurtured an elephant peanut and Chip and Dale stole the peanuts. This was probably the 1960's look at the 1960s. If you've seen Robinsons meet in 3D in theaters, this cartoon has been shown before the movie and explains details of its origins. There are probably somewhere around 100 designs designed specifically to be seen in 3D glasses. This claim was a bad move because it was not difficult to prove wrong. On top of that, this just looks like a bad movie.
