Never before have a movie my drive to write a review but this was just a long time.I stuck with it trying to find out what it was about this movie that made snoop pick it as his first major role but frankly it was a poor choices.Maybe this did a good book but it certainly did not work for me as a movie.i found it incredible, lacking atmosphere and I found lots of scenes of awiting stilted.a maestro music it may be but a serious actor snoop ain't.the act by Dylan mcdermott and lift berth was pierced, but not enough to bring a weak scheme with weak dialogue. Maybe I was just totally missed the point, but for me it did not fit into any genre, he did not elit any sympathy with the characters, nor did he create any suspense, in fact I found myself praying for the end and quelling a deep desire to calm down all the three main characters!
