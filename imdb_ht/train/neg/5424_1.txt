Miwa. Mirror (1990) is a flat film from lame. Why did I watch movies like this when I was younger? What do you know? Perhaps I was one to punish myself by watching a horrible movie after another. I do not know, I guess I need a pleasure during my teenage years. A young outcast (Rainbow Harvest) seeks consciousness in an old mirror. Soon she learns about the terrible antique ice cream that has and uses it to strike out against her who was wrong. Movies like these, the giver may have a nasty side effect. This one changes it inside and out if he likes it or not. <br /> A mess in a movie that for some reason has been restored on d.v.d. a few years back. I do not know why. They should leave it on the shelf and collect dust. People love the curtains for some reason. If you do, I would like to know why. Until then, I have this movie and I have no reason to look it over again. <br /> <br /> Do not recommend all.
