Mark Pirro at "Deathrow Gameshow" in 1987 is a very comedy black cheese in many parts, but sometimes very funny anyway. This movie might certainly have been a lot better, the act is terrible, and some very cheesy scenes make it hard to look at times, but the concept is funny, and it has some hilarious moments. The next night (1991's), games show changing. Chuck Todean (John Mc Cafferty) hosts a game called "Live Or Die", in which prison death row prisoner has the chance to play for life and for money. Candidates who fail, get executed in the air using many different methods, such as guillotines, electric chairs, and other, the most bizarre device of execution, followed by excitement at the cheerful studio audience. The show is, of course, much more than controversial, and Chuck made many of the enemies ... <br /> <br /> "Deathrow Gameshow" is incredibly cheesy and disabled in many ways, and the act is terrible but It is undoubtedly fun in many parts, especially if you are a fan of black humor. You have not missed anything if you have not seen it, but it is definitely funny and a good time toning. 4/10
