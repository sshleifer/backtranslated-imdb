My title would be enough. <br /> It abused me that such culture is rich in literary excellence (Dumas, Flaubert, Balzac, Maupassant) would churn these tosh as the "wave movement" cinematic movement. Up to the 20th century, France had a great tradition of linguistic arts and smart philosophy. But the minute you give them a movie camera to start acting like WOOOHOOO LOOK HOW WEIRD I CAN! PLOT? Theme? PSHAW! LET'S FILM a fun PARK RIDE GO ROUND & ROUND! At least this is not as bad as Godard (with an unhealthy passion and the heads of the people '. Oh-la-la, of artiste.). No, Truffaut holds a clear visual degree. But so the camera is securely in a quickie-mart. The two are confused. <br /> Haha, as a sidewalk throughout you must movie nerds school: I bet the vein is popping out the side of your neck now. But do not leave without reading the last sentence of my review. <br /> <br /> Anyway, if you like French literature, you'll hATE this. People who love this movie probably never read any books other than the ramblings of Jack Kerouac or perhaps "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy". Or maybe they have read the lyrics of the Doors songs, and they think that in depth move. Whatever float boat yer. I find it ironic that this film injects some (weak) Balzac alerts, one of the finest and most sensitive writers ever to live. Nice to try, Truffles. But you are nowhere near the boulpark. <br /> Avoid this movie as an AIDS-infected syringe. <br /> <br /> If you are the kind of person who likes to think, then stick to Jean Cocteau (ORPHEE), Robert Bresson (PICKPOCKET) and Japanese Kurosawa (IKURU), Kobayashi (KAIDAN) and Teshigahara (SUNA NON ONNA). <br /> If you are a fool, enjoy Truffaut, Godard, and Andy Worhol. And for the sake of pushing back wounds back to your neck. You look like a cabbage.
