Richie's good guys movie guy (not counting God-awful "sweat away" is an active thriller of traders involving gambling, gangsters and failures. Fans of Richie's previous efforts will probably hate revolvers just as I did, and torsion it Richie emulated Jason Statham plays Jake, a new-release former con, from revenge revenge on the ridiculously named Dorothy Macha (a superbly OTT Ray Liotta) but instead gets incredible with a couple of other disadvantages, one of which is Andrew 3000 out of Outkast Rapper Outfit) that drove it with us the audience, a number of red erasers throughout the movie, all of which become very tedious .The high point of this mess in a movie is bit in the restaurant, where the dialogue turns down in favor of a superbly shot, shot-slow-word set at Beethoven's Sonata Moonlight. In all, revolver is an undeserved work, not really horrible, but far from the best Richie's .. That Would Always Lock, Stock If this movie was a duty homework it would be grady and 'try harder!'
