The "Year of Growth" is a film adapted to an e-novel by Singapore writer Catherine Lim, who became the first Singapore novel / novel to be sold online. The film had a post-production posture torture: early injection 2005, she was looking for release at the end of 2005, but only turning up 3 years later, on February 29, 2008, a year of growth. <br /> <Before I say anything, I must first admit I have no fan of the genre romance, so I can slightly partased against this movie - I watch it simply because it was a Singapore production, and that it is available for borrowers in my neighborhood library. Here's my two cents on the movie. <br /> Let's just begin by saying that other than Qi Yu-wu's KS and Wong Li-Lin, everyone here in note seems to have an Eurasian. The Love Interest is a Eurasian (Ananda Everingham), and the Trio Wong of the Amy All, er-em, Eurasians. Is this movie perpetrated the stereotype that fell in love and associated with the Eurasians have more "in" than the Chinese Common (or whatever Asian race are you?) I do not know, it's sure looks like. Also, everyone in the movie speaks of some mystical "angled" accents that do not exist anywhere, certainly not in Singapore. It's kind of "semi-perfect English" that authorities would like us to talk, but that does not exist anywhere outside, say, the MTV Channel. The effect is that the dialogue of the film sounds forced and stilted, not helped by the lack of true-blue Singapore at the disposal. <br /> <br /> The scriptwriter seems to be trying too hard one-lithium string that after one-piece material. After twenty minutes, the "understanding" of the movie starts pall and the movie starts to serve up its normal plate of clich√©s. <br /> <br /> I think I did not enjoy the movie because the whole quote of sustaining a love affair about 16 years long looks incredible. <br /> <br /> There are other incredulity of the movie. I can not believe that KS (played by Qi Yu-wu) would fall for one of Wong's girlfriends. And the scene where the bridegroom says, "Go before I change my mind," which was used in a hundred Eastern Asian (Korean, Chinese, Hong Kong, Taiwan etc.) TV series ... , 4 stars for this movie. Production value is just, and Wong Li-Lin tries to best, but it does not help in the script. Joan Chen has a 15-minute movie party like Wong older and maybe the best actress of many, but hey, her role is just to came. <br /> <br /> If you come across all the "Years of the Year" in the rental or library, you may want to pop it in the DVD player for the sake of curiosity, but otherwise, for those who do not exactly enjoy The genre of romance, you can decide if you do not give it a miss.
