I can not say much about this movie. I think he or she speaks for himself (as does the current assessments here). I rent this about two years ago and I totally regret it. I even tried / loved it by watching it twice, but I just could not. I can safely say that I have absolutely no desire to see this waste of time, ever again. And I'm not one of the movie's films, but I'm really convinced that this was awful. It was not even funny at the slightest. The only bits I enjoyed were the few scenes with Christopher Walken in them. I think that this movie has lost both Jack Black and Ben Stiller for me. All I can think about when I see one of the movie-a-day movies is terrible and it reminds me not to waste my money. Amy Poehler is so annoying, too. <br /> Overall, well, I think you get my point. The stars are for Walken, by the way.
