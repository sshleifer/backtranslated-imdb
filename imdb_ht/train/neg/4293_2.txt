The "Rainmaker" released in 1956 - some of the finest actors in its time. Katharine Hepburn, Lloyd Bridges, and Burt Lancaster being the leading players. Not even can they save this completely on ajude melodrama. First of all, Hepburn is horribly miscasted as a shy spinster - despite its brightness as an actress, not even he can pull it off. It is too strong to be credible as being this much of a simpleton, and it was just too old for the party. Lancaster on the extreme act, and Earl Holliman is way too empire and comes in more like Jetro Clampett. Only the bridge with Wendell Corey's reliable time seems to rise above the throw in a bit - but even they can only do a lot. It looks like 1950 was a time when Katharine Hepburn wanted to spread her wings a bit as an actress, and that's fine. She just made a bad choice here. Fortunately for his fans (I was in the middle) he did not do too much of them. Despite an A-cast cast and good production value, it does not work.
