I read some comment on the internet about this movie as "... then harder then hostel ...", "the camera never screens when it's getting really brutal ...". But none of them are true. The camera is never in the screen, because there's nothing in the screen. The same scene is repeated hundreds and hundreds of times. Female lies on a table, killer violates women a few times, killer cuts women into pieces (you never see that during the whole movie!). Police came and arrested him. Assassins sort the jury. Movie about. In Germany we might say, "Many hear about Nothing". All in all, one of my boring films I've ever seen. Absolutely non-referential.
