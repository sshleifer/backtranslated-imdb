"Paula, I can be a bitch, but I'll never be a butcher!" <br /> A hilarious line of a smell rather spongy fruit that features a beautiful honey in Stacey Walker, but that's all about. This gal is a real tease that attracts his boyfriends, co-workers and even his wife Paula roommate in his room, but then turns into a cut job that cries "rape" and calls for the police! This scholarly personality is certified c ** t interesting for perhaps a while, but this story finally becomes a real repetitive one-note affair. At least the end is worth the wait, for those who will always take care of this time.
