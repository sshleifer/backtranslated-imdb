It has a great name, but that's it and you'll get more than that for your money, in fact the first 30-40min of the movie you might find it some kind of funny but after that the story goes from one The only side of another and there is no particular reason and you just can not understand what happens until the action goes. <br /> But the producers (Roberto Angel Salcedo) call it an actor, but I do not think it can call nothing but overacting !! .... period. The little kid who plays as his son has totally no sense of acting and I believe he was just a favor he did or something because he had no signs of what he did. <br /> For some reason while doing the casting they thought that by casting the comedians could do it, but they did not !! and sometimes the good humor humor humor is so bad, I do not buy it. But hopefully this is as bad as it gets. To make people accept these DVDs to the delicious public will have to offer some foods to it, which would work out. <br /> <br /> Maka
