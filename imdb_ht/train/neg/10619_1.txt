... but a disgusting movie. As Maltin says this Christopher Lee's attempt was made a serious horror movie. Well, it's serious ... TOO serious! The plot is funny and slow (something about old people reside in the young children to realize immortality) ... The movie is all talking pale talking pale talk speak pale talking talk about the same things over and over again. I'm actually dozage at a few times! This movie is sooooo mat! Sleep is thrown at this with the sole exceptions of Peter Cushing and Lee ... but this was probably a work of love for both (they often complained about horror movies were too violent ... well, this does not have no violence!). Avoid all costs ... unless you have insomnia ... this will put you in sleep!
