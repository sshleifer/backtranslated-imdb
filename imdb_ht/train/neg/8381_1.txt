There are some very talented black director Spike Lee, Carl Franklin, Billy Dukes, Denzel and a host of others who carry well worthy credit in the movie industry. Then there are Brother Wayans who at one time (15, years ago) had a very funny TV show in Living Living that launched Jim Carrey's career among others. Now we have to sort replacement for humor and gross out gag (humor humor) as the standard operating procedure. People are not as stupid as those described in 'Little Man' could not possibly be. A baby with a full set of teeth and a tattoo accepted as being only month old? Baby comes with a five five shadows that she shakes. She suggests that the baby has sex with her foster mother behind her husband, Darryl, back .Oh, yes that is just hilarious. As a criminal 'Little Man' criminal is the stupidest on earth planet. She stashes a stealing stone that is just great in a woman's purse and then has to pursue her. Co-star Chazz Palminteri, why Chazz, offers the best line: "I am surrounded by morons." Based on, without credit, on a cartoon Chuck Jones, baby buggy bunny. This is far too stupid to be even remotely funny. A sign of how bad this movie is Damon Wayans appears on Jay Leno at night, before the BAT award and he did not even mention the movie that is objectionable. When Hollywood will stop littering garbage collection from the Bravery Brothers. When found on white pants are all likely.
