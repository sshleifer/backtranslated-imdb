"Extreme Makeover: Home Edition" is yet another 'feel-goody', so called 'hearty', and out-of-the-show shows that ABC has time to put together. Understand the difficulties experienced by these families. For this, I'm sorry. But you would not think that placing four TV plasma wide screen, three screen screen screen computer, an inground pool taking half of a yard, and the full wardrobe of expensive designer clothes is a too much too much BIT for any family? Sure, these families were in great abundance. But honestly, the things that Ty Pennington and the crew put in these homes are enough to follow a whole neighborhood. <br /> <br> / Another thing that really crack me on this show is how Ty and her crew still have something good to say about all the little things related to the family, or family requirements. Tell a wheelchair that it is 'so strong', or 'very brave' really get old after a while. It can sound rude, but believe me; See this show, and you'll see what I mean. <br /> At all, this is overrated. If you want to look it up, go ahead. This comment is just a top-up for what you should look like.
