My Favorite Party was when credit began to roll. I wish I could give it a .0000000000001 from 10. I really wish I had Time and thirty minutes back. Do not waste your money or time on it. I really could look grass grow and felt better after wards. Nadia was really nice and I hope the movie did not destroy her career. But he chose to be in it. All in all it sucked more than any other movie was sucked. More than Kazaam and glitter combine. This says something. <br /> <br /> not <br /> <br /> is it !!!!
