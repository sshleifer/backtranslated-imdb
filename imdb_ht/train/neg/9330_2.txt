This film has recently been seen and has had much hope. Not so much based on the director, which has not made a previous Cinematography release, but more based on its cast. Harvey Keitel, Scott Glenn and Craig Wasson (lead roles in Double Body, a Brian De Palma chief) have all starred in great movies. Not together though, and this fact has not exactly changed because of this one. The film is incredible, very predictable and clich√©. The only thing that could make it a little appealing is the selection of places on which it was shot. In my humble opinion: do not waste your time on this one.
