Wow and I thought that any movie Steven Segal was bad. Every time I thought that the movie could not get worse it proved to be wrong. The story was good but the actors could not carry it. Also, a lot of errors have been made about how proper archiological searches are done. For example you do not handle artifacts as long as they are cataloged and matured. The biggest crime in casting was the archiologist girl. She is a weak actress and I felt that she really did make the film less realistic then she was already. The whole concept of the jittery storm was all year long seemed very stupid to me. I love the idea of ​​how they disappear and other things, so that almost seemed depressing. I thought that the characters wern't explained quite enough. You did not get much background and what made it harder to relate to them.
