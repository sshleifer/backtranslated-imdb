Maybe you should not compare, but Wild Style and Style Wars are the original Hip Hop. Bat Street has a lot of original artists at Hip Hop early, but they obviously made it clear that this would be great breaks, of course for some it was and that's nice. But if you see this as the original Hip Hop Culture you're wrong. It's too much product and has a Hollywood sauce. Instead look for the first two cinemas I mentioned. They have transmitted the life-threatening life of the ghetto. Yes, the rating for this movie is low, but reviews are mostly positive or even gorgeous. This is probably because although the story, acting, dialogue and direction all are horrible, the music and dancing are what the people love about it. Me, I love the dance but at the moment thought that electro was the death of Hip Hop (I was so happy when round '86 a new generation of Hip Hop Classics now appeared, like Krs One, Public Enemies, Ultramagnetic Mc The Jungle, Bizmarkie in the name of a few), and I still do not like most of the beats in this movie and therefore it does not work for me. I mean, Wild Style does not have much of a story but the music is great and authentic. Of course different tastes and that's okay. But as far as I'm concerned, this movie is garbage except for dancing to rest with some of the music and so I can not rate it higher than a 4 out of ten.
