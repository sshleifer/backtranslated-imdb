Seeing a picture of a man being attacked by zombies gave me hope that Lucio "Zombi" Fulci could be up to his old tricks. Unfortunately, other than the UPS closed off a rotten corpse, the little has to be recommended in this story of the assassination of a rich man and his daughter's quest to figure out who killed him. None of the characters are appealing and not the time you find out how to do it (which twist, at least, cool), you stop taking care of. The only good thing I can say is that it makes sense more than nightmare concert!
