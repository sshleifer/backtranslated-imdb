This collection really sucks! <br /> I rent it, thinking I would really enjoy some good fight. This man sucks! Quick cuts flashy, a very annoying speaker, and the battles themselves were heavily edited and shortened (I think especially of Jet Li's fights to the legendary point and Jackie Chan's fight from drunken meters 2). <Brr /> <br /> And what's the deal with these brawling streetwighters? What is "cool" about that? I saw more exciting fights on Martial Laws! <br /> This is a stupid collection of cuts for stupid people. <br /> Never buy this movie! Do not encourage those who did this crap to do more in this crap! <br /> Rather, go buy the movie The Battle was from and Wath the battles of their uncut glory!
