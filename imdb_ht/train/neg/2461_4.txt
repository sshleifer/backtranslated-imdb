There are probably more people scared the dentist than in, let's say, little monsters or dolls dolls. Which makes it a perfect topic for a horror movie, really. <br /> <br /> Feinstone (Corbin Bernsen) has been a successful dentist for many years now, but when he catches his wife coping with him and the poolguy she binds, and brings her anger and frustration to her work. Well, give a dental dentist an exercise and a mouth, and you can probably guess what's happening next ... <br /> <br /> As I said, bright ideas, but not released as well as it would must. In particular finish is a big down. Last note: look for Mark Ruffalo (You can count on me, Sunshine Eternal ...) in this one.
