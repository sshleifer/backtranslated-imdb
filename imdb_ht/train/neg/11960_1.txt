I actually retired from Asian horror movies some time ago after becoming completely ill in seeing gossip history. However, I got more and more of flick exploits lately, and so decided to give them another chance. My first port has been named very rated director Takashi Miike highly rated 'Visitors Q'. I'd already seen Audition, and while I did not like it so much, I miss it as one of the best modern Asian horror films. So I entered this with tender expectations; and unfortunately, they found only boredom. I think that this movie is actually really smart and it just went on my head, but that it seemed like I was simply a collection of violent and embarrassing scenes with little or no interconnections between them. Any comparison of the work of Luis Bunuel and David Lynch is blasphemous as far as I'm concerned; all Miike made here is making a movie; Any intelligence that surrounds it has been implemented by fanatics, desperate to gain some kind of meaning. My head scarcely put in about 10 minutes (after a father had sex with her daughter for some reason), and did not diminish until the movie finally ended; at least twenty four hours later, or so it would look like. Do not get me wrong, I'm not against violence in movies and in fact actively looking for the most notorious movie around; but while this might be violent, it's also meaningless and boring and I did not get one ounce of fun out of it. Takashi Miike can have a lot of fans, but I certainly not one of them; and I certainly hope this is the last time I will come into contact with one of his films.
