Not sure why this movie was released as a wild, original, laughing comedy. There is not much of this movie that will entertain or entertain the movie. Annette Bening (who has been known to have been Oscar deserved) from here as accustomed to, and his performance routine looks like. Brian Cox's character is confusing and irritating, and the play play Augusten ?? Joseph Cross? It simply does not have the personality to take his role. The best thing about the movie is Evan Rachel Wood, but it's not enough to endorse this boring, movie theater. The film disappears quickly and looks good. I found some of the unpleasant scenes (the scene with Brian Cox and just used her toilet rival some of the worst scenes in 'You and Everyone You Know' with the 'Squid and the Whale'), some nasty, and most of them are disturbing. I found the experience of a waste of time. Do not waste your time?
