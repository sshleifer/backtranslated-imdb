This movie movie was in the right place, no matter where its brains were. <br /> <br /> "Attack" is basically a parody of a "plane!" (two years before the fact - nice going.) That happens when vegetables, or in this case fruits, assaults. <br /> Through all kinds of magic films (suspended movement, paper-market tomatoes on skateboards, reversing filming, people watching tomato tomatoes, those who throw basketball-sized tomatoes on the screen), the tomatoes really attack all in the green apple. <br /> Then it's up to Mason Dixon (Miller) and a spy group I would not want on any government's side to save the day. Of course, there is a mediator (Taylor) reporter who pops in the worst moment, dances and songs of Army Soldiers, Japanese scientists and armed-in voices, some guys dragging around a parachute with a samurai sword ... and oh yeah, The bloody Diego chicken before he made it big. <br /> The gags here are not all that great. In fact, you might probably do better yourself after watching these. Some of the dialogue is unnecessary bad ("Please pass the tomato sauce" - not something to say in front of tomatoes.) And as far as "Love Puberty" goes ... well, I can not blame the tomatoes for shriveling up about hearing it. <br /> <br /> What's good about it? Well, I loved singing this theme with the early credit, and there was a scene with four people on the phone at once that was very well executed. ... that's about it. <br /> Three stars. It's not a "killer" comedy, but it tries. <br /> <br /> Rock on, peaceful.
