James Gandolfini is a good actor so that ever he took a role in this piece of unfunny waste. Affleck is just a lightweight that just can not cut it, the rest of the cast is really unforgettable. I saw this in the USA in an empty theater, I soon knew why the place was empty after about 10 minutes. I walked out before the end it was so bad, so imagine my surprise when back to England I saw the movie had a glowing report from kio "Paul Ross" on one of Sunday's walk down. I always count on Ross to save me money on movie tickets, if it says the movie is good, I get straight to many websites to check it out. This movie should go straight to Â£ 1.99 dvd in a supermarket near you.
