Wow ... <br /> I chose this up at the Wal-Mart local after reading online that she had released early. I followed this online for some time, and just had to buy the movie. <br /> <br /> Wow ... <br /> <br /> I guess the thing that really hit me was the correction, or lack thereof. Time and again, characters (usually the Narrator and those it is and are) to show markets ... and market ... and market. I'm not an editor, but I know that you can cut off someone leaving point A to show up to point B. There is no need to show nearly the entire trip! Wow ... <br /> I actually ended feeling a bit sorry for the actors involved in this. They seem to have given no direction on what to do during other scenes than to look awesome or look happy, depending on what action they should add to a later date. <br /> <br /> Wow ... Why it was decided to make almost all the effects using CG is beyond me. Even ILM always employs miniaturization at times. One of the most distracted uses of green screens in this film is the constant noise of (according to the credit ends) the same group of people representing the citizen in different towns and cities, including London. At these popular times are coming and go with no consideration as the angle of the shot or the distance from the camera. In one shot in London, there appears to be at least two men on six feet high just behind the narrator's costume (played by Anthony Piana star without his mustache). Not since Gettysburg I've seen such a piece of fake facial hair. <br /> <br /> Why Timothy Hines spoke this movie as he did is beyond me. It is a turkey, plain and simple. On the plus side (at least for me) it gave some of the most genuine laugh-out-loud bits of hilarity I've seen in quite a while.
