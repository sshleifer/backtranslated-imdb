To tell Funky Forest: The first contact is a bad movie is an understatement of incredible proportions. I can really enter a good movie home movie, even a surreal and wavy film like El Topo, Nude Lunch, and Survival Style 5+, because those movies actually have something worth discussing when their credit rolls. FFFC attempts at every avenue to be deep and intellectual, essentially no substance in this film. This film seriously does, the visual of this film does not inspire, the dialogue gets worse, music numbers are destroyed by this movie .. I chuckled for GUITAR brothers, but that was immediately wiped by something completely unnecessary, and irrelevant. He tried to be deep and meaningful I think, but just his unprecedented firefighters. Freshman films that do not have a camera can craft something more interesting. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />, Sogo Ishii, David Lynch, and Jodoworsky. Give me a break. I am convinced that people who rely on FFFC will do so because they have no idea what they have seen because it has nothing but serious statement here and there is mixed and stupid and mixed until you kick off your own shoes them. <br /> This film was an extreme deception that came from the High Copy 5+ Style, a movie that actually has meaning, combines with excellent use of scenery, cinematography, diarrhea in dialogue, funny moments , good soundtrack, excellent performance, fantastic walking and sinking. FFFC features the exact opposite in every way, boring landscape (20 minutes set in a bland plain at night? A completely white stage? Foreign balls floating in white space? A dinky school hallway and then a .. school halls?), Terrible cinematography, forgettable dialogues, nothing funny or funny, save the reality or just wasting your life for two hours, bands ..., performances, uneven, disoriented, and often flattening out rhythm, zero flow as well. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />! This is simply a way to self stroke it seems, because "unpredictable" might be a good quality for a movie if it has not been coupled with "boring", "inning", and "terrible". Personally I talked to two people who admitted that FFFC was awful when they left the theater, but overwhelming rave by art-home elite was made to watch the movie again and then came back to me with a. .. "Hey was very good I love it." <br /> I'll put my feet down, this film is sliding, I do not care if Roger Ebert says this movie is the best thing she ever looked since she lost her girl. "The Emperor's New Clothes" I say ... This film has no indicative way of filming the other psychedelic / Trippy films from Japan in the last 10 years. Taste of Tea, Part 7, and Kamikaze Girls are the best movies (even with a low budget), and no one can honestly compare with 5+ Survival Style. See FFFC only if you are interested in making a pile of pretensions to nothing on a rising budget.
