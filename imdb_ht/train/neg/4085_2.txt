"Sir" Jan Gielgud must have become starred star in a mess of a movie like this one. <br /> <br /> This is one of those films, I suppose, which is considered "art," but Don was not deceived ..... it's garbage. Stick to the "art" you can admire in a frame because the films that are labeled as such are usually unmistakable forage like this. <br /> <br /> In this masterpiece, Gechud recipes Shakespeare in the "storm" while the boiler trucks go to naked men. one of them a little urine in a pool. Wow, this is healing thing and real "art," is not it ?? That's just an example. Most of the story makes no sense, it is impossible to follow and, hence, one of the liberal critics is afraid they say they did not understand "to give it high marks to save their hover ego." Want Shakespeare? Read his books.
