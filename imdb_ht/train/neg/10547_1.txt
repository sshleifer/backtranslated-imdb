I do not remember a movie where I took care less about where the characters came from, what happens or where they are going. I realize that Hollywood's greatest pastime is stretched-gazing, but these people are either too desperate or too boring to take time with them. For what it's worth, though, the discussion followed the show, under the auspices of the key key series Cinema, made allowances that maybe three women have shown some rachim characteristics. I do not agree.
