The first few minutes of the "Bodyguard" have a collection of chants: it opens with text crawling from the Bible (part of which Samuel Jackson recites his victim at "Pulp Fiction" speed), continues with two karate teachers in New York discuss lonely human questions (better? Sonny Chiba or Bruce Lee?), and then Chiba appears, playing himself; He immediately stopped a hijacking aircraft and broke a bottle in two with his hand. Unfortunately, any entertainment, intentional or unintentional value, soon become crushed by the disjointed story, lack of action for long periods of time, and the poor quality of any present action. To keep it simple, here's why "The Bodyguard" is an unbearable movie to watch: <br /> 1) You do not know what's going on. <br /> <br /> 2) There is barely any fight. <br /> <br /> 3) The battles are there, short and terribly filmed. <br /> <br /> Sonny Chiba is cool. Judy Lee is gorgeous, his face gloss. Only for me to give the "Bodyguard" a 2nd star from 10. This film makes 87 minutes feel like 5 hours.
