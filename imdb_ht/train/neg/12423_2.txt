Cage (1989) was another budget buddy's buddy buddies that were produced during the 80's thanks in large part due to these films such as 48hrs. and Lethal Weapons. This one star Reb Brown and Lou Ferrigno as former Vietnamese veterinarian who came to run a diving diving site. Reb took care of Lou because he saved his life in 'Nam. But Lou was shot at the top and is now very soft. Although it's great, Lou has the brain of a child. A few days ruffians throw them around in the bar and Lou and Rebb beat the tar from them. But a mother's payback. The bar injury left Lou and Reb nothing. That is until these two thugs enter the picture (one of them is a real nice guy) that has a plan in mind. The movie in a waste of time. Perhaps if they went all the way and made a hard core normal action instead of trying to tone down the gruesomeness of the situation maybe it might have worked. Alas, it's not the audience left the bag. Oh well. It's too bad because you have all the components for a large B-movie. Best chance next time, I guess. <br /> <br /> Do not recommend. <br /> <br /> xxx
