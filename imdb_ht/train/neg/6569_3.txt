Max had the V-8, Trace (Wheel of Fire and Hero Only) has a jet engine on the back of his car that allows him to cope without any funny call as it rockets around half the desert desert. Be surprised as Mad Max 2 (aka The Warrior Road) is dissected and spliced ​​back together as a new movie albeit filmmaker in a subtle way with bad actors and dirty work caps. <br /> <br /> Why is WoF set in a post-apocalyptic desert? Simple, the Road Warrior was! Actually any questions can be answered by: it was that way in the Road Warrior! Except for working from mutant actors from the original 60 of the Time Machine movie which makes a camera appearance for the sake of giving the audience some non-machine action to grind for for a few minutes. <br /> In the Typical Fashion 80, all cars are driven by bad guys who were hit or slightly jostled to explode in a great blast blaster. Inevitably all car chassis will be reached near the cliff side and cars will inevitably fall into their hands. Along with this 80's cinematic ride in the wild is the general rampant misogyny of this style of cheap film. Generally, I was waiting for Trace's flagship car market to accelerate and fire flames so there would be another shot in it scrunching up her face as it is supposed to be hard, which comes over her looking constipation. Bad acting corruption and bad acting make this movie a true turn. Unwanted humor values ​​even manage to thin. <br /> <br /> Rat: The Horror Night by Bruno Mattei is superior. And that's and in itself will tell a lot! By counting this 2020 Texas Gladiators is a cinematic masterpiece compared to wheels of fire. A poor Warrior Road hit in that there is not enough cheese factor to make the movie look. <br /> <br />
