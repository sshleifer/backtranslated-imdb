After seeing a heavily censored version of this film on television years ago, I was curious to see the native version. I was surprised that it was more credible and well-act than I remembered, but one thing really stood out. I think other reviews have mentioned this too, namely, what exactly is the nature and motivation of the character Chris Sarandon? Did he violate other victims before? Is it completely psychotic or an "average" sociopath? How did he expect to get away with his attack on the youngest sister? Is this the character of all credible, or is it just a matter of more background being needed? It looks almost alike to be an uncomfortable character, and too crazy actually able to hold on to an instructional job that puts it in contact with young, vulnerable girls. This seems to be the biggest complaint of viewers in general. It has nothing to do with its performance, which is permanent to persuade. The film occupies a comfortable position between absolute exploits and a half-way serious treatment of the subject, without being properly resolved in either mode. Not the worst movie ever made, but not all that good, either.
