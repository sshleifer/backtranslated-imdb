Seeing all the negative reviews for this movie, I figured out that it might be another comedy cheating that was not well meant to be. I watched the first two staged scenes, listening to the generic dialogue released awfully by Lungren, and the other cast - of Oriental actors, and I found the movie so terrible that it was funny. Then Brandon Lee entered the story with one-material to start flying, the plot fell apart, the script writers began to drink and the film wears out it's welcome, as it gets into the worst movie action EVER. Lungren beat out his previous efforts at the "Punisher" and others, as well as all of Van Damme's movies, Seagal's movies, and the Rocky Stallone's movies, for this distinct honor. This movie has absolute worst acting (checking Tia Carrere's face when it is at any stage and dolph, that's a laugh), with the worst dialogue ever (Comment Brandon Lee's Little Dolph is the line the worst ever in a movie) and the worst outfit of a movie (Dolph in full Japanese attire). Photo "Tango and Cash" and Worst Act, Meet "Commando", meet "The 13th Friday" (because of the essence of Lungren's great sense of performance and Jason Voorhees-love), in an hour and fifteen minutes jokes in a movie . / / <br /> Well (how about not terrible) performances go to the bad guy (which always seems to constipate in all his performances) and Carrere (which somehow says his 5 lines without breaking out laughing). Brandon Lee is just having to sideways the Lungren, and doing a really awful job at that. A terrible terrible horrible. Fear it and avoid it. If you look it though, ask yourself why the underwater vaccines are twice as clear as most non-vacant vaccines. Speaking of the underwater shots, check out the lame battle scene with the worst-fought-ever-ending battle. This movie has all versions of a bad battle scene for those who have carefully scratched and fills in between the flashes of stripping. <br /> A BAD BAD MOVIE !!!!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
