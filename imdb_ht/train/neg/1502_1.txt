The ballad of Django is an epic mess in a movie! This western spaghetti is simply a collection of other scenes (and best!) Films supposed to be tied together by "Django" to say how it brought in different prohibitions. Hunting Power (John Cameron) brings nothing into the role of Django. Skip this one unless you just have all Django films made and even this can not be a good excuse to see this one !!
