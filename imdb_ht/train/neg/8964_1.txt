These people are familiar with the two Cube movies before they really know what they can expect: a small group of people trapped inside a bunch of crazy chambers, paranoia, bad acting ... This one is a little as different though. Approximately half of the film takes place outside the cube, where we get to watch the people watching the people inside the cube (or at least five of them). <br /> I guess the zero cube is deduced to explain what to cope with the cube is, but you really do not get to know more than that was covered by the two films first. Sure, there's sort of an explanation of the, but it feels very blame compared to what's suggested in the movie first. <br /> <br /> Cube Zero looks rather cheap (as did its previous), and the fact that it shows more than just a couple of empty rooms only emphasize this feeling. I also fell very confident in saying there is no risk that any of the actors will have any prizes in the foreseeable future. They brought back the traps from cube 1, though, (not that I mean they're almost the same, which is a bit of a shame). <br /> I know that many people appreciate this movie and its links with the first one, but I just feel that it's a completely unnecessary contribution to a franchise that was not great to start with.
