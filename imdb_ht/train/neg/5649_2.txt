I do not think this is too bad at a show under the right conditions. I tolerate the first quarter. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this is a show about lawyers who are not really lawyers. God prevents anybody actually going to law school based on those shows, which I heard was the case when I watched some interviews in the show. She just made me gag a bit. <br /> <br /> That aside, Spader and Shatner, who are supposed to be the stars in the show, are the most annoying. While this might be a compliment in some situations, it's certainly not here. They constantly harass the women on the show is the first comedy. But since that's what they're doing literally all the time, I've realized that this is as deep as the show is going to get. Try to interrupt some serious, dramatic, and even tattered moments in the midst of mockery in a real show failed to compensate for the progressive loss of interest I have experienced to enjoy the show. /> Alan Shore's flamboyant and free ad "ad service" where he sprouts in his opinion is not impressed. Denny Crane is just annoying. I was embarrassed for him and for the writers of the show for the technical speech to put a colonial outfit. <br /> I give two stars because there are moments where I thought attempt attempts to deal with some contemporary issues with care. <br /> I think the show writer has come to know that sexual harassment appears by Denny and Alan got overbearing even to those who were more invited to them from the start. The thing is, I do not care if the sexual harassment treatment in the show does well, but I just felt that the writer was insulting me and artificially implanting sexual whales all over the show in hoping my libido will hold I'm coming back for more. I'm not a teenager anymore, and I think that this show is promising if its goals were not provided in the lowest common denominator to get evaluation. <br /> Of course, I write this after I realize that it really will not get better than that. It's a shame because it's one of those who show I'd love to.
