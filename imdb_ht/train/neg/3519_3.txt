Some Stallone movies I love, but this movie did not meet expectations to me. I found this movie hard to believe. For example, a bunch of terrorists who crash land in the desert are preparing to survive for at least two days. Also, in all this Stallone Desert and companies keep running across the bridges and ladders that provide short-cut practices or tracing devices. Also, the Trek cops do not seem to coordinate anything with local rescue persons. Also, bad guys could not hit the side of a barn with really high-tech automatic weapons. <br /> I love the Lithgow villain initially, but the character is such a complete psychopath that he did not care at all about any of his own bad guys, or all of them are getting killed. Eventually I just could not believe the character again. <br /> Not worth the price of a rental, not even worth taking the time to look.
