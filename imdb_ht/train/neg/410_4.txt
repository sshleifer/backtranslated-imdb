Unfortunately, one of the best efforts ever made in the area of ​​special effects has been made to be completely pointless by being combined with a debris, humorous and equally useless and a scarce, scary scenario. Hollow Man is a rather useless film. Practically everything seen here made of death - the characters, the mind and sequence actions (especially the shaft rises!) - and only the really intriguing element of the movie being the impressive impressive effects. However, it is just the same special effect on them and over again, and at the end of the film that is also made to death. I was expecting before watching Hollow Man that the term Invisible Man, which is hardly original in itself, would be the basis of something tougher and more interesting. This is not so. It is not long before the movie gets into a bath without being too familiar with the mass of the Hurricane ineffectual - the mound of cliché batter up so fast that it's almost impressive. <br /> <br /> On top of all this, Kevin Bacon does a very useless job and thinks its support will hardly be trying their best. Good score could be a Jerry Goldsmith note (but there is no competition for its best effort), a very interesting use of thermal imaging and special effects. I was tempted to give this movie three out of ten, but the effects push Hollow Man deserve up one tooth. <br /> 4/10
