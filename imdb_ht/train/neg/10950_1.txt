If I knew this movie was filmed in the exaspering style and queuing-indirect Dogme 95, I would never have rented it. But I took a dramamine for the seasickness and gave it a shot. I lasted a very, very, very long forty minutes before abandoning. It's just boring, sluggish sluggish. The last French movie I saw was "Romance" and it was also very involved, but at least the camera was fixed and did not breathe down the strokes of the characters ever. I am distorted in the continued popularity of Dogme 95 overseas - it will catch over in America at the same time as the next epidemic of eyewitnesses. (This is called Dogme 95 because the average number of times the actors are poked in the eye by the camera.) <br /> <br />
