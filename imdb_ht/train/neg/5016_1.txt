The Nick Stahl name, cast in teens with the attractive cover of the VHS to make me buy and watch this flick movie, hoping to see a good movie movie movie. What a crap! The full of scenario glowing, dialogue and performance are awful, obnoxious, very bad, awful, horrendous ?? Summary, a complete waste of time. There is no horror, black humor, only an absolutely boring story, and point to shame. The movie begins with six characters, indeed three couples, together as a group of friends, but indeed very embarrassing people who seem to have enemies, play a ridiculous game called "Taboo", and each one of them writes yes or There are no taboo problems. That is it: there is no previous development of the characters, the viewer does not know who they are, the motives and their relationships. Then there is an elipher in a year later, and the same group is gathered in a New Year Eve party, insulting each other in a very sordid way. The draw and the twists are so ridiculous, predictable, mediocre and incredible that do not deserve any additional line of my review. A council only: Do not waste your time or money on this waste, you will certainly regret. My vote is one (terrible). <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Taboo ?? Jogando and Assassino" ("Playing with the Assassin")
