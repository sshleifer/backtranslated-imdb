Knights were just a start of a series, a pilot, one would say. The plot (I really should not call it that, was not any draw) was not logical at all and there were so many errors, as [warning, I summarized the plot]: <br /> <br /> In the beginning In the movie someone said there were only a couple of these cyborgs (bad guys), but after the climax, never found that there were so many more left. And it was said that cyborgs were hard to kill, but after a month's training, Nea could kill them with a single blow. <br /> <br /> The movie was just as soon as kicking. I was not surprised at all, when I found that the leading star was a kicker boxer. <br /> There was one positive thing in the entire movie: it really gave a great deal of laugh when watching it and talking about it with my friends. I recommend watching it, if you are in need of laughter.
