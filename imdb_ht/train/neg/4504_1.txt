A slow, tiring, and one-dimensional movie! Good casting and clich√© dialogues, boring story lines, and inataxial directions of Mr Marshal! The conventional and predictable history of the most popular form of prostitution from the Asian continent, lack of heart, new insights, and depth. The lead character looks out of place due to its small phial and lenses looking for contact lenses. Lexicon employees do not sound their geishas sounds and a bit too sophisticated to expose their limited way in education. The story goes on and on for hours trying to persuade you this little boring, flat chested Asian girl is the ultimate gay, they actually say in the movie "It is destined to become a legend" I say hardy the case ! The movie is just plain boring, it is nice to look at it, it has a very few very exciting moments as you can get by going out for cigarretes. Basically, if you do not believe the messenger you do not believe the message, and this girl did not fill the shoe! Borin, boring, skipping it!
