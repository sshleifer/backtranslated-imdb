I watched this movie when I was a young full of hormone hormones and it was about as a movie as I've ever seen- or ever saw. It may not have been a big movie. I guess it was not. I do not really remember much about it, tell you the truth. I only remember the sexual chemistry between Crosby and Biehn. No woman in any movie has ever done it for me as the incredible sexy Cathy made in this movie. I did not see it since my first time kept on TV in the 70s and I do not think I would like to see it again since I'm sure it would be a hassle-hormone to me not as raging and I became more jaded over the years. Still, when I think back on the shower scene I can always remember how great it felt way back air. <br /> <br /> Add later: After watching the movie again, I discovered that it's dangerous to go home again. What was once erotic is now very tame. The older woman-the least person things are still working for me, just as much as he's done, probably because I'm not a 12 year old. This older woman is now smaller than I am. Also, the entertainment of the whole thing was not perceived by my twelve-year-old idea. <br /> Morals: Sometimes it's best not to review the past.
