This movie is a blatant attempt by the left side of Hollywood to show Reagan's administration as incompetent and incompetent. Some errors can be made at the time of the crisis, but I'm certainly not in the limits described in this lame film. My first reaction was that this film was headed by Oliver Stone, but I was wrong this time. There are apparently many others.
