The first, the title character is not the same character of the movie. It is sidekick of the cult leader. The actor shows Igor believing that screaming loudly, laughing hysterical, and having a crooked smile while bugging out your eyes would be an excellent way to scare people. Igor also had the annoying habit of calling (because he never actually just spoke) in a loud voice up. It would also say idiotic one-materio. For example when the cult leader kills one of his followers with a buzz seen, Igor on seeing this, call "Paul! No Paul! Why do you do it? I could cut him clean! So clean! " In another scene Igor said a victim that he would have to find his own tools for surgery because now he's been his time to operate. 'Aside from the bad act, the finish did not make sense because while the story builds up little steam it has towards the climax, which is Igor getting a bullet arrow at the top and the rest of the boyfriend His buddies were killed, he showed up again more times to kill the good guys. The movie offers no explanation, only tells the viewer that Igor escaped from the mental hospital. What is ??? Bottom line is not wasting time you watch this movie. I wish I could return the moment I lost that look.
