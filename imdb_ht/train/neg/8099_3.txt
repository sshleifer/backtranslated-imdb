This was a great book and the possibilities for a really great movie were definitely there. But the decision to filed completely broke the movie. Hanks is a great actor to be sure, but lacking the smarmy features, morally characteristic needed for the lead role. Jeff Daniels would have been my choice. <br /> Put the Melanie Griffiths, for the purpose of eye candy, is understandable, but again, he did not show the depth or ambivalence, so need to pull it off. /> <br /> This movie is a great example of how each decision, even those early in film production can do or break a record.
