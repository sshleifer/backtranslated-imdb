It's one of these plays that is so bad that it almost hit the point of being very funny, the script is absolutely terrifying, appalling direction, lighting purely arrangement, the only thing left him out of a bad fucking it's fragrant is that the design sound is only quite bad; It adds no suspense to the story although trying hard, but not at least destroy any speech. There are continuous issues of seasonal expansion from door shots at all. And ultimately last but not least the act is appalling. For a professional production it's very much the feel of a university university project you have to feel sorry for the sorry for anyone who has to put their names in this.
