Well, I'll start by admitting me to a fan of John Ford. (I look at the "Informator" only because I'm trying to work on my way to a "big" list.) So, if you are, just move along, 'cause you will not agree with me. /> <br /> What a too much piece of dates in this silliness is! I'm going to say that there is a good idea for a movie here (it made me think about how some films have about the Irish Revolution) but, as usual, Ford is determined to bury it under mood and kindness . I suppose it's a bit interesting to look for temporarily in order to see the less-than-smooth transition that has been made out of the silences in the "talkies" - Styles to act in some of the principals there which endebow endemic quality in early film and film feels as if it can play better with four titles than dialogue. (Of course, four titles would prevent Ford from repairing every bit of six times emotion.) What dialogue has usually has a "They're Still After My Lucky Charms!" quality has become aggravated by the fact that every actor seems to have been able to use it or his own personal version of an Irish accent. Of course, as bad as they are, the accents are useful in reminding us of Ireland because the sets are mostly viewed as if they were dragged from out to some German Expressionist pieces by being filmed about the next ringing on. (It feels as if, with an eagle eye, you can see some of the villages in Dr. Frankenstein's torch in the background.) <br /> <br /> Technical change. Snack Shift. So I will not go on how crazy it seems that this movie was so acclaimed in its day. But it's not one of the classics that holds - more just "just warnings" about the kind of over-simplified malcilli that Ford was going to devote to his career.
