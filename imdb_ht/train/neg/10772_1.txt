The infamous part of this is the fact that these are 87 minutes I will never get back. I knew this was terrible from the get-go, and the guy dressed like an American digging head on top of the roof. (See if they could get away with this in 2008). My 10-year-old boy really at baseball right now, so we decided to rent it on a rainy day. Though it seemed to enjoy part of it, I had to cringe when I heard all the bad language words. Bad, bad movie. This was a terrible ripple of bad news bears. Completely cynical and completely predictable. I do not mind a predictable movie if it does well, but this one absolutely did not.
