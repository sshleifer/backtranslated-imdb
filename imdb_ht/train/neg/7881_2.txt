This movie is a portrait of boy half-spotted boy Benjamin who has visited a boarding school because of his disgusting mark in Mathematics. He did not have the best experiences in life before and received serious self-esteem problems. After a rough start at her new school, she starts to make friends, falls in love with a girl and does some American Pieish teens. <br /> In addition to some comedy elements, the film is said to be very serious, focusing on Benjamin and its problems. <br /> <br /> If you do not like this story description, save your time and look something else. If you do, please be aware of the following: <br /> 1) Benjamin is a total loser. Whatever it does, it makes it terribly wrong and then it goes for self-pity all the time. For me it was not the kind of "good loser" that you can feel sympathy for and laugh with. Instead he and his behavior really hurt me and with my own youth not so far I could barely stand watching. <br /> 2) The movie hardly tries to be realistic and the story seems to be handy to my character 's experience just by (except for Janosch maybe). And yes, I know this movie based on a self-biography written by a 17-year-old - but there are some experiences with German and German youth myself, I do not believe it. ) Showing the sexual arena really is important for a movie that has the topic. But I doubt that young boys make a "cumshot of candy" -contest where everyone has hit a candy and sperm while mass-masturbating in the woods and the loser has to eat the mele-wet candy afterwards. Although he likes to amuse me in a contemptible way, it's neither funny nor underscored the serious attempts of this movie. <br /> <br /> 4) There is a sub-draw on Benjamin's family and her husband betrayed his wife - still, I do not know why she's and where to put her. She just bored me. <br /> Well, I personally hated this movie for having the character of Benjamin, being without a message, concept, scheme, whichever and it's weakening attempts to be dramatic and serious. However, I can imagine that some people can get it sensitive and touchy. If you liked the "Other Sister" you will probably love this one, too. I was hated both. <br /> <br /> 17-year old boy should not write an autobiography and if they do, it does not seem to have the best idea to make a movie out of it. <br /> 2 out of 10.
