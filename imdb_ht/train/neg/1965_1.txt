Stephen J. Cannell apparently decided a few years ago that he would expand his horizons and drabble in horror. The result, "Dead of Ground", is an abysmal piece of junk. Now I've noticed her name in association with this film in particular I'd put it back but no, I did not have my glasses on and that's why I miss it, damn, I really need bring these with me while shopping videos. The first question would be, who is the heck is the target audience for this? It's almost like a movie movie "movie", but then again there's topless and some gore and some bad words spouted here and there. The main characters are so nice that you want to see someone, anyone, go behind them and firm installation of some kind. It seems that a guy opens a bed and breakfast with a breakthrough of past, a child-killing witch who collects the children's teeth. Probably something real estate agent failed to mention. Of course now in the modern day there is a little girl ghost around cautioning the real-little girl who now lives there is something bad that will happen. It does, and there are both Bubbas who have squatted on this property when the new owner took on what they are going out for revenge as well. All this has the feeling of some make-for-the-cable junk is for the kids of Halloween except for, of course, things that are not suitable for small children, so not only this mediocre in confused, too. A big booster and bears of Anchor Bay for putting this out too, consider the usual records to follow and this fine release is a new bar. The UK gets a Box Box Set, we find "Fairy tooth". Hardly looks just like. 1 out of 10 absolute garbage.
