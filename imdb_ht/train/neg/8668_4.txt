I have never read Bradbury's novel that this movie is based on but what I liked, it will be interesting (when I finally make it read and I'll). My comments will be based purely on the movie. As soon as I saw the trailer I knew I saw it and was so excited but when I finally did, I was so shameful that it hurt. This is because the movie itself felt so amateur. The actors were not well disposed (though Robards and Pryce are both good actors - just not here). The kid actors, it seems, were simply asked to show up, get into the characters' clothes, tell the lines and face them. The set and accessories were cheap and unrealistic. The direction was surprisingly bad. I was so amazed at the awfulness of it that I went online and checked that directed it, just to see what kind of work she did. The cut and paste correction and the scheme (scenario) were just as good (though the author involved himself, irony?). I have read some of the comments on this movie and find it hard to believe that people actually love being built in tension, fear and suspense were so mild to be effective when the final happened. li. What makes me worse is that the content is interesting and entertaining and intriguing. It has a lot of potential. Unfortunately, the movie was so technically bad it took away the brightness of the story.
