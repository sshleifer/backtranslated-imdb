Some unpleasant smokers have been included. <br /> From real-life experiences, this film continues to disappoint from the very beginning. I currently deployed my second trip to Iraq as an infantry man. This film has nothing near to what would happen in real life events. From the very start of a few names: the Sonic cart, the EOD elements roll out solo with no escort, EOD employee sneaking into VBC, having sleeves to roll the entire time of ACUs in my place called it to leave on my 2 dollar haji copy, the sniper scene. The list would continue, however, it is necessary to list wrong things happening with a span of 2 minutes before the more things are inaccurate; and the point was made. <br /> <br /> This movie is for people and critics to look with no understanding or experience with deployment or the military. <br /> <br /> People with military background or knowledge of the military will be ashamed of infidelity.
