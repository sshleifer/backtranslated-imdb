A scene demonstrates the mentality of "Woman Terminator" very well: Karen Sheperd and another woman are trying to escape from the wicked camp. Karen runs through an army guard, who points out his weapon in it, but after a few seconds throws it away and challenges him in a fight. Karen kicks him in the balls, chooses the gun and runs away! Then again, when a movie is directed by a martial arts and writing / produced by another member of his family, you know you should not expect too much. Karen Sheperd and Jerry Trimble make some glamorous fun go early, and the movie might have turned out to be best if it focused more on their love-hate relationships. But after about 20 minutes to get separated, and the movie slows down in a crawl, and even with the occasional scene scenes of living things, it lacks excitement. The final has Qissi fighting trimble inside a cave and Sheperd will womano-a-womans against Ashley Hayden's beautiful on a speedboat, but the battles will cut off in a way that breaks down and reduces their value. On the positive side, the Kudos department costs Karen the chance to show spectacular cleavage throughout the film! (* 1/2)
