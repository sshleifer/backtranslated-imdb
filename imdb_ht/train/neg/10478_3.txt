I sincerely consider this movie as another poor effort in the Dominican movie industry. The first 30 minutes of the film are a little funny but then when they change the role of society (men who do what women usually do with women doing what men usually do) the movie falls. Become boring and not funny at all. They left a lot without explanation and the film's end is predictable. I did not like the way as an angel was playing his character with his little one either. I went to the theater theater hoping to see a good job but I'm really really disappointed. <br /> I do not recommend this movie.
