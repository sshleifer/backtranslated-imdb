There is a remark that one heroine was raped about "drunken rattle" by Russian soldiers, which is completely true. This film should not be shown solely for that purpose. <br /> Also, there is a statement by someone, that KGB prosecutes "Jews, Gypsies etc.", which is "worse than Nazi". KGB was looking for what is called "zionist" agent, which (KGB believes) imperialist agent. This is totally different from targeting Jews as a whole nation, as Nazism did. The gypsy was never pursued. KGB was political tool and used politically, but from international plans. Communists really did not distinguish nationality. <br /> <br /> Movie Stink Like Fake. Main hero does not speak Russian, the Berlin sign has typographical errors, KGB general seems totally false. Some so-called "Russian proverbs" are totally made up, and lists go on and off. <br /> <br /> Do not recommend to watch - this movie is all lying, and stuffy stuff. Go to "good shepherd" instead.
