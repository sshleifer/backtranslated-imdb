After Disney's witty live-action George in the jungle, I had high hopes for this movie flick. Great disappointment. Wire conspiracy, defective acts, visual effects. This movie was counted on lame one-material, idiotic (and freeware) product placement, and the most annoying side-kick lamest of gadget stuff. I took two young children to see it and where bored out of their minds. The only laughter received from this movie was to stand out in the air that needed a street show a guy getting it in the blanket!
