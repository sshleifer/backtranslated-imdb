All I can say is before you watch the movie I did not have a hint indication that Annemarie Schwarzenbach was or what was her life story .. and I must confess that the movie was hardly a help to reach that data and even he did not have success to convince me to do some research by typing some words on Google's website; However, all I can say is that actress Jeanette Hain was great with her facial dumb really fucked well and showed a deep mental depression, as it is in real life. <br /> <br /> After all, based on the movie script was spent in Turkey and Tehran as well as Afghanistan .. but believing I am familiar with the area, it was all about an Arab desert in Morocco. Turkish and Persian people are completely different in face and culture as well as in non-Arabic languages ​​.. <br /> <br /> I would like to make a movie like this kind of documentary - a complete search of all the minor elements is mandatory.
