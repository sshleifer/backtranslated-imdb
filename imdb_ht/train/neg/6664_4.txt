What begins to emerge as a gentle, harmless and violent string of romantic storytelling stories as Edward Norton's initially good Harlan gradually revealed more about himself and things to take a turn for the disaster, as the movie gradually change from a southern romance to a modern western wood. <br /> An amiable airport (Norton) wanders in town with a girl's charm (Evan Rachel Wood), seemingly salvaging her from a dead-end existence with her father's father-managing a romance tornado but It gradually becomes apparent that more of this cowboy than satisfying the eye. <br /> <br /> Edward Norton ?? A real actor of chameleon (and changing face facial hair) plays a country hick, slightly dodgy accent, but perhaps because it simply tries to act the party without worrying about the accent. It certainly makes it appear easy to make all the nuances adjustments as we learn more about Harlan. However, with little change that means we're never sure exactly where Harlan is coming out, and that seemed like a good performance in Norton gradually gets confused. Evan Rachel Wood is likable without ever really having a great deal to do other than his stick to Norton. <br /> <br /> Down deep to hit as slightly unequal history due to its change in pace, and never really made the protagonist's motive to clear the audience's sympathy for the characters to remain uncertain. Would we like this heat or not? Even after a dramatic turn of events it remains unclear. This ambiguity is the movie's filth, as if the writer could not climb the type of story they had to say and stayed for a bit of a poach-poch. The movie has remained one or the other it might have been a solid film, but as it is what we are leaving and is something of a mess. Fans of old-fashioned romance will enjoy a portion of the movie, but will be stripped off by the tuning tone. Complete fans of Norton aside (or fans of the lush scenery of the Fernando Valley), giving this a miss.
