Mr. VanHook took a good idea and kicked off like a football. Unfortunately, he did not make the goal. The historical subject of greatness is good, but poured into the goon milk and you end up with a giant wheat cheese. I say, take this coil wheel and roll it on a cliff. I could not even watch the entire movie. That says a lot because I rarely walk away from any movie. I always love to give them a chance for the last minute redemption. It is impossible to buy something bad. Well, at least the act was good .... NOT! <br /> <br /> The only thing to "fall" in this film is the rating. 1/10 and sinking in the negative numbers!
