I said I hated this movie. I do not like to say that because Gerard Butler is in it. About half an hour of boring conversations, sorry for everyone who actually cares about the draw, I started fast-throwing at the Gerry scene. I really do not know the finish, I was bored with it. If Gerry was not in it, I probably either do one of the two things: fall asleep or turn it off, but Gerry is the bright light of this movie, as it is with most of the earliest movies his. If you're a fan of Gerry's not worried, it's as adorable and precious as it's always, but if you actually want to watch the movie for the draw, good luck because you'll need it, either that or a lot of coffee or soda keep you awake! <br /> <br /> 4/10 ... and is just because the casting director had the sense of wearing Gerry in this movie, though they had no idea about how to spell his name!
