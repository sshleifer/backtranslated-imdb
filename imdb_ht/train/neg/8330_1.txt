I saw "Shiner" on DVD. While I was watching her, I thought, "This is a really bad porn movie without pornography." I also thought, "Anyone who wrote this has some real problems." Then I watch Carlson's director / writer explaining his process as a special feature. Yeah, it was real special. <br /> <br /> The emphasis of film is placed on two alcoholic losers who hit each other to get there. They are very attractive. There are naked front cars and full. These factors probably account for the movie being seen at all. <br /> <br /> The most troubling elements of the film are the gay bashin and subsequent more gay bashing of the same victim who tries to uncertain exact revenge from his attackers, the losers losers. Not only is the subject busy absurdly and seriously from a technical point of view, but the act is incredibly bad. Then there's the boxer-stalker theme. This is really crazy, not just absurd. This hunker boxer is somehow traumatized by the persistent attentions of a fervent boy boy who works in his garage at the parking lot. This is in LA, your mind. The boxer is so traumatized that he turns into the stalker's home, his front legs, and gets excited about the process. <br /> <br /> Well, all I can say is, why would a boxer in the heart of an exhibitorist be so traumatized by the attention of a stalker? It simply does not make any sense. And I'm afraid, some psycho-dynamics actually make sense, if you take the time to read about them. However, bad scripts rarely make sense at all. The director / writer seems to have thought that this movie represents a considerable minority in the gay community. Well, it may be correct, I suppose. We can never know, since this minority would be so dysfunctional they would hardly be able to organize enough for ever to go to a dark gay movie or DVD store, the only place they might find this turkey. Thank you for that.
