I had no background knowledge of this movie before I bought it, but it sounded cool and I wanted to see a really kick-butt Viking movie for a while now ... Alas, this movie was not 'what I was looking for. I was hoping for the best, but instead, they delivered a boring Nordic soap opera that seemed to drag on too long despite its 84 minute running time. The first movie is intriguing enough: It's a victory victory that challenged God and Odin is so angry that he cursed the son of war, called Barek, to death and rebirth as a Berserker. This Barek guy is then forced to live swallowed, crazy, and violent for lifetime. The film is filmed completely enough, with some rich movies and quasi-good performances by the actors, but again, I find myself bored and questioned then dribble would end. The movieist had a chance to do something rather fun and semi-unique but they dropped the ball. Perhaps it might have been improved with some cheap exploitation tactics thrown in like free nudity and lots of gurus ... I mean, we're talking about "Berserkers" here, are not we? Vikings were supposed to be bad enough, what and all violated with embryo, so does Berserkers suppose even more extreme? All in all, unless you are a fan of Young and Restless (etc ...) or, is yourself, in fact, a crazy Berserker who loves self torture, I would probably steal clear of this piece drab in seluloid.
