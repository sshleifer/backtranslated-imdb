I watched all the film in the shameless finish even though I felt angry at what I saw. I felt that the director was screaming for the only way he could accomplish this being to be as repulsive as possible. Since I have lived in the UK I have come to love this country but this movie depicts British teenagers in the worst way to imagine. There is nothing to be said but avoid it, it will make you angry and sick. People involved should be disappointed.
