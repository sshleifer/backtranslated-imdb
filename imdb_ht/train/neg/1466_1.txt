I was really looking forward to a new TV / movie on a favorite subject - making a nice change from a * unfamiliar familiar documentary * on Kursk or Stalingrad on the History Channel. I like to look forward to Pearl Harbor and the enemies of the Gates - but it has been briskly down to earth with the realization of the malware, stupid-efficient power of Hollywood - and its ability to spend an absolute fortune on me excited about 'awakening of evil', especially as I heard that Ian Kershaw was involved, as I enjoyed her books. I can see why she leaves. <br /> To quote some guys responsible for this trash: <br /> "The Kershaw book was an academic piece," he said. "It was <br /> quite dry We need more incident." <br /> <br /> Incident? Are they totally black? Hitler's life can not say that there is no 'incident' - yes Kershaw's volume of Hitler's volume was long and detailed, but was supposed to be. <br /> <br /> Hitler was a very bad man - no it was a bad man, who wanted Jews, and just in case you miss this, we will emphasize the reality of every scene in the movie. <br /> There was no effort to try and explain the attitude of the time, and why Hitler could have adopted the views and strategies he made. Needless to say - unlike the generally excellent 'Nazi - an Warning from History' - this film neglected to point out the fact that almost all the leaders of the communist communist minister were Jewish, and that this may have colored His views on the subject - and the axiomatic bonds of the Jews and Bolshevism - an absolutely critical aspect of understanding of the Nazi era. <br /> But there was not much understanding to be done - the movie-makers were not going to go there, so we just got the whole thing we knew about anyway. We certainly do not find the fascinating fact that Kershaw Alludes, who had Hitler briefly being a socialist / communist instantly after WW1. That would of course be far too complex for the busy film, and might even diverge from unlucky 'he's been very bad' mantra that bangs far inevitably. <br /> We know it was a bad man. However, we also know that it was a fascinating figure both as a public speaker and in more private situations. It could be polite and even sympathetic, and of course has inspired some opinions such as vegetarianism, anti-alcohol and anti-smoking that many guardians might agree with. He was also famously fond of animals, hence why fully invented chocolate - jumping was so absurd. <br /> It was also, from all the accounts I saw, a brave soldier at WW1. While we saw him and the Cross do it, we never get to see how he got it (act of courage was not in the script, useless to say). We also did not get any insight whatsoever why he was so shot up in his war experiences, also Sassoon, Owen, Brook, Remarque and many others found it so repainted by an experiment. And again, as above, re-link Jewish / bolshevik, this is vital for understanding anyone on the subject. Why did he love so much war? Why did he think it was still a good idea, despite massive controversy? Why did he not care about his dead colleagues? Or maybe she did - but still drew the wrong conclusions. <br /> <br /> This movie certainly did not have anything of any interest to say about this either. <br /> As all too often these days, the film is a classic example of 'making history related to the present' and inventing things or leaving awkward information from the fit and 'present' - which all too often is provided in the lower common denominator, where you do not trust your audience an inch, so you just burn things down the throats, know (sorry correctly) that you will always get away with it because there are many fool people in the world. History is really about to make us relevant to the past and see how it's our present color for best and worse. This waste was a great opportunity, lost again. They spent millions on it, and where and great scenes were impressive, but he said we had nothing in all of us who did not know, and encouraged no understanding of this dark period in human history .
