So I got a hold this as an assignment for Trent Harris, who teaches occasionally in the movie dept in U's in U. I guess this is just her real way to get anyone to watch her movie. .. <br /> The documentary section at the beginning dragged on. Yes, the kid is a dark work from nowhere, but that's not good enough to keep it interesting. <br /> See Sean Penn dressed as an ONG is the only record ... and after about thirty seconds she loses all humor. <br /> <br /> When Crispin Glover takes on Larry, the storytelling was the best, but I just could not take anymore ...
