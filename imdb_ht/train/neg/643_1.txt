I'm a big fan of the Largo Winch TV series. This movie was pain for me. I had to use fast forward by falling asleep. It was boring! How can someone break this title so much? The story was just the right thing. The actors were sht. They can not live the role. The main actor (Tom ...) is a null. See another role of this actor. The fighting scenes were incredible boring and not trackable, somehow they did not follow the situation. Like other reviews say low budget films and bad actors. Perhaps another person can do the best thing from this title. French can not do good things with big movies, such as Aliens 4. That was just BRRR, after Aliens 1,2,3.
