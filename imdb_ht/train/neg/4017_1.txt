Yes, this film gets a lot of attention and is considered a classic of the adult movie genre. Still, I did not like this one at all. On a woman who committed suicide in a scene further tightened a horror movie, she was given the opportunity to return to the world shortly to live the life of her lust never before did her mundane life. Scandal sex scenes are followed. Why are they wrong, for one they try so hard to be artistic that they take away from the actual sex act. I want to tell you porn sex for sex. Blue girls also do things in an artistic way, but it is still very erotic and beautiful to look at. Of course the girls in that one are very nice. Here we have a rather unattractive lead actress and does not help things. If you find the lead in your adult movie unappealing there is no number of artistic visions that will make me enjoy the movie. The sex scenes range from yuck to ra ... I mean there is a snake in one of them people. So, for me this movie just failed as it does not motivate me at all, but rather to turn me off.
