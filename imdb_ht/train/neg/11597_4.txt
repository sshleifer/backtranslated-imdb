I'm going to the statue and draw Alice, which has survived the previous installment of the nightmare series, to find the deadly dreams of Freddy Krueger starting once again. This time, the taunting bandit is striking in your sleep of Alice's unborn child. Her intentions are to be "born again" in the real world. The only one who can stop Freddy is her dead mother, but can Alice free her mind in time to save her own son? This movie started in really well as we saw Alice dreaming of being Amanda Kruger who got stuck in room and getting rape on 100 manics then she was running to hospital but then she was not yet the lady pregnant but then Amanda gave birth to Freddy again .. Alice and Dan are only two people to return from the 4th film and then have become some new friends' not long before Freddy starts to kill again , I did like the first die of it, not as good as the other deaths or dreams. Freddy himself did not seem to be afraid of this movie at all, the nightmare was just boring really they did not scare or climb at all. /> <br /> Actress of the movie was okay for a 5th film in the series but in general I think that this film was really dull. (Still not the worst film in the series, Freddy died the worst) <br /> 4/10
