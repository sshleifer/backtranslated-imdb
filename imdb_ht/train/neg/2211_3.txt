Hahahaha !!!!!! Funny-that's the movie sum up in one word. What the crap was this "thing", since It might kill me to use the movie movie!?!?! I hope the director, writer, and producer did not mean that this turned out to be good, because he certainly did not press a scientist to turn his son into a math shark, and the shark killed a bunch of people scientists is invited to the island !!! Oh my Gooooooodddd !!!! I hate this movie so much that when I watched it I laughed at all the parties, because they were so corny and amateur .. and could not have made the shark look more unrealistic, even though this " something "has been a bit bigger budget than the lowest budget cinema. All I said is watching this movie awaits street laughing at all bad acting, and stupid korny dialogue, because if you're waiting for a good movie you're will be very disappointed.
