Universal Soldier: The Return is not the worst movie ever made. No, this honor should go to a movie that tried to make some sort of statement or accomplish some artistic feat but failed in a tacky or offensive way. However, maybe no movie I've ever seen tried so little and succeed so completely as did Universal Soldier: The Return. <br /> <br /> This movie is a sci-fi travesti / action that normally has nothing to recommend. The act is as bad as any movie I've ever seen. The plot is terrible and predictable. Special effects are bad. In short, anyone even remotely connected to this movie should be disappointed. US: The return to Door Van Damme ticket looks like inaugural Cinemas. Some movies are so bad, they are good. Believe me when I tell you that this is not one of them. I'm really not sure what else to say here. I doubt many people who have considered this movie if they were not already, but just in case: do not.
