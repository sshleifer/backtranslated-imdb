This is not just a bad movie, it's one of the worst movies ever. it's so bad that I found it to be quite enjoyable. The act, my God, the script, you have to be kiddin '. How can you imagine the writer coming up with things like: - a kid of fireworks in school, SO fireworks, when one gets hit by it, they fly one hundred yards backwards and explode. -The girl is trapped in the selurge, the killer tries to break open the door. It gets an exercise, but the thread is not long enough. he first made an extension cord, oh the horror, and then when he did, he exercised through the door and drill at the top of the killer. WOW - and there are many more examples. oh yeah, and what happened to George Kennedy, he used to be great (Thunderbolt and Lightfoot / Cool but Luke)
