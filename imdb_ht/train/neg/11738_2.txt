"Iowa" wants to "Requiem for a dream" for Midwest ever, but it comes across as a hard R rated "Reefer Madness". <br /> <br /> Yes, the bad drugs, and methods are original pervert, as an addiction and how it destroys people, their families and their communities. But these characters are either dumb or ridiculous and the eye-rolling scheme will not teach that lessons to anyone. <br /> While writer / director / star Matt Farnsworth has some charisma on screen, his partner Diane Foster plays a wincibly unusual eye-wound drug corrupted by drugs previously saturated by Susan Sarandon at the "Rocky Horror Picture Show".
