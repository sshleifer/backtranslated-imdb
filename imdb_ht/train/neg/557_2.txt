It's hard to believe, after waiting 14 years, we wind up with this piece of cinematic film. The original was a great impact, the film thriller that achieved "cults" status demonstrated the fine art of film as directed by Paul Verhoeven. This movie adds anything, delivers nothing, and finally winds up in the big box of failed fails. <br /> <br /> The opening sequence could trigger an intriguing set of drawings by using a considerably talented and capable cast. Unfortunately, we treat in a 90 minute minute essay of the self-indulgent life of Catherine Tramell ... or is it Sharon Stone. It is possible for a copy of both. <br /> If the desire too is to see a continuation of provocative butcher's sex like "B.S.1", forget it. You wind up with soft-boredom pornography that ultimately sustains the old adage that a woman can have more alliance of clothes than out of them. It's interesting to note that the wonderful Charlotte Rampling was romping around in her skivvies, across the girly GEORGY 1966, when Ms. Stone was only 8 years old. An actress is very talented and well-liked to keep her own here. <br /> <br /> If you are a true movie fan then you must see this movie and judge it using your own rating system. If not, you might well wait for the DVD release of the "rated" version, "unrated" version, "collector" edition, or "ultimate" version, and perhaps in another 14 years we will be saturated with news about "Basic Instinct 3" at which point Ms. Stone will be 62 years old and nobody really cares.
