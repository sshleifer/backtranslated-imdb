I completely agree with someone in other comments should make a What Tiger Lily up with this movie. <br /> It has to be one of the worst French films I've seen in a long time (actually along with Brotherwood in the wolves, 2 horrible films in a too short time period). It is really sad because the cast is really interesting and the idea of ​​the original idea of ​​pleasure. Antoine DeCaunes in particular with Jean Rochefort being among my darlings, I was unfamiliar to see them compromised in a poor movie. <br /> <br /> Heavy Doyon is quite bad, as usual that goes on to prove that a beautiful figure and famous parents can get you into the movies but they do not necessarily give you talent. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
