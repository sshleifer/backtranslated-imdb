I do not get that. The film obviously has a very good budget. She has lots of good movies. It has nice rhythm, good correction and beautiful good leadership too. Then why not have to hire someone to make a final rewrite of the script so it would not be so damn cheesy and why for being hired as lousy actors who can not act their way out of a paper bag ? This movie could be good. At most times she looks good and feels good, but in the end, you realize that the movie was not good at all. So I would say it is a good production but a bad movie. Too bad actually. <br /> <br /> And eels? Come One, Really!
