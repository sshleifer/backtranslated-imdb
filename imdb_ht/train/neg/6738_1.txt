There were many films based on the same theme. One beautiful girl needs beautiful boys to impress the former, pay him, and then (guess what?) he fell in love with him, there is a bit of fumbling followed by a precedent before everyone Make up before the happy ending ...... this has been done many times. <br /> <br /> The thing I knew this before to start looking. But despite that, I was always looking forward to it. In the right hands, with a good throw and a bright script it can always be a great way to pass a couple of hours. <br /> <br /> This was not one of these. to last. <br /> A female lead is missing in charm or understatement that totally fails to light even the slightest walk in me. I really did not handle if she "got her man" or stayed single and happy. <br /> A male lead that, after a few of her endless words in wisdom, I wanted to kill. Just to remove this surface look. I had no idea that a life of a prostitute was the way to all-seeing Enlightenment. A totally unrealized movie filled with unrealistic characters. Not one of them seemed to have worked, all of them had more money than meaning, a bridegroom who always went ahead with his marriage after learning that his bride died with his best friend. ... more "I miss you though we've never encountered" !!!!! I could go on but I just realized that I was wasting even more time on this ..... I could rant about introducing a character just to have a very cheap laugh in the name of "Woody" but in truth was only remotely funny thing that happened in the movie.
