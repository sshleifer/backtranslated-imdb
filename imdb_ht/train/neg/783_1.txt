I watched this show and I simply did not find it funny at all. It might be the first episode. Recently I realized ABC is playing a lot of stupid show nowadays and it will go down as a station. All the characters on this show are very bad actors, but even if they were good jokes and script they are very hideous and would always bring the show down. I would say that I believe that this show will be canceled, but see how ABC is doing very awful for the quality of the playing shows, they might just keep this one simply because it's average compared to them.
