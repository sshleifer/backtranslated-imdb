I did not think this was as terrible as some people apparently did. It passes as one of these movies to your manure film that you can waste time and night when you can not sleep, although admittedly it's not better than that. It is true that the act is not great - I thought Marianne McAndrew as Cathy Beck, for example, came across as completely passionate - but the main problem is that several aspects of the plot did not really make sense of me. Becks are on a trip described by John (Stewart Moss) as party work and partly the bees never had (now this romantic!) Part of work has something to do with tourist caves, which in itself sounds strange (how was part of a travel group in a cave related to someone's work?) but it becomes stranger when we find that he is a doctor doing research in the area of ​​preventive medicine (huh? has lost me.) Biting by a stick while in the cave, he begins to transform into what I guess was supposed to be a human-rod hybrid (although when we finally saw him in his makeup looks a lot more like a Manape - In some sort) and a killing spree begins. Here's another problem. First killing is a nurse in a hospital. At first, everyone thought his death was an accident. The second mortal is at a young girl, who is described as having his throat torn out. The Sheriff (Michael Pataki) then told us that his death looked like the nurse (ie throat torn out? - How could anyone think that was an injury?) And what with the sheriff? It looks pretty no-nonsense until the scene of Cathy's hotel room when it takes a swig of liquor and then almost violates it, after which everything seems to be back to normal. It's sealed with an end that leaves almost everything unresolved, and also with one of the most irritating songs I've ever heard of in a movie. Even so, there was something here that kept me watching. Sometimes pure cheesiness can get you through an hour and a half. Pretty bad, yes - but not as terrible as some say.
