good master! (and that comes from an atheist), this "movie" is bad! Many <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> among the three men who had to eat their own digestive digestive products, had been cut up by an ax, rape on a broomstick, had the balls to blow away - former companion suffered the worst torture while they had to listen to the endless girl and baby's pointing to the kitchen table (like us, but at least we have the mercy of the mute button). The directors have cut off the pointless and endless scene with inverted scenes, our suffering might be over 30 minutes. <br /> <br /> The only things that made this movie flick at least a bit fake Emily Haack's tits (one point). <br /> <br /> forget it. Do not buy it. Do not waste your time. and your sanity. My brain is so freshen after watching this I feel the urgent need to look (and suffer?) "Scrapbook" right now.
