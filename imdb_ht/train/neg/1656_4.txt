It's easy that anyone except those who worship silent films will appreciate any of the lyrical camera-work and handled (but scratch) background notes that accompany this release 1933. Although sound was generally used in 1928, no more than Five words mentioned the story of a woman, unhappily married, who despised her husband for a younger man after a romantic inside the woods. /> The most bright scene of the photo of the jealous husband gives a lift to the young man for a ride in town, the procedure of driving normally until he realizes the man is his wife lover. In a jealous madness, he drives to head up towards a railroad crossing, but his mind in the past, losing his nerve. It's probably the most tense-full scene of the otherwise slow-moving story and obviously optimally. <br /> <br /> HEDY LAMARR gives the sort of pre-up treatment sort of Marlene Dietrich by her discovery, but her beauty has not yet been refined by the cosmeticians as they were when it was transported to Hollywood. Her performance consists mostly of sad and morous while mourning the loss of her marriage and only briefly glimpses in a smile when she finds her true love (ARIBERT MOG), pretty young student who retrieves her clothes after a naked swim. <br /> <br /> <br /> The scene of the swim is very short, slender picture, and not worth the heat it apparently produces. The love-making scene, later on, is also artfully photographed and clarified in the lyrical photography of most of the movie - artfully so. More that leaves the imagination and use of symbols - and this is the sort of thing that others claim the movie are some kind of lyrical chiefs. <br /> Not so. It's disappointing, primarily gross in its sound portion (including the Symphony Worker music in the background) and certainly Miss Lamarr is fortunate that Louis B. Mayer has seen the movie and on the base, he has given him a career in Hollywood . He had to see something in his work that I did not. <br /> It's apparent that this was conceived as a silent film with the camera doing all the work. The "worker" bust of the scene of the conclusion goes on for too long and is a jarring intrusion where they do not need. It fails to end the movie on the proper score.
