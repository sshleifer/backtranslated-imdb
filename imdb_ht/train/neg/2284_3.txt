Now I will not refuse that when I buy this on eBay, I had great hope. This was an out-of-print incredible out of the master of comedy that I am so enjoying. However, I was soon to be disappointed. Exquisite to those who enjoyed it, but I just found Compleat Al very difficult to watch. I got a few smiles, sure, but the majority of the comic came from the music videos (which I had on DVD) and the rest was basically filler. You could say that this was not the greatest video success of Al (who was honored to attend UHF). Honestly, I doubt if this will ever make the DVD jump, so if you're an ultra-hardcore fan and just have everything to do, buy the tape on eBay. Just do not pay too much for it.
