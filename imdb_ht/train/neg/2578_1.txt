To resume this movie: Without a real plot, this movie consists of 80 minutes of disruptive characters either drinking or making bad jokes. The music is just awful, the humor is not funny with all the female characters slutty idiots or total geeks. It seems to me, that the movie was actually written by a 14-year-old boy, who thinks that drinking is cool, women are designed to please people and all that opposes to seeing them geeks. Also, the movie has nothing to do with the original American movie cinema, other than a few names with Mr. Levenstein who is a minor character in this one. The only good thing about this movie is the girls look beautiful. Do not watch this movie and do not be fooled by Rating 5.4, because it's obviously overrated and it does not deserve anything above 2.
