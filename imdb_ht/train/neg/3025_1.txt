This film is really bad ....... no I mean really really bad. Tony Scott is a terrible director. Out of all the films he did me only as the enemy of the state, besides being one of the worst directors of all time. What surprised me most is Richard Kelly (director Donnie Darko) who made this scenario. Now Richard Kelly is a genius in my eyes but to be involved in this hope that he has learned his lessons. <br /> Now I love Mickey Rourke's new role but I cant even like him in this because of the terrible story and look at it. Do not get me wrong I still love Mickey Rourke but he did an occasion to some of his time and this is one of them. I do not know what to say about Keira Knight, I think it's a bit too tricky. I just cant feel for it in the movie. <br /> <br /> all of this movie is bad. That is ....... 1/10 ....... j.d Seaton
