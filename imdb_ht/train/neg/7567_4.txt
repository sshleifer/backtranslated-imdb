The story: Young-goon is a girl whose family has a history of mental illness. It ends in a mental institution after it starts to believe it is in fact a cyborg. At the institution she meets Park Il-sun, a young man who develops a bond with her. <br /> If you are reading this you probably already know how talent the Chan-Wook Park. But 'I'm a Cyborg ...' is a great departure from the habit, and (unfortunately) most territories. I'm a big fan of any movie or story trying to do something different. God knows, we all get enough crap to our local movies. The main point on the movie I need to say is that it fails to say anything about mental illness, or create a character that you care about. <br /> This story has to be one of the weird things I've seen in years ... but strange is not enough. No heart in the movie ... just surrealism and confusion. Confusion seems to be the main theme of the movie. The characters all try to make their own problems, but it's Chan-wook Park itself that proves to be the most confused of them all.
