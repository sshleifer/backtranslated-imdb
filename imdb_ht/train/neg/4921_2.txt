Put the blame on producer Wes Craven and financiers Weinsteins for this big-budgetary debate: an "dramatic" update of "Dracula", with a verbal gesture of Bram Stoker (which probably does not want his name on this stuff anyway) and there is nothing so much for the rest of us except slasher-styled jol and gore. Christopher Plummer looks reversed as Helsing's wind in the modern day - not just a descent of Helsing but the real thing; he kept himself going with censorship to get into the Dracula Count's cock, which is exhumed from his coffin after being robbed from Van Helsing's Vault and flying to New Orleans. This is just what New Orleans needs in the 21st Century! The film, well produced, but without a single original idea (except for multi-racial victims), is both vile and lazy, and after about an hour to start repeating itself. * from ****
