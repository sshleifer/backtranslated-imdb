In light of the recent Batman and the well-brave and the Bold's well, now is the time to bring a fatal blow to that mistake in the life of Batman. Being a big fan of the first time by Tim Burton 20 years ago, I could accept different tonality of the character, dark or farmer. This one is just not credible: too many effects, poor intrigues and some questions. What is great about Batman is the diversity of his skills and aspects of his personality: detective, crime-fighter, playboy, philanthropist etc. The Batman shows him only in his karate day. And by the way, how come the penguin is capable of virtuosity when jumping in the sky regardless of its portly cooperation? With the look of the Joker, a mixture of street fighter Blanka 2 and a stereotype reggae man, what Batman fans might accept as a betrayal? Not me anyway. Batman is better without the "article" in front of his name.
