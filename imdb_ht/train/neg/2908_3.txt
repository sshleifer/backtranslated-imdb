Based on one of the books by Gabriel Marquez and it would be brilliant literature, this cinema-adaptation really sucks as it's more like fighting rather than enjoying some cinematic delays. The story is about an old couple whose children have died and live a life that is dominated by poverty, and where the main character is a cock that hopes that one day brings some money for a forthcoming cockfight. I'm not in the mood to spread more words about this useless firefighter piece, just maybe you can see Salma Hayek here, but sit 90 minutes in front of your screen for just that? No gracias .....
