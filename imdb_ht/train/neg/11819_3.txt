Illere unfortunately think himself to be (a) intelligent, (b) important and (c) interesting, fortunately this film is about to thank quickly. The script makes little sense, the whole idea of ​​the sado-masochistic relationship between the two main characters is weirdness, and John Lydon shows us all, in one movie space, why he should never let himself out of music. Its performance is one-note and irritating. Only the positive thing to be said is that Harvey Keitel manages to deliver a good turn. Later his bad lover would show just how bad actor can act, but his miserable performance here is suspended.
