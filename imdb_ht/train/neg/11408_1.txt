This was just plain terrible. I read this book for school, I did as on all the tests, and see it like this! My teacher forced me and 20 others to watch her, and she was worse than Leonard Part 6, Plan 9 from the outer space, and Hudson Hawk put together. The thing that made this horrible movie was right enough to kill yourself. First of all, it was done on Hallmark. Secondly, the act was terrible. Third, it was as completely different from the book. Literally, it was so bad I was asking myself to be excused. Basically, I'd rather look Basic Instinct 2 than this look. Take my advice, do not watch this movie. No one wants to look at that. It was terrible. OBJECTIFY!
