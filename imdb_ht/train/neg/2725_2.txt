Chesty gringo Telly Savalas (as Frank Cooper) is a US-Mexico "Border Cop". He serves as a father of young immigrant Danny De La Paz (as Benny Romero), who wants Mr. Savalas to be the best person in his next marriage. Savalas is tough, but boss Eddie Albert (as Commander Moffat) can be tougher. Hard is that you need to stop smugglers Michael V. Gazzo (like Chico Suarez). You can get the association in flux. If you have the opportunity to hear "Kojak" and "Oliver Douglas" to explain them to think, you must direct the "Border". If not, you may not have the sale for the "realistic" cow killing scenes. Although it does not end up being worthwhile, Mr. De La Paz and Cecilia Camacho (like Leina) steal the show. <br /> <br /> ** Border (1979) Tony Richardson ~ Telly Savalas, Danny De La Paz, Eddie Albert
