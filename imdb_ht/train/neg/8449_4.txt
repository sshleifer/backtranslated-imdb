what a preposterous story, murder killings, sex charges, gays and the Catholic Church ..... absolute drift. How is it that most UK-based TVs, coms sites etc. have included the mandatory Gay, really getting Fatworm right now. Everyone accepts that Gay people in society just had other minority groups, but we do not want to ramming down our throat (I'll pass on this one) at every single show. Aside from the above, the drama went to what could be a tiny interesting story of a mimic, the priest was a pedophile and there were gays running on each side, oh yes just to be totally pc one of the gay couple was black . I'm surprised at ecclestone for even contemplating this when reading the script.
