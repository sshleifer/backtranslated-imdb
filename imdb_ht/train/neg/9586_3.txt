After the disaster revolution, this film was pretty much the final nail in the coffin of Goldcrest and thus the British industry. The film is sheer pants, it's full of music from the mid-80 jazz renaissance in relation to a book & author that was a bit popular at this time and she deserved to dive back into obscures. Temples searched for ages trying to find Suzette and came up with 8th Patsy Kensett wonders of someone who was briefly popular at the time. By the time the film came from the Jazz Recovery post production, it was as Kensett's career with the film had met a totally uncaring film film. <br /> <br /> Mediocre would be an overstatement for some of the worst / campest / cheesiest act permanently for the British silver screen watching it almost 20 years ago and the movie is Cringeworthy Trojans.
