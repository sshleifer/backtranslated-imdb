This movie was hard to find a hold of, and when I eventually saw it the disappointment was overwhelming. I mean, this is one of the great stories of the twentieth century: an unknown man takes advantage of the unsuspecting aircraft industry and gets away with millions of ransom without injuring anyone or petite attempt. With all this built-in interest, how can one do as a substandard, flickering-laden flick of this true-life event. While Williams is still interesting, the screenwriters suppose that D.B. Cooper Persona has been stereotypically heroic as a movie star, that's what we get is a kind-without any details engaging or browsing into the mind of someone daring enough and smart enough to pull it off. Harrold practically steals the movie with her spunk and beauty pies, but the real debris was in touch of the plot and lame direction. Shame on this movie for even existing ones.
