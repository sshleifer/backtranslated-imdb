I can see the movie worse than that, but I'm sure I do not remember. Or maybe block them out. Who knows, if I have been suffering from hypnotherapy, I can remember, together, perhaps, being kidnapped by strangers as a child, or other traumatic. If so, I would happily exchange these memories for those I have in watching this movie. <br /> I should give the movie some credit: It made an emotional response. I actually began to become angry at the false scenes of other films and TV shows, that this travesti was saline by association. I'm terrified that I can not watch movies like Dr. Strangelove again without this movie flitting through my eyes.
