Well, I will not criticize this movie in depth. I recall many stylish reviews in advance of me, and as I generally like Maria de Medeiros, I have long hesitated to make a disparaging comment - and in such fashion almost a year has passed. But every time I see that DVD on my shelf, I feel a plain inside. Anyway, let the stylish voices over me! But for other cinephiles like me - beware. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> in my life - through my diary every day at my local pub-European center. At that time, I was following the news reports, but never completely eliminated what the heck was sweating. Reporters tend to report either in non-partisan terms, or with a conservatisist who has invaded any group that affects peace or rebellion founded on the establishment. Those were moments when other winds of swirled swirled in Paris, Berlin, Prague, and various places in the U.S., everyone with problems I clearly understood at the moment - but dictatorship or not, my paper tended to treat The government of Portugal simply as the establishment - not as an estate out of "empire empire", is used to flip the Star Wars. So week after week, I read in disturbances, but never found a smart editor that could give the story behind them, or assess the practices and social-economic impact of the dictatorship, etc. So in buying this movie, I was at least expected: finally understanding the details leading up to the social hustle, and enjoying a well-known drama. This movie gave me both. The movie pretends that viewers already have enough knowledge and deep emotions regarding the historical fact. And the drama - well, as I said, I want to encourage Maria de Medeiros and the Portuguese film industry, but - she was frank and deep. <br /> I found my copy of the DVD from France - Official Cannes 2000 - Certain Regard. "The box shows active self-raze smile, the lead gives signs of victory in a fashion that reminds me the most The Playboy Bunny After seeing the work, I wonder what the French might think of - even though a deep piece of "true movies" with ethnic sensitive content, I can understand the natural inclinations to praise him for "honesty" It, but ... <br /> Look at the back of the box: "Unlike the Chaleuruex over the Revolution" - a warm consideration? Try to discover Allende's reversal and murder with a "big consideration"! Try it Czechoslovakia in 1968! Try it with the line-up in reverse, with civilian rebellion! <br /> Another review: Maria de Medeiros a renounced 'son pays, infants and his story.' Garbage, waste, waste ! least for me. <br /> I love Portugal .. Throughout Europe, Lisbon, Barcelona and Prague are my favorite cities.But I love being a city and a country by eating out a naughty movie. 'hanging on my old VHS tapes in Capas Negras and A Cancao de Lisboa - meanwhile, I stuck with a 2 area by the top title that might as well go to the trash.
