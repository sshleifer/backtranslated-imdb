That's the only question I'm staying with. Why does this movie suck when it has such a big cast? Why was it written very badly, leaving the audience completely unconnected with the characters? Why does it make no sense at all? Why does the studio take a good perfectly good and hell "Hollywood" out of it when it needs to be good, smart story says? Why? I never understood why movies that start out good turning into a pile of crap by the time they're released. I hope for Freeman a Spacey, which is Oscar Wins, that's never released in the big screens in America. As a person who holds a Bachelor Degree in Journalism, the whole story is just totally ridiculous. I just ... think the script was potential, but the execution turned it into a stereo, with a terrible one. Yes. No.
