Literally every aspect of this low-budget fiction science fiction falls under the categories that have been ranked for its pre-existing, contemporary, and follow-up. Bad effects, a weak storyline, ridiculous amounts of blood and gore, annoying and freaky characters, all you can expect. "The Sabretooth Attack" is on a new vacation resort where the genetically engineered smilodon cat proprietors for an attraction. The cats escape and start killing, the guy runs the show to save them and does not warn visitors unsuspecting, and there are a lot of visitors and some rebel employees and plans to kill their cats. <br /> Special Effect-wise, the movie is about an average success given to its budget. Sabretooth are described in poor CGI. Surprisingly, though, the cats look more realistic in a shotgun, detailed injection details rather than longer, the more vaccines where the CGI is better hidden. The attacks are impressive bloody and unattractive. As you would expect, they attack, rip into some arms and legs, and leave a lot behind. This is part of the movie's why the poor slock down. The draw and the characters are just as lurid. We have some college kids coming to the island and planning a hunting scavenger. And take it very, very seriously. Though many things have been misled into private property, unfortunate and secure systems, and steals. Why is a simple game so serious? Did I miss something? Is there money involved? Or were they sent to do it? I do not know, I could barely follow the movie. But it seemed to me as they just did it for the pleasure of doing it. Even so, they went too far for normal. <br /> "Attack of the Sabretooth" is a very poor movie. Even for a small budget sci-fi film, it is a very poor and cheap example. It will make most viewers and tears, be attractive for some, and will make you chuckle and laugh all the way through. And keep in mind, this is not a comedy, this is a flick of cheap movie, so it's not supposed to be funny.
