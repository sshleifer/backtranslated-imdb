The film has one flaw, unfortunately this defect damages all the credibility of the piece. It begins with the conviction of the Israeli occupation of territories disputing. It failed to address the Israeli reason. Egypt, Syria, Iraq and Jordan attack Israel. Therefore, Israel "occupies" their land, because these countries have lost it in a war began. The film also claims that Israel was challenged by the United Nations by complying with Resolution 242. The issue was, 242 was immediately rejected on the creation by Palestine ....., which made it void. Many films are put together well, and can really show the foot of mind, but remember, when watching anything, believe that none of what you hear, and only half of what you see. <br /> <br /> All participants in this movie are known critics in Israel, and some have made many public commentary antisemits, removing any possible credibility of their words. <br /> <br /> All participants in dire need in an actual story lesson teach objectively, not by some Palestinian sympathized.
