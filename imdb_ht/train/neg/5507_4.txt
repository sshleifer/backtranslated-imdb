This was yet another big screen screen for a US television show from the sixties. It is fun enough, but it has many formulas. Smart land Marche on Earth and meet people are not too bright, to look at it. <br /> <br /> The wackiness of the usual progress and the human, bridges, eventually liaising with him and helping him get home. Along the way she also gets the girl, Hannah. <br /> This is a nice outing for some beautiful Hollywood stars that I have not seen for a while. <br /> <br /> Pleasant enough to spend some time spare if you had nothing better to see.
