I'm sure surgery dames have been a favorite of driving-ins in the day. There's absolutely nothing in the way of a draw that you might miss if you were otherwise preoccupied. But if you need to get into the mood for other activities you've got some curvaceous cuties on the screen to get you into the mood. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It's set in the Korean War where a platoon of GIs along with a British tommy gets a little too far ahead and has to get back to the United Nations lines. Bad enough already, but these guys also come across a bunch of killing of USO girls and choreographers in the same situation. <br /> <br /> You know what's sad about this movie is that it took woman generations to finally get accepted in the Army and in combat situations. These bimbos from the USO put women's release back into light years. In fact not even the hard professional wizard wizard that is the sergeant in charge of these guys can hold him in his pants. <br /> But that was probably the best to remember some of the drive-in. This not cast is best with me not recognizing any of them for any individual effort. <br /> <br /> Operation Dames is definitely a team flop.
