This straight-to-duffer duffer is another nail in the coffin of Rick Moranis's career. As is the Disney tradition, the quality is sacrificed in the name of a quick cash; This is a lazy rtle and Moranis accidentally shrinking himself and some families so they can repeat all the best scenes of the original movie. Immediate expectations of the visual effects and dialogue of violence are many of this cheesy lamer, which has nothing but make me the bread for the days of 'The Incredible Reversi Man', then the kind of thing has done well. Shockingly, this is headed by Cinematographer Dean Cundey, who should either stick to the work day or choose the best material next time.
