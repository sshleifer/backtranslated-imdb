The quote of the movie was explained and if you've gotten this far you do not make me pretend that I'm a movie critic. With being told my own opinion in the movie is quite low. I'm a fan of Takashi Miike but that's down to the category of his work is not so great with DOA 2 and 3, and some others (many). The film seems to get a free pass because it's a Takashi movie and nothing Takashi can be wrong. This is a highschoolers approach to movies. For the rest of us we will find and hours and a half of a kid screaming for no real reason completely annoying (and yes, this takes away the movie), the pace of the movie almost reached rigomorti levels, and act ... well ... hmmm. <br /> <br /> If someone is a Takashi fan you will see it regardless of your interest peak. It lacks any originality (see the Neverending story) or any character development of the lead character in the face of other conflicts then a superficial well. <br /> As she pointed out this is the first Miike film that has been credited with co-writing, but that does not mean much as not to what we would expect Miike's personality to spread over to the screen. All we get are some of the Miike Shots vis-a-vis directors in photography. The film had the potential to be a great thing. The site is not one hard to run wild with. But this one seemed to have run to the ground. <br /> <br /> My suggestion is whether you're just getting into Miike going with some of the standards like Gozu, Ichi, and Audition. Then the film works like the Harp Blue, Fudoh, Rabbit Dog, Bird People in China.
