Baba - Rajinikanth will never forget that name in her life. This is the movie that caused his collapse. He was released with many hassles but crashed seriously with the serious financial losses for its producers and distributors. Rajinikanth has personally repaid them for their losses. Immediately after his release, he tried to venture into politics but failed miserably. It's a very bad and hideous movie act, bad-quality makeup and sc√©narious scenario. Throughout the film, Rajinikanth looks like someone who suffers from some diseases. I'm one of the unfortunate souls who saw Baba, the first day of the first theater show. The audiences were so bored that most of them left the theater before the intermediary. Sorry, I will not recommend this one to anyone.
