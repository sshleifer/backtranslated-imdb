This movie reveals to me. It may be that I'm just an American stupid, but I really just do not get 400 Corps. All that I have read about this movie has a total unlock, but I just could not stay interested. I'm sure he was like the movie-revolutionary revolutionary as all the critics say, but when he nails right down to it, it's just really really boring. Maybe it's the language barrier, I can just not "sensitive" or "artsy" enough, but whatever the case, I hated this movie. The story itself is not bad; It's about a young Frenchman who is unjustly treated by his parents and his teacher, and eventually ends in a juvenile facility. That in itself would be interesting, and it was, at first. There was nothing wrong with the dialogue, but then again it's hard to say because half of the conversations were not subtitled and for no reason, so I did not always know what was going on. But for the dialogue we could understand, it made enough sense. The actors were credible enough, but it is hard to say that a real person would do in such situations. So you feel for the main character, but only in the sense that when it comes to problems you think, well-absorbed. The plot is not even your typical scheme. Each time it gets into trouble, it gets into more trouble than the last time, but the reason is never varied. And in the movie all you realize that nothing the main character can really do about it. So it's more like just waiting to see how it ends. The finish, by the way, was completely on my mind. It's way too artsy for me, and I just did not get it. Leading up to the end was easy enough to follow. The structure was certainly there, and it made sense as well, but everything was really drawn. For the number of dialogues and important moments, the movie could be a shorter hour. It just did not end up. Part of it was unnecessarily long vaccines, none of which was especially memorable; for example, the finish was a clip of the main character running down a land road lasting a good thirty seconds. Now I'm sure there was some deeper meaning in it somewhere, but for the average viewer, I'd rather have gotten up getting some more food during that time. Or at least do something a little more useful than sitting and looking at this boy running, like doing laundry, or taking a nap. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The feeling of all the movie was that this would probably be very moving and just amazing and that he would teach me some great life lessons I could only find what the director was trying to say about it? unique decisions. As it was, I was just cheated out of a good two hours in my life.
