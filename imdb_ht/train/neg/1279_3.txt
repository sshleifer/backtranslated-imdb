Three stories were told in this movie, which seemed to be fired without the knowledge of being a composite filigree film. The makers relate to the three stickers they do not have all connected to Martin Kove shrinking, although you've never seen some of the leads with Cove. The first vintage has sexy Vivian Schilling, a woman scared everything under the sun (she made Adrian Monk look brave), she had a paranoia launcher tonight at home alone. You will literally call Vivian to do some ridiculous things. She spent most of her time in a nighty showing off her amazing features. But his movie is the worst if not the nail-biting. The second vinyl is owned by Bill Paxton as it shows the roommate from hell. His joke pocket allows him to take full advantage of it, and Bill does so every time he can. The last sticker was comical as a fear that death will take it at any moment, like pale ones who choke in death on an olive. <br /> Not very interesting, as the movie as a whole looks off together with very little thought involved. A must for Bill Paxton fans.
