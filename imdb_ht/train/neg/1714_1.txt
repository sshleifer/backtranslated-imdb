Once again a classic film was unnecessary remade and result of disaster warning. The title is fake as is all about this movie. The period is not compellingly reduced, and the leads seem to be too young and too steep way to be criminals. Arthur Penn's film has style, humor, a point of view, and was made by talented people. Though the 1967 version did not exist this would still be a necessary movie. The 1967 version lost in reality, featuring a glamorous version of Bonnie and Clyde, but it was interesting, and innovative for 1967, and had some outstanding performances that allow you to take care of. This 1992 reminder looks abruptly from the original movie rather than the truth as it was with the actors in this version called, unappealing, and not least the bit interesting. By all means to skip this one and hope the 2010 version will be best. Is it possible to get worse?
