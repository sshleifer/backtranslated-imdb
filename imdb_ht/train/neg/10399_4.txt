One of the biggest flaws in this movie is that while mocking in firefighters yuppies meets, it neglects to realize that the movie makers themselves are guilty of being one of those deserving to be mocking. One of the characteristics of these yuppie is the misunderstanding that they (the yuppies) are only sophisticated enough to understand art. While the film ignores this feature and instead focuses on the misunderstanding of dinning, I find it ironic that only those who enjoy this movie boast the same roar of films as the characters make of the choices of dinner. If these pompous characters in this movie have a video library at home, I would bet that American Psycho would be one of those movies.
