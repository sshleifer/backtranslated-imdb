Batman mystery in the Batwoman is, in a word, stingy. <br /> <br /> The plot goes as a mysterious virtual girl ("Batwoman") is intruder to Batman's turf, and while Batman tries to fight a penguin threesome / too / Rupert Thorne, she tries to figure out who is Mysterious Batwoman is. <br /> <br /> There is nothing tackling wrong about this, but nothing really special about it either, nothing really made it stick out. <br /> <br /> The Mask of the Phantasm had Bruce's long lost love to re-surface and mess with himself. Subzero was a great event in the life of Mr. Freeze. <br /> Even Batman Beyond the Turn Movie, Return to the Joker, Dig Deep and the characters involved. But <br /> <br /> But Mystery in the Batwoman had some minor subplots, a lot of formulas topped by a mediocre plateau on a cruise ship. Frankly, this is more Scooby Doo than Dark Knight, miss the punch and bite that the animated series was in its prime.
