The slackers as titles in this film are three college friends Dave, Jeff and Sam (Devon Sawa, Michael Maronna and Jason Segel), who are graduating from university without sitting in an honest quiz but making it a success. This continues until the very end of the unlikeable but most characteristic characters of the film Nathan (Schwartzman) figure out what they are up to. Nathan starts blackmail in order to make up with her dream girl as she cant pursues that in normal conditions. The only problem is when the trio begins to work on it, Dave falls in love with Angela's gorgeous and good hearted (James King) Unfortunately, it's not a brilliant genre movie. Schwartzman makes them watch the movie easily as its performance is brilliant. King's performance is average, I think he hired just to be around with her gorgeous look. The Slackers are reminiscent of American Pie with a different direction. The jokes are as deep as Americans. But are not they all used? I think this film is a warning filmmaker in the genre that they are running out of originality. In general, a smiley moment but a horrible movie in terms of acting (except for Schwartzman) and subject. * from *****
