This movie is about a male escort participating in a murderous investigation passed by the powerful female man's circle. <br /> I think the "walker" should be thrilling and engaging, but I was so bad. The rhythm is painfully excruciatingly slow, that even after 40 minutes in the movie there is nothing happening. Seriously, the first hour would be condensed in ten minutes. That's how slow it is. <br /> The fact that it lacks any emotion or action scene to aggravate the boredom. It's almost shocking that even the argument scenes are so plain and devoid of emotions. Perhaps it is because of the uppermost skin of the highest social class? <br /> <br /> It's sad that the "Walker" gets such a boring mess, despite such a strong cast. Blame it on the poor plot and even worse rhythm.
