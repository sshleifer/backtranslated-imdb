I'm both surprised and disgusted by those who claim that this film is so accurate on Vietnam, and never has. This movie is also true of all Vietnam wars as Rodney King's reign is true to all police officers. Yes, bad things happen (and done) happen, but in general people have the same as you and me. They have moral, they do not kill their cars, they do not make any drugs. Atrocities were exceptions in Vietnam, not the rule. They came far more often than the "hype" would lead you to believe. Oliver Stone has a talent for making movies that illustrates Vietnam's wars as this brutal bloodbath, but is based largely on reality as Star Wars. If you honestly believe the stereotypes of Vietnam, make yourself a favor and learn the truth. Reality: The Viet Cong and NVA did things much worse in the southern Vietnamese than any soldier in the US Armed Forces. Reality: The soldiers of the Second World War have treated the enemy far worse than the soldiers in Vietnam did, and were WELCOMED when they came home. The fine Americans who served this country in Vietnam deserve our respect; though the war was seriously fighting in a political policy, no one could ask for more from our soldiers, and it is a big mistake to assert that this kind of "fictitious especially true" is the way things really are they were there.
