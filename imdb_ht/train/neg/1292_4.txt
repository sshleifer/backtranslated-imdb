Okay .. this was not the worst film I've ever seen, but I've heard many good things about it and I was sorely disappointed. I could see where movie makers came from and were trying to express the fact that the two sides of this battle did not have a whole lot different from each other, that people were getting lost in the fight , etc., etc. (well, that's my assumption, anyway = ^ _ ^ =) <br /> At any rate .. kind of movie in my boredom. I've watched a lot of movies really long, but this one just seemed to drag on and off and over .. basically because I just could not bring myself to care for any of the characters. I just keep thinking ... who cares ??? I also found the act to be rather dead and the excessive dialogue. I understand that this was 1800 and all, but most of the conversations just seemed rather abnormal. No one seemed to have any emotion at all of the movie except during melodramatic events. <br /> <br /> The "Romance" of the story did not seem to be supported by anything other than "I'm a guy and you are a girl", which I do not consider much of a romance, and yet I felt I was being dragged into the belief that these people were in love. Oh well .. I guess it's all "all this horror around us, we have each other stuck in" kind of stuff, or whatever. I also hoped for some sort of dynamics between the two best friends (who both initially seemed to have an interest in the girl) but that was just sort of falling. Maybe avoid a love triangle triangles. I do not know. <br /> <br /> Oh well .. Daniel Holt was on the only character I really really love. And Sue Lee was all right. I did not exactly jake, but it seemed a bit too ... blinch, i guess. Jack Bull I did not care for all. And I'm pretty sure you're * supposed to * hate just about everyone else, with the exception of the poor people who just get mowed down the left and right. It was very graphic and it was that all the "horrors of war" stuff went down, but I saw many other movies with the same theme, doing better. (I loved the lot of patriots, for example, though it was a little emotionally manipulative) but as I have already stated, I'm a cynical. What's wrong? :)
