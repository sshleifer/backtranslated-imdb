I really despised this movie when I saw it at the age of about 6 or 7 as I was a big fan of Robin Williams and nothing he could do was bad. So far. This robin meets Robin for a long time. I only retrieve lately and comfy but serious her on Father's Day, but then she went on to create another mistake, Bicenntinial Man I think he called, but the point is. Robin should get better work by now and now she has returned to slip out with this 'classic'.
