If there were some unusual Oscar Academy's award winning festival this movie would have it all. It has all the gods, draws excellent, extreme special effects coupled with very good acting skills and of course each role has a celebrity superstar. Well, this would be the scenario if the world was reversed, but it's not. Rather it's the worst awful cops ever made, not just bad actors who look like the scripts from a teleprinter and bad dyslexia, but also very much on special effects. For example the devil suit (which by the way is a must-see), is something of the most hilarious I've ever seen. Every time I saw that the red-black so-called monster on screen I could not keep my laugh back. And the top of things it looked like the comic beast transported by a conveyor belt. <br /> <br /> Do not make the same mistake as I did. Checking IMDB saw that the film was released in 2003, had less than five votes and thought: - "Well, it's worth a shot, can not be wrong". <br /> <br /> Yes it could be. /> <br /> I'm not even going to waste more words on this movie.
