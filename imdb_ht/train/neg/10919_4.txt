Bollywood fans pretty much hold Mard Amitabh Bachan's consideration but I think it is very overrated. Manmohan Desai collaborated before on movies such as Suhaag, Parvarish, Amar Akbar Anthony, Naseeb, Desh Premee and Coolie and I saw all of them I loved so I had so many expectations before I looked at Mard and were bitterly disappointed . My main flu on mard is that it feels like Amar Akbar Anthony party 2, maybe Mr Desai runs out of mind, after all he's been using that formula for years and years. 1. First of all some members of the cast repeatedly from AAA, for example the police inspector who brought up Amar, the Muslim who brought up Akbar, Nirupa Roy and a few more. 2. In AAA Nirupa Roy loses his eyes, in Mard he loses his voice 3. In AAA has the famous song (Shirdi Whale sai baba) well in mard we have Amitabh songs Maa Sherawali. I saw AAA for more than 1000 times I noticed that straight. <br /> <br /> My other flu is that some of the situations just seem ridiculous, true Manmohan Desai has left your brain in the door kind of movie but with Mard I thought he was going too far. My last flu is that compared to songs in Desami movies before I found the songs rather irritating. I know he has many fans who swear by him but I did not like it a bit. It's actually my pain to write this review because I'm like a big fan and liked her movies since I was a kid.
