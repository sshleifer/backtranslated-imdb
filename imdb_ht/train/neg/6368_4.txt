This is the last time I rent a video without checking in the IMDB reviews. The Limey is directed by Steven Soderbergh who also writes Writing Nightwatch's really awful with Ewan Macgregor and directing these garbage as out of Sight and Jennifer Lopez's anti-talent. Terence Stamp is a fine actor and is a shame he has been involved in such a bad movie. There are often corruption corrections that seem like it was a last minute decision in order to make up for the shortage or story, filming and just common sense sense. This movie does everything wrong. What they thought?
