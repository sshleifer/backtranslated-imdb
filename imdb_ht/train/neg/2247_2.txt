Kris Kristofferson, in his drug-driven picks in the mid 70's, finds himself barely able to press on the screen with La Streisand's human ego and feminist discounted stores. <br /> <br /> None of the characters really likable; I was very happy when Ferrari Kristofferson went on this mountain and crashed. <br /> If you want to see a good movie about rock and rolling limbs, try _The Buddy Holly Story_ (made only about a year and a half later this drake).
