Tom Wolfe's, astonishedly observed satirical novel in life among snobberi New York gets a brilliant look here but it does not quite serve. The film suffers not merely from the culmination of Tom Hanks as a Yuppie incubator, Kewpie-doll Melanie Griffith as a manipulative South Belle and Bruce Willis (?!) As the New York darling in literature. The most serious mission was to chair the director. Robert Altman could have breathed life into these characters unlike making them interesting, but Brian De Palma, for all his sophisticated visuals, never had an eye for the nuances of the human experience. The resulting film looks good but looks blah toward its subjects of disunity in favor of status. Honestly, if a satire does not make the visual viewer, what is the point?
