So ... it's really sexist, and classicist, and I think he might not be in the early stages of the movie, like Stella saying Steven that he would really love to change himself and start talking on the path , and said he did not change. Well, he certainly changed his tune, and it seems that other reviews are followed by lawsuits. what at the beginning appears to be a love story is really about social placement with women as mother sacrifice. At the end of the movie does not make him a hero, he does all the sad things. and its sad that people think it makes him a hero. Maybe that's the comment from the movie that people should take away. Positive reception reflects ongoing patriarchal stream of social awareness. yuck.
