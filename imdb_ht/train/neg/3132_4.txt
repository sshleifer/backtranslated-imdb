I've seen awesome fantasy on IMDb, but I went to see it anyway because I'm a big fan of material-related Bible. The first thing that bothered me was a little too much Indiana Jones wannabe movie, but it also looked like Casper Van Dien did not see Jones's movies (but it should). I believe he has tried his best, but script just stunk. The music tried as well as Jones style. Great job, but for the films it seemed like too much work, as part of video did't deserve all that great music. Robert Wagner gave his best skills, he did a great job, but somehow the script brought everything down. "Joke" is old school, somewhere 20 years old; bringing only cynical smile to my face. Some really bad camera angels, SFX looks indigenous and unrealistic. Kevin VanHook was probably a good idea about the story (in my opinion, but I love those stories), but things just did not work out to the end. Perhaps it should be placed on a paper when it was still fresh in itself. When I (in the first minute) saw that film went to one of these 'low budget movies,' I hoped I would at least hear 'a good story, but sometimes movies just disappoint.
