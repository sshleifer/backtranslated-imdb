Banned as a 'Nasty Video' in the UK, Unhinged has naturally became quite a bit of notoriety. However, the most shocking thing I found on the movie was to entertain her in all the departments. The Lord I was able to handle: terrible acts, anchor corrections, terrible directions, script scriptures and soundtrack soundtracks were much harder to take. Three girls on their way to a musical festival accident in a ravine during a storm. They are saved by a friendly foreigner who takes them to a nearby home. The owner of the house, an old lady Batty, and her spinster daughter, welcomed the girls in, allowing them to stay for a few days in order to recreate. However, one does not want girls to leave their legs! One does not fall victim to an unseen attacker. <br /> When you take a long time to go and present some of the worst performances ever in a horror movie (and which takes some to do), Unhinged is a really awesome movie. The music is a total mess (it sounds like a three year old that has been released on a synthesizer) and as such, it completes the movie perfectly. Only a couple of hundred scenes towards the end and a bit of free nudity save Unhinged from getting the lowest score possible. <br /> <br /> If you are a horror accomplice (and unfortunately, I am), you'll want to watch this in order to tick it into the Nasty Watch-List video. But to be warned? It is really, really bad.
