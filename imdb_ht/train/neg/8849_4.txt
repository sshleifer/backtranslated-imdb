This is a very bad movie. But not as bad as it reputation suggests. Their production value is not too bad and has odd performing scenes. And she has the cheezoid 80's veneer which means it is always kind of fun. Look out, too, for Jimmy Nail's short appearance - his attempt at an American accent is so astoundingly garbing it to fantastic. Fantastic is also the Sybil Danning tube - they make a brief look at the movie but the scene is repeated ompteen times in their credits at the end of what can only be described as the 12 "Dunk bleaching remix. You must see them As a horror movie it's not scary, the effects are funny with Christopher Lee turning up to sleepwalk in his performance. I guess he's bought a new home and needed some cash for the deposit. The central character - the man and women - were so negligible that I had forgotten almost everything about them and I just watched this movie earlier tonight. Werewolves are noticeably less impressive than in the original movie, in fact, bizarre, they sometimes look more like Wrongly harmful. European environment is good with music provided by the new Babel waves band, while being very awful, making at least give movies in some added cheese. <br /> <br /> Overall? Good for a laugh. Are you serious about to expect it to be? And, at the very least, you still have to knockers Sybil la.
