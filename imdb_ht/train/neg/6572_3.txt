In my opinion, this movie title should change from the "only Brave" to "All About Lane". I went to a screening of this film a few months ago and was quite disappointed with the result. Although, I appreciate that the director made a movie about the guys at 442nd - a long-deserved subject addressed to the film industry - the act of some parts of the film was quite sober. Performances Marc Marcos, Tamlyn Tomita, and Jason Scott Lee were all great. However, the director should never set himself as the main character in the movie. Forgiveness, you are just not a movie actor. Wood in what you're good at - acting theater. Gina Hiraizumi's performance in this film was also awful. She should never give a talk and looks like she was incompetent to play part of a Miss Nisei queen. There were other young actresses in the movie that were naturally beautiful and whose performances were wonderful ... Why were they not cast for that role? Another big problem with this film was the sequence of its actions. The Japanese-American soldiers do not look like they were fighting German soldiers ... let alone anyone. This award was a low budget feature, but since this was a war-based film, is not it important to show some actually fighting? This film was a worthy attempt, but definitely not worth a larger distribution.
