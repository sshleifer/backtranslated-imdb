The original show was so much better. They should be left on a good note. This movie has killed the whole idea. It was boring, over-dramatic, and comical to have been far in between making up the slack. This movie really looks like it's trying to way too hard to be serious, and that's definitely not what I wanted out of this end. Not to mention, that for a long time it was just depressing about the same over and over again. So, sorry, Tyler Perry, but try harder next time. This movie is just as dull, and not that funny either. Padon. 4/10 stars is it. Jay Addison
