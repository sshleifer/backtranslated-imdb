I'm sure the way to the Texas / Louisiana border must have had a good laugh or air when Paramount's photo unit inflicted this one over the time of the public war. Very simply the area of ​​the Sabine River where the open film is land just like the rest of the Deep South or at least the South Deep was post Civl War. No large animal empire, they're far west in Texas, beyond Richard Dix and Preston Foster could ride to set up their empire. The film begins with two of them partners in a pirate boat and when Leo Carrillo tries to take a flight from their service when they do not pay for their livestock, they keep their animals. And it is the beginning of great Ponderosa as the hips begin. <br /> <br /> All the way Foster married Dix's sister plays by Frances Gifford and feuds with his youngest neighbor. They also have some further runs with Leo Carrillo. Anyway, our western favorites easters usually do not bother with geography and it's still a good west from the production factory of Harry Sherman who produced all these Hopalong Cassidy West for Paramount. The bigger point is a flame, and I mean literally, fighting weapons that should be used on a production A <br /> but I would not have any but western fans look at it.
