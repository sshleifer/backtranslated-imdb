I was waiting for this movie a long time. Especially because Juhi Chawla is in this, she is a great actress. <br /> <br /> This movie has six stories. It's a new concept flying from Hollywood. So it's not a new item. <br /> 1. Khamini (priyanka chopra) is a dancer. She wants to get famous and make up a companion to let news reporters be interested in her. But then Rahul (Salman Khan) appears and she claims to be her boyfriend. Priyanka Chopra is still not a good actress. When she weeps, I get annoyed. Salman Khan can not play funny role. But in his serious part it is wonderful. <br /> 2. Vinay (Anil Kapoor) marries Seema (Juhi Chawla). He gets into a midlife crisis and gets a younger woman, and to forget what he really has in life; his wife and children. <br /> <br /> Anil Kapoor in Juhi are natural actors / actresses. They are great. But this story is thin for them. <br /> 3. Shiven (Akshaye Khanna) is going to get married to Gia (Ayesha Takia), but she gets cold feet and weddings. Ashutosh (Joh Abraham) married Tehzeeb (Vidya Balan). It gets an accident and suffers a memory loss. Now she does not know that she likes her husband again. Raju (Govinda) is a taxi driver. She meets Stephani (Shannon Esrechowitz) who is a white woman who is in love with an Indian boy but she's about to marry an Indian woman. Raju brought Staphani to the man, but fell in love with her. <br /> I never liked Govinda's movie. It's very annoying, not funny. But in this movie I love him so much, as he's been growing recent years. Oh yes! Have Sohail Khan! He plays Ram Dayal who is just married to Phoolwati (Isha Koppikar). She wants to get some serious actions with her, but every time her family comes in between. <br /> <br /> Sohail Khan is not a beautiful actor, but it is funny! I love his movies. <br /> Now here's the problem. All these stories are not interesting. To make a story from six stories not interesting does not make the movie all interesting! Here and there are stories to earn each other, but not important for the characters. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Conclusion; Priyanka can not act! Released this woman in the Bollywood industry. Sohail Khan should make more movies, so that he was too young. Salman Khan can not act ridiculously, but real movies. This writes about his life as an actor. This film sucks, and it's a waste of a cast of good actors and actresses like Anil Kapoor, Juhi Chawla, Akshaya Khanna and John Abraham. It's just like you have the ability to make a movie with Amitabh Bachchan, and you only let him sing a lullaby.
