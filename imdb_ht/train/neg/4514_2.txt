The problem with the book, "Memory of a Geisha" is that it had Japanese surface, but under the surface it was all American way of thinking. Reading the book is like watching a magnificent ballet with great music, lying, and costume again made by barnyard animals dressed in these costumes ?? so far from Japanese way of thinking were the characters. The movie is not about Japan or real gay. It's a story about some Iranian ideas about Japan and Geisha filtering in their own ignorance and misconceptions. So what's this movie if it's not about Japan or Geisha? Is it most fantasy as many have said? Yes, but then, why do it in an American fantasy? <br /> There were many missed opportunities. Imagine a culture where there are no puritan panels, there is no conspiracy of sex on sex. Sex is natural and normal. How to handle sex in this movie? Right. Like it was dirty. The closest thing to a sex scene in the movie has Sayuri complaining up his nose and grimace and distaste for five seconds as if the man trying to mount he had dropped a handful of cockroaches on her side. <br /> <br /> Is anyone actually enjoying sex in this movie? Nope. One of the characters says to be promising but all we see is pushing away his girlfriend because it seems he does not want to get caught doing something dirty. This typical American puritanism has no place in a movie about Japanese geisha. <br /> <br /> Are Sayuri enjoying his first ravishing by some old codger after having Cherry been auctioned? Nope. He lies there like a cold slab of meat on a cut block. Of course it is not supposed to enjoy it. And that's what I mean about this movie. Why could not they give him something to enjoy? Why Does All Sex Have to Sin and Evil? <br /> Behind Mameha President is Sayuri's secret boss, and as such he was behind the auction of his girl. He could have rigged the auction and won himself. Nobu did not even bid. So why did the President leave that old codger win him and, reeking old-man stink, find his fingers all over his naked body? Would any woman ever forgive someone for that? Let's try to make that sense. Not being behind the Mameha President spends debt for Sayuri's Geisha formation. In order to recover its debt the President had Sayuri sold to Dr. Crab. Through the Mameha President has sold Sayuri's sexual favors and old ones so that the President could make some money out of it. The President is not her boss. It was pimping it! There are some romantic love stories. <br /> Yes, the movie is gorgeous, but it is like the beauty of a very beautiful, transvestite trendy voice, appearance and all touches are thrilling. But under this surface many feminine lies a menacing secret. Under the Japanese surface that does not appear in this film cinema that seals heart, soul, spirit and core film entirely to Americans and men. It's not the best thing to be if it's trying to be different than a lie, deformation, and terribly wrong. <br /> Some differences between Japan and MOAG: <br /> <br /> Japanese style ?? Refine, elegant simplicity. MOAG style ?? Beijing Opera. <br /> <br /> Japanese Geisha ?? Hair swept up. MOAG geisha ?? Loose hair that surely must have gotten gunked up in the thick paste of white makeup. Japanese peeled ice - The Japanese prefer strict on seasonal observations. Ice peel is forbidden to treat summer. MOAG hatched ice - The President bought Chiyo, the young Sayuri played by Suzuka Ohgo's wonderful, this seasoned Cherry-Flower-Look. The thought made my body tremble and cold. <br /> <br /> Japanese Geisha ?? Trainers trained and skilled. Moag Geisha - Sluts. <br /> <br /> Japanese wind chip - Used in the summer because of the sound it does, thanks to the breeze, Japanese people feel somehow cooler. MOAG van sun - a door bell! If someone stood in front of another's house and made noises and a wind shield should be considered an oven, do not get in. <br /> <br /> Japan ?? Emphasis on human relationships, oriented groups. MOAG ?? "I want a life of mine" Americanism. <br /> <br /> Japanese traditional dance ?? Refined elegance. A precision geometric and precision mechanical. MOAG dans ?? Martha Graham leaked out on LSD while wearing a blend of non-highly-favored Japanese blend pump. Made by a gay go down a ramp in a similar place to a strip club? Ha ha ha! Is a strip club where they did most of their research on geisha? <br /> <br /> Japan fire house ?? Setting or even leaving a fire breaks out worse than murder because it poses a terrifying threat to the community. Fire can rip into these wooden villages, towns, towns and cities to destroy hundreds or thousands of homes and kill as many people. MOAG Fire In Fire - Great adjunct in a battle scene but has zero division and because it is no need to fire out-of-control miraculously setting itself out. Technically the movie ended here because of the younger Sayuri being ostracized and putting his sister among those who never heard again. Where both Arthur Golden and Rob Marshall should be deported. The movie feels.
