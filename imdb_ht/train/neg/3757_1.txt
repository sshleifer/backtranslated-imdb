How has this been to existence? I generally like Sci F / Bigfoot regardless of film etc. . but I always expect to be writing without cheese quite like this. The effects were sad, the lines were sad. Avoid all costs. I only ended up renting it because it was in the wrong case (I was looking for the movie Sasquatch and Lance Henrikson in it - still not seen that one). The idea of ​​the movie is actually a good one. There was a lot of potential to make a great little movie here. I just do not understand how something like this ends like this. Go to the movies / art / English students who are interested in any high school, and find people who can write a better script.
