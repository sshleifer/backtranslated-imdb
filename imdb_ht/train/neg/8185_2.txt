Oh my. I decided to go out of the movies with some friends, wanting to look at one of these mild, feel-good Christmas movies, and I walk out disgusting. The movie fails. Full-stop. Paul Giamatti who I considered a good actor played his character and rolled just horribly, along with Vince Vaughn who was still a personal favorite of mine. They try and turn a Christmas movie, into some new style. The bad thing, mixed with good, but it all turned out very badly. The first ten minutes or so were not too bad, but once we saw Santa, it ended. It did not find any better, the rate remained the same, there was no character development, and certainly is one of the worst Christmas cinemas ever invented. Do not look at it, whatever you do.
