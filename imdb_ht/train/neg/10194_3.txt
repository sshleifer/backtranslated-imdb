This 30-minute documentary Bu単uel made in the early 1930s on one of Spain's most portable regions is, in my opinion, one of his weaker films. First, let's admit that 70 years later, Spain is richer than it was then (and when I say that, I fully admit that wealth can bring trouble to its own, such as excessive independence and consumption, though all in all its wealth is a far better condition than extreme poverty described here). But if poverty decreased in Spain it was not exactly the sort of socialism that Bu単uel favored, but with western capitalism Western style. But one of the most shocking things about the movie is this: in one scene, the narrator of the school chides, the kids teach Pi values. Math training to the poor, the horror! Bu単uel shortsightedness is at its most blatant here, not realizing that it is access to the latest knowledge and technology that will help the poor overcome their situation. What does it propose? Do these children teach exactly what is in the school? By Bu単uel understands that it is lack of modern technology that has been poor in comparison with others?
