This movie was a littttle first confusion. I usually like Gina Phillips, but this one I was saying was a bad choice just like making the movie Ring around Rosie, which is also one of her good movies. Jeepers Creepers have been the best way. Anyway, Faye Dunaway was good. It totally strengthened me from the end, that was crazy. It was about Jennifer Cassi (Phillips) who comes to his old twin funeral. She lives in a home that she owns and her grandmother (Dunaway) lives in with a Aunt named Emma. Mary Ellen (Dunaway) is something that sacrificed her relationship to stay alive and as long as she wants to live, she can not die. Even though Jennifer tries to kill him, he is trying. Cornelius has a strange part of it. When the relationships go to sleep, the ravens eat organs, so they can not go to bed. But they do. Basically it's crazy and Mary Ellen never dies and the relationships are buried, but do not die, b / c have to suffer forever for Mary Ellen to stay alive. Yeah, I hope this helps. If he does not, sorry. Love ya.
