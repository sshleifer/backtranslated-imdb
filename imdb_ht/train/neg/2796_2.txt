For the most part, On Demand delivers some horrible horrible movies, and only offers other horror movies everyone has already seen, and already has an opinion on. It was either this, or Invinicible (I like Mark Wahlberg movies), which I have not seen, and I was actually in a movie watching attitude, which does not happen often because I've already watched all the movies I own One million times, and that's a lot of movies, and I do not have much interest in new movies, and boys, this movie made me regret it. I will not put in any crowd, I just will tell you that only a few of the very few actors in this movie are half decent way. I think the main girl, the dead who kills everyone, is something that is harassing, but convincing; I would take it for any psycho bitch anyday, so it fits his roll well, though it is lame. The blood is not that great, only a few of the killers, or I can say "injuries" are okay, but you do not see much and no partial part of the film makes the wounds look more compelling. Towards the end of the film I asked my girlfriend to turn her, and being a member group, the registration part was not very interesting either, though what happened would really happen when going on the recording. I do, if you want to watch this, suits yourself.
