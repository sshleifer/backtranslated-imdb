Ok, let me say that I did not expect a movie starring Jerry Springer to be cinemas of gold, all I asked for was Cinematic ... and he did not even. It looked like a bad home movie. Illere acting, scripting, and full of films and stripping of the most unnatractive people I've ever seen. The film "Draw" film focuses on a low-class family who decides to go on "Jerry Farrelly show" to discuss several issues between a mother, daughter, stepparent and daughter's fianc√©. From there, the movie fizzles and develops into a unique experience: white-garbage porn. There are redneck gender, interacial sex, even sex between Jerry and his wife? (Yuk!) This movie encourages me to run out of the theater and get a second circumcision. At least it was mercifully short. Troubleshooting and degrading. African Americans and Americans working class should be offended. (Howard Stern would be happy however, he did not waste his attempt to film movie. It was smart, funny and fun) <br /> <br /> My Grade: F + (the girl was hot)
