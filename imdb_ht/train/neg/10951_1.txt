I have no idea what that idiot gives this movie a Palm D'or at the Cannes Film Festival 1999 because it was atrocious! I'm currently watching the whole thing simply because I could not believe that someone would make such a movie worthless. There is nothing interesting about the scheme, the characters are devoid of depth and there is no attempt to provide any sort of ambiance with music or sound effects. Also, if you decide to waste 2 hours in your life by watching this movie, be sure to bring something to the throw because the cinematography is simply someone running around with a camcorder but held and half the time you do not even can look at the main subjects. This style has been used most successfully in movies such as "Blair Witch" because it creates suspense. In Rosetta, there is no plot and no suspense that style would borrow anything. I should have known better when it comes to 2 o'clock in the morning that it will be terrible.
