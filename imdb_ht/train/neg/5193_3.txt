Another turgid action / adventure cops from the Martin Productions Quinn factory. Roy Thinnes plays engaging head of head (Mr. Head, for you), working for his G-Man Handler "Mat Mary", looking for "Tree", who's on a mission ... well, just watch the movie. <br /> <br /> This one deserved and received the full MST3K invitation. As the boys and various reviews have pointed out, the film "Fargo" has more Hawaiian than this movie. Apparently shot on a pinnacle budget, this movie included Hawaii's dive shop, gas station, and cheapo hotels. Zulu - later star as Kono in Hawaii-Five-O - appears as tiles, defeat sidekick Thinnes, while France's Nguyen model Jenny Craig diet goes horribly wrong. Others share the flickering screen included a drunken Richard Harris knockoff, an imitator of George Takai, a hit-and-smart hitch and pistons-on bandits, and the bad "Tree", sporting a British veddy accent. You can pretty much figure out half of the scheme of the opening credits, but relax - just enjoy the giddy gimmick in this 70-in-the-week movie. <br /> Every time I think of this film (and I think of this movie often), I catch myself the theme tape, written for flute and tuba ... no one knows why. <br /> <br /> Trivia Scores - Diamond Head led by Jeannot Szwarc, one of three universal contract directors who would attend many major films, in the case of Jaws 2. Others were Jan Badham (War Game), with a young fellow named Steven Spielberg.
