First, let me say that I'm a big fan of Ashley Judd; That's why I was curious to check this, her first role. There is no argument that his talent is apparent and his performance is excellent. I guess I can also see how professional critics liked the aesthetic content of the story. However, I like to think that movies are meant to entertain us and that is where this movie fails. <br /> <br /> Do not point in half, I find myself thinking, "How long have we had to watch a boredom store girl, carelessly standing around a desert memorial store, replacing the merchandise?" It seemed to go on for ever! <br /> Then I thought, maybe this is one of those movies where the director tries to close the audience in a relaxed state before striking them with some dynamic events. No such luck. The movie continues its marvelous, boring, unprecedented history all the way to the end. <br /> I do not say that because I'm a junkie action. I love all kinds of movies, especially romantic-comedians. But I hope to be entertained. <br /> <br /> Add the fact that the cinematography and sound quality are comparable to your neighbor's home theater. Depreciation! <br /> I just do not find out how anyone might like this movie. Zero-entertainment value. The longer 114 minutes in my life. <br /> <br />
