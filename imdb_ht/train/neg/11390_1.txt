This is not a movie. It's a collection of related, ill-conceived scenes and incorrect gathering that looks like the inadvertent results of a 10 year old and a mini-DV camera. In fact, I have a theory that the girl very abrasive in the train corridor - the one with the fatty hair, die-pan panel, iPod and nervous tick - probably shoot it herself into a creative phase. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This is a true and complete waste of time, money and films that would have made William One-Shot Beaudine cringe. <br /> <br /> The unfortunate part is that the endless series of vacuum-packed characters is the representative of what's happening for many of humanity. <br /> <br /> What's next? Six directors shot social flags at Wal-Mart snack counter?
