King's maker is a film about a series of real (quotations needed) events occurring during the Occupation of Portuguese Indochina. Although the costumes and artistic direction of the art, the movie still neglected to impress the viewer. Acting, in particular, was very poor. Some of the actors are trying hard to let tears and their accents, both real and fake, are very disappointing. The scenario was also too dumb and too stupid to be true and it seemed more like a lesson story. The film could not even take that sort of regular and centuries-old time and looked more like a botched attempt to make an Asian version of Elizabeth. <br /> <br /> Final say? Costumes and art directions give the film a breath of fresh air, but the execution was very poor and the actors could not even give natural bursts of emotions. In short, the movie sounded more like hullabaloo than a script.
