Flight of FURY takes the mantle to be very eagle Steven Seagal flick the movie I've ever seen ... Up to now. <br /> It's a painful with no action scenes of any interest, Seagal is not really trying in this - it's fat and his voice armed once more. The co-stars fare not better, were a rather regrettable charge of 3rd ratter. Keusch is very poor and comes as no surprise that he's also responsible for another couple of Seagal Stupers (SHADOW MAN & ATTACK FORCE) scenario co-written by Seagal himself is ridiculous inept. IMDb $ 12M was spent on this boring load in the toes - If these figures are correct I feel a big big tax as nowhere near the amount of money being spent. <br /> <br /> The flight of FURY is actually a shotgun for refueling injections of Michael Dudikoff to blink in the BLACK THUNDER movie - which has been much better than this trip. This has no kind of redefining whatever, Give it a MISS! 1/2 * from *****
