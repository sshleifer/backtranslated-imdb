In spite of Sterling's work by the actors supporting, with a clever script by Alan Plater, this film suffers from a fatal defect - the lack of charm of the central character / actor. One of the characters depicted Richard E Grant's character as "a little turd dog" and unfortunately this sumptuously went up perfectly. Nothing about his or her performance is credible that her lover and high-class publisher / friend would spend a lot of time with emotional efforts on her. It is rude, arrogant, selfish, self-destructive and quite annoying. The party called for an actor who can make you love him even when he was a believer - a Ewan McGregor, for example. <br /> All of the witty satire on the class system etc. were wasted, thanks to this disappointing performance and quite unlikeable. All I wanted to do was shake him and told him to get on his head.
