I found this to be a waste written in time, effort and money. I know Disney always shows the lack of creativity when making the "straight-to-video" film - but rehashing the plot of the original movie with a "new perspective" is an all-time low ... soon will be just to re- releasing the original films and new animations with new songs and calling it a "new version of the movie we all love." Nathan Lane's amazing returns to his role in Timon again. Timon and Pumbaa animated animals from the world of the original "Lion King" embark on a narrative journey tell us the original story as it really happened ... as seen. <br /> Of course Timon is now the hero of the story, yadda yadda yadda, blah blah blah ... music sequences are lame and the animation is crap. The vocal talents are impressive for a video feature, but then again, when was the last time you remember Matthew Broderick, Whoopi Goldberg or Nathan Lane were in anything of real commercial substance? In general if you loved the original you will hate this. She insults because she's unjust childhood and adult looks like. And that's about to sum up.
