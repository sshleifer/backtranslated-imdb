This version moved a little slow to my taste and I suppose I have problems with this game to begin with. But the first movie, it's a typical TV movie version of a game that means it does not have flair in the original movie version with William Holden. What could they afford to hire more than twelve people as expenses? Why move the movie up to 1966? So, could you give the little sister a line on the Vietnam war manifestations? Why not 1963 and give him a line of civil rights movement? <br /> As for the filing, some hits hit. Jay O. Sanders hit the right notes for his character especially with his scene with Josh Brolin. Brolin on the other hand misses a lot of scores. He is credible as a former BMOC jockey but he does not have the raw sensuality of William Holden. I still think Brolin looks a bit like a gorilla where all the women in town go to her on (forgive the pun). Gretchen Moll was beautiful but it seemed a bit too wise for her character to play. It was not the innocent project or ignorance that the characters asked. Maybe it's because she and Brolin were about 5 years older than the characters would be. But then again Holden was ten years old too old. Bonnie Bedelia was rather forgettable as the mother and Mary Steenburgen could not seem to make up herself if she played Blanche duBois or Katharine from the "behavior of the musical". <br /> <br /> As for Mr. Inge's play, I still feel that such stories of a young woman choose passion for practice still need an epilogue. "Twilight Zone" I believe offering a lucky epilogue with the episode, "Spur at the moment" where a young Diana Hyland was chased by a senior Diana Hyland, because the Little Hyland Diana chose to run with a guys who look like Hal Carter.
