Van Dien must be rekindled with the embarrassment of this ludicrously poor memory, as good to be every single person involved. To be honest I am rather embarrassed to admit I look at her from start to finish. Their production value is somewhere between the original set of 'Crossroads' and 'block block blocks'. Most five-year-olds could come up with more realistic dialogue and a more compelling scheme. As for performance to act, if you can imagine the most garbage porn you ever saw - one of those where the action is padded out with some indifferent 'stories' to explain how some chocolate broth chooses old blonde parrots Spit-Large by a couple of blocks and whiskers - you'll have some idea of ​​the standard of acting in 'Maiden Travel'. Worse still, you can not even fast forward to the sex scenes, because no. A terrific terrifying film.
