Are there others who feel like betraying me as I did? The first hour or so was very solid but the last. Oh God. It seemed like it was predictable with cheese. No breathtaking and epic like the whole run of the show. Most read reviews have been glowing but I really can not understand why. I was seriously anticipating that the overall end of the WAY earlier was but then withdrawing it because I thought "No, they would never do that, this too is lit." I can hardly stand it. I feel dissatisfied. I think I'm walking out the door to sell every season I own. Someone please. Change my mind. I want to like this. So bad. Someone told me why I was wrong. Great show. Terrible end.
