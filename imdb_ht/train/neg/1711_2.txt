Well, I bought the bloodbath zombie trilogy thinking he would mindless gory fun. This is what it is, without pleasure. This movie really is stupid, it is absent from any plot or character development, or any sort of scenario. The core problem with this movie is to kill them with Gore. Basically, each kill looks exactly the same. ZOmbies grab someone apart. Yeah, that's okay, but you need some original killings too. I mean it was really lame, every killer looked exactly the same, filmed exactly the same way. That's what killed me. I love Gore, and the Gore in this film was nothing to me. It was just boring. There are no scenarios, just lunchtime scenes over and over again with a different person. I wanted to like this movie too. I like shooting on movie movies ... like Zombie Redneck. But I could not kid myself. This film has good points, but not one of those film. I understand that many of the "zombies" helped out with the flood and there were as over 100 zombies, which is very cool how many people have participated and helped out the world. But in general, this is a terrible movie.
