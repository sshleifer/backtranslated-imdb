A high quality television movie, totally formal story of religious fans (Ron Perlman, who gives good "I'm not just the President of 'Psychos R Us,' I'm also a customer.") That gets control of a biochemical virus ( think that the virus comes from the movie "The Rock"). Too bad for him also gets stuck in a bank building during an earthquake and stealing bank and agents the government is trying to stop him (led by Wolf Larson's impressive physically entertaining, lively backed by Fred Dryer) along with standards "in this wrong place at the wrong time" spunky girl (forever Erika Eleniak) and "lived as a vlimp but died as a hero at the last minute" (Brandon Karrer). Does the background history standard provide the religious empathy (wives and sons die in a police attack a few years before). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> So. "<br /> Worth a rent.
