A typical Italian comes in the movie, original and good music, but with some crafts, interesting photography, but not fantastic, poor and at times confused scenario (eg role in the wild beast, and where does the boy come from? ) and poor dialogue, good ambition. The reason it's still (relatively) well-known and sought after is probably the naked scenes (including typical pseudo-coastal 70s) that involve a 11 and 13 year old girl and a boy who (Eva Ionesco and Laura Wendel) - it's interesting from a socio-political point of view to see how these representations of teenage teenagers are considered acceptable and normal throughout Europe (and US) 30 years That, then, now it is much more than taboo. The story revolves round the intimidation of one girl (Laura) by the other two characters, with his discovery of sex, a specific representation of a youth aspect life. The character of Eva (Silvia) does not evolve at the very end of the film and has already appeared many verses of erotic arts - no "come at age" for her: she is a very young teenage teens who are already aware of her sexual charm , but ultimately it's just used and it ends the movie as the girl is really still alive. The boy is totally intelligent, while Laura comes across as a very naive and weak victim.
