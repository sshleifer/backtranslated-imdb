I love Dracula but this movie was a complete disappointment! I remember Lee from Dracula's other film from when I was younger, and I thought it was great, but this film was really bad. I do not know if it was my teen who deceived me to believe Lee was the ultimate Dracula, and style, looks, attraction and evil underneath that. Or maybe it was just that movie that shame me. <br /> But you can imagine Dracula with an English snobbish accent and the body language goes along with it? You love when a draw has unrealistic choices by the characters and is boring and miss any kind of tension ..? Then this is a movie for you! <br /> <br /> Otherwise - do not see it! I was only giving it a 2 because somehow I managed to stay awake during the entire movie. <br /> <br /> Sorry, if you liked this movie then you must have been sleeping private and home alone in a dark room with plenty of homeless space. Perhaps you are alone in your home or in a home. Cause by the same characters in this flick movie seemed scary, and I think summarizing up the whole thing! Or maybe you like this movie because of its place in Dracula movies, maybe it was captivated by how Dracula's story has evolved into Nosferatu in what it is today. Cause as its film is not appealing, it does not pull you into the mystery suggestion that I make the Vampyre myth to fascinating. <br /> <br /> And in addition it has so much of that sadies 70ies feel about it. The scenery looks cheap Theater. And I do not say that reject everything made in the 70ies. Cause I can like old movie as well as new.
