This film has nothing but a religious device that promotes classic Hinduism and New Age Occultism dressed with Western images to be swallowed by those who ignorant of the fundamental religious comparisons. Tenant tenants of Hinduism include elements of reincarnation. (Some of the characters appear both at this time and also in the 1600) are obviously reincarnated. God is an infinite force. Life of animals and life plants are all the same. (This is Pantheism). Redfield tried to mix Eastern Mysticism with Western Christianty. His attempt at sincretism can be crazy or confused by those who seek truth but this movie is a weak excuse for any ultimate reality. As the announcement of former Berkeley Barb used to say for $ 10.00 will show you how to begin your own religion. As a famous prophet said, "Use the Luke Force".
