History of a man with abnormal feelings for a pig. Start with an opening scene that is a terrific example of absurd comedy. A formal oral hearing turned into a violent, violent violent crackdown by the musicians. Unfortunately it remains absurd the time ever with no general narrative eventually making it just too laid. Even people from the era should be turned off. The cryptic dialect would make Shakespeare seem easy to a third grade student. At a technological level it's better than you might think of some good cinematography by the great city of Vilmos Zsigmond. The next star Sally Kirkland and Frederic Forrest can be seen briefly.
