Very implosive, incredible, and incoherent Spanish production on ... well, let me see just how close I can get it. The movie opens with a woman who has one of her cats killed by a young girl. He then begs his lover to take him somewhere on his vacation. He calls work and demands that he has lost his vacation time saying he will pay for it. How important this play is to guess anybody at the end of the movie, because the guy, a black photographer, spies a beautiful Shepard Patty, the queen of his Hispanic horror movie, looks like his bikini head at the moment so he can snap a photo, ask it out of lunch, and then to its place at Mountain Witches - for yet again we are not safe. Before going, Patty must stop at home and loudly, "strange" echoes chanting in our hero's ear. Again, never explained. The movie goes on and the two stand at an altar, go to the mountain, and finally realize why the mountain is called Witches Mountain. You know, there are several aspects of this movie that make it much better than a movie movie. It has some atmosphere, some of the character's actors are really good (especially the deaf innkeeper and the old woman), their driving is at least enough, and the climax - even if it makes absolutely no sense to all - is well-choreographed (literally) with the witches of white and long black hair bracelets. It just makes no sense though, and that's a big negative to me. I could watch the movie once more ten times and I still do not know more now than I did after the first look. This is a big problem. The Witches Mountain is a curious film from the long line of cheap, atmospheric European horror film that is empty decades. If you can get more out of it than me, your best power.
