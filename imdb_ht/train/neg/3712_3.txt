When I first heard about "down the earth," I was very excited. I'm a very big fan of Chris Rock, it's especially hilarious in Dogma. But this movie proved a disappointment. Chris Rock's performance was not nearly as good as his performance, and the film was just very seriously led as a whole. <br /> <br /> The first, Chris Rock. He plays the whole movie as a standard comedy routine. Obviously, this fine works in the scenes where he was supposed to be standing, but in the rest of the film he does not. Even when talking to another character, she seems to be trying to make a laugh at people laughing. He has a few funny moments, but mostly come during the scenes (no wonder they decided to make his character a comedy). As for the rest of the cast, they are pretty much there just give Rock someone to talk to, none of them stand out. <br /> <br /> Also, the movie was wrong to direct. The film has basically a single-joke scheme: old white guy acts as a young black comedy. While I prefer movies with more than one joke, this may still work, and they were quite funny. The problem was, we saw too much of Rock and not enough of the old white guy. It's supposed to be funny because it's this guy who tells Chris Rock's joke, but for most of the time we just see Chris Rock, so it's not as funny. The scenes are some where they decide to show us the white guy talking like the Rock, in fact, hilarious. If he showed more, the movie would be a lot funnier. <br /> Overall, a moment of laughter can not make up for the fact that "down to earth" is wrong, and poorly led. This one was a very big disappointment. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> 4/10
