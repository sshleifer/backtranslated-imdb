This topic deserves a better script, with final results, than this movie serves up. The script is full of holes because it never conceived as a story, but rather a string of knighted knight story sets together. The gaps and the loose end of the story line are numerous. The scene where the kidnapped victim said his parents did not die, and they were looking for it since it was taken, it's just scarce. She writes such a cathartic therapy moment with the top of the shelter for Runaways to give her a "missing poster" from when she was eight. In the real world, if the head of a shelter for runaways found that he was, under his roof, a kidnapped settlement, what would follow would have been an immediate appeal to the police. It is a law enforcement issue not a 12 minute segment for Oprah. All that followed from the up to the end is short courtesy that I can only conclude that the first 90 minutes were for best exploitation exploitation. Funny, that this movie is supposed to be condemned. At the end it seems to have joined in.
