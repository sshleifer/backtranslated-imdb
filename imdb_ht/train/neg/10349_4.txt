First of all, I'm a big fan of Madeleine L'Engle and was so excited to see that a movie was made for one of my dear books, A rush in time. This movie, however, ruins that excitement for me. I'm sorry, but Meg was described in the book as there are carbonated curls and glasses and as they consider highly uncool. In the movie, she has straight hair and no glasses and is "the sporty type" with a deep voice. This is not how Madeleine L'Engle Meg's photos have to be at all. In fact, Meg was based on Madeleine's character and depicted how she felt when she was young. This is just a great example of how the book and the films are different. So, I would say, if you want to watch it for entertainment purposes, look it, but if you're a fan devoted to Madeleine L'Engle and it's Wrinkle in time series, I'd suggest skipping this movie.
