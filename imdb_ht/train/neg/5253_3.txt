The name (wife) of the main character is the German word for "Woman". I do not know if this was intentional or not, but if sure there were some giggles at the German audience at the Film Festival Festival last year, when it was shown. <br /> But these were the only giggles films got. Not that he was aiming for giggles, it's a terrible movie for Heaven's sake! A horrible movie of more than one meaning. It's a shame that a site like these was wasted and horrible even unbearable moments for the viewer (definitely not for the faint of heart !!)! And it was not even necessary to show all the things that are shown. I'm not even going to a moral obligation (because movies do not really have that type of job or function) discussions about what's being shown here, but this is a new bar on all "torture movements" that has grown in recent years!
