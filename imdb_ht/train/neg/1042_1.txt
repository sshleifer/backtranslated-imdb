First of all, write the script on a piece of cloth. Who needs more than that? After all we are not a Hollywood movie. Then get amateur actors. It will be good for the festival's hype. After all, who needs those who have spent their year honing craft? Then hire a cinematographer who does not know how to light. You see, if it's well lit, it will not look "real" and the festival people will not like it. Who needs professional level professional anyway? Then hire a ten-year old who has never caught a camera to be your operator. It will provide your movie that fully amateur touches that screeners festival will be mistaken for "reality" and guarantees that even if you will empty the chairs out of real people, critics and a slice of the on-smart audience will call "genius "because they will not believe that this was just complete amateur hours. <br /> <br /> Once you've done this, buy your tickets to the Festival at Bad Movies aka Sundance. tris trash.
