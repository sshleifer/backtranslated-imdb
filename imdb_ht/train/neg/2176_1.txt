If there are people in security, it's a comedy that will not close on his audience. Then again, maybe the worst thing about Carlos Mencia's comedy is that he does not get in his free high horse speech. If you want to be funny, just make a joke, not explaining all the reasons why you save the American way and your failed attempt in generating laughs. <br /> <br /> Hmm ... actually .. The worst thing about Carlos Mencia's comedy is that it replaces the ethnic jabs for legitimate humor. Avoid this as the epidemic.
