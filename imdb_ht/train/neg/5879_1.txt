I wonder how actors have been acting in this film. Annette Bening was really himself, half and half out, was faking or being natural? He did not make any difference considering that even though he walked on the ceiling he would not change the pattern of the movie. Brian Cox acts really well. I almost thought that he was still acting in this way, hard, dishonest, in an enclosed room where nobody really cares about hygiene. As for Gwyneth Paltrow, the question is what he did in this movie. <br /> This film is quite disgusting and disgusting. Who would pay to see such a crap?
