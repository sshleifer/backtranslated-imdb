This movie takes what could be a good idea, a 2000 year old witch witch and completely destroying her. Nora and Jim are alcohol that goes to Ireland to dry-out. They go to live with Him and Uncle. The uncle discovered a 2000 year old witch kept in the peat. He revived it and took the form of Nora. It can not be conventional, (more is the mercy). Nora, however, works on a way to do this. This is a Gothic horror movie that has been made about the cheap. It's a sprawling mess. I must ask why anyone wants to do such a bad movie. I was tempted to learn magic in order to make it disappear. <br /> <br /> Avoid all money
