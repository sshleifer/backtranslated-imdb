I saw this movie when it was first released. The memory of how bad she stayed with me nearly forty years. I did not want to trust my own feelings about the movie when I saw it, so I consulted a movie review published in a metropolitan journalist's greatest sentiment in the next day-confirmed, the review wrote that the movie was incoherent, indecent, and uninspiring. A little research reveals that the producer was Mary Carleton's star, so the sale of nepotism suggests the start of this terrible movie. The film list of many actors - Caron, Warren Oates, Scatman Crothers, Gloria Grahame, and James Sikking among others - suggests that he holds some promises. But the death of this film is attributed to its terrible scenario. The "Mystery" involves so dark and so little to reveal in the movie that the viewer leaves embarrassing from the scene scene. The film looks torn between being a detective mystery and a spying thriller but never settles on one or the other. The essence of suspension is entirely absent. The main characters resolved to play dry, kind of emotion in a fashion that inspires no empathy. The cinematography is pedestrian. The result is that the hapless viewer loses interest in the characters, the draw and, in the end, the movie itself. I am amazed that no version of this pathetic film is available to buy. I hope that if TCM gets a print of this movie and feels he's obliged to read it is safe to relegate to the place 4:00 am.
