When I heard that the officials in Hazzard were going to relinquish the current actor and a solid script, I was like, "Well, I'll give him a chance, it will not be better than the first, but we'll see what happens "Well, I saw what happened. I saw a great late 70's / 80's show that was a classic, fundamentally outraged by Hollywood. It's so sad to see that scriptwriter Hollywood can not come up with something original these days. They seem to take a great show that has a great target audience, and try to "REMAKE" the classic show. Head UP Hollywood ... it does not work !!!! Anyway, more on the show. I think they could throw a better actor than Sean William Scott (Stiffler from American Pie) to play Bo. I'm sure John Schneider is definitely disappointed with how his character was portraying and taking advantage of. Also, Find For Real, Johnny Knoxville, as Luke Duke. Which can you go? A crazy Jacky actor to play lovable Luke. That's my illness. Also, I'll give Jessica Simpson a nice woman, but she acts to absorb. Catherine Bach who played the original Daisy, was smart, sexy, strong, opinion and a good little girl. It was every model role girls growing! (I own the doll and the jeep - thank you very much !!!) Anyway, Jessica Simpson has played a smart, 2-bit slut ass as Daisy Duke. Daisy was never blonde. Why had to throw it. Jessica Alba would play a great Daisy Duke. He can talk to a great southern accent, and it is gorgeous, and they would do a wonderful job. Anyway, I would like to say that this film is crying something fierce. I feel like I've torn off paying $ 8.50 for tickets, and my money should be reimbursed. If you like the prince of Hazzard (the original series) do not see this movie. It will just upset you. CMT (TV music country) plays the replays of the officials all the time later at night. So put your LEVEL and go with the real thing, not the imitation on the big screen in Hollywood.
