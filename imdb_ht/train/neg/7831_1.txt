With MASTERS OF HORROR companions, NIGHTMARES and DREAMSCAPES can only be viewed as the absolute nadir of the genre that has started so evidently with the TWILIGHT area and the boundaries of YOU. <br /> Of course, part of the problem is that it does not have anything to be of any interest in a comparatively adult audience, rather targeted at the TEN-ANE-OLDS, who are only able to count-bags, and so forth. So, grossness is king, and king is gross. Stephen King is simply sick? In general he has the ability to tell stories of Bart Simpson. Since she can not read only her inspiration she is the films. True, the cinema is not such a bad place to start, since it was generally escaped from the onslaught of "realistic". But these films are only the rumor, not the thing, and if you want to write, you have to dig deeper. <br /> <br /> Of course, only PICKMAN had monsters as close friends. But even so, it should be clear to any bachelor's vampires by Dracula and Lugosi. <br /> <br /> At least AUTOPSY four rooms are a clear indication of what's wrong. One can almost imagine this pathetic dolt sitting as his desk trying to come up with something WRITE. <br /> No, your idea is trying to describe the horror of the system in which it is an integral part, making the Stupid stupid, but trying to come up with a scary story for his little nephew. Suppose you were paralyzed, and those who thought you were dead and started cutting you open like they did in these autopsy things! Should not this be gross? With that, boys and girls are the story. <br /> <br /> What about characterization? Oh yes, it's one of those costumes, who never really appreciate life, you know, and now it's too late, right? And he cried aloud ?? Well, they can not actually hear it, you know ?? He said he will go to call the hospital, but it's not like a big shot again, you see, lying there (or is it laying, I can never remember) and all. And he thought: Oh no please, please do not cut me and this is terrible, lying (or laying) like that ?? Now, would not be a great story? You know I read somewhere that a snake bite can do that, I think it was the great medical authority Agatha Christie. What was the name that snake again, oh yeah, a BOOMSLANG ?? There's quite a ring in it, not it. <br /> Let's make it a BOOMSLANG PEROMEN! Sure, Steve, is that great ?? except that BOOMSLANG is Afrikaans, you moron! But how can you really say that the target audience is children, and not simply mental damage? It's easy: There is no sex. <br /> Well, there, but it's the kind of glimpsed in a crack at the door of our parent room. Modern communities are really great about erotic aspects of the genre, the monster, the female victim, the chase. <br /> But unlike the UNIVERSAL and Europe, there is no idea what's going on. All that's really left is the giggling outside the SM club and the Fascist credo that those who have their sexual intentions are intrinsically wrong. <br /> <br /> In spite of a certain error in size, King Kong knew exactly what to do with Fay Wray. Freddy Krueger can only kill him. <br /> And since there's no real titles in this, it's his first turtle ?? not in any way that could motivate it, you understand, since what would have anger our puritanic feelings. So, horrors and romanticism simply merge with the grooming of psychopaths. Our hero, you see, is a rubber fetish, and can only get a better if someone touches him you know down with you know ?? rubber gloves (giants). And that's what's used in autopsies, and it's way to discover that it is, in fact, you know. Obviously, this is the author of the height of his inspirational power. Too bad and cut it out, because it might be upset five-year-old watching the show!
