About 4 years ago, I loved this movie. I would watch it over and over and over. But now ... I do not. Actually, I think this movie was great for Mystery Science Theater 3000. He had a bunch of heavy-heavy comments (Macaulay Culkin, Christopher Lloyd, Patrick Stewart, Whoopi Goldberg), and a very cheesy scheme. My favorite part is when Culkin rides his bike and comes across a gang and a gang member says, "Hey, Tyler! Where is Goin '? MOON?" Also look out for the classic line, "Do you feel in your toe?" On the other hand, it's better than the "Good Son".
