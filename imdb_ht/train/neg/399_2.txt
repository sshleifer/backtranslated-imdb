This picture started out with good intentions, the Bacon scientist from the theory of invisibility, and Shue is beautiful as usual in his role. It all falls apart afterwards, it's your comedy Hollywood comedy now, filmed on a sound and special effects galling, less any kind of humor, wit or soul. In other words, do not waste your time watching this. Find the audio tapes with John DeLancie as the invisible man instead, also starring Leonard Nimoy. Now that's fine, and HG Wells is well served, unlike this disruption.
