Although I recently put that on my 10th worst movie list, I have to say it's probably not worse than Burt Reynolds in the "Maddening" or any of the "look who's talking" end. Still, she's pretty nauseating, even with sexy Drew Barrymore playing something in a Holly Golightly horror response, moving from New York City to Los Angeles, but finding out she was backed by a murderous look like. Poor Sally Kellerman, an original actress of great reputation in the '70s, is reduced here in a pervasive supporting role, and Barrymore's leading George Newbern is the worst kind of sitcom actors, still standing for a laugh after each line. The picture is snake, but the Drew Drew scene is full of grief, and the identity of the psycho (although right from an episode "Scooby Doo") is interesting. But as for the final ... get real! Who has cleaned that mess? * from ****
