The only reason I did not score is that one is that Sibrel shows that he is skillful in the technical aspects of making a movie. It's a skillful technique film. <br /> <br /> What they said, this is a movie based on lies and deformations that are easily disproven. Most of the documentary was spent using propaganda techniques to hit the program space, rather than actual facts. With the Sibrel "irrepressible evidence" that the fake landing was easy to refuse if you know anything about orbital mechanics. <br /> I do not recommend watching this, but if you do, see it in Google video for free. Do not let Bart Sibrel benefit from your curiosity.
