Whenever an essential colonial history of the familiar plot (colorful assassin commits crimes, Columbo smokes out killer, Columbo becomes pest into the process), the writers somehow never can match the quality and interest in most episodes traditional ones. This episode deviates from the extreme, and the result is a great flop. <br /> <br /> Would you believe: Columbo never faces the villain until the very end? was tempted to turn it over two-thirds of. Oh, the sacrifices we are self-appointed to review !!!
