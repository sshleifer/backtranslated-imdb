This inferior end-based character created by David Selzer and Harvey Bernhard (also producer) concerns about a marriage called Michael (Woods) and Karen York (Faye Grant). They adopted a girl named Delia from a convent. Gene York is re-elected for the congress and presides over the funding committee. Meanwhile, Delia seems to be around when inexplicable death occurs. It creates rampage when it comes to a nice metaphysics, such as store in numerology, therapy, healing advice, yoga, tarots, among others are destroyed. Karen York hired a private eye (Michael Lerner) to investigate strange and bizarre events. <br /> <br /> End of this TV shows emotions, thrills, creepy events and kill gory. Delia like Damien seems to dispatch new unusual killings every few minutes of film, which happens to kill terrible land. Excitement excuses in looking at what's new and innocent victims can be done by the special mediative effects. In addition, grief mediocre, Faye Grant and Michael Woods, however, were thrown high, such as Michael Lerner, Madison Mason, Duncan Fraser and recently killed Don Davis, a Army commander back to act. As always, excellent music notes take in my omnibus I and III by the great Jerry Goldsmith. The film is only for legendary disco legendary disco. The motion picture is seriously directed by Jorge Montesi and Dominique Othenin Girard. The front and the better versions are the following: The Extremely High Omen '(Gregory Peck, Lee Remick) by Richard Donner; Damien (William Holden, Lee Grant) by Don Taylor; 'Final Conflicts' (Sam Neil and Tisa Harrow) by Grahame Baker. Rating: Below average.
