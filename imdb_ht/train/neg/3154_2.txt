Look, there is nothing specifically offensive about this film, it's just boring. It's a rom-com type and a finish you can see before you've seen so much as the trailer. The key difference is that classic rom coms are attacking their stories and wit and a lack of pretense. This film has no pretense but it really does not have any sense of movement, you feel as if you could get up and go away at any moment. The production of the film also had the feeling of a movie first made about fifteen years ago. I would like to re-watch a classic movie like Harry when Sally took Sally instead of imitating this valley. Oh, another big problem ... there is no chemistry. If you're used to seeing Michael looking pretty as the algae Vaughn, you're going to be seriously disappointed with how they made him look here.
