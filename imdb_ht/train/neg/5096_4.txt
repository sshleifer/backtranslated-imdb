Kurt Russell (like Steven Post) works as a mail boy for UBC TV difficulties (this United Broadcasting Corporation); it will be nowhere to work, offering ridiculous projects such as "Dr. Lincoln's dog dog" to studio executives - because Lincoln, doctors, and dogs are popular. Director of Programming Joe Flynn (as Francis X. Wilbanks) wisely dismissed Mr. Russell's proposal, but he has no idea how to choose a hit TV show. His secretary Heather North (as Jennifer Scott), who makes double assignments as Russell's girlfriend, has a chimpanzee that bugs the heel from Russell when he wants to watch TV. Turn out, the monkey will watch all the popular shows, and can easily choose to hit them. Russell discovers the talent of the chimp, and uses it to advance his career. Understand that, things become HAIRY for Russell and the cast! <br /> <br /> Raffles the chimp (busy by Frank Lamping) doing well; Raffles look bored and / or disturbed during a few scenes, when the chimp is supposed to look interested; These could be corrected and re-taken or corrected. An over satirical edge is present - imagine a monkey picking hit TV shows! AND, it's a monkey that gets a beer during the advertisements (drinking in a Disney movie)! A look at the cast will reveal the bunch of TV actors pleased to recognize and try to put. You could make a drink game, in honor of beer-guzzling raffles, by guessing actors, and where you first saw them. Here's a start - Hey, is not that "Dr. Bellows" from "I dream to Jeannie"? Down the Peel! <br /> <br /> **** Barefoot Executive (1971) Robert Butler ~ Kurt Russell, Joe Flynn, Jan Ritter
