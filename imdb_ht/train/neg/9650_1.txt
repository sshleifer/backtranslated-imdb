Maaan, where I start with this horrible movie god. Bad bad story is bad. I do not know what the director thought when he made this movie. Namaste London was quite an enjoyable movie to be honest .. though the band was good. But in this one .. my good one .. for a movie that is supposed to be a single music .. the songs are soooo bad. AR Rahman would be the director of the music. <br /> <br /> Give two great actors a better job they should have done by the director. Even though the first half absorbs, the last 30 mins of the movie are OK. Performances from Salman and Ajay saves the movie from being a total disaster. <br /> <br /> Look at it if you have nothing better to do. The last good movie from Bollywood I watched (and I watched a charge at them) is Dev D and Waking South.
