Well, friends, a serious movie scrub is hoping to watch all kinds of films, the bad as well as the good, and this film puts me to the test. I will not despise the words. This movie was bad. The story was bad. The act was bad. Still the wonderful Sissy Spacek did nothing to make this movie better. Indeed I was wondering why I even bother to see this rotten movie waste? Why did I waste my time and money on something that I suspect would be bad? The answer is, of course, that I'm a movie scrub and therefore can not avoid what should be avoided otherwise. I will not waste your time explaining what exactly was wrong with this amateur movie, except to say that the quality of the act, to put it politely, subjugated. A serious movie scrub might want to take responsibility for watching this movie. Otherwise. Stay home, do not waste your time, read a book, get taken to work or you or a good sandwich.
