Hanna-Barbera sucks the life from another famous property. Violence is watering down, stories are formulaic, the animation is bad, the music is reckless and repetitive, and frankly, the show is just not funny. <br /> At this time, HB puts all one in its series in the same clich√© situations, regardless of whether it fit the world of the cartoon or not. So Popeye and Bluto appear in a renewable segment as cavemen ("Hey! Popeye is popular, with the popular Flinstones .. Put 'em together, and you can not miss!"). Also, in a apparent Ripoff of "Private Benjamin," Olive Oyl and the Goon have a regular segment that features them as recruiting new armies. Seriously! Why? <br /> <br /> Adding to the annoying factor are publicity announcements in every episode (standard practice at the time for animated cartoons, but still annoying). Popeye connects his nephew to cross the street safely, recycling, and - are you ready for this? - The dangers of smoking! (I swear I do not.) <br /> <br /> The only charming remains of the original cartoon is that Jack Mercer, the voice of Popeye from the early days, continues the role here. > <br /> Worth check out once just to get a new appreciation for the old Fleischer shorts. Otherwise, avoid at all costs.
