This movie was bad. This movie was awful. The act was bad. The environment was unrealistic. The story was absurd: A comet that appeared once in eons is set to appear one night. Most of the world's population decided to watch this committing. Then everyone in the morning but a few chooses some who have returned to dust from the committing radiation. Men's clothes are still intact, there are still plants that are alive, but the people have returned to dust. There is no bone, nothing. This ridiculous. How radiation can burn people, but leave the clothes and other biological substances intact? <br /> <br /> Even better, the comet underworld mutations of zombie eating meat monsters. Makeup would not even look awful at a newborn child. Personal sort of Posse makes me afraid ... and they're supposed to look stupid. Then there were survivors. People surrounded by steel when the comet passed was killed out of zombie domes and deaths. How to block steel a committing radiation that allegedly incinerates the trains? <br /> <br /> Equally insulting is the 60 music music horror music playing in the background of the movie part, or 80 hair of stone that serves no purpose in the movie and makes you want to shoot your TV . <br /> <br /> The stupid part of the movie, however, is the characters it focuses on: two Valley girls and chattels from Star Trek: Voyager. These three characters were totally unrealistic. Who would spoil the day after an apocalypse and meat eating mutants run everywhere? There were four 5 minute horror scenes in the movie all, and most of them dreamed. In between these scenes is sophisticated dialogue that makes South Park seem intelligent. The silence among the elemental dialogue was painful. I could make a better movie with four monkeys and bags in Cheetos. Do not see this movie, ever.
