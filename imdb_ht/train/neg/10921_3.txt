I make a point out of watching movies frequently, and the Sci-Fi original cinema movies tend to be one of the best sources for those movies you can find. As such, I'm sure you can imagine my disappointment when I saw Sands in Oblivion. The act was uncharacteristically sub-par, as opposed to the emergence of dry-sex usually belongs to our store. Some cameos made by someone you would most likely recognize, although you may not know their names by heart. CGI's special effects are minimal, and as such, one of the largest sources of comedy in a Sci-Fi feature is missing. Sure, there are some funny moments like when a guy gets off by a bulldozer, or when the main character leaves his friends dead in order to save a girl he was known for a couple of days but In general, it ends up just do not have you rolling on the floor and laughing, and I consider that a great disappointment. <br /> If I was rating on a 10-star scale made specifically to jury-made for TV movies, I'd probably give it a 4, maybe even a 5. A real shame that I can have to wait 'till The next sci-fi movie originally to get a good laugh, and I really hope that this movie is not part of some overall quality boosts in Sci-Fi's original cinema.
