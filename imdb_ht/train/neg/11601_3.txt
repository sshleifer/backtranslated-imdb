A nightmare on Elm Street: Children of dreams, the fifth installment of the nightmare on Elm Street series and the worst end of the series, even worse than a nightmare on Elm Street 2. I was lucky enough to get nightmares on Elm Street DVD box set for my birthday and I watched all the suites. The child of dreams was the worst without a doubt, I was amazed too much since doing so well with the last two at the end. But I guess they just lost the charm, the story was just ridiculous and I was not happy with where he went. Alice just became even annoying, not Nancy or Kirsten, so she brought this movie on her own did not work for me. Freddy is also freeing her fear, this was just getting a bit funny. Alice is back and she's wearing a baby, she might not be happy with her life. But Freddy is also back and he will not be too light on it since he beat it easily into the fourth movie. But, any way, he wants his child to be born in the world anymore. Have you ever wondered whether Freddy was also parent? Well that's what a nightmare on Elm Street: the dreamed child and Alice soon find out that Freddy's childhood was like and maybe this is one thing that can defeat him. <br /> A nightmare on Elm Street: Dream kids is just all in all a bad movie and an insult to the series. I do not think anyone would be happy with this end. Just the story was really amazing, I mean he could possibly work, but once again, he just executed the wrong way. I know that if you're looking to see the suites for the Nightmare on Elm Street series, you should look it, but I really would not recommend it, it's not worth it, at least in my opinion. <br /> <br> 3/10
