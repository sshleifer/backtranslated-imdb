The only reason I commented is because I finally figured out why Dr. Cox was bald. Although we probably all realize it at the same time this week, Dr. Cox is bald because they show these episodes in a different order than they are filmed. The latest episode when wet our favorite, Jesus-loving Nurse Roberts dies Dr. Cox pulling himself. They must have shown them out of order for some odd reasons and forget to slip up the continuity. For shame, scrubs. They made mistakes like that before. I remember when Elliot tries to date Scott Foley and her hair is wet 2 seconds before it hit her. I try not to notice things, but my favorite show needs her step.
