Dire. Just wait. The script is opposite, painful act, and the story just drags together. It is, without a doubt, a celebration of Sally Potter and little else. This should not be so bad, but it is the director, writer and star of the movie, and so is just self-glorifying. I found I do not care about the romance developed between the two characters, and the finish did not come a moment too soon. It has two traits. The first is that a lot of shots are really nice, particularly in Paris, and look rather good in black and white. Secondly, if you're a fan of tango or not, the music is not great, excellent (except where Sally starts singing). Watch this movie at your own risk, or need an unwitting laugh. I am sure he appeals to someone. Statistics, it has.
