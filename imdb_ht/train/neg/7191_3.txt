See it last night at Midnight Slam at the World Heritage Film Festival in Montreal. What a disappointment. This film is clearly rated by IMDb fans. The act was only regular. The direction did not bring anything new or interesting. The plot misses considerably: The movie is all about these college graduates and the game to play appeal to prank (7th Century 5ive). And on top of that, you can predict the movie end in the first five minutes. If you like appealing prank with a slasher and an ax that makes you jump only once or twice during the entire movie, you might like it. If you do not, this movie is not worth it.
