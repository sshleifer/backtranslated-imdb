More wide-eyed, hysterical 50s hyper-cheerfulness that gives new meaning to anti-social, pathological behavior. Danza and Grayson will let you beg for mercy. It's a shame that all involved in doing this movie are now dead (or nursing homes). I just thought about calling for torture. As this film began to trigger its aggressive aggressive aggression on my poor, ear ears, I felt instantly, strongly wrapped around my whole body. This muscular muscular vibrato can break Soviet tanks into small bits, nevermind glass. <br /> <br /> "Why do not you change the channel if you did not like it?" You might ask angry. Fair points, fair points ... The answer is that I wanted, but the pain was so sudden and diligent that I fell into the floor, writhing in agony. And last of all my energy, I tried to reach the remote, but could not. A funny sailor and talented doubt in singing and an annoying voice was discovered by Niven, who then "pigmalionized" him. Lanza is in love with Grayson asymmetric, but he predicted to treat him with contempt until they finally hook up. This might seem like a rather thin plot, but this noisy sound is so shock-filled in songs and music that there barely any dialogue at all. This movie is RELENTLESS. Forget about hype torture and prison war with "The Slayer's Reign" (as in a South Park episode). Whatever little conversation there are amongst the funny adults who infest this strange world's 50s music, it's all infantile - as if They were all 6-year-olds who have imitated growth-ups.I can only envy those who find movies like this funny. It must be great that they were easy-to-please: what a world of wonder would open up to me, if only I could enjoy any funny old funny as hilarious, funny gut-rustic. <br /> But let's examine this phenomenon, the 50s music. My best guess is that 50s musicals offer more day- Dreamlike idealist among us a glimpse of Utopia or Heaven (depending on whether you're church-gone or Lenin's-tomb-will), or at least very cheesy version of these fantasy- inspired places. TTONO is more analogous to a The representation of Hell, but that's just me. I do not seem to "get" music. People talk, have a story - but then all-to-a-awesome Everyone's inspiration begins to sing for about 4 minutes after they are abruptly calmed down and then pretend as if nothing strange happened! When you think about it, the musicals are strangers than any science-fiction films. <br /> <br /> Worse yet, TTONO (my favorite quality in pizza, BW) is not just a 50s music but one and squealing opera. Opera is proof that there is something like subtraction of a voice - at the point where it becomes an ear to perception of weapons rather than a means of bringing pleasure to listen. The clear example of this travesti is when Lanza and Grayson unite the Dark Side vocals for a really unbearable reason. I tried to lower the volume. I lowered it from 18 to 14. Then from 14 to 10. Then 8. I ended up lowering it to a 1, which is usually so much that it was only heard by dogs specially trained and certain types of marsupials , and again I still might hear these brains like donkeys! <br /> Take the scene of the small boat in the river. Danza starts off with one of her deafening, brain-kill tunes, and then ... there's nothing. No animal anywhere to be seen. Even the crocodiles, who are mostly deaf, have all but left. If you look closely, you might even see the trees change color, from yellow to yellow, in a matter of minutes. No, this was not a continuous error, it was plainly drawn to the old Flora. And these trees were just painted! Imagine how real trees would react. The <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Humans - hence can only take a lot of pain before committed suicide in spontaneous self-explosion. I can listen to most, least band-friendly metal deaths for hours, but give me just one minute to a soprano and I get a split head.
