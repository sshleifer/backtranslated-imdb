Ploton is Vietnam's war as Rocky IV is weight weight championship weight. Oliver Stone's story of experience in a U.S. Army platoon in Vietnam in 1968 is so rampant at ridiculous. While most or all of the events in Platon have reached the 10 year span of US military involvement in Vietnam, in displaying things happening in a small group of people as a short-time frame (week) gives a horrible picture ditch in the war. In Platon, the men in the platoon see all of this in a week or two: US soldiers killed civilians, US Soldiers violated civilians, a US Sergeant killed another US Sergeant, a US private killing a US employee Sgt., US soldiers killed / injured by fire friendly, 90% + were killed or injured on the platoon. For rock to try this film as a typical experience of a US soldier in Vietnam is a shame. From Vietnam's film I would recommend that we were Soldiers (the true story of arguing the worst battle for U.S. soldiers in Vietnam) and the HBO A brightly shining sunset.
