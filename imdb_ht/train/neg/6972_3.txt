When I first saw the cover of this movie (a giant bug pursued a few nurses) And the name "Blue Monkey", I knew I was not in for any great Hollywood movie. I was pleasantly surprised to see Steve Railsback this cheeky ball-flicker movie, who always does a good job in whatever role he tackles .... The FXs are very unreal, not too much in a draw, and I still do not certain why this film is called Blue Monkey, because there is nothing in this film to do with monkeys. But come on people, what did you expect ?? It's not really as bad as it looks ... If you enjoy the old 50-year-old black and white film bug film attack, this one is basically an upgrade version, without the latest special FX
