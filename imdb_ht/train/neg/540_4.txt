ALL for love (as it was titled when it was broadcast on the weekend) is a romantic period drama featuring Captain Saint Ives a French officer in Napoleon`s army captured by the British and imprisoned in Scotland where he meets and falls in love with a young girl who visits the prison. There is also a storyline involving a murder. <br /> I'm honest and confessed that I did not take the film since I'm not much of a fan of period periods and the scenario feels a bit of episodes but I'll say that this is quite acted by Everyone involved and he`s got a good cast that features Miranda Richardson, Anna Friel, Richard E Grant, Michael Gough and Jason Isaacs. Costume design as you can expect is also excellent <br /> I will be very surprised if this movie does not get any complaints after being broadcast on the BBC's teatime. Captain Saint Ives lies in bed with a whore where a nipple is fully exposed and there is a scene of French immersed babies including full nudity men in front of not mentioning a murder scene where blood is clearly seen. You really have to worry if BBC planners have any kind of sign as they are doing
