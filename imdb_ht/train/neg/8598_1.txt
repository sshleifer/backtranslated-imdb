Just kidding! This was one of the worst movies I've ever seen! It was so bad though, that it was hilarious. My friend and I praised him because he looked so bad. Chewing old horror cheats are always good for some laughs. The scheme stunk, some of the armed voices, the quality was horrendous. But I'm sure there was a blast watching it!
