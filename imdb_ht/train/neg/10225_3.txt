Now I'll be the first person to admit it when I say something that can speak blasphemous or unjust, so I would like to apologize for myself to ranting about how much I neglected this movie. Her psalm too. I licked this movie. To be more specific, I neglected the concept of this movie. The building was good. The atmosphere was nice. And the act was satisfactory. However, the story is tired, inaccurate and error. It is also offensive. <br /> I'm a Cree American Cree, and for some reason I feel insulted, on a personal level, by the nature of Whitaker's character. First of all, she is a black guy. And this is not a racist remarks, I swear. The thought of a white, Spanish or even American Indian swing a katana on a three-salvation all that Katana represents. The Katana represents the soul of a Samurai, imbibed with the souls of the ancestors who guided and protected the Samurai. For the Holy Dog to use his weapon instead of the Katana is also a reproach of the blade and the soul inside, and where does the heck find a katana anyway? It must be one of those repicas, which insults the Samurai helmet even more. <br /> <br /> Also, Holy Dog has not shown any honors. Near the end of the movie, she shot a guard at the back of a window and then assassinated a man by shooting it in the face through a drain drain. Not only is an attorney's way to kill an enemy, it's more like a ninja way; silent killer; a group that samurais refuses to exist, but hates no-less. Then he tries to kill his boss, when he finds out his boss is a baddie. You know what a true samurai does when he learns his master is proving bad or strip? He killed himself, proving he would rather die then lower himself to the level of his doggish master. <br /> <br /> All about the character was a giant contradiction of the real code that all samurai conform to: Bushido. So we have great movies, good ambitions and so-so acting to cover a satirical plot and quotes, (which unfortunately is the most important aspect of it), making it a satisfactory movie in general, and a reproach of everything a bushi honorable (samurai) to keep dear. <br /> <br /> 2.5 / 10 Bleah
