What? You did not know that Scooby-Doo zombie fighting? Well, you might also not be aware of this little movie led by Victor Halperin, who also directed White Zombie four years earlier. Which would probably make it the second zombie movie made. <br /> No, do not go looking for Dorothy Stone to expose her breasts as you would expect from most zombie films, and not even look for any brains they ate. This is 1936, you know. So what you will see is typical of the period - lots of talk. <br /> You get to see Dean Jagger (Twelve O 'Clock High) with Bela Lugosi's eyes, but that's about it. Zombies in Cambodia, indeed!
