Poor Ingrid suffered and suffered once he went to Italy, tired of the Hollywood glamor treatment. First he suffered the torment of a volcanic island of Strobboli, a failure of art that would have killed quarters in a less flexible actress. And now, it's EUROPA 51, another tedious exercise of tired feelings. The story has made much for Alexander KNOX, another role as an ingredient to her husband, who tried to comfort her after the suicide bombing of the young men. At least one of this has better production value and a much more adorable script than STROMBOLI. Bergman is still attractive here, but moves toward a more matronly appearance as a wealthy society woman. He can never cope with the sudden loss of his son, despite attempts by a little friend. "Sometimes I think I'll come out of my mind," she told her husband. An affidavit of a movie that is totally without humor or grace, but it gives us a sense of where the story will be. <br /> <br /> Bergman is soon motivated to help the poor in post-war Rome, but a social worker with poor children does not improve his emotional health and out on the plot to take a turn to become wrong. The overall film effect is that it is not enough interesting to make a project for a big star like Bergman. The movie lost Midway passage through the story as Bergman became more and more distressed and her husband suspected he was de-timing him. The story goes down from there after having a street-walker nurse in her terminal disorders. The final amount of the plot has her husband who needs to wear it for observation in a mental asylum. <br /> <br /> Ingrid suffers nobody in it all (sub-compensation for the loss of his son), but is not used. No one of her best cops, put it mildly ... <br /> <br /> Trivia note: If she wanted neo-realism and mental illness, she might have been better at accepting the lead in PIT SNAKE when she was offered by Anatol Litvak director !! He would do more for his career than EUROPA 51. <br /> Summon up: Another weak concern at Rossellini and Bergman.
