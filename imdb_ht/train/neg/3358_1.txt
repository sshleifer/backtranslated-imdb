Haunting. A rumor, of course. The original was a thrilling psychological thriller, with one that improved and time. Compared with this remarkable 1999, it's a classic. There is no character development here, only caricatures (the breath, the authoritative brain, "I'll get you outta here" fellow, oh livworm sensitive). But to see how banking was the special effect being the "star", I guess characters that you can empathize and are a high concern. Unfortunately, the effects are ridiculous. Bad cherubs, eternal doors, disappointing dead kids who can not speak clearly ... with an idiotic smile making it at Darnedest giving you a new enema of butterflies and rainbows. I'll take Skittles to me orally, thank you. Bruce Dern, I loved you since the "Cowboys". Stop.
