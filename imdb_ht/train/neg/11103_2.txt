OK, so I just saw the movie, although it appeared last year ... I thought it was generally a decent movie, except for the storyline, which was stupid and awful ... First of all, we're not Never get to know anything about the animals, why have they appeared, wtf are doing in our world, and really, were on Earth before we were or were they just out of space? Secondly, the role of the butcher keeps order is just so obviously created ... Really, how big was the underground for a sub station could be? There were only so many of these creatures, so I thought instead of killing innocent people in vain, they could just plant some tactical bombs, or maybe they are clear and a Nuke would do the job. I know it sounds funny and it is, but I do not see the murders as they were NESESTER ... Thirdly, Leon acts as superman jumping on the train and fighting Vinnie Jones, who was the highest and greatest way where. Then again, when she faces the conductor she does nothing and acts as a vagabond, watching all the abominations. I mean OK, the conductor had creepy help (lol), but if Leon was so brave he would go all the way ... I mean he risks his life first, then there is nothing exactly when it should have. He might have died like a hero, but he lives like a coward ... this might be the case, but not after showing much courage earlier on ... then the cop's stuff come on! This was a city with a train, I bet had to have other cops except that ladies, other police stations, this was really kind of unlucky ... All in all, big act by Vinnie Jones, interesting idea up to the reason making them behind it that does not really build at all ... By the way, what made the signs on the chest mean? Vinnie Jones can not do for the rest ...
