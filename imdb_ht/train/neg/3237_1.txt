Not that I tinkle myself and Glee in the eye of real bloody flow, but when I put a DVD in wait for a bloodbath, and that I get to see is one bloody egg (the eyeball) at the end of the assinine fake slide, and turning to an office chair, I finished thinking "well that's 43 minutes in my life to go forever." I would not consider this or body blood and blood "movies" so much as a exercise of willingness; to see if you can sit in them. Blood and blood flowers had a few tasks to look hard. The devil's experience was not. It was at best, stupid, and at worst ... well ... really stupid. Perhaps my expectation was too high. I put the thought of DVD "oh people, this will get sick." After looking at the girl's fake slap about a thousand times, I watched her in the fast forward. Two types of people should be interested in this movie. 1) Those who seek F'd up movie just to see how F'd up it really, or 2) full horror. I sought this with the other guinea pigs movies for the last reason, but even though I dropped into the category of the former, this movie would not float my boat. As a matter of fact, I could imagine this movie raising the blood of lust ... as in "you would only kill the B * TCH all !!" So, in conclusion, the only reason to own this movie is for collection purposes. If you want to carnage that traditional horror does not give, get traces of death. Sure, which sucks too, but at least you will get the blood and intestines you expect. <br /> <br /> The only reason I can see for anyone who praises this crap is because they feel supposed to be. There is no artistic merit that I can understand, there is no reason to be notorious, nothing. Just an attempt to blame to be shocking.
