Terrible movie. Nuff said. These lines are just filler. The film was bad. Why I have to expand on what I do not know. This is already a waste of my time. I just wanted to warn others. Avoid this movie. The act of absorption and writing is just moronic. Bad in every way. The only wonderful thing about the movie is Deniz Akkaya's breasts. Even that was lost if not a terrible and inneded rape scene. This film is a piece of paper that is well-compact and totally incredible in garbage. <br /> OK now I'm just going to rumble on IMDb for this stupid rule of 10 lines of minimum text. First I waste my time watching this. Then feel forced to warn others I create an account with IMDb only to discover that I have to write a friggen essay on the movie just to express how bad I think it is. Totally unnecessary.
