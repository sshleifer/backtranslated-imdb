Geez, as a gay man who lives in NYC I can gratitude say that I have never seen underbelly in Gay culture described in this film - and I'm glad of it !!! Was this broadcast film on television across the United States would be a great anti-Gay backlash I could not say I would blame them. These people in this movie do not represent the average American Gay or even the average American Trandgender, which they represent is an absolute and utter nightmare. Character inclusion obviously obviously is terrible and obvious racists (anti-white) are blatant and disturbing society can not blame for those who chose drugs, unemployment and rejection of education on part of the movie "cast" - human actions These are no acts of deportation, but rather a rejection of anything similar to personal ambitions and a willingness to do something from one's own.
