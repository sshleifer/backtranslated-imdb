Dramas of all time can not make any real points. So she became an actress - so what? She learned love - great deal. There is a certain existence among the characters and in the dialogue and situations, but the kind that is bad for the movie, causing it often seems absurd. <br /> <br /> Summer Phoenix, playing the lead, talks and behaving like a semi-retarded man, so there is no choice but to watch the movie as a lingerie girl who makes it into the world of Theater - which was clearly not the intended point. We said earlier (in that "Barry Lyndon" - like narration) that he learned to hide his emotions, which certainly explains his rock-figure autism, but the movie suffers for it. It basically walks around like a zombie, and its success as an actress is not quite credible to give her lack of emotion. Occasionally, the movie had that feeling, sleeping in a Dogma movie 95. Is it one? I should not be surprised. <br /> <br /> Summer Phoenix is ​​the sister of Joaquim Phoenix and the Phoenix River. Nepotism rarely works.
