This movie is just awful. It's boring, it's low quality, the actors are just the worst actors I've ever seen and the storyline is so bad that it's hilarious. The "primary" is supposed to be the warm guy who gets all the girls, but it is ugly, overweight and looks like it is from the early 90's. <br /> <br /> All the characters are gone for the weekend for a get together among friends, but nobody actually friends! The couple married did not see the "main" guy in over 5 years and even back then they were not really friends. The main guy only knows him from work and having to have a girl to pick up in a bar. Now tell me that you would risk losing your job over a week-end in your cabin and those who are not even friends Your real life, because that's what it does at the start of the movie! <br /> Do not waste even a minute of your time on this lemon. <br />
