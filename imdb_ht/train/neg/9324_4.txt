OK I own this DVD I got it new to amazon ... i mean i think its badass with a pretty cool cops and melissa sweeping the slutty / bitchy girl they pick up hot as hell ... the act sucks and all the polt just sucks the clown is some big guy wearing a mask and its disgusting but OK it I would not recommend it if u wanted to rent a good flick fun after a hard day work but if you have nothing Other things do with you obsessed with this stupid movie like I, watch it sometime, and I do not know how artisan DVDs have got sick in its DVD collection, s.ic.ck It is not good enough to be owned by a half-decent movie company OK well all
