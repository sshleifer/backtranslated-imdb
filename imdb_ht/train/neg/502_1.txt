This film is not just a very bad movie, with awesome actors - preseter actors actors, a bold and an unpleasant story, and also copies exactly the scene of the excellent "giallio" "Torso", directed by Sergio Martino 1973 (two years before), one of the most celebrated psycho-thrill of Italian movies and a movie-film around the world. In the "La Sanguinusa Dangerous Drive", the director replays the scene scene between the black girl and the white girl, and a peeping-tom watching from a window in the bedroom. Of course, the scene of Rizzo's film is ridiculous and inferior to the heartbreaking and spacious of Martino's film. To put another black girl, another white girl and another peeping-tom replaying scene is simply the most appropriate way to prove that Rizzo's movie has no idea, no originality, no taste, and nothing at all. I think things are a spectator offense.
