I promised a long time ago NEVER, watching all a movie that has anyone who has a regular member thrown into "Saturday Night Live". I did not rent "Corky Romano" but I was forced by my looks good to look it for half an hour. And then my breakthrough failed. Stupid, not funny. Tedious, not hilarious. Bad, not good. That's a nutshell is all I can say for this video.
