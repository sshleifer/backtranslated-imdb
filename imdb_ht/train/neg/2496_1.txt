I would list this movie under the genre of horror movie. I did this because I'm not aware of a genre called horror. Since the genre genre came the nearest terrible I decided to put it in this category. The act was amateur. You know who the villains should be in the first stage. The heroine is as ugly as the movie. Students in the movie should take this movie as an example of the lesson that does not make in a movie. It is that bad. Man's bad word is an understatement. The villains divert an offshore liner and want 10 million dollars. They want the money to be saved on a stay Rose Island in the Pacific. They should sit down after receiving the money. There is no step plan. How dumb. The female cruise director is an ancient cop, seafarer, kung fu I'm scared. The hilarious party is the way to defuse the time bomb. He says he knows what he is doing and keeps pulling all the threads one by one. He then put it in his pocket and according to the movie and all the connections to his place. Is it angry? As crazy we watched this ridiculous. If you have an M-I-L who you do not like. To annoy her movie rent and pretend you enjoy it. I assure you it will definitely tell your spouse that you have the bad taste and that her son / daughter marries someone below her family standard.
