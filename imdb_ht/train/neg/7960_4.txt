I rent it because the second segment traumatized me as a kid. I jumped down early one morning, started watching HBO, and the boat (segment 2) warns me good. This time around, I still enjoyed the raft, although I could not tell if it was for nostalgia or if it was actually a good one. Two other segments were filled with garbage. I can not believe a producer somewhere pays for this junk. All I have accomplished by watching this was to ruin one more child memory. Creepshow 2 will now join my list of classic attached children. 4/10
