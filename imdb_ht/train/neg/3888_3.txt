I started to melt so I'll make this review as short and sweet as possible. <br /> Have this astronaut, and went up to a spacecraft and two other guys, would you know? Except something happens that expose it to radiation, and then when they come back ... well, never mind what happened to other men, but our astronaut began to melt! No, not just burning, but MELT! Like a ice cream cone in July! Well OK maybe not so fast, but you know what I mean. <br /> <br /> Anyway, it gets all red & gooey, and the fact that it's melting makes it really upset. I guess it also check out the "melting" handbook because suddenly she knows that in order to keep from totally melting away, she has to eat human body, so it's starting to scratch apart. other characters, but in a movie where a man dissolves and dissolves and melts (and melts), do you really need anyone else? What is important is WHO is going to be next to munch, and what will remain in them? How long will it take to just melt away in nothing? WHY was this movie made in the first place? WHERE did they get the money? When will you sleep while watching it? I was very nearly melted, but I still have enough time to let you say that this film is warm boring, though the idea is really cool and the quality of gross. The makeup is clean but everything else is ... SPLAT
