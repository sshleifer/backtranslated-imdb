This gay counterpart was gone and the wind gave its long season, but instead it met itself by being a huge chain of empty episodes in which absolutely nothing happened. The characters unite dimensions and no other development of the story (there is actually no story either) than looking for each other and kissing. It's a shame that an interesting aesthetic proposal as it has almost no completely wasted dialogue in a movie than does not make any effort to examine the psychology of its character and some dignity, and succeed true emotional resonance. On top of that, he pretended to be an "art" movie using the worst naive clubs in the cinematic snobbery. But anyway, if anyone can identify with his heavy rug, I guess this fine.
