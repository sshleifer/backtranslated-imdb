I went to awaiting the movie to be completely mute. With such a low expectation, any form of entertainment would be a pleasant surprise. The band was the best part of the movie, but poking fun in nonsense that went into singles singles was also fun .. there were lots of Ward Singles that were completely annoying. The movie was all awkwardly armed and watched while listening to their voices were very disappointing. This lack of professionalism was unsurpassed only by the cameos of the Mormon celebrity with no business acting. This movie will do well in the middle of Mormondom, especially in college communities where only parishes exist. However the conclusion will offer no hope for the poor who find themselves married. (Only the lovely girls of the Ward Singers marry, grease, these ugly people do not, but all are ugly to do) Finally we realize that the movie all was an advertisement for LDSSingles.com
