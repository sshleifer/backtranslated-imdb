It was so terrible. It was not fun to look at all. Even the scene where the girl is using a vibrator, even this is not fun to watch in this movie. Again, the scene where a girl is masturbating with a vibrator is not even fun to watch. Or maybe if it were only part of the movie that you watch, just girl on couch using a vibrator. Perhaps they should just release that one stage of the theater, maybe then the movie would be enjoyable on a certain level. My advice, fast forward to this point, watch it, rewind the movie, watch it again, delay, repeat. Perhaps you could enjoy yourself for 2 hours in this way. This movie hangs along and I spit on your grave and cursing generation in the category of worst movies I've ever seen.
