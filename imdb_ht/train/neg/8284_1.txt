Who wrote this? Some guy named John Cohen. I guess this was the first movie he ever worked on. Someone should tell him you should write the dialogue that sounds like something someone might actually say. <br /> <br /> And who is directing this? Scott Marshal? Son Gerry Marshall. My black tea dropped off the tree. Someone might want to let her know that you can, in fact, shoot a scene from a taxi in New York, and it will look real, and you will not have to fake it with a blue screen for no reason. Could also wish to let her know she should stay away from Jessica Simpson, but hopefully she learned that now. Jessica Simpson ... naturally she can not act. Hell, she does Jessica Alba look like Audry Hepburn, and yet she's starting to film this. Oh wait, he was produced by his father. Well, that's why he got the part. This is the real reason I can think of. So should I be surprised to be bad? No. Should I be surprised at how bad it is? I think a lot of people would have been seen as much of it as I did. I mean you expect a movie to start Jessica Simpson to be bad, but that's not just bad, it's the complete opposite of a classic movie. Thinking of a great movie by Woody Allen, this film is as bad as that movie is a good thing. It's the Anti-Annie Hall. <br /> I am so happy I did not pay to see it, I stopped watching ten minutes from my body could not go on. No doubt I would have walked out of the theater earlier. In fact, I wonder how many of the 6 people who saw it for each theater actually lived and looked at it all. The film starts out ridiculously bad, and then goes to the point of being so bad it becomes a kind of Chinese tortoise. Then, around when the first act ends, you realize it will only get worse, and that when you either need to quit, or kill yourself. <br /> In conclusion, this movie goes under the category of being so bad it should be used in place of water climbs in Guantanamo Bay. Although some prefer to ride in water.
