Based on Ray Russell's black beasts, this (PATISRI in the Woods) Hough-led bubble has little to go for it. Even if it does not lack gory violence, it has narrower sensitivity to "character". <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The Incubus of the title is a demon spirits and a monstrous penis that shoots red sperm at vagina while lying - or, to be more precise, rape. John Cassavetes, testing from his successful career, is convinced as a doctor who questions the circumstances of the rare attacks on young women. <br /> <br /> The terrible potential of victims of demonic widespread trauma is not considered - and neither is the hearing tolerance for slow moving garbage. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />!
