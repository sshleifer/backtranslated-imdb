I watched this movie as a preview of a Barney art exhibit. It certainly prepares me. I almost skipped the display and, in retrospect, probably should have. Aside from the high score (Bjork) and the picture rich and colorful, the content was mostly tedious and predictable. Yes, I really need to see a person wearing pearls to figure out what the pearl divisions were up to. The film was mostly a funny mix of Japanese cultural references and industrial shots in modern candle technology used in a mock-hunting / crop. The film "head" with enough shock-art trauma turns your stomach. <br /> <br /> What was the point in the movie? While others might argue that it is an anti-whaling piece, one might equally argue that it somehow also justifies whaling. Personally I think he tried Barney's attempt to "flash" the audience with anal, fecal, self-mutilation, and cannibal fetishes. <br /> <br /> Bottom line: unless you really get off Barney's art, Don does not need to see this movie. The message is obscure, slow down, and cultural firefighting references. If you are after shock-art, you will do better in one of the many "Undead" movies or hunt down an old copy of Hustler and take in a fecal-cartoon below.
