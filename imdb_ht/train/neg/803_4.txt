I read the novel Reaper of Ben Mezrich a few years ago and last night I accidentally came to see this adaptation. Although it has been years since I read the first story, the difference between the novel and the film are humongous. Very important elements, which made everything possible to just write out or change in bad. <br /> <br /> If the draw sounds interesting you: go and get the novel. It's very much, much, better. <br /> Always 4 out of 10 since it was hard to stop watching because of the big scheme of basic by Ben Mezrich.
