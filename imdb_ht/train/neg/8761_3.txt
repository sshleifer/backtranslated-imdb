My girlfriend has the habit of going to blockbuster and choosing no-one movies ever heard of anything. Admittedly, at times, it has led to some fun discovery. Often times, the best that can be said is to run an hour and a half. <br /> It brought home "Tips from a Caterpillar." She was excited because the box said it was funny. Lucky for us, propaganda on the boxes never lying. This movie was an exercise of patience. This is one of those movies where, unless you're a firefighter and a fan who likes watching movies over your head, you will hate all characters in the movie. Until the introduction of one beautiful character. That annoying plagiarism character will fall in love with and act in such a way that, in the real world, would drive anyone to go. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> So a lot of emotionally stupid, stuck-up, pretest artists swear in love and find success in their careers. Then they meet a beautiful, intelligent, emotional mature character and love (a nearly perfect guy). We then looked at the woman, the artist annoyingly pretentious (in his 30's?) Wild out as he fell in love. So she tries to run out of beautiful, smart, emotionally mature people and staying with the man who is married to whom she has great but empty sex. It is rude to the man and to do everything in his power to drive him away. In the real world, it would be quite successful. I certainly wanted to leave him and I did not even in a relationship with him! Although its beautiful that the man 'fought for his love, I never wanted him to have him. (No I was girlfriend) He did not deserve it. And, why do I ask, did the director think that 'almost perfect guys' should be punished not to have a relationship with him? When the artist asked 'almost perfect guys' to leave, we were screaming for him to leave. There is a problem with a movie when the heroine of the movie is so annoying, embarrassing and stupid that you want it to fail. <br /> <br /> Beyond that, let me say that Andy Dick has made me laugh a few times even though his character was also pretent to the point of annoyance. Regarding the other characters, they were well-acting, morally bankrupt and annoying characters. <br /> It's a comedy and I can say I was laughing a few times in the movie. Unfortunately, not a lot of laughs occurred until the last 10 minutes or so. But by the time I had these laughter, I prayed for the movie to end for too long. I needed to find these vapid characters out of my life. <br /> <br /> If you want to watch those you hate struggle with a love for people they do not deserve, then this is the movie for you.
