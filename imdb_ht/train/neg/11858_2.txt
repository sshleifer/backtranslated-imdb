I'm a fan of Matthew Modine, but this movie - which I stumble over on cable - is absolutely inexplicable. I see that the senarist and the directors were one and the same, so there was no one around to check his worst instincts. There are no surprises, no original lines, and no original characters. The red fish was the most sympathetic character. What a waste of all this talent acts. Given how expensive it is in New York films these days, I must ask how this was done in the first place. But if you are wondering why I watched it all, it came after a movie that I liked on the cable and left it on while I was working on the computer. It's not a very demanding picture!
