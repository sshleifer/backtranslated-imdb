Honey, I shrunk the Kids Franchise was a great deal and not to mention very popular. I loved honey, I shrunk the kids when I was little. It was an original story and had such an interesting plot! Together they were so amazing and the cast seemed like they enjoyed each other's company. Now, honey, I blow up the kid was very stupid, so I think they wanted to go back to the story that everyone liked. <br /> <br /> Basically, Adam is a little more grown now and the mother will be on vacation to leave their husbands and their children. But when Wayne's favorite article is threatened for the trash, he wants to shrink and hold it, but he and his brothers get along the way. But when the girls return after they give some meds for their son, they get caught in the car as well, leaving the children alone at home! The plot is funny, but as I said, it was just a family movie that I think some can get a kick out of. The original honey, I shrunk the kids is the best, I think everyone could agree. The third one was not so bad, I would recommend this one at least on honey, I Blew up the kid movie, it was at least a little more fun.
