Hey, <br /> <br /> If you're going to make a documentary about Leonard Cohen trying to do it on Leonard Cohen! This file is filled with only the apple enough Leonard that will let you ask why they're listening to all the other musicians (some of them doubt) talking about themselves. Puleeze .... sounds like to revive their journals in junior high - who cares about you, what about Leonard? Guess who, if you "do something" deserves maybe someone will make a documentary about you. I found it particularly insulting the parade of U2 members as if adding credibility to this film - NOT. Leonard does not need Bono or the Edge talking about his spirituality. What would have been nice for the filmmakers incorporated some pieces of his spirituality into the movie. Gee, what a concept! I will provide accessory for Rufus Wainwright and Jarvis Cocker to cover them in Melody Cohen - the rest of the performances and some were unbearable. <br /> <br /> Cohen fans, do not say I did not warn you!
