I went to see this film in the movies and I was shocked when I got into the room. There was only me and my girlfriend! This was called me that this movie is not very good. <br /> <br /> No surprise me, the movie lasted. Ben Affleck plays a guy who buys a family for Christmas. It is a very predictable narrative with her falling in love with the girl who hates her. His act is OKish but for aspects of the movie comedy he is not very good. The draw line is poor and the almost non-existent comedy. <br /> However, there are some good points. For example, the family is falling apart with the mother very funny. I hope that this review will stop others from wasting money. I was very embarrassed when I came out of the room !!!
