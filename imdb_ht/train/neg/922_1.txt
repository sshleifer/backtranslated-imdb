This movie is exactly what you get when you really are about to stretch your abilities, it's like someone who just has to have driving tests and then pitting them into a Formula 1 Grand Prix (not I might add, US The Grand Prix as everyone could crack due to dodgy tires and you might just have), that's how far this short film is falling. Now, do not take this bad way, I like B-Movies, around half my collection made in B-Movies but I do not think there is enough milk in the alphabet to describe how bad this movie is. > <br /> First of the story (for a B-movie) is not that bad, it has potential to have a B-movie feature, did not talk Friday 13 potential, but the potential no less there. But what really allows this movie down is to act, in not a second I believe everything is like watching QVC except the presenters on QVC tend to have a heavier one. <br /> In summary I would like to say I've seen movie worse, but I can not.
