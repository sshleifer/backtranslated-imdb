I can not say enough bad things about this train wreck. It is one of the few movies I've ever tried to walk from. It was a bad quote to begin with, first male pregnant, but then they tried to make it a parody. What are they spoofing all those real men pregnant ??? This was the worst movie I've ever seen. If he had enough votes it would be below the IMDB 100. If it was possible to give it a zero I would, and I would still feel I gave him too much credit.
