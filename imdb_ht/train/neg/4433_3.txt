I really wanted to love this movie much more than I did. That's because I love wacky foreign comedies - especially those weird people who keep you completely out of surprise. However, although this one often keeps me from surprise, these are almost never nice surprises. It reminds me of South Park that almost normal social norms have been violated until the ones that only let them crack were too sick to be funny. For example, after exploring adultery, drug abuse (in almost all sort - from skin, heroin, sniffing glitters), prostitution, S & M, suicide, murder, etc., the film reached the hilarious subject (?) pedophilia. Mother encouraged her one son (who looked 12 years old) to sleep with neighbors. In fact, at one point in the movie it gives this boy to the dentist in place of payment for dental work! Funny? You've got to be kidding. This movie just goes too far and delves into "black holes in comedy". What should be the next fun, cancer or rectal tumors?
