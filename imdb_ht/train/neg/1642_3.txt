For months before the release of this movie you saw it published in all kinds of print media, so I partially waited for her video release to see what all the hype was about. After it was over I had to apologize my roommate to handle the VCR for the last hour and a half to look like a horrible movie. It essentially fails because it is a character movie based on unredeemable characters. With the exception of Amanda Peet (with only the quality of the soundtrack is that it is Amanda Peet) you can not stop any of them. The film depends on its dialogue that is sophomoric, moronic, and bituminous. The only little funny character is Eric, who has painted in the sole married member of a group of friends who died on. The final twist, designed to make you laugh at the three main characters, only rather inspire the same kind of resentment towards Peet. All in all, only rent if you are desperate or possess a dark sense of humor.
