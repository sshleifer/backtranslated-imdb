I liked how this started out, featuring some decent special-effects especially for a 50 year old movie. There were some impressive scenery. However, the bog movie goes down quite early and some very mute dialogue as men try to flirt with Anne Francis "Altaira Morbius.") <br /> This view of the '90s after a long absence, it was fun to see Francis again, an actress who made mostly TV shows since this film was released .... and still acts. It was also interesting to see a young looking for Leslie Nielsen ("Dr. John J. Adams"), whom I would not recognize that he was not for that voice <br /> I watched half of this film Before the boredom became almost overwhelming and I had a strong desire to go to sleep. I appreciate being re-doing this VHS tape in stereo. but it was a weak effort. This is one movie movie where "elite" thinks so "heavy" and "thought-provoking." This nonsense. It only appeared "smart" because the rest of the films' 50s sci-fi were so stupid !! <br /> Some if the early scenes would look great on widescreen, which I did not have at that time written. Perhaps another look - this time about 2.35: 1 the widespread transfer would make me change this review.
