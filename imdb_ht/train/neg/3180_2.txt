What a boring film! Her psalm all went up, she was basically just Nana Patekar beating up daughter-in-law Karisma Kapoor, while she tried to escape from the village, and her son. Can someone say BORING ??? The concept was not too bad, but it was wrong to execute. Local Canadians, and some of the village scenes were nicely shot. However, in general, the movie came short. The story could have been great, but the film just seemed to drag on. There are just so many people can take, let alone three hours without it. The best part of the whole movie was the song "Ishq Kamina", and that was only five minutes long. Other than that, this movie was a piece of crap.
