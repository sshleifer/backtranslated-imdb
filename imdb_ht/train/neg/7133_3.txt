I felt I was hitting the anger again, but with different actors and a little different scheme. I'll tell the cars in the movie are pretty cool. So, if you like fast cars, then you'll probably find this movie lustfully entertaining. I also loved Nadia Bjorlin because I saw her from day to day. He is a really good singer, but too bad he was given as song lousy songs in this movie. I mean songs on cars; Not exactly what you would be here on the radio. Since it's a Hollywood movie, you have to give this story a little bit lively, but in real life I do not think that no average joe would come across as a hot girl like Nadia Bjorlin who can drive a race car, fix a motor car, and be a lead singer. That's just all pretty funny. <br /> Another side note, anyone who wants to bet 25 million on a car race is a black. But it was a kind of cool at the end when Natasha stopped right before the finish line and screwed Michael over. Priceless. <br /> <br /> FINAL VERDICT: This movie is for franchise machines. So, if you like fast cars, then I would recommend this.
