An actress who made a movie in Africa is kidnapped and taken to the jungle where she was born for ransom. The producer hired some people to go and bring it back. Complete all the cannibals in the jungle that worships a really ugly looking "god" who loves naked women. <br /> <br /> This is a movie of thunder fate. There are abundant amounts of stripping and violence, not to mention violence against naked people. It's an exploitation film designed to appeal to deeper into our worst parts, and if the movie was not so boring this movie would be a classic. Lets face it, despite the gorus, the nasty and abusive sex, and the ugly monster movie is a snoozer. The gathering is all about kilter and puts you out. There are several plot lines that all seem to be apart separately from each other, even though it's finally all one story. Worst of all, almost no one says anything. Most of the dialogue's minimum concern the cruelty or a manifestation character that "I'll do what I want". It's like a movie that is quiet and dull that if it did not cry out often to the victims I would recommend this as a sleep assistant. This is a movie to avoid unless you need to sleep, or unless you need to see each movie cannibal .. <br /> <br /> (A sideways.) VideoAsia just released this as a party in the fast-paced series. The prints are strange letter-boxes that seem to be the result of taking the print out from a Japanese (fogging) source that has been cut to remove the subtitles. The printing also does not have any title titles)
