While I counted myself as a fan of Babylon's TV series 5, the original film that featured the series was a weak start. Although many of the elements that later would mature and become more compelling in the series are, the pace of the rally is slow, the makeup is a bit inappropriate, and the confusion scheme. Worse, characterization of Episode Premiere is poor. Although the evaluation charts show that many fans want to neglect these issues, I note that the gathering has almost turned me off to what is rapidly growing in a spectacular range.
