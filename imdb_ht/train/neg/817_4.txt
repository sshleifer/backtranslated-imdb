"You're not going to shoot those little creatures. In the first place they did not hurt you anymore. In the second, they can be radioactive." Ah, the joys with no-budget 50s Sci-Fi ?? But despite the odd gem like that, Superman and Grinder-Men are very uninspiring going even with a lean time 58 minutes to run. It's beyond cheap (the one shot at Superman Fly is a strictly stupid frame of animation) and pretty dull with it, though it has an amazing altistic word ?? Mole bowl-men, reducing actors and enlarged skulls and fur clothes that look more like Mr Mxyzptlk without the hat than underground critters, released into underground worlds by drilling oil are not bad, merely misunderstood with George Reeves' Man of Steel tries to prevent the local small-city crowd led by Jeff Corey from their killing. An interesting counterpoint to the paranoia of the day, maybe, but with little more than good intentions recommended.
