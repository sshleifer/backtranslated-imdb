This "movie" is one of the most obnoxious things I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Please do yourself a favor and avoid this incompetent contest. <br /> <br /> Shaking the camera and having the actors you adopt scowls do not count as "direction", that movie is needed in droves. Not that the writing was all the wonderful, instead of leaving with a bunch of completely artificial characters directed in the most artificial way (the pseudo-documentary "style" specified by people who do not know how to direct). <Br /> <br /> This movie gives the impression that it has made cynically appealing to critics who do not know the first thing about film-making (which is most of them). Just awful. He said much about Sundance and what it turns out that Victor Vargas was presenting.
