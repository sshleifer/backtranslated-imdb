Come on Tina Fey you can do better then. As soon as the movie started I knew how it might end. Make sure it was funny at times. Even laugh funny loudly. But there is no laugh enough to save this movie. I do not recommend buying this. At most I recommend renting it, but all. Mama baby has some funny scenes but is predictable and fails to have the tender end to striving for. Tina Fey and Amy Poalher made a good team. Girl is one of my favorite movies. Tina Fey and Amy Poalher both did great at that and did good in this. But this is not the best. Mum's baby had a great deal of support. Dane Cook, Sigourney Weaver and Steve Martin added to the grandest protection. Another pregnancy movie hit the movie world. After the big hit up with Juno, Mama's baby looks very average when compared. Hit Up and Juno are hilarious, Heartwarming and have endings that leave you with a smile on your face. The baby's mother finish was unfunny and dull. <br /> <br /> Baby Mama was not the best comedy of the year and she does not try to be. I recommend it, but do not expect it to be totally hilarious. Expect an average comedy that does not give great emotional end to trying. I give baby Mama ..... <br /> <br /> 4/10
