I liked the movie first, but this is a book example at an end that would be best to leave on the drawing board. The overall idea of ​​the movie was first, if not great, then at least very interesting. Ends this attempt to build on the idea and the characters from the first movie, and even though Christopher Walken is still good Gabriel, the whole idea suddenly gets a bit ridiculous. If you have not seen any of these movies, then get the movie first and forget about the end, they can take all the joy of the original.
