This is the first non-zombie subgenre review but this movie is worth making a review. Dinocroc is a good movie in general but unfortunately it's still a b-movie obvious. The Dinocroc himself looked great, but I thought the movie itself needed a bit more weight than in action and violence because every time the crok shows or is in a battle scene not much goes on except the crow to show and the croc either kills or runs through a repeated process. Jane Longenecker was hot and that is a plus and the act was better than the average and most surprising thing is that the crow seemed to be fleshy instead of such a cartoon cough cough * in the cod. * Cough. I enjoyed this movie enough to be happy that there will be an end that is much more than I can say about some movies in general. Overall 3/6 stars and worth a look.
