For anyone not familiar with c.S. Forrester's book this movie should be interesting. It is colorful, well-acting and paintered high adventure, but to those of us who know their original story it is appalling. I could hardly sit in it. <br /> For some reason screen-writer seems to rewrite the stories they're working on. Of course, this word is different from the word written, and there are some episodes that might be tough movie. But why writers-writers write the story instead of just adjusting it? In this case the writers went out-made themselves. <br /> Just a few examples: There was no mutiny on the Renovation. The officers took over the ship after the half-hearted captain was completely angry when he had fallen into a failure - for implicit reasons but never gave up. There was no martial court. The court of inquiry was conducted in an almost congratulatory atmosphere. Captain Pellew does not appear in this part of the Hornblower legend, nor Colts wife. Ortega a. Hornblower, himself, had never been in the brig on the ship or on the shore. There are many of these manipulations in Forrester's history. <br /> <br /> On a purely technical basis, I think repeating the movie used in the flash-back device hurts the continuity of the story. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Why, oh why screen-writers have messed up a good story?
