This has to be the worst movie I've ever seen. I bought the DVD and it did not work, well the DVD worked fine, it's just the movie was not, in fact it's so bad that I think not of the actors have worked since (or before judging from act a). There is no real plot to speak of and there is no real horror. Their production value is even for a low budget film and some outside scenes are being heard due to winds on the microphone. <br /> <br /> All in all it was so bad a movie that a viewer could think was going to turn into a porn if they did not know any better (that was an improvement). There are only two lines of the movie that are funny, both of which are engraved around the transvestite whore. (Although they deserve to be watching all 76 minutes for) <br /> As for marketing in the DVD I feel quite cheated. I mean reading back in my expectation to be bad: <br /> He chose his weapon. He chose his victims. He chose his nose. It turned into a girl! <br /> But I thought it might be funny. Also, the claim to it is usually mastered, I would like to see it in advance, the print so green you could use it as sandpaper. This case says it is an absolute extreme movie, in what way?, Disgusting production, acting. <br /> This movie goes out to be welcomed in the first five minutes, (if you consider buying this I would buy 'bad taste' instead of being a better movie and is funny, also having Peter Jackson director in the LOTR in it.) Incidentally if anyone knows anything about any of the actors (or director Patrick J Mathews) and what they have done since, please post here as I would like to know, the peppers find out if there is a the movie gets worse, or if anyone in this movie ever bothers to learn to act
