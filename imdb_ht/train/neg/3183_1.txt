Sergio Leone turns into his grave ... If there was any movie that tramples on someone's life in this one's life. Character lead to "Lone Wolf" bravado is uninspiring and lame, and the script was apparently written by a monkey and eight classes of education. Anyone in this idea should horse whipped. The only reason I spend time trashing it is because there is a minimum of 10 lines. Sergio Leone's family should call, not because of its crap, but because now it is immune to crap by MST 3000. Shame. Chaos. I blame Hollywood ... at least Gary Busey does crap that will offend anyone but cocaine users and gun experts ... this movie is better to talk about God.
