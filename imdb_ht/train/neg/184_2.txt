Man photographs of Alberta Rocky Mountains are in a superb fashion, and Jimmy Stewart and Walter Brennan provide enjoyable performances as they always seem to be. But come on Hollywood - a mountain that tells the people of Dawson City, Yukon to choose themselves a marshal (yes a marshal!) And apply the law themselves, then tracks his fight from the streets for the control the city? <br /> <br /> There is nothing even remotely resembling what happened on the Canadian side at the border during the Klondike Gold Rush. Mr. Mann and company seem to make Dawson City's errors for Deadwood, the Canadian North for the Wild West Indian. <br /> <br /> Canadian viewers must prepare for a type of Reefer Madness in delightful enjoyment with this ludicrous plot, or, to shake yourself in disgust.
