Well I also heard it all reviewed without breathing and commenting on how this movie might deserve the best photo Oscar so I went to see it today. What a great disappointment! 1) If you read other comments you will learn from US military members who have served in Iraq how easy these movie events are. They reflect my own thinking; As the movie played me - a full-fledged thought - hold myself, "say what? there is no way that would happen like that." 2) There are very few who are actually happening in terms of plot. A guy throwing new bombs shows up to replace a dead person (a death that does not really explain clearly). The new guy gets an adrenaline rush in his work. His attitude puts others at risk. SA A IT! 3) This movie is nowhere near as suspenseful as claimed. If you want to suspect trying one of the Bourne movies. If you want to see a film of emotionally powerful warfare, try to lecture Go Di Spartans, which is about the Vietnam War, and Burt Lancaster stars (who told me PERSONALLY at a serendipitous supermarket meeting that it was a movie he was incredibly proud of one he considered some of his finest works, with which he was always upset was largely ignored in the wake of the on-hyped Apocalypse Now), or an old WWII black and white classic flow The Bismark, which, especially for an English movie, is unbelievably heart-wrenching. Do not let your time be jammed.
