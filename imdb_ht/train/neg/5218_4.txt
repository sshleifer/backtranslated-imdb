All the elements for a bad night in these films are in place: dialogue riddled with biological-biological babble, along chintzy, balsa-wood acting, a terrible late-80's Casio note, with a general view that suggests anything about sci - Women's Programming Program, Approximately 1993. Although "Metamorphosis" begins with plenty of promises, the film is fend off idiocy borders and MST3K-style cheeses like Clark Kent wannabe 'Doctor' Peter Houseman (Gene LeBrock) pressure in releasing project information his secret. But when he tested his surge on his head, he transformed into a vaguely-defined animal (which brought more than one resemblance to Dr. Freudstein's "House by the Cemetery"). The FX work is fairly good for such a obvious low-budget output (though I suspect most of it keeps in shadow for a reason), but in general, "metamorphosis" leaves a bad retro badge in your bowel, in spite in its hopes for us to encourage us otherwise. I can not help but agree with one character's closing remarks: "(It was) a nightmare ... of the past!"
