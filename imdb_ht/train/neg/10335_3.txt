Average (and surprisingly tame) Fulci giallo which means it's still quite abnormal to normal, but delivers its solid build-ups and some nice touches as a neat twist on the issues of vision and clairvoyance. /> The well-known genius's weird are in full gear: banal dialogue, wooden acting, draw point illogical. And the final goes on much too long, while the denouement proves to be a rather lame or I must say: humpback affair. <br /> <br /> Ironic Fulic's handling of normal jallo is fun, though. Yellow indication where you look. <br /> 3 out of 10 killers
