Such a pretestious attempt to lip hipness. Diabolic script and dialogue with genuine embarrassment. Really the movie gets worse I've ever seen (in the movie). Nothing in my opinion saved this movie from being a total disaster. I saw her when she came from a movie theater in Brighton. People walked out and there were more people sitting outside their toilet in the auditorium! In the end, there were boos and bouncing out of the lean throng crowd, which was quite sad as family of one of the main actors was present and was really watching the arrows. However the movie was that bad that I really could not feel as sympathetic with them. Everyone started out of a place with their son begun in his acting career with this really awful attempt at 'Tarantumism in the UK'. 5 years went by, but sometimes I still cringe in memory of that sad night in the movies! This is a movie that has no features redeeming everything! I gave it a 1 as 0 was not available. They should invent a 'shameometer' for everyone involved in this disorder to regret in a movie. I know some of them moved on to the best thing, the positive thing is that none of them could have sank any lower than this.
