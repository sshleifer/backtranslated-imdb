After a few lean years, 1968 was a very swollen time for Elvis: not only did he celebrate "Reap" Special TV but he also became a father and starred in two decent beautiful movies as well ?? SPEEDWAY AND LIVE A little, love a little. Therefore, personally I can forgive him for the misstep that has been left far, JOE who, at best, results as an exciting misconduct and not all that bad to consider. Sure, Burgess Meredith and Joan Blondell are really embarrassed ?? As, respectively, a father of American father of Elvis' character and a bartender who has his eyes on Mr. Presley too - but one is pleased to see Elvis surrounded by top Hollywood talent veterans such as Katy Jurado (as Mexican Meredith's wife), two Jones ?? Henry and L.Q. - and Thomas Gomez who is particularly entertaining like sarcastic Chief Thundercloud that Meredith's father is still donning his old ruler's clothes in the present day! <br /> While there is a surprising (if not unwelcome to provide the usual usual) lack of songs, there seems to be no shortage of free-for-all parties were the Indian boys hit the bottle gradually during presley practice practices her woman behind the backs! As expected, typically the 'Arizona Entertainment Landscape' is a major advantage here and asleep, the bullshit gag catches is not only a good thing but a bigger point score. On the other hand, the climax of "house destruction" is one we've seen too often since and does not work too well here ...
