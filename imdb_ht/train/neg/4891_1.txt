I want to clarify some things. I'm not familiar with Ming-liang Tsai movies, and I'm very familiar with art cinema; I grew up in the sixties times in Goddard, Fellini, Bergman, Bertolucci and many others. <br /> <br /> Cinema art then they were really ART; such as paints. People have made it express their inner feelings, not really worrying about whether others understand anything. They were beyond their commercial value; just look at some old Antonioni (or early Picasso) and you will understand. <br /> Tian Bian Yi Duo Yun (The Wayward Cloud) has nothing to do with that. It is an opportunistic film, which intends to dig festivals and critics, playing lots of things without saying anything. <br /> The story makes no sense. Lack of water makes the government encourage the use of watermelons to moisturize. A girl in despair, stealing water from WC toilet. There's also a start porn (neighbors) trying to make a movie with an actress she does not seem to feel comfortable with. There are some romantic awakening between the girl and the porn star. The chaos ends with a sexual scene (not pornographic) that many people feel shocked, but I believe it is less provocative than you can see in American Pie or History of Violence. talk. Sometimes, a number of 60 music appears and explains (through a song) what is happening in character spirit. These video clips are really welcomed because the previous stage, without dialogue or music only to each other, takes sometimes 4, 5 or even more minutes in film times is too many. <br /> There are also a few bits about the "hard sex without love", "the selfish idea of ​​the porn industry". <br /> It is obvious, this movie intended (get away with it) of juries festival juries and critics. It has a few pseudo-shocking scenes (within the boundaries of Taiwan censorship) and many topics are open, but nothing is concluded or goes anywhere. <br /> <br /> These tricks, got films of a few (discussed) priceless films in film festivals and get the movie a successful sanitary success (I see the movie in France and the theater is packed) . <br /> However, please do not be fooled. Nothing new or original or even original has been said or filmed in this movie. It is boring and empty; really a public fraud. Boogie Nights (which I did not really enjoy), intimacy and 9 songs far better movies.
