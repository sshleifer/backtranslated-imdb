I did not expect a movie as good as "in the line of fire" or an episode of "24", but it looked like this movie was made for TV and did a bit of work at best. The cast (good) could not disguise the fact that the plot was all too predictable and actors were struggling (they really try their best to think) in the lines of bad script, giving characters instead of flat any extras. When I watched the movie I got the feeling that I saw most of this in the other (best) movies. In it you have cars chases, big shootouts, romance, twists, etc. etc; This movie is not one. <br /> <br /> ** Spoiler ** As soon as you see another woman talking on the Cuba character's phone, you know who's behind all of this and all the suggestions that you're given (" you stand too close to the president, see it from my perspective .. ") sounds funny. <br /> <br /> If it was up to me (and maybe it's a good thing that it is not) I would write the plot like this: <br /> <br /> The first lady's murder order She is husband because she is sick and tired of writing in Cuba all the time.
