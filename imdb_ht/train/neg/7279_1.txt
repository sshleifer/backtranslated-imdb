I just saw this film on a local TV station (TV8 in "Big Chuck and Little John" in Cleveland, Ohio). I never heard of this movie and decided to watch it. <br /> I know that there is no thesaurus that can even come close to helping me in describing how bad this movie really is. The script is awful. Acting, well other than one of two exceptions, is pointless since nothing in this material deserves all real efforts. It looks a bunch of little ideas, resting out of various writing sessions, where they are thrown into a blender. It's not just funny. The "parody" aspect is exaggerated at best. There are some references where almost out of date (even for the time to drop it). No wonder I've never heard of it, it's really bad, worse than anything Saturday night Live, MAD TVs or even in living colors put out on the worst days. <br /> <br /> If you see it on TV, it's a great example of how NOT to make a movie. Whatever you do NOT PALE a center. <br /> Adam
