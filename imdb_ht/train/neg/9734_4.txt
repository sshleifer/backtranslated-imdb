A man discovered that his parents were part of a nuclear experiment in the 50 and that he now has the power ... burst into flame! I really suited for this movie, what and being led by the great Toby Hooper and starring Brad Dourd cards. Unfortunately it did not rise above the individual-and-violent-power films. Spontaneous combustion has an interesting site behind it, unfortunately it never seems to live up to its potential and prolong its plot too much. Special effects are not bad though and help bring the final movie. <br /> <br /> The throw is not bad, The bullfighting stolen show. <br /> All around, there is no classic but it's not the worst of its kind either. <br /> ** from ****
