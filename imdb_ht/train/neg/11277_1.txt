There is no doubt that this movie has an impressive cast but unfortunately this does not help with the biggest pitfalls in the movie. I never understood why directors ask the actors / actresses to use their own accents when it is obvious and everyone can not convince. Fiennes just can not do Irish and Fitzgerald is not the best in Russia. When the voice is wrong then no matter how good acting the character will never be convinced. As for the biggest problem .... The scheme .... was there one? I guess there was some sort of scenario involved but it was so full of holes that I just could not wait for the movie at the end ... it was ridiculous. Save 90 minutes into your life and do not watch this movie!
