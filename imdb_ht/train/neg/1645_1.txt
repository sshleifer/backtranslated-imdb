I just watch this movie last night, and I put a warning for anyone else to view this movie. In one word - do not. I seriously feel like this is something that a student writing was written in a Quentin Tarantino / Eddie Murphy phase, each word being a curse. I do not have a problem with profuse curse, as in "Good Will China", giving it help to dig more of the characters. In that case it was just plain hollow and attempted to draw an occasional * incidental stunts or laughter from the audience. The three lead characters are all their own unique stereotypes, the wall wall strip, the house's tremor, and "I'm-not-gay-just-in-touch-and-I-feminine-side" slightly-less - in-a-jerk. You just do not give a damn on any of them! They are all deeply lost and lost that you want to see lost. For those who dare, this movie has a couple of funny moments, the very beginning, and the end of many. The toilet / vibrator scene is funny in a kind of sick "Uh, yeah" way. Really though, I'd recommend just this movie to my worst enemy.
