This is arguably the worst movie I've ever seen, and I have quite an appetite for terrible (and good) movies. He could (just) have managed a kind of humorous teen if he was still tongue-in-cheek - in the ROCKY HORROR PICTURE SHOW, which was really very funny. Other movies, such as NINE PLAN ON OUTER SPACE, managed to be funny while (apparently) trying seriously. As the act, it seems to round up brain-teens die and asked them to ad-free all production. Compared with them, Tom Cruise looks like Alec Guinness. There was one decent interpretation - that of older ghoul-busting wide on the motorcycle.
