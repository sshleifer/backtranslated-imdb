The first I really liked Zombi 2 by Lucio Fulci. This movie was smoke completely. I could not stand to watch him. The scenario was a joke, the act was a joke, and the fact that Zombi 3 has nothing to do with Zombi 2 is even more a joke. We fly from voodoo to DEATH 1 PAYMENT OF PURPOSE People return to life. Regardless, this film is not worth $ 1.00 it costs to lease it. I really enjoyed film lucio fulci but this one was awful. If Zombi 3 is an indicator of how zombies 4 and 5 will make me think I'll just skip them. <br /> <br /> Zombi 2 is an awesome cops tho.
