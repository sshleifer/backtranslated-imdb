Not the worst movie I've seen but definitely not very good either. I am a player of paintball, used to play a lot of aircraft and go to Woods Airball is quite a big change. The movie shows similar types First of all the movie starts off with this team that apparently tries to shoot this "Phantom" guy or whatever, they appear to be a professional team and wear jerseys and shooting mags, autocollers. A sporting guy a bushy. Not much wrong with the movie but more how it's known it was very cheesy. A lot of kids with good players are woodsball players who do not seem to have a lot of money and have the dream getting "better weapons". Another team constantly chooses about them and insults them to play Woods and Blah Blah Phantom Blah to help these woodsball kids out and trains with all this crap, he gets to play airball and basically defeat all the teams including the "professionals". <br /> So what exactly is wrong with the movie? Well the budget is great, a movie film should not be bad but the budget is very low and the film feels like it was done by an amateur. There is no big name in this movie and the act is very cheesy. Perception of paintball is very bad too. They seem to mean that everyone who goes to speedball with all this other crap. It just was a disgusting movie in my opinion and did not give a real perception that paintball is. To be honest true paintball is not all like friends, it's a lot of cussing and balling bonuses by "respecting" and playing by the rules. Do not watch this movie and then hope to go to a field screaming "4 is 1 !!"
