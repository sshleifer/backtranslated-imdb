Ulises is a teacher of literature arriving in a coastal town. There, she will fall in love with Martina, the most beautiful girl in the city. They will begin a rare romance that will end in the tragic death of Ulises in the sea. Some years later, Martina was married to Sierra, the rich man of the city and living a quiet living quaint surrounded by money. One day, the onset of Ulises is making his passion for awakening and acting without consequences. The plot is quite absurd and none of the actors plays a decent part. In addition, three-quarters of the film are sexual acts, which, always were well-filmed, are quite tedious, as we want to see More Development in the Story. It's just a bad movie Bigas Luna, with lots of sex, there is no argument with stupid characters everywhere.
