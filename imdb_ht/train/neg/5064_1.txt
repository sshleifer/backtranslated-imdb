I do not think this film was made. Completely needed. The first movie was okay. But there was no need for an end, certainly not after a TV set that was already an end to the movie first. This movie feels like a soap opera. Writing this is so bad, it's very simple. The jokes do not come across, the act is flat, it's injected like a soap, it misses any direction. The first movie was a good emotional spine behind her. Each character has a little arc. It was very simple then but somehow it worked and I could see the merit of that movie. But this time around, there is no story-line itself. Characters are dread steroids and nothing interesting is happening. One good thing: the Brazilian boy who plays Axel Daeseleire's son is very well disposed. That was one moment of creative success on this movie. I have heard they already shoot a second TV series as an end to 'Spirit Team 2', but please God, do not let them do a slice characteristic slice.
