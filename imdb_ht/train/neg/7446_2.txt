I have 2 words for you. Sean Bean. It is the only refreshing presence of this film. But even so, do not see this movie. Even if it is good as the main villain, you do not want to waste your time. I did not care about the characters (except the little boy) and in fact, I did not really care if the stars crossed lovers ended together or died. The movie did not care or believe that these people care about each other at all. I read a lot of "classic" novels after seeing these films and this movie made me do not even want to read the book. The story looks so boring. But I can go ahead and read it to try to make the story in my head. <br /> <br /> Stay away from Lorna Doone. The actress who played Lorna was also in Sense and Sensibility and was the best of that. Watch Sharpe, Horatio Hornblower, A & E have great films in novels such as pride and prejudice. Or mini like the Forsyte saga. Check out, do not bother with Lorna Doone.
