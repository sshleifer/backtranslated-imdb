The only good thing about this unfunny dreck is that I did not have to pay for it. I've seen it for free college. But if a college student can not find humor in something that was free, it's hopeless. <br /> <br /> Staying active with poor jokes can not be masked by an excellent, yet bewildering design (which goes out of its way to brisk Volkswagon market). I do not know what Michaels Myers did in this movie, but I never saw anything more depressing. This was nothing more than a blatant effort to capitalize on the success of Grinch's (with its opponent, but I enjoyed it very much). It is difficult not to sit in this failure and wonder what best projects are spent on funding it. <br /> You want a funny Seuss entertainment? Go to Grinch.
