A vampire henchman wants to call her after falling in love with a five dollar hooker in this extreme low-budget horror comedy. I can not explain any positive comments about this movie. I'm going to choke it up to mass delusions, but it's bothering no less there. The single redirect factor (and this is me being incredibly generous here) would be the Grandfather who's only the semi-likable character of this whole mess. Do not waste your money or time. In fact here's a word of advice, If Troma puts it on DVD, but DO NOT do it themselves, in all luck it's crap. <br /> <br /> Troma DVD Extras: Commentary with Omar and Kirk; second book and cast and delete scene crew; bloopers; interactivity tron; radiation; Clip from "Terror Terror"; Theater Trailer; Trailer for the "Rowdy Girls", "Catgirls Teens in Heat", "Cannibal: The Musical", and "Toxic 4". <br /> <br /> My Class: D
