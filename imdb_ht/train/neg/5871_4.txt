For this reason only to have a look at this note has seen how bad and funny it might be. There was no doubt about it was funny and bad, because I saw my "Voyna" (1968). Should we start? Here we go ... <br /> <br /> Robert Dornhelm & Pierre Bezukhov Brendan Donnison - a lean fellow who misses the depth of the original; Robert Dornhelm & Brendan Donnison's Natasha Rostova - a scarecrow, his image can cause insomnia; Robert Dornhelm and Andrew Bolkonsky Brendan Donnison - an OK incarnation that, like lean fellow (cf. above), by the depth of a Russian soul and the "struggle"; Robert Dornhelm & Napoleon Brendan Donnison - a rather unimpressive leader; Robert Dornhelm & Prince Brendan Donnison Bolkonsky - a turd with an English figure; Robert Dornhelm & Brendan Donnison's Bezukhov County - a freak-show spineless ... <br /> <br /> The rest of the characters are not the best. <br /> <br /> The movements of the actors and the way they look and talk are often atrocious. They behave like modern EU citizens dressed for a one-day masquerade. It all looks cheap and never comes close to the standards of our Russian people and women in the early 19th century. A good piece of entertainment to examine and make fun of. We had some giggles in our office when we remember this modern product, which was shown in the evening on our television. <br /> "User rating: 8.0 / 10 (29 votes)" - I guess, many young people never looked at our movie ("My Voyna" 1968) or have a weird sense of quality "Tarantino-Spielberg". Remember the scene when our Husar is saving his friends, turning around, shoots, and the bridge goes boom? Look like a CGI explosion. There is neither sense nor craft making a better version of the novel, which was screened well in our country once. But I would like to look at a Russian rumor of "Gone and the Wind". Hey, the directors, wake up and take care of that, instead of our classic disaster. <br /> Now go back to common sense. Jokes sideways. What I mentioned above is nothing new, though extremely dangerous exaggerated. <br /> To make foreign actors trying to pass for Russia (while participating in very serious spells and drama) is a rude mistake and filmmakers are making this mistake again and again. Of course it results in many laughter - especially Clemence Poesy is uncomfortable ridiculous and dancing and singing to a Russian viewer thinking: "This sucks so much that it's funny!"). new, I would like to mention the pace of the movie. In my mind, this new version is very patchy. The story and scenes are not naturally flowing - they are rattled and pop up as in a modern video. Once again I have to remember my "Voyna I", where the action is so natural and the narration is so easy that you simply sit back and enjoy the "go and sink". <br /> I think perhaps Borodino's battle would be great (somehow rehab many drawbacks) but it turned out there was no match for the film-filmed scene in 1968. <br /> There must be a good thing in this movie after all. And there. The actors seem to be trying hard to make it all work. They did not have a chance from the beginning but still joined the "losers team". Plus 1 point for that objectionable. He makes a Russian visitor comfortably - some ironically ridiculous scenes if they are intended to be dramatically powerful and the actors are doing their best. It all recalls mercy, and sometimes - fits in laughs. <br /> What I still love about this series is the last part of it. It clearly shows how everyone gets his or her "salary and taxes". In addition, judging by the movie trailer I thought the movie would have an adult sex scene, which would definitely kill the entire project. But fortunately, he does not have such waste. And it's a big plus. <br /> "Voyna i Mir" is not "Harry Potter" and nowadays, here at present Russia, does not have enough movie craft well. Should I say that moral quality in our lives deteriorates substantially? Fortunately, a suitable film was screened during our Soviet time. The American version of the 1950s was justified to some extent - we did not even exist. There were unexpected circumstances then. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10 (1 points given from the start, 1 point goes for the unconscious, and 2 points for the last part of the series. Thank you for attention.
