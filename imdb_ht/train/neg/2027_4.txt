Unlike the endemol USA two other game shows now (Deal Or Deal and 1 vs. 100), the rhythm of this show is way too slow for what's happening on the screen. <br /> <br /> DOND AND 1 VS. 100 can get away and slow down because the games can change speed - or end - at any moment. There are risks involving each player's action taken, the rewards are wildly variable, and it is difficult for the players to leave with a significant amount of money. Stop typically wearing good use. <br /> <br /> Show me the money, on the other hand, is just too slow-paced. When asked a question and it is obvious that the player knows the correct answer, you can rest assured that absolutely nothing interesting will happen in the next few minutes. It would greatly help the speed of this show to reveal the correct FIRST answer, and the player has chosen a dancer, instead of Shat wasted time talking about what will happen if the player gets a wrong answer when we all knowing they're right. The random dance is filler that actually feels like filler. Too much time is wasted while not enough is happening ... and the fact that players can not choose to leave the game early to guarantee that there will be a lot of time wasting. <br /> Oh, and I have no interest in looking Shat shaking his groin throat, especially right after I ate dinner. <br /> I'm a fan game show all life, but even I've got a lot of trouble sitting in an hour of this. It either needs great change or early retirement.
