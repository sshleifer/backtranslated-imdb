I watched this movie recently with my sister who likes the performances of Sophia Loren. I am a person who is called a Cultural Barber. I hate art in any form or form. Rambo is my more kind of movie, action, kill, blood, horror. If you recognize yourself in this avoiding this movie like the epidemic. No one dies, no action, no stripping, nothing of the kind. Let me give you a summary of a few sentences. It starts out with 5 minutes of black and white Nazi propaganda. Each Italian in a housing block goes to a parade in honor of Hitler, except for a housewife, an anti fascist and a caretaker. Housewife who is cheated by her husband, meets the anti fascist. She fell in love with her, wanting to make her love, but anti fascist is gay. Despite having sex with each other. At the end of the day, the housewife read a book from his gay lover, and the guy himself is deported by silver. End of. Do you want a shorter event? BORING ... That's enough? The guy should use his weapon from the beginning of this film and shoot himself, to save the audience in this atrocity. On a note to my sister I liked this movie. As I said, I'm a Cultural Barber ...
