The only good thing about this movie was the shotgun at Goldie Hawn standing in its little French bikini off panties and struggling to hold a dozen other women scraped out by removing his little cotton skimpy while giggled with cooed. Ooooof! She's kidnapped those rivals in Nina Hartley. This movie came when I was fourteen and that the shot almost killed me. I would forget about it all tucked away in the naughty Roladex in my mind until seeing it the other day on television, where they actually trouble meddling it in that scene, mournful, remind me that a smokin 'hottie of a woman Goldie Hawn was in the '80s. Kurt Russell must have had a fun life.
