This film is a shame in the Major League franchise. I live in Minnesota and I can not believe they are cast Cleveland. (Yes I realized in real-time Indians were very good, and the Twins took over their seats at the bottom of the American League, but still consistent.) Anyway I loved the first bigger, liked The second, and always look forward to the third, when the Indians would finally go all the way through the series. You can not tell me this was not the plan after the second film was finished. What happened? Anyways if you're a true fan of the original Major League make yourself a favor and do not watch this junk.
