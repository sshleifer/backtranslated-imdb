The first ten minutes of this film about making an international film in Belgium are fine: you see real mess on the series, a producer on the edge of a nervous breakdown, the fresh-headed director (Mickey Rourke), the starry weather , etc. You've seen everything before, but it's well done. But after that! The rest of the time the movie just repeats itself: the ten minutes are over and over again. There is no bigger point, no dramatic development, no good action, not even bad act, it just goes over and over and over. Mickey Rourke has two good minutes when talking about her character on her career in a scene where reality and fiction meet. All along, making 12 good minutes. <br /> <br />
