Many women can not sit, talk, smoke. They have another woman in a wheelchair to hide because it is deformed, and occasionally kills one to feed this person's body that really looks like some small store shops that are bought that are dressed by sticking to a finger some plastic. We do not see to kill anyone, suddenly there is a body on the floor, covered by a similar leaf. I can not eat spam covered by a sheet of paper again because of that. Just thinking of spam is covered by a leaf is enough to provoke even the nasal-optic fit brought on by trying to get through this movie. Occasionally there are scenes of a guy who is "hunting" by way of torturing some guy he attached to a chair is his basement. Why he holds this guy and how it is connected to the Sit-On-The-Couch Sisters never explained. There are also scenes of some guy "guy" freaking out. It will be p *** it's blood and punches in a wall, but who it is or wrong with him does not explain or even tied to the story. <br /> <br /> There is no action, no special effects, no history. If you want to watch some boring people talk in a profound way about anything while sitting around and eating ham and smoking, then here's 90 minutes from that, because, except for a scene where a chick does some skirmish In a street corner and aforementioned the random scene, absolutely nothing happens. (YAWN) Oh, I almost forgot, you get to see them move some things, including the depressed sister, when going to the new apartment. It's one of the few times they're not sitting on a couch or lying in the bed.
