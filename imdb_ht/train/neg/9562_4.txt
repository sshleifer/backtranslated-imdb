I think this could have been a decent movie, and some of its parts are OK ... but the whole of it in a movie B. Even on the plot, the parties are OK but have holes and several non-oddities well add them. Interesting is especially OK, I've seen it worse too. :) <br /> <br /> In the beginning sets the level, and car driving through the desert, making "cool", but totally unnecessary jumps in some small dunes (In slow motion! Cool!), like the drivers never seen sand before ... It gets a little better out there, but not much. <br /> If you're going to rent this, find someone else and use this one as a warm-up. Hold low expectations and can work for you.
