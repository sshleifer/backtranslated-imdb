They must just be done as well as being able with a budget of five shillings and suspense, but the dialogue was cheesy than 9lbs of emmental and the CGI was a little old hat right now. Maybe if some of the actors were not so perfectly chiselled out of granite it would have made the movie a little better too .. To say this was terrible is to make this movie a mis-service, if you want to see a something that is exactly Exactly, you have to sit and waste a couple of hours in your life watching 'sick', which is sooo numbingly awful idea, it's actually good, (several big alcoholic beverages are still deriguer though. , I enjoyed this movie and it should be worth a look if you have not seen it again, just do not expect anything on the lines of 'Jurassic Park, the Lost World' or 'Apocalypto'.
