This photo reminds me a Keneth More photos from 1957 called the admirable Crighton "also on the boat he was a servant and on the island he became the master and on being saved back back to domestic. some movies however this one does not fire .. If there is any picture showing Madonna can not act it is this one. <br /> I'm not sure this was a subtle copy of the "admirable Crighton" but it sure looks like it and if that's the case then Hollywood must run out of mind and that's sad .. to give a platform for actors to improve their career profile and just about that this fails in every corner and detail <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </a>, I think of films such as "A League of Their Own" were quite good and enjoyable with "Who in this girl" showed a quirkiness in Madonna's style by showing must be before or after. Madonna movie is not as enjoyable and I would like to see a set of Madonna animations and the character from "Who's Girl" I like the music from the two films however "swept" at the bottom in the pile here and will be so. <br /> <br /> Everyone has a bomb right?
