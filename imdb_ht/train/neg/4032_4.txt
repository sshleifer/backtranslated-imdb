I have never heard of this one before it came back on cable TV. It's very typical at the end of Sci-Fi 50s: mild, depressing and not a little paranoia! Despite the equally typical inclusion of a romantic couple, the film is pretty much put through in a documentary style - which is perhaps a cheap way of leaving a lot of exhibitions in narration and an excuse to insert as many stock stocks as human is possibly what unmistakably a very low-budget enterprise! While not refreshing in itself (angle-apocalypse-via-renegade-missile later used, with larger aplomb, for both DR STRANGELOVE [1964] and FAIL-SAFE [1964]) and short thanks, single approach -Please watch the movie in the outcome of its subjects in a good deal of involuntary laughs - particularly in the scenes involving an imminent delivery with a juvenile juvenile delinquent gang!
