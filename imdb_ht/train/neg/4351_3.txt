Each generation fully believes it lives in the end times. This was true for thousands of years now. And movies like this feed on this. How did Orson Welles find them telling this wreck trains? This is a documentary on the biblical prophecies of Armageddon. He tries to connect the prophecies as well as he can of what happened in his time, making it obviously dated and unusual. <br /> <br /> Reenactments look like they come from "Unsolved Mysteries" but worthless to high yields. People should be embarrassed to take part in this. <br /> <br /> In short, the movie is dated, funny, archaic, and useless. Well if you want a good laugh, but it's not good enough to actually look for.
