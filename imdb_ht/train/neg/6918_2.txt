I went for this film to believe it was good evaluation. Firstly, it is ridiculous that they are releasing an original film made in 2001, seven years later in 2008 here in India. All of the movie looks dating. Even for 2001 the film looks like it did on a string string budget. There is a scene where a taxi hit an elaborate man how to budget you can get. Anthony Hopkins does not seem to know what he's doing in the movie. It ends up giving a long monologue towards the end. If the film had bright spark during this scene, I missed it as I was sleeping on my seat. There is nothing about Jennifer Hewitt likes to resemble a Devil. She wears ill-surface surfaces with scowls in random children. As for Alec Baldwin a scene where he goes to meet Webster for the first time is not to be missed. What a waste of money! As Anthony Hopkins rightly put it, "Go back home and write better!"
