Frank Tashlin in the 'Front Home' is one of the more thin Slaps Private Shades, a series of animated cartoons made as an educational film for the military. Instead of Snafu taking some unacceptable actions that lead to disaster, the 'Front House' rather focuses on loved ones back home and how much they have to offer in the war effort too. Snafu realized it was wrong when he thought it was easy. It's a concept with some possibilities for good gaming and instead Tashlin plays the most challenging card, extensive jokes that include debris and scantily clad girls dance in place of very effective funny action. The result is a brief but significant meaning of little importance or entertainment value today other than as a historical artifact.
