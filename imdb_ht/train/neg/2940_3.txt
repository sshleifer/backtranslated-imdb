I saw this movie when I was really little. It is, far away, one of the weird movies I've ever seen. Now, normally, I love strange movies, but this was just a bit too much. There is not much of a draw in the movie. If anything, it starts out like story games, where games come to life, and Raggedy Ann and Andy go on an adventure to rescue their new friends, Babette. From there, insanity frowns. There's the greedy, Looneys, a sea monster named Gazooks, and a bunch of Pirates singing show tunes, all of which just made films in films. Also, I can not help but feel that Babette is annoying with a bit too much. It definitely did not help the movie. <br /> Now, though I did not like this movie, there was a nice party. I love to sing the camel. Even though it was a song about being alone, she had a friendly feel. Then there was Sir Leonard. While most of the Looneys were just plain black, Sir Leonard was the most interesting and probably the funniest. Wa Koo Koo was just a little tirtbag that made Dr. Bad look like a serious villain. Also, there was Andy's Raggedy song, no girl's toy. It was definitely good song for little boys who wanted to act hard. But honestly, even things did not make the movie any better. (But remember, this is just my perspective.) While I personally would not recommend this movie, even I have to admit, it has its good moments. Watch it if you are interested, but only if you're in the mood for something "really" out of the ordinary.
