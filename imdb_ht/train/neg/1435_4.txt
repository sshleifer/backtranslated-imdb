This film was made in Saskatchewan and Manitoba Parks and has again seen the world again in what little of "Wild West Canada" left. When Archie started writing his story for the papers; thought of the day had tasted the desert and converted / absorbed the nation nations first. The movie puts forward and asks the question; Why would a well-educated English, Englishman become an Indian? <br /> <br /> Archie, like an English boy dream about becoming something but thrilling to the full meaning of this dream is unique and priceless - no matter what it is. Sounds like a famous puppet story by it. <br /> In my opinion, I saw Archie becoming my living image of the "American Cigarette Store" a very wooden and not real character at all - very well done on the part of Mr. Brosnan. He also described the wooden Indians in the dance scene for the tourist. The mob and reality he did not realize until he met with his wife, Annie. Annie pushes Archie in one direction that would lead him to the forefront of the English world, not as himself but Gray Owl - a Canadian native of the desert borders. <br /> <br /> This is Archie is closer to becoming the noble nobody prototype. <br /> <br /> Mr. Brosnan's interpretation as well as director is both well-off. I looked at Gray Owl documentary and I think this is a great movie screen for adding to my collection. <br /> <br /> Spoiler - I thought the final scenes and Archie went to meet the council of Chiefs was a big big moment in the movie. <br /> <br /> Very beautiful Canadian lake landscape with real "Gray Owl" location. <br /> <br />
