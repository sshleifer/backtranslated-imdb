I'll say that at least the movie makes sense, but it's bad. Acting for the most part is not good (I think heaven only showed no promise) and you feel awkward to watch it. All of the scenes should be meaningful, as Ng comes out of her parents. There are a lot of trite details, such as the kanji tattoo on the shoulders of the sky, the magnets on the fridges of the girls and the awesome god decor of these sets ... and the music ... and clothes .. and everything. Real life is never like this movie. The boy says in a point "I'm gay, not rooster." And they are not aware. Even the comment is awful, I turn it off after Ng speech about how it was weirded out to play a lesbian.
