Oh, it's amazing how one can claim global warming to be a science, well, I guess this nonsense elite is now replacing the aging science! Al Gore tries to sound this problem complicated, though it just needs common sense to see the whole thing is a big mistake by a man and his own money agenda! How do scientists estimate the historical temperature in this planet? Do not estimate the sun's activity. Has anyone ever questioned whether this method was accurate? No, not even gore himself! So how does the heck would not be accurate to forecast future temperatures and sun spots if it was accurate in the past? Under the sun's temperature today's temperature is totally in line with what it should be. How does the temperature of the universe rise (relatively) the same as the earth? Did our SUV cause temperature on Jupiter to climb? <br /> Use some common sense! You do not need to be a rocket scientist to figure out that this can be nothing other than a HOAX. Please do research on yourself. What Al Gore and his friends elitems like Rothschild (family banking that host live live events) get out of this? Well, the new global bank will be founded on carbon credits, it's the tax on everything that gives CO2 omissions, and it's easier to get away with these taxes if the people are attracted to thinking it is to save the world It is only about money, centralized control and more power to the elite bankers. Al Gore has even a company that sells carbon credits! Is it not noble to pay carbon credits voluntarily to save the world, especially if it goes to its own company? <br /> I do not want you gameplay to believe me, please do your own research and use your own common sense and I'm sure you will come to the right conclusion!
