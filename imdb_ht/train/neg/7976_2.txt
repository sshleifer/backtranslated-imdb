You believe in God or not. You believe in Jesus or do not. You believe it is the Son of God or you do not. The choice is up to you. <br /> <br /> Director of Denys Arcand has really done everything he could bring back to Jesus in a historical figure, social worker, two sons, instead of the Son of God, the Holy Spirit and Mary open the heavens again for us. Encourage the Big Bang, a world from evolution, instead of seeing the beauty of creation. The film depicts a theologian brings some "modern outcomes" to the actor who plays Jesus in the passionate passion, who happily embody them in his play. The priest shows that running the temple where the Passion is held in Montreal has a sexual relationship with one of the female players of the Passion instead of showing his love for God through celibacy. More often than not the abomination of the director of the Church is clearly visible. <br /> <br /> The principal tried to make a parallel between Jesus' life and the actor's passion. This is an admirable attempt, but describes the Resurrection and Transplantation of the Actor Passion Organs play in the other body as the director thinks about Jesus. <br /> <br /> My opinion is not important, God's opinion is, but I do not want to stand in the shoes of the director and actor when standing before the throne of Jesus.
