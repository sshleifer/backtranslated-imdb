All the funny looking things in this sitcom are based on Jim's main character being either a bad father, a bad husband or generally just envious selfish. How can this be funny? Of course a character in a sitkon has to be flawed, but Jim's character is flawed in a very unsympathetic way. <br /> Why is it that? I guess is that it's because "it should now be best". Jim is not a stupid guy, he can take care of the things and he has the opportunity to do this. But he does not choose. It's a conscious choice he does, choosing not to play with his kids, does not go shopping because he does not want to buy "product lady" and it's a choice he does when put down his family. <br /> <br /> The other characters seem to be only in the series for Jim may be someone to be a jerk. If the character Cheryl was a real person, he would leave him years ago, and not stay with the deadbeat for 8 years. But alas, it's just a catalyst for extreme selfish extreme of Jim's original.
