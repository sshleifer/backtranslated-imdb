I'm quite sure that this was the worst movie ever made. If you can not make a laugh 13 year old laugh in humorous humor you should give up comedy forever. Unfortunately Joan Rivers has chosen differently. The film is all predictable gag (some of these are racists) and many unfunny jokes. Particularly memorable is the scene where the doctor tells the lead character that the rabbit has died and is pregnant (as I write this, I can not believe this was actually a movie scene). The man rushes into a rabbit dead on the office doctor and tries to give it mouth to his mouth. ROTFLMAO! PA! The short punch line can tell you how bad the things in this film are "I knew I should be on top." ha ha ha ha ah ........
