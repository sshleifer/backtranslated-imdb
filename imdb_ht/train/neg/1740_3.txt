The movie was a big disappointment. Especially since he was led by Priyadarshan, he was sad to see these standards of participation. Poor screenplay (almost non-existent) and song sequences and bad songs every minute and at the most odd times killed all that humor movie could offer. Some of the scenes were funny, but it probably amounted to only 5 mins in the entire duration. The correction was bad. Dismal! The overall film shame as the lack of history was only too obvious. In fact, only a few people were left to watch the second half of the movie after the interval. One would not miss anything if you did not watch the movie. Not worth the cost of ticket fare on this movie. wait until it looks on TV ...
