Frank Sinatra was away from the acting actor for the West. He was a great actor, From Here for eternity and the Man and the Golden Arms are a proof that, but he did not have the physical in a western hero, you identified him as an urban guy. But he tried to do his job well at Johnny Concho, the fact that the movie was a failure in the box office was not his fault. I blame it on two factors: a) The story was too weird, especially in the fact that Sinatra behaves more like a cruel than a hero of the movie. In a genre where people expect a certain pattern, they break away from it the movie must be very good. b) The story is not convincing, it's hard to believe that a whole city will allow Sinatra to do anything he wants just because of fear of his brothers. Also when someone shows him a special pocket that will open aside that he does not have to draw the gun you wonder if that will make him irresistible, why all the gunfighters have not adopted it? I think this movie should not have been removed, because any movie with Sinatra is worth seeing, and despite its imperfections it is always enjoyable
