Really, really bad. How to make a movie this bad thing? I kept waiting for some Axis scheme points, interesting work cameras, or at least some free nudity but I got nothing. I was just watching Fever Cabin and I thought it was a wreck train (except for the stripping and pancakes) but it looks like engineering compared to this drak. The best script doctor in the world could not save this pile of pills. <br /> <br /> The only thing for this "movie" is that it ended. I had a headache just thinking about this movie and trying to write something. Ugh! I'm glad I only paid $ 5 for it and will soon end up in a dump.
