This 1977 culture film has two crazy lesbians (Sandra Locke & Colleen Camp) that appear in George Manning's social wealth house (Seymour Cassel), hoping to locate a residence they can not seem to find. But these two other plans in mind, when finding George's wife is out of town, they end up taking control of the residence, tied George, killing a boy delivery while destroying the whole place in one evening. Cheerful and disturbing movie, but the two find just reward in the same physical way as the movie ends. Most will either grip it right off or get caught in this funny movie after about 30 minutes in it. Either way some even consider this a classic cult. <br /> <br /> Larry Dodson
