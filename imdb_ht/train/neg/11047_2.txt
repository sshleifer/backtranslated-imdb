There are two reasons I did not give a 1 in this movie. One of the reasons is some of the actors (such as Malcolm McDowell and Gwynyth Walsh), who tried to play in the usually good levels of acting. However in many scenes were somehow blocked by the bad scripting. The other reason is the cool and looking idea of ​​the Cyborg, which is quite different from most of the other roles I have seen so far. <br /> <br /> Everything else in this movie is as bad as it can. Boring scene, useless and boring dialogue, malicious script work. And it looked like it was the first movie ever for many actors. It could be an interesting story though, but they failed completely.
