The movie begins with people on Earth discovering that the missiles in Mars have not lost but it was just drifting out of space near planet. And when one of the crew members is ill, one is alive and the other two are missing. What happened to said in a flashback by members of survival. While on Mars, the crew was apparently attacked by a whole army of very dummy eyed monsters. Strangely, while these sets were pretty good, the monsters were among the silliest I saw on film. Plus, in an odd attempt to realism, the production uses a process called "Cinemagic". Unfortunately, this lovely innovation just makes the movie look very cheap when they were on the mass surface and the intensity of the red practically made my eyes bleeding - it was wrong !! Despite all the cheese, the film has a somewhat interesting plot as well as a good message about space travel. For lovers of the genre, it is well worth seeing. For others, you can just get the whole thing unusual - see for yourself and decide. While not today's standards this is not an especially good Sci-Fi film, compared to the films they made at the time, it piles up very well. <br /> PS - When you watch the movie, pay attention to Dr. Tremayne. It looks like the spit image of Dr. Quest from the cartoon "Jonny"! Plus, it sounds and acts like him, too.
