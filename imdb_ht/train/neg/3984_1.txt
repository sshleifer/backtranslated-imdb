I saw this film some years back on the BBC I sat on it. How? I do not know, this is the way up there in these "bad bad" kidneys, Kidman, Baldwin, and Pullman must be cringe when they see it right now. I think Woody Allen would have worked wonders with the unusual scheme, and the party Baldwin could be played with gusto by Leslie Nelson.it was over again tonight I tried to watch it again but life was too short. The few minutes I watched for Nicolline was beautiful she was so hot around 93, did Baldwin ever make a good movie? Pullman played his stock in the trade "handsome, but dim" F-word character from his mouth when ladies from "frasier" miscast ed as a detective accused him of murdering evil sounds. stay far away.
