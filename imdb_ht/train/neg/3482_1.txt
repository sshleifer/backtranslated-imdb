So I know that I've voted 1 out of 10 but really worth not more than half a star. I hated it. It was so stupid and unrealistic, I can not believe any of the stars signed on doing this ridiculous project. It was excellent in the characters with Ben Affleck and Cathrine O'Hara Christina Applegate was just as good too, but the story sucked and encouraged anyone who saw this in the video store does not even bother picking it and reading the back cover , but just walk away ... I do not even want to get into what the movie is over, because it's too stupid to pontify. <br /> <br /> Do not rent this! It's awful! Terib!
