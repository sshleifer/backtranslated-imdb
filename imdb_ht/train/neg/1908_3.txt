But another insult and slap in the face of gay men everywhere. This tram attempt at a comedy has nothing to recommend. Once again we have an attractive 'right' hero who supposedly can not find any woman to be interested in him. Yeah, right! And we're also presented with 'sympathetic, attractive' gay friend who is actually a fat, balding, ugly old man whom the lead is supposed to attract. Even I did not get it appealing and I'm a fat, ugly old gay male (but thankfully not balding)! Whatever acting talent can be here has been thrown away on a bad script, and really awful direction. Mr. Sneedeker should be banned from filmdom, but then he has no different than many hackers working in Hollyweed.
