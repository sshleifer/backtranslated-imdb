Probably New Zealands Worst Films Ever Made <br /> The Jokes Are Not Funny. Used from other movies & just plain coral The act is bad though there is a great cast <br /> <br /> The story is refreshing & boring There is more cheese then pizza coffee cheesy lovely pizza type such as the acting tea making 1,000 times before <br /> I watch this when it comes to TV but it was so boring could stand only 30 minutes into it. <br /> <br /> This film absorbs <br /> does not look it, <br /> <br /> Look at the paint rather dry
