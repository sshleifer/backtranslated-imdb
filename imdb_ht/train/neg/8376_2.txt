"Little Man", now on DVD, is a brave brave bravery. It's the story of a less than a midget criminal playing by Marlon Wayans, who hid a diamond in a lady's backpack after an heist. She and her partner Tracy Morgan cooked up the plan to disguise Marlon as a baby and planted her in the lady's house. He then goes through all sorts of "Home alone" or "Play for kids" such as destruction to get the harder back and be treated like a baby. I was surprised at how the humor was in this movie. Jokes are made in other places many times, that they are not nice or funny. I almost think that the movie might be funnier if they did not use CGI and used the little actor that Marlon's face was stuck on. In watching the deleted scenes (less CGI) this actor was funny in a Mini-me as way, but they chose a different route. A few gastos and Tracy Morgan make some funny scenes .Repeat your rent $ on Borat if you want some real laugh these days. <br /> <br /> http://mcmusicnotes.blogspot.com
