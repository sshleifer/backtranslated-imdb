Since I loved the Inspector's cartoon in the 80's, I went to see this movie. I wasted my money. The plot was very thin. Also, the movie could not keep me interested for long. I was happy he had passed. <br /> <br /> If you want to see gadget inspectors, watch the design instead. It was better than the movie.
