1st look 12/6/2009 - 4 out of 10 (Dir-Walter Lang): Designate music from a characteristic point of view, in my opinion, from this many-edged Rodgers and Hammerstein pieces. There are a couple of good songs and a comic stripping decent, at times, in the king of Siam by Yul Brynner - but the movie does not really do a good job of presenting the situation with the settings. I can only blame the scenario and possibly some of the act as why we do not completely understand the character and situations. I know it might be a bit too much demanding of a music meant for the fun of the songs and the dance, but even this party did not stand out a lot for me. The basic scenario is about an English woman coming to Siam to teach children about extending European things. We get later that the king is actually the biggest student. There is a side to ban romance between the new wife, played by Rita Moreno (a Latino as an Arab - coming on !!) and an ancient lover that causes some hassle, but nothing really fascinated added though. Deborah Kerr, as Annie's main girl - is OK, but not convinced either. The king learns some things because of his presence and then the movie disappears as he does. This is really a miniature story with some songs and dancing but not great in an experience for a real viewer.
