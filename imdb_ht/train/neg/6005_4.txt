This is a classic stinker with a great cast calling, especially the seniors who were well past the first and the sleep of this one. <br /> This is quite a depressing film when you think about it. Stay on the ground, and you will deal with illness and eventually break you. Gwen Verndon showed that he could still dance. Too bad the movie did not focus more on that. Maureen Stapleton, looking haggard, always appears the steps from "Queen of the Starroom Dust," so much more down to earth from 10 years earlier. <br /> I only hope this film does not encourage seniors to commit suicide to the level of Jim Jones. How can someone be idiotically enough to love this and say it gets you thinking? <br /> Why Do Don Ameche Have an Oscar for This Nonsense? If the elderly were doing such a wonderful thing in the end, why was the little boy encouraged to get into the boat? Why Steve Guttenberg jumps as well? After all, he found his love lady. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, with the exception of Wilford Brimley, this was a nice movie if the seniors were just managing to find the sources of youth on earth and stay there. In this writing, Vernon, Gilford, Stapleton, Ameche, Tandy, Cronyn and Lord know that others are all gone. Writers should have taken the scenario and placed it with this group as well.
