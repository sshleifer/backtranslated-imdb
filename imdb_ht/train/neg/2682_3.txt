I was looking forward to seeing this movie for a long time, after seeing "Back to Paradise," which I found to be fearless. I was so disappointed. The most realistic thing about it was the unpredictable ending that I thought was partly stolen from "Back to Paradise." <br /> <br /> Maybe I was expecting too much. <br /> <br /> On the positive Danes side, Beckinsale and Pullman were fantastic in their role. Although I did not like the character Danes and first and found it annoying. I did not see anything realistic about the movie. He could have done much better, for example being able to have more emphasis on the prison conditions and the sheer horror. He was too busy to be a realistic film. There could also have been more action and tension <br /> <br /> The best thing about this film is "tragic" to finish. I could not predict it. But by this time I really did not care what happened to them. <br /> <br /> 3/10
