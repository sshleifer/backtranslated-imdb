When you look at little people, you'll spend time running it trying to figure out its many plot holes. And this is not a good sign because this film is supposed to be a comedy! You should laugh at it! But will you? Probably not. <br /> <br /> The main problem with little man is his concept- far too ridiculous to accept (even as a cartoonish comedy), so when the loud, the work and the jokes themselves Shooters of them, doing all the stuff seems ten times stupider than it is already. <br /> "But it's a comedy" some of you might be screaming. That's true, but that does not have any excuse for such a mute scheme. I mean to come on, think about it if you've seen a baby with a growing FACE, you would not be the least suspect? But if Calvin wanted to hide the diamond so badly, why did not he put it in a nearby shelf instead of a hand but womans hand? And how does a qualified physician NOT recognize that Calvin is a grown man? I mean seriously ... what? <br /> <br /> "It's not about the plot, it's about to laugh" you might be screaming. Well heres thing to see, there is hardly any laugh in little man and that just makes the dumb ass plot stand out all the more. <br /> <br /> If you really want to look at a comedy comedy comedy with a suspended suspension, stick to white chicks because at least that has a few decent dreams. Whenever you do not drag the little ones away.
