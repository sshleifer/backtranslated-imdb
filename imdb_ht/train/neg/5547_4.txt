REVOLT of the zombies (2 outta 5 stars) No, this is not a long-lost classic George A. Romero's flicks. This is a low-budget potboiler from 1936 that probably seemed very cool audience in the time ... but looks awfully routine these days. There is actually a very good scene at the start of a soldier shot on his pistol in a horde of soldiers approaching ... and a close-up of bullets entering the chest to make in one of them. The effect looks hopelessly fake these days but in 1936 I'm sure he was gasping audience. The story concerns the search for the secret of self-control ... officially created an unstoppable zombie army ... but later as a means of a character to win the woman he loves. The film is barely an hour long, but moving at a snail's speed to seem like-length, believe me! There really is not much to recommend ... you can find some entertainment in the studio studio shots of the star "wading" in a "swamp". The funky ending ... So I'd say the movie is worth seeing at least once. More than likely you will see it as an extra feature on some cheap "4 Movies on 1 DVD" compilation of Wal Mart for five bucks. Hey, it's well worth the money ...
