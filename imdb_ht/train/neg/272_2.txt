When I was younger I really liked watching bad TV. We were all guilty of it in some time or another but excused myself to look at things like "Buck Rogers in the 25th Century" and "Silver Spoons" this: I was young and naive; ignorant of what makes a really refreshing show. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, I now appreciate the good thing. Stargate SG-1 is not good. The 12 year old I would love every bit of fun in it, every line of dialogue stilted, all the bit of useless technobabble. The writing is beyond acidic; so marvelous and unimpressed it makes one miss Star Trek: Voyager. If your show me long for the worst cartoon show ever, you are in trouble. The movie stargate is a delightful pleasure ceremony, anchored by two solid performances by James Spader and Kurt Russell, full of fascinating Egyptian architecture and culture, a beautiful music note, and cool sci-fi ideas. With the exception of a little bit of the original music, none of which made the movie fun to appear in this show. Even Richard Dean Anderson, who makes MacGyver beckon and exciting saga, seems to be half as much episodic sleep. <br /> <br /> The budget must have been very low because the sets sometimes look like someone's basement. Cinematography is no better, such as vanilla and subjects like the scripts. It amazes me that with a lot more style (such as Farscape) and substance (like the reimagine Battlestar Galactica) there are smaller, less rugged fanbases than it will not. It just does not deserve it.
