When I was at school I had to make a movie about a couple walking around in the trees and talking, and I realized half of correction that this was not just a stupid missing strategy, but a clich√© of Canadian movies: sodden lyrisism married to empty, metaforous- load burden of social book. But regardless of my own movie failure I feel better after seeing this ... this ... thing. For one thing, I run 20 minutes, by 85, and it has more content in this: every bit of free business here is fawned on for four, five, six minutes relentlessly. The male foot is just incredible, a sound noise, loudmouthed creep to the dramatic-driven crisis enhances in between browsing abrupt philosophy from U to T pub, and has given so much space and space to hated it. Admittedly, if it was not like a hole ** then the third act would make even less sense, as a couple snarky dudes show up to provide far and eerie odds of 'exploitation' values; but it does not make it any easier to watch the rubber crack tire "please" in bulk until the journal runs out. I took back what I said about OUVIN BEFORE, which at least had the courage of its own lechery: this cinematic criminal is and will remain the very worst Canadian film ever. At least, I really hope that.
