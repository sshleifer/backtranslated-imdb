I watched 'jealousy' two nights ago, on DVD, in a friend's house. The first of this film is quite promising, Jack Black and Ben Stiller in a comedy with a lot of potential, but it's completely overlooked to deliver. I watched her with five friends and no-one laughs for the whole movie. The joke (which is some and far between) is NOT funny in any way ... The story line is crap, and they never answer the question ... WHERE? Of course the answer to this is no car. This film lacks any sort of comedy value, and as a few other users said the only thing that makes it almost worth watching is Christopher Walken as the J-man. None of the characters they develop, their cemeteries are minimal to almost transparent - and that the song all the movie is supposed to be funny ??
