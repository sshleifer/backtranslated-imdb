When I was a kid, I remember watching this while visiting a friend of our "Uncle Phil". We're back! A dinosaur story is a most funny cartoon about a dinosaur named Rex (voiced by John Goodman's beautiful). He tells a little boy dinosaur the story of how dinosaurs have returned to Earth to live. He explains that it was part of the thing that brought them back, along with some friends. The doctor / bad teacher in this movie I think they could be responsible for being turned off, but I do not care about him. Children can love this, but personally it is just too cheesy. John Goodman was probably the only thing decent. Poor!
