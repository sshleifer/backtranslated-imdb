I got a DVD from "Bogeyman" and this stunker was an extra feature. I assume that he was "Boogeyman II" because he was frightening with the original. But you know what to say about people who "assume": it makes an "ass-" from "u -" and "me." I have read before to look that BII has a lot of footage from the original and that he plays actress love. While watching "Back to the Boogeyman," I decided to stick to the original foot to see the scene of death by toothbrush. Before I knew it, the movie ended. Rip off. I think I thought this was BII because this has a similar title to one of BII's alternate titles. Oh well, at least this was just an extra feature, right? <br /> <br /> Let me stop talking about my mistake and start talking about the movie error. Many, many, errors. Who does this guy Ulli Whatever thought he is? Does it really think that the same movie will be sold in different forms. There is nothing original to keep Part III. It is basically a flashback of the original in the eyes of a psychic, who will give you a great play-not-play toy as everything happens. This is the movie. Oh, with a death-by-stereo scene, but you can read off someone else's review. My interest in "Boogeyman II" is forever lost. <br /> <br /> Final note: This is not a series of movies to look back at.
