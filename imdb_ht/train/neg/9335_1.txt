The reason is such a bad movie is because it is so very seriously written, and that's entirely the fault of the novel Hack Robert James Waller, also author of the Madison County Bridge. The word is bad because the plot is paralyzed and the dialogue is wooden and implausible. A negative couple ?? an American writer blocking with a beautiful Mexican woman and a story in which she is ashamed ?? They are swept by a strong, self-governing criminal, and after a few adventures (especially violent violent) alternating with scenes that show the warmest side of the assassin, he leaves the impotent partner for the assassin, who, his bad way , see him more clearly than anyone who has before. There is nothing that can help this film succeed, not even the seamed figure of Scott Glenn as the killer, by the Latinite appeal to Giovanna Zacar√≠as as Luz, and not even the stalwart performance of Harvey Keitel as the CIA specialist assigned to track the killer goes down. A serious waste of time.
