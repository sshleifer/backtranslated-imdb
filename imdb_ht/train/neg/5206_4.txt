Adapting the movie play is often a bad idea because they have two different medias. Do you think it's a great idea to do ZULU in a stage game? Imagine where the two mighty redcoat sit in a tent argument "Blimey has thousands of them out" Great movie with a bad stage game <br /> <br /> In order for a great playing movie to have great movies there's two essentials Need <1) A fine cast created on screen screens <br /> 2) Great dialogue <br /> <br /> On paper Cher and Chazz Palminterri would be a good casting choice but not in the roles . The story revolves around a hit-man playing by Palminterri break in a house to kill a wife playing by Cher and most of the action takes place indoors. I could take these two characters seriously though perhaps it was the fault in the script that can not decide whether it was trying serious or funny. Since its very static story is of extreme importance that the dialogue shines and once again because of the scarce tone of the scenario it embarrassed more than anything else and much of the revolutionary conversation of sex acts. if you want to see a great translation of a transfer game transfer to the silver screen to give a loyal miss and watch 12 BEST FRIENDS
