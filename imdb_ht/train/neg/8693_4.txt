I am from the Dallas / Fort Worth area and lived in Arlington for a few years. This movie was in style as far as making it look like Arlington. I saw mountains in the background of one scene! Texas does not have mountain. I guess what's going on is a movie that is supposed to be in Texas filmed in Canada. The accents are also really bad. They should have gotten actors from Texas to play the parts. There are a lot of aspiring actors from Texas from Hollywood. The movie is really sad though, because it's a true story. I pray that the assassin is found and convicted. The good thing is that bc to his death, we now have Amber Alert's help to find children who disappear quickly after being kidnapped.
