If you hit yourself with a shovel, write the script and your foot, you can get close to the intelligence level of this movie. There is nothing in this film that has not done a thousand times gangster other gangster and doing better. Those who think "Scarface" had some kind of heroes to look up or saw "Goodfellas", "Threat II Society" or "Middle President" and think MMM "That's life for me!" will love this movie. I thought I would give the movie a chance, since the site was perfect for a prequel. I should have known better after seeing Mario Van Peebles and Sean Combs involved. Anyone who is above a 4th grade education, looked the original with Pacino, a real actor, and must meet.
