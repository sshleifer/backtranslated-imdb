If you are looking for eye candy, you can enjoy Sky Captain. Sky Captain is just a video game shot and live performer. Visuals are beautiful and interesting to watch in during the entire movie. Now, say that, the visuals are the only good thing in Captain Sky. After ten minutes, I knew I was watching one of the movies getting worse at all times. I was hoping this movie would get better, but it never achieved any degree of interest. After thirty minutes, encourage to walk out to keep growing and growing. Now I own more than 2000 cinemas and have seen five times that number. But this is only the second movie I felt like walking out of my whole life. <br /> <br /> Actress --- no. The three main performers are debilitating. Jude Law (also in the other movie I wanted to walk out) is just awful in the title role. I'd rather sit down in Ben Affleck in Gigli than the Act Again. <br /> <br /> Paltrow is trying hard to camp, to back in his face. The last article I read was that Paltrow was thinking of staying home and being a mom rather than acting. After this performance I would applaud that decision. <br /> <br /> History --- Soap opera are best written. The story behind the Captain Sky begins bad and it gets worse as it progresses. <br /> <br /> Reports --- none. Everything has been put into special effects as stories, acting and directing many breaths. Even the "Phantom Threats" was best acted with what not a big deal. I should give this movie a "0" from "10". Avoid paid theater cost and wait until video release.
