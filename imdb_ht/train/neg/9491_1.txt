This movie makes you really appreciate the invention of the fast forward button on your remote control. She's excitedly excited in beautiful pictures. For once Hamilton goes relatively easy on soft shots concentrated. However, what I find difficult to take on the movie was that although Anja Schüte was about 19 when she shot the girls are portraying as younger than younger ones actually. That's all Lolita things as there is an older man involved to let me rather uncomfortable. The heroine is actually razor in the pubic area in order to make her look even younger than she is. Come, sex is a good past time - between adult consent. Another thing I found to be odd was that neither Beart nor Schüte has a nude scene in the movie, well, it is not a proper one at least.
