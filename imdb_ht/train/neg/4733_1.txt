I can not believe I actually sit in the whole thing. This movie has the worst since Killjoy. <br /> Here's a brief description of the field: The movie starts out with Jojo and other chick sitting around on the beach, drooling on a thin blonde-haired "Hunk" beach that looks like it was not in the gym a day of his life. Somehow, everyone knows it, and every single chick in the movie wants it. UH OH! Here comes the competition! Stereotype "The Hot Chick" with her best friend, driving an ugly pink car. We soon find Jojo's mother working in a life of Australia, which means that Jojo would have to move and leave her best friend behind (oh no, I think I'll cry). A great storm comes, with full pools and nasty waters. Somehow, for no apparent reason, the little chick falls into the pool, and it comes face to face with, yes, you guessed it, a MERMAID! This is where the "story" really takes. Basically, they want to get the mermaid fall in love with the "couple". This is a flick of films and acting so badly, making the 80 look like the pinnacle of Oscar-worthy performance. This movie has all the possible clich√©s ... The best friends, "The Couple" that everyone wants, the "hot" bad girl and her bitchy friends, awesome the old man ... or her name , it's there. I took one for many people not to watch this. Consider my hours and 40 minutes a sacrifice for you. Please do not see this movie. Do not do it, for I am in vain.
