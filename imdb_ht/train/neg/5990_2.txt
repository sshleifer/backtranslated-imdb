I have not yet seen all these things; it runs on cable now, and I seem to keep coming in on the middle of it. My main reason for being interested in it is that I'm a Paxton Bill fan; She is a very good actor, and she turned to work still good over the course of her career. <br /> <br /> The other thing is that, while never really a fan of the old series, I kinda liked Thunderbirds for ships and work effects. Derek Meddings was probably the best of the business during the sixties and sixties, and its design for the rescue international craft are wonderful. The current team does a great job of translating his work into the big screen. But there is only one lame story. Children are asked to drive it, and while doing a job okay, it's hard to stop your disbelief, especially when you have eight children flying T2, an enormous multi-ton of transportation with all aerodynamics in a Buick . Everywhere you look, you see a Ford logo. Product placement is way on the top here, and it's annoying. Ben Kingsley does a good job like the Hood, but can only do a lot with a single dimensional role. If you can accept the movie on its thin slate, Thunderbirds is a fun, enjoyable ride. Just do not look too close to the car that drives it. <br /> <br /> ADDENDUM: I finally got to see all of this, and worse than I thought. The act is fairly impartial, and while the effects are fairly good, the story about multiple opinions has gotten cheesy. The placement of late products for Ford is annoying, and children as central to grille on my remaining nerves. Like the Avengers, if you ignore the source material, it's bearable. But not very. See the original show, and you will see what I mean. <br /> And a word of advice to Jon Frakes. Take a refresher course from the Guild Director. You can do better than this, old friends. <br /> Another note ... <br /> I see that again. Yeswa. About Telemundo. Armed in Spanish, with the effect of comedy comedy comedy. And yes, I came in roughly in the middle, with Ben, Ron and Sophia in the Battle Scenes on Tracy Island. <br /> I did not think it was possible for a movie already lame to become worse, but it was. It was anbarrassingly bad. <br /> If this was done right, there is no child-to-rescue, no joke-in-shaking joke, it might have worked. As it is, it's just another cheerful little child who has lost too.
