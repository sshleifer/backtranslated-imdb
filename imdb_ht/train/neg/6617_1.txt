Really shows that hype is not everything. Show by and by what an actor abhishek discourages is and is only getting movies because of his father and his wife. Amitabh as always solid. Ajay Devgan as always is cats and useless with the new guy is a joke. The leading lady is like a waste of an actor. These pathetic films come from such a revered director and from such a great industry. With movies as I have decreased the amount of bollywood movies I watched. <br /> <br /> RGV has made pretty crappy movies for a while now. Time to get different actors. Hrithek anyone? Bollywood needs Madhuri and Kajol back. Each other lady is a half-nude wish. Pffffft.
