Redundant, eternal vaccinations, useless vaccines, useless scenes are what you will find in this movie. In other words, it seemed technically poor for me. The music bits are amateurically directed (no synchronization would would have been dancing, seriously post-syncing, bad and obvious improvisation of actors from time to time, etc.). The movie is long and boring. Eventually, it makes some points and even less meaningful. <br /> <br /> There are some good ideas though. Some of the funny elements are actually effective, especially the opening scenes. However, the movie gets worse and worse so it is completely unbearable and impossible to understand in the end. <br /> <br /> The trailer I saw was very dynamic, that's not true for the movie. This means that the difference between the trailer and the current movie is something very close to a rip.
