I watched the first 15 minutes, thinking it was a real documentary (with a producer dramatically "on camera"). When I realized it was all the scenes I thought "why would I want to waste my time watching this junk ??" so I turned it up and came online to warn others. Characters do not act in a credible manner. excessive emotions humor. For a guy traveling half way around the world in a war torn country, he acted as a kid. and I do not think it was because "her character was so upset about the bomb mall". <br /> <br /> Very trite and stupid. <br /> <br /> Do you see the "lost town"? French fantasy fantasy about a guy who kidnaps kids and steals their dreams ... I love it!
