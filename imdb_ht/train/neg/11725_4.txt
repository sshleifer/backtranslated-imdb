STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning <br /> <br /> James Dial (Wesley Snipes) is hiding out on her hips in Montana after taking a notorious terrorist. Then he was approached by the agency again to travel to London to another one. His target was arrested there and is under heavy police protection - but they do not want to simply pick the people - they want him to take out. All goes well but then the mission gets botched and when a senior police chief, Windsor (Charles Dans) dies, the blame falls into the Dial of the Dial. Chase like an animal and took refuge in a nearby home and befriends a young girl named Emily (Eliza Bennett) who is dealing with problems in her own and gets sidekick her annuity as she goes on cleaning up him, and working out who betrays him. <br /> This latest snipe straight into escapade DVD has come from nowhere, with a minimum of even advertising for something so little time (I do not remember seeing any ads or trailers for it anywhere.) With that in yourself and after Snipes's story in Duff DVD effort, this might seem like one that Snoop Dawg would say you drop like it's hot. But I felt compelled to give it a go anyway. It does not rank among its worst, but it does not happen any higher than the standards of some of its best (Detonators, 7 seconds, say it all, really), either. This is, at best, suspense glazes, with a minimal of action, naff all along the path of fresh dialogue and Snipes not exactly at its best in the lead role. Likewise, in a main supporting role, it clearly Dance has only been shown up for the same paycheck as this is generally one that none of the cast goes to call for the hills on any of the CVs. <br /> It tells a lot that in the end just the 'deal' what keeps you interested is when the Snipes will end up with Sony and with it an end to any sub sub by EL DVD movie action. **
