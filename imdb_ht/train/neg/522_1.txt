Approximately 15 minutes, my wife already wanted to leave. Not so much because of the material, but the lack thereof. They decided to fill in the blankets where the funny thing would be they were with as many languages ​​and absolutely vulgar talk as they could. Then leave (very rare), we would sit back and watch (do not laugh, yourself) and wait for the next grit-out or offensive reminder (s). After about 35 minutes, we both got up and left. All we would have told how great this was. The trailer looked good and Roger Ebert actually called it "intelligent" and said it was not a rude sex comedy. Did he go to the right movie? Together with Let's cool, only the other movie I've ever walked out on ... and I have no regret. I'm sick of trying to see comedies in America.
