Wow, I love and respect very much anything that David Lynch has done. However, this film is analogous to an attempt to perform a pseudo art video. <br /> <br /> To give you a couple of examples: <br /> <br /> 1. David Lynch is typically a visual reminder, however, this has little visual artistic content (empty walls, "up shots "and ceiling in the background) <br /> <br /> 2. David Lynch typically takes pride in audio, however, in this you might even hear the hum video camera. <br /> <br /> In fact, it's very difficult to swallow the idea that she had nothing to do with this movie. unless ... <br /> <br /> ... this is a joke, on David's part, forcing fans to search his website (for hours) only to get this drivel. I hope that, because at least this idea is funny.
