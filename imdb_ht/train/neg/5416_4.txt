This was Stroheim's third effort director - it is quite rude and shows no of the outstanding flair for the camera and his correction mastery would show a few years later with his master, GREED and the wedding marriage. Essentially we have a trio of grifters, masquerading as a Russian count and two Russian princesses who rented a villa in Monte Carlo. The goals are to use counterfeit money in the gambling toys and win a fortune. Part of this plan is for the county (von Stroheim) to insist himself between an ambassador visiting American and his "crazy" wife, wooing him, and hoping to get some money by playing on his weakness. He also makes the mistake of saving the lives of the maid, whom he promised to marry. When he saw them together, he set fire to the room, (von Stroheim and his animals are on the balcony room). Here's Stroheim first establish his character as "the man you love to hate." It is quite bad and its character's flaws eventually carry it to a very bad and desperate end. The movie is a bit of its movies and edits and is not worth seeing unless you are captivated by the director. There is a bit nice - when she first tried to meet the Ambassador's wife, she read a book - we see the title - FOOLISH WIVES by Erich von Stroheim. This was originally viewed as a movie 210 minutes, cut to 140 minutes by the studio and finally released in 70 minutes. Restoration on Video Cinema to restore footpaths (damaged in some ways in most scenes) from the earlier version of version to us a minute 107 minutes.
