A trooper is on the road making sure every1 obeys the speed limit (performing tasks); it then pulls on a woman who appears it is a mother (there is a child in the seat back); he then told him wrong with BAM ... to get killed. Well, this is the beginning of what I thought personally would be a good movie. When I watched this movie in the theater I was with some friends. This was our first night after the summer so we wanted to go and see a good movie. We all decided to see a suspension / thriller that looked good at everyone in the group ... this was one of the biggest mistakes in my life. Not only was I wasted $ 7.oo on a movie ticket but I was sitting in torture for the brain. This movie started with mystery and suspense and I seriously thought "this can not be bad" ... I was so bad. The whole problem with this movie is that it makes no sense; even if you can get past the bad act, "not so scary" the storyline, and over all this horrible movie mess, you will still be able to believe. It's not because you're smart enough to understand it, because no one with a brain could understand what the stupid movie is about. Now you can think "Oh man! I have to watch this movie just to see if it's as bad as this person says it is." I HAVE TO HAVE MY MONEY! I'm trying to save you the problem watching this movie by telling you that it's so bad that there is no point at even considering seeing it. Please do not make the same mistake I thought that this film has potential ... it does not. I give this movie 1 out of 10 (if I could give a zero I would), and I do not recommend anyone ever seen this movie, you will save yourself many sleepless nights trying to think w.t. that the film is over.
