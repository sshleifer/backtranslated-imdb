I rented this movie on Netflix after having won all the Oscars, to see if it was really good. <br /> <br /> The Hurt Locker is a very realistic painting (for the most part) of a group of soldiers rotating in Iraq. The film film around Will James, a reckless soldier that reinforces its adrenaline in taking risks, and deficits bombs. <br /> <br /> Where this movie seems lacking in my opinion is the plot and direction of the movie. This film has no clear drawings unlike other films like Black Hawk Down. What this movie tries to do is focus more on the characters, and their different mood about the war. Bigelow does a harsh job of focusing on the characters, but there are many points in the movie where the dialogue seems to drag. Hurt Locker is 131 minutes long, but it feels like a movie 3 hours. One scene from the film was particularly terrible, and ruined the perfect credibility films, the surface sniping half of the movie. It was both unrealistic, and lots of time. <br /> In general, I thought this movie was OK, but the reason I gave it a 6 instead of a 7, was because it was a great disappointment to win Best Pictures at the Oscars. I felt like this movie could be so much better to consider Saving Private Ryan lost better photos, but it was better than this movie. Another remarkable mention is Black Hawk Down which has only won 2 Oscars. I honestly do not know how this was the best photo. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a action packed war cops, rent Black Hawk Down. This film will be forgotten in a year or two.
