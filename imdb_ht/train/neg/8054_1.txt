Oh, I, what a movie is amazed. <br /> <br /> The production was so cheap and nasty ... Remember the shot from the "Natural", where the lightning struck the tree (leaving a glowing umbrella) that Roy Hobbs made a stick out in ?? Well the producers of this film used the same scene of prefix a scene where a branch of the tree was crying in the house. <br /> I wonder if they pay to use the footage from the Natural, or were they just hoping that no one would watch the movie would pick it up? Then at the end of which they were getting trying to get away from the truck. These over-acting in the cabin. <br /> A really bad movie, a really bad movie.
