Yeah cheap shot I know, but this movie is a great example of how a collection of signatories of 'deepness' (political turmoil, love / lust) can be combined with great great criticism (see also' 'American beauty'). The film films on plods along with free sex scenes are interactive with frequent painful sequences (in one scene I count three accents 'European' accents affected by the actors) and the state show might run amok, yet neglected to tie them together in meditation in coherent kundera offers. and in its over-three hours it manages almost completely frozen frans, missing fourth piece of triangles the love that lies in the heart of the plot, and in this way kill the Roman novel mechanism in displaying the spectrum of emotions and in the power relationship found in love affairs. It also failed to even include the time token screen for Tomas' son, used in the novel to illustrate examples of Kundera's political point of view in the novel. Combined with the soundtrack, these flaws make this three-hour movie unbearably weighty to tone again to light content.
