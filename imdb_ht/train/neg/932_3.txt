I watched this movie, and I was hoping something would be best ever. What is so great about a guy with no emotion? * Huge * <br /> <br /> You never see Alex show emotions for anyone else than his son. Yes, I know that's why her son is the sole cause of her temper (if you can call it), I get it. <br /> <br /> The characters are undeveloped, the relationships are not given enough time to be understood. In one scene Sara says she will not fall in love, and the next time we see her she talked about how her death really shook her because they were so close? Logic synapses abound in this movie. <br /> It's like someone who watched Boogie Nights and wrote this part to imitate Little Bill. Even the scene where he "loses temper" he is the same as when Little Bill throws his wife down to the facial expressions (or lack thereof). Yes, William H. Macy is good at showing a man without emotion - was there, doing that - can you tell Magnolia? <br /> This movie did not miss lack of emotions, it lacked substance, a good script, developed characters, and a draw. And it certainly misses my recommendation. :) <br /> <br /> ~ A ~
