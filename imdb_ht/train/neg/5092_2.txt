Chokan! <br /> In 1965 I saw Jaguar Gagarin alive. It was sincere, unpretentious and sweet, he was at ease and looked like well-educated and intellectual. In this movie I saw a clown! The actor looks dummy and gestures that affect and mimicry. Have a cartoon! The real Gagarin was another person! Do not believe in this movie! <br /> I saw this movie after the films such as "Taming of Fire" and "Apollo 13" and after the book "Rockets and People" by Chertok and "Korolev: Myths and Facts" by Golovanov. I was shocked by lightning, poor acting and productive scenarios, and a lot of inaccuracies in "Space Race". The film is the tiring render of well-known Russian historical facts. A lot of interesting things known in the space projects have not been demonstrated. Some facts and details have been distorted. For example, in 1945 Korolev was not yet a prisoner (liberated in 1944), and in 1940 he was already not in my college mine mint, but in special design office prison. Korolev was the designer of prison design office and was not buried prisoners dead. But in Korolev's film worked as gravel digger after 1940 (because jailer had uniform shoulder straps). IMHO, the film authors have no profound knowledge about this part of the story and can not make interesting movies.
