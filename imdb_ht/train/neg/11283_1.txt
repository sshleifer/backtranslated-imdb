I felt Rancid Aluminum was a complete waste of two hours, the plot line was thin and confusing, the prestigious line up of players had some terrible dialogue and highly questionable accent. The camera work was somewhat experimental in place and although it could be seen what the director was trying to convey, it just made it even more difficult to watch. One of the most annoying aspects of Rancid Aluminum is on the use of narration in all of the film almost like the whole plot being dictated by the audience. The best performances were nothing to do and act. In fact probably the most compelling performance was from Dani Behr to everyone, although Byenselman played the stereotype office secretary. DO NOT under any circumstances go and see this movie unless you need a reason to catch up on some sleep loss, there are certainly better ways to spend cash earned.
