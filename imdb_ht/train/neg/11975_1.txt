How was this piece of crap staying on this television long ago? It is terrible. It made me want to shoot someone. So fake that it is actually worse than a movie cinema-1940. I would rather have a stroke than watching this nonsense. I remember watching him when he first came out. I thought, hey would be interesting, then I found out how absolutely, insanely, ridiculous stupid it really was. It was so bad that I actually took my pocket knife and stuck my hand on the table. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />!
