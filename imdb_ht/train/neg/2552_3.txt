This is as a documentary, it's not, it was filmed as a documentary but I suspect was just because then they got away with an unstable camera and dodgy filming. This has just been published in the UK on DVD as an "American comedy style" it's not that either. <br /> <br /> Basically it follows around a group of teens on spring breaks as they go to Mexico for cheap booze and with the quest to find having their girlfriend finally put. Throw is a pair of noses, also on the same sort of quest and you have a non-hilarious story of young drink trying to find some girls. <br /> <br /> Considering this 18 Rating has very little, practically sex sex scenes, especially I guess the rating is to swear in the crowd. <br /> <br /> If you love Jackass behavior without the humor, then this may be your thing, if you have any brain cells left I would probably avoid that!
