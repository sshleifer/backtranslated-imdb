This is blatantly a futuristic adaptation of Jules Verne's "Mysterious Island". Correct the sound is very bad. You hear the dialogue on the set and you hear the voices being recorded on a recording booth at the same time! This is an amateur film and actor from Boston and shot around New Hampshire. For people living in New Engalnd and who are reading this comment, they will be wowed with a capital W. This movie is full of flaws. You get heard the director's voice give direction and give out the direction of the actress. "OK now stand." As for the other characters. Have this guy talk to his mind instead of his voice and this alien blue. The guy speaks to foreign guys and a deep voice. When it is given or grunting when it fights you hear the actor's voice. As for special effects, people! This was the early Brett Piper's job for shouting! The animals are good but the animation is hatch. Really terky. Sort in as Karl Zeman animation on tour for the start of time (1955). Special effects are imaginative. Thge music is good. Bottom line, this movie makes EQUINOX or PLANIN DINOSAURS look like a Ray Harryhausen season. Did you know that MYSTERIOUS PLANET was a movie house and was on a budget string budget? A must look for aspiring movie makers.
