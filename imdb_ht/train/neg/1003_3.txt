OK, I'm not Japanese. I know a little about Japanese culture, and a little less about Japanese pop culture. Other than that, I'm Spanish, I eat paella and I love black humor. <br /> <br /> Well, with that point put, I can comment on the movie: I have no idea about how it is enjoyable Japanese audience, Mamoru Oshii is quite a good director - despite such things They are padded in the style of talking headlong, and even that was curious and somehow interesting - and I wonder he came up with this. It may just be one of these can be lost-in-translation, I'm afraid it is, but as a European viewer watching the movie and subtext overloading the translation I just thought it was awful. The jokes seemed bad, the escaped script-I meant, giving the audience a break, and closing a little or damn narrator - to the point of almost making myself explode on an overkill of fast-rhythmic talk and absurd action . But <br /> <br /> However, I thought the animation was really cool. The idea is great, and is well exploited in the scenes. However, the eye-candy ends as soon as the characters are leaving aside to begin with a perennial not funny in any mumbo-jumbo speech on still pictures. It just makes you want to fast forward to the next off-out character of the hysterical scenes. <br /> I read Mamoru Oshii is actually planning an end to that. The idea was good but horribly exploited. Perhaps the second part will bring the good parts of this first and actually make an exciting movie, or maybe it will be more and more over-telling scenes. But Hell, if you thought Talk Head was dense, Amazing Lifes in Fast Food Feeders will give you a stroke. <br /> <br /> Of course, all this comment is based on the experiences of a person who is European. Probably this is totally useless to Japanese people, maybe it was a really funny movie lost in border cultural and translation. Maybe.
