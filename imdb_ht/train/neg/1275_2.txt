This is a horrible movie. All three stories are bracketed with a hypnotic psychiatrist line that is needed and all stories are bad. The first one is about wild wolves and some ladies, some things do not make sense, but the thing hypnotism makes up for that. The second, and bad Bill Paxton as a maniac roommate should not be seen by anyone. The last, sadly the best is almost incomprehensible that I guess to do it better than the other garbage.
