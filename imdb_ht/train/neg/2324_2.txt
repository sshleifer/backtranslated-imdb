I agree with other users commenting that the two main roles were well-acting, being the guy who played Gary Gillmore and Giovanni's role. Too bad the story was so boring. Do not hear about the story I do not know anything at Gary Gillmore before the movie so I did not know what to expect. I thought it would be something like Dead Man Walk or the Chamber but how wrong I was. The movie all just spoke, talking and talking about mom and dad. The only cool scenes were floating where the father would lose his temper. That was the only interest I got in this boroughfest.
