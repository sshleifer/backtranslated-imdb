This film was not scheduled in Italian cinemas, I saw it in a manifestation called "fantafestival" .I found it awful because some scenes seem like chaotic and black music videos, the use of fluorescent colors is ridiculous and there 's no suspension in the movie. Music is completely out of the story and I do not have the word to describe the visual effects. If you look at the first stage the film seems to be interesting, but a few minutes later it gets busy. The story is interesting, but the development needs a complete review.
