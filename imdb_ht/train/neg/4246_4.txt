Anne Bancroft plays Estelle, a Jewish death-maker calling her son to consecrate her (Ron Silver) to find one movie star movie star Greta Garbo and presenting the previous two Estelle checks for good. It might have been "Bancroft talks" as the actress attacks this uncertain comedy / dramatic / sentimental material for its duration. Hot-or-cold director Sidney Lumet can not find a rhythmic rhythm to be, and Bactroft 's constant overacting is scaled back to all by the cinema - it holds upright his right: cute, teary - eyed and ranting. Estelle has become a drag on this scenario (not the wrong-conceived scheme has much to go on besides). Silver and co-star Carrie Fisher and Catherine Hicks finished with very little to do, but supported the star, and everyone trampled by hamming it. * 1/2 from ****
