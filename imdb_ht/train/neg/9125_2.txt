It's one of the funny things about being young that someone can fool easily by advertisers. I first talked about another film, in which the commercial for the movie (comedy) makes it seem funnier than it is. Seeing the announcement for this in 1981 has made me think this would be a wildly wild movie. What I and my brother went and saw with me did not know that the scene was used in the TV announcement was the very scene of the movie! <br /> <br /> Since this stage is the end result of all that came first in the movie, I can only guess that there was nothing other funny to use! The last scene is, thanks to a young portion, Dr. Fu Manchu turns out to be a long golden man, in a bright Asian / Elvis Asian as a rock star! (With back up musicians no less!) <br /> Set for no real reason, in the 1930s, Peter Sellers does his best with the material but does not give any good reason for "moments of comedy" . The rest of the actors were just plain dull with my brothers and I sat all across this barely laughing at anything. It was only natural that we expected a comedy "Pink Panther", Peter Sellers was so great at that. <br /> <br /> It's a pitiful shame that was her latest movie before she died. Her appearance on the Muppet Show was more fun than this ill-design flop. Still, I'm not her fault. I am the blame of all others involved in trying not to make a better movie of this. 2 stars is being generated !!
