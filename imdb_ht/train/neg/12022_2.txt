The story idea is excellent. Unfortunately, the execution allows it to go down. The movie missed speed, for one thing. It should be an exciting ride, but it is slow and over a bit boring. <br /> I think the problem is mostly in the scenario and correction. There are not enough obstacles and hits to hack up suspicions, and there are scenes that do not really move the story together very effectively. The producers should have seen this in the scenario and insist on a major rewrite. Unfortunately, when the producer is also the writer and director, this obvious will not happen. Many of the acts seem like flat, and that's down to the director - all the actors have been quite competent in other projects. <br /> It's a shame, because with best writing, editing and direction, this could be a really good thriller.
