When thinking about captivity many words come to mind. Among them are: refreshing, nurturing, without pity, inexpensive, infernal, and indisputable. <br /> I used to hate these films from the middle of late nineties that were basically ripoffs in screams, but these new hit hits are starting to make these movies look classic. They still hang the same demographic that these other cinemas were so successful in doing, but now they add a new level of degeneration that makes the twelveteen year old girls are aiming to feel like they're hardcore and hip . br /> <br /> This movie is a burden of crap crap! What happened to Larry Cohen? His name was not attached to anything good since 1993! Even so, I was always surprised to see that he had nothing to do with this bad thing! Was anyone astounding when interest the movie turned out to be one of the psychopaths? Does anyone know that when they see him? Only someone who never before has ever seen another movie!
