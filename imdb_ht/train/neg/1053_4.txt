Feel taking over Cinderella's story. Terribly poor script, but Kathleen Turner turns into a pretty decent wrong step-mother performance. Visually stunning in some parts, but that's about it. Gift periods range from the time of Elizabeth to the 1990s. Fast forward until you see something interesting and save yourself full 90 minutes from drivel. If you're really in the mood for a Cinderella story - I suggest "Ever After: A Cinderella Story" or "The Glass Slide".
