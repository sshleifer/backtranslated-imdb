The following are some of the most blaring issues with this movie: 1) There are many shadows. Very, awful "twists" are everywhere. <br /> 2) The narrative jumps around in time, which would be fine if done well, but not. <br /> <br /> 3) Character character that does not develop so much that stays static, or quite change for good reason. <br /> 4) Big one: PRINTING CART. On top of almost every person. The following are some of the best points in the movie: 1) The lead is damn good looking .. As I see, there are only two types of people in this film: a) People can sit In 90 minutes of drift simply because the lead is attractive. b) People who often think of themselves, "I like Hollywood twilight and clich√© and overacting twilight, but if only I could watch it in Korean ..." There's a lot of good movies Korean out there, so why waste your time with garbage?
