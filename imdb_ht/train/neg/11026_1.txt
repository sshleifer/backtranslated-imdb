I just finished reading a book about Dillinger. This movie was typically correct. It's like having a list of names and just did everything up. Its flights and getaways were well planned, down to the second - when the time went up, they left if they had all the money or not. They had notes in every way, where they turned, etc. Purvis never saw him in the restaurant, saying that Dillinger paid for his meal after Dillinger left. Purvis never even saw Dillinger before night Dillinger died, only photographing him. The gang members of the gang were dead. Dillinger never steals a bank alone, as he did in this movie. If I never read the book, maybe I could have enjoyed the movie. The act was a bit on the top of the place. The action was canceled as well. On second thought, I doubt if I would like it very much though I do not read the book.
