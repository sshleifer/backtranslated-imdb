I was not entirely sure what to expect from a comedy, drama, fantasy, sci-fi genre, but given the actors involved I thought I would give it a turn. The tone of the movie felt awkward, going to patch in each of the styles but never quite felt balanced, so eventually I gave up trying, and focused on the cinematography and individual performance, which I thought was good on the whole, considering every character was small in depth because of the nature of the story (will not give anything away here). I said he felt a lot longer than his 96-minute time, and not in a great way. At the end I was looking for closing, some satisfaction measure but it did not turn out to be the smart or ingenious piece I expected it would be. I think Tony mistakenly thought what he did at the end of the movie gave us that ... but it was a tragic mistake to try and validate before 95 minutes and the ill-conceived conclusion. Finally I feel cheated. IMO it would be best for it to stand without "finishing" as a piece of art ... just. Or ... I can miss the point completely :)
