I was in second grade, 12 years ago. I remember it clearly. We learned about space. All little kids want to go to space, right? Well, after I saw this, I was so scared to death that I would accidentally get thrown in space by some psychotic robot with a single thought track. I had no idea that this was a movie. I thought it was some news or something program. I guess it was my own version of when people were freaked out of the radio program 'War of the Worlds. So lately, I found this movie again to watch, to achieve my favorite actor, Joaquin Phoenix was in it (then known as Leaf Phoenix). I can tell you, I laughed at the dramatic parts and laughed even harder in the act. I mean, when Andy is in space, he moves in slow motion, have you ever noticed that? I do not think that in space you talk to slow down or think slow. <br /> <br /> The best part is when Andy is struck unconsciously by the oxygen tank, and begin to float backward as the lock secured doors. Little Max is trying to pull it off. At the same time, we get a bigger close to Max's face as he spoke (in slow motion) "Whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa?" I had no idea.
