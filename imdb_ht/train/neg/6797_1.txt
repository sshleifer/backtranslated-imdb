What can you say about a movie, filmed 16mm film, where the best and most attractive scene is a German Shepherd? Nothing could be positive. Avoid this travesty at all costs. In any case, it would be difficult to find, since bestiality remains a taboo and illegal subjects in the USA. I strongly suggest IMDb re-visit the pods formulas to establish ratings, since a rating of 8.8 for this piece of fecal matter is absurd! I, no means, a pride and spent many hours enjoying the classic porn movies in the 70 & 80; but this is inferior product even by the looser standards of (then illegal) loop the cribs.
