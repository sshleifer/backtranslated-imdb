When I saw that IMDb users rated this movie movie under the 250s, I thought it was too hard, but my little one knew that the low rating was absolutely incorrect. <br /> I'm a big fan of the bravery brothers. I liked the movie scary 2 and even enjoyed White Bean. Little Man, however, had a lot of laughter and jokes had been stunned. Obviously, the joke would be gravity around Marlon Wayans, who played a growling midget that had just left out of jail. He and his partner, Tracy Morgan, steal a diamond meant for a criminal. Things go awry and the midget have to put the diamond and a weird couple played by Shawn Wayans and Kerry Washington. In order to get the diamond back, the midget pretends to be an abandoned baby to leave on the unsuspecting couple front. Of course, he is taken in with the drama starting on demand for the diamond. The film has some actors and actresses from Saturday Live Live like Molly Shannon and Rob Schneider as well from Color Living. All these talents, however, can not help the poor script and the jokes that simply did not comic. The special effects make Marlon Wayans look like a midget was OK. I mean, it was not 100% credible but it was ok ... nothing big. I just hope that the bravery brothers have put more effort into developing a script and good jokes rather than trying to shore up the poor script and cameos from the comedian actress and actresses. Wait for it on cable or TV. It really is not worth any amount of money.
