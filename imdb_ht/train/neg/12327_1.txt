A previous review said the movie is not all that bad. What?!?!?! The movie glorifies the child's incident. Oh, but Sylvia Kristel was naked in her, so let's give her 5 out of 10 stars. Why not be a full 10? Because the film was "agonizing," the kids in the shock were "unrealistic," and friends in fat were "irritating." Nowhere in the review, the review expresses any victory of an American film in 1981 featuring the scene of a child of gender and a growing woman. I arrived to catch this steamer steam in a movie while staying in a showtime hotel. For me, though the fat friend was acting up a storm and was worthy of an Oscar, I should always give the movie only 1 star. That TV Howard Hessman starred in the film at the same time as it appeared at WKRP is particularly ridiculous. But do not take my word for it!
