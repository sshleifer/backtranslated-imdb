If you are after the real story of early Baroque painter Artemisia Gentileschi, you will be disappointed - however if you are after a correct reasonable ripper with an art theme, you've found you are film. <br /> This movie is like a basically incorrect illustration of the life of Artemisia Gentileschi that it almost made me cry. (Types of happiness in Artemisia in Google and check out some of the factual facts vs. fiction.) From a purely technical point of view though, the film was well: the sets, costumes, and especially the chiaroscuro lighting helped create a immersive 17th century experience; although mentioned above mentioned FACTUAL INACCACIES left it a bit. <br /> I wonder how the director / co-writer Agn√®s Merlet defended his film at the time? Perhaps he refused to show Artemisia as a victim, who would have been unfortunate, because allowed him to face it.
