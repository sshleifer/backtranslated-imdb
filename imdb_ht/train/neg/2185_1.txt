... or a hearing. A quick rekapital ... <br /> <br /> So, you had this doctor who experienced and stolen body parts for some vague reasons. She wants perfect transplants, but she feels she needs to do that in her basement. WTF ??? Then suddenly, unfortunately, with a good, her fiancé gets himself off to a traffic accident that she is responsible for. Agonizing and grief, he presents himself in a lasagna pot (or he strudel?) And his full pump "adreno-ferment" (sugar) keeps it alive. Then he got up, talking himself off (so to speak) even though his neck was obviously off in the vocal cords, and he had no lungs so he could not even talk if he was em. Looks incredible b * The tech does not appreciate any of her fiancés. Just like a woman ..... Then her grief comes back to horniness as she sees the possibility of plugin himself the beloved on the body of the first bimbo sleigh he can pick up on the street. Meanwhile, the assistant physician, a sort of dime-store Igor, joins philosophical argument with the head, who has hit up a telekinetic friend and the "monster in the closet" (each mad scientist has one). Eventually the senarist realized he could not keep his misogyny injured and feared intimacy issues on the hearing impairment incident, so he killed everyone, then presumably going to the cash bank check before financial financial film in having a chance to stop payment on it. <br /> Did I mention that I think this is a bad movie? <br /> <br /> Someone should say Turner Classic Movies to stop showing that edited versions without the gory stuff. The vision of the wizard and his arm worn off, pirouetting around the house without leaving much without anywhere is just too precious.
