I'm a great brand for the music of Neil Young, with that with the glowing luminous film got in the press of Alt-Indie, hit the first show at Greendale I could get. My excitement was short live, as this turgid scenario with low-lyrical momentum left most filmgoers either sleeping or shameful. <br /> <br /> Neil said the movie started as a band, and the characters came to many lives that they just filmed the band. Not the best way to track a story. No character really has an arch, and when "significant" event occurs, the viewer does not care, because the level of movie levels is high at this point. The movie is full of songs, and at the end, the characters on the end of the lyrics are as they sing ... The technique works for the first couple it does, and it is grille on the nerves afterwards. It does not feel real or false, it just feels unwelcome. <br /> <br /> Terrible act, and character to find an attitude and play all of it. Poor lighting at times. The only kudos I can give the movie are in view of several injection scenes as newscast, but the technique is so used in today's movies that this movie has done little more. A band abroad, but nothing I'm quick to buy. A bad movie.
