Even worse than the worst David Lynch "konfusathon", "Dead brain" makes no sense too. Talent wasted waves (Bill Pullman, Bill Paxton), bouncing around like them in a cartoon "Tom and Jerry" on acid. There are negligible character development. It simply begins to climb the "weird scale", until climaxing into total chaos. Do not get sucked into this because of the highest actors fine. They are given nothing to work with, and you'll be wondering what's happening in the whole, incomplete 85 minutes. I highly recommend avoiding "Dead Brain" at all costs, unless you are in spreading your brain in total nonsense. - MERK
