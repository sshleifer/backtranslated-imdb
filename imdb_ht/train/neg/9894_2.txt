I miss the beginning of this film, which could be against why I neglected it very much. On the other hand I studied the fall of the Roman republic for years to know the story. Then again, that might also be the reason why I licked this movie. <br /> <br /> The movie has more historical historical than extras. Even if it's correct that I do not think that an attempt has been made to be correct, in this case it can be forgiven. The odd thing is that they sometimes go into great lengths to be historically accurate as it ends up finding confusion. Like sent to Antonius' wedding in Octavia, and then push it aside two scenes later. Why even bring it if it serves no reason for the plot and Octavia has never even seen? And such as called Antonius by his current name (Marcus Antonius) in some performances, and by his other English English Mark Antony Antony in other scenes. Though historical historic aside, the movie has always been an entertainment look if it was not for the leading lady. There is an ounce of dignity in it. It's hysterical, dramatic, and completely lacking control over itself. Instead of being a smart clever and composed queen turned into a hysterical teenager and a bad PMS case. 95% of those out of the poor act, but 5% is also out of writing poor script. Far from many dramatic scene scenes are written in the script. Sometimes you did not look to Antonius and Cleopatra, you looked at immature versions of Dawson and Joey from Creek Dawson. .
