I did not think it would be possible for Joe Don Baker to make a movie as stinkbomb 'Mitchell' but this one succeeds. <br /> I would not recommend this if you're a fan of Joe Don Baker's best work. But if you like to look like swimmers guy and really, really draw out gun fighting, you'll love this movie.
