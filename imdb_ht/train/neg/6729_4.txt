Obviously many people really like this, but I found it infantilising and reasonable offensive codswallop, saved from injustice by Jane Russell and a couple of memorable music numbers, especially the box (but there is a marked dip in invention later on). I do not get to Monroe - it's supposed to play a dumb blonde that is not dumb, but it just comes as dumb. Russell can not be quite convinced when he claims never been in a gym, but otherwise rather wonderful. The guys are staggeringly refreshing, as is the plot. There is no mean atrocity, but so patchy that, if this is a classic, God helps us all.
