I really look forward to seeing Nana after seeing Renoir amazing work first, the Fate Whirlpool. I read that Nana was generally regarded as her best films for my high hopes. Unfortunately this felt like a big step backwards. Catherine Hessling is the main problem with this movie. Acting it is on the head, even for a silent film. His act is more like that one would expect from a movie from early June, by the late 20s. It usually has the same figure, which reminds me (sorry to say) to someone with pain constipation. It was also very difficult to believe that anyone would fall to this female femdom. There was nothing good about it at all. The film was also quite long drawn, the camera work was refreshing (aside from a shot of a horse race) and the correction was dull. The story reminds me of Box Pandora's Pandora. It's interesting to compare the two because there are only 3 years between these films. Pandora's box simply scores on each level where Nana fails. <br /> <br /> This movie is only for complete Renoir or movie very silent.
