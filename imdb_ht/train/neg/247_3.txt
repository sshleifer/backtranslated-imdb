It was 9:30 PM last night at my friend's camera trailer and we were so hyped to watch South Park (a new episode). The thing is, in my country, South Park Airs at 10:30 PM and we decided to kill time by watching the show now launching, Father of pride. I'll start by saying that I was just looking at episodes. First I looked at him, I found it unfunny and bit for anything, so I thought '' Ghost sh * t, I have a football game early tomorrow, so I have to stop watching sleep desen '. But yesterday, I tried to give Father the pride a second chance. I find that it is a complete rip-off of the Simpsons, only replacing yellow people by character instead of lions. The second thing is I wonder why she received her TV-14 rating. I find the Simpsons a lot more vulgar, and only the real vulgarite of this show is a few homosexuals (jammed) jokes. The Simpsons is also a lot more violent (Halloween specialty) and bit. I also heard that the series creator also led Shrek 2, well I had news for him: Shrek 2 was the best way and I think he stayed too much in the family's terms. However, I must admit that Papa's pride made me smile (even burst out laughing once) three or four times. <br /> In all, I do not mind Papa's pride. I do not hate it, but I do not like either. I've seen better ways in the 'The Simpsons'. <br /> <br /> 3.5 / 10
