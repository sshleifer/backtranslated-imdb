No, I never saw any of the "Santa Slasher" series, the 'Silent Night, Deadly Night,' the original 'Black Christmas' or this one, 'Christmas evil.' I've heard everything about their reputation, or, MADS (Mother Disrupting Santas.) I thought I would rent this one as I heard her pop up as a reference to an 'Fat Adult In the Movies segment. /> <br /> Mothers should be against this, but not for Santa's "killer" ooooohhhh, but for reality this film was just plain crap. Boring, time ?? even in only 92 minutes, crap. <br /> <br /> Little boy saw Santa came down a fireplace in 1947, delivered presents, ate some goodies and miraculously, floated up the chimney. Boy goes to bed, but returns to living room in witnesses Mommy and Santa (sort of) get it over. Apparently this messed up that kid for the rest of his life, though the scene was about as steam like Ralphie's father had the "leg lamp" in 'a Christmas story. He was sooo disturbed, he went to the attic, and, well, cut his own hands. <br /> <br /> Fast forward to the future! Now it's 1980 and messed up boy working in a toy factory. We get a little bit of it being a little off-cult, and it's the feet of both the kids and their parents alike. Who's naughty, who's beautiful, blah blah. He takes a good two-thirds of the movie to get him to finally snap ?? as if it is unpredictable in one frame. NO MOVIE should take this time. <br /> I'll admit, this film had building tension, but only because I kept her waiting to do something, anything to anyone. When it finally does, well, punishes "who's naughty," it's as graphic as a card "Kidney Pail Kid". And I do not mention finishing the WTF. I think it was a metaphor, but in fact, it's just as strange as the rest of the movie. (Take the brother who is angry at his sibling, and his solution is u, kill.) Do not open this mess, even on Christmas Eve, or wrong. Again, I did not watch the other "Santa-Slashers" but this one sucks bad. He built up suspense due to the nature of the movie and never once released a decent present.
