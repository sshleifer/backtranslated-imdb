I had a really hard time doing it in this move. It was incredibly slow and at times surprised when the plot of the movie would actually come to life. <br /> <br /> This movie seemed to leak to slow down and I kept on asking when it was going to end. I'm usually a person who loves a good independent record every time in a while, but that did not satisfy what I was looking for. <br /> It seemed to have tried many out of this movie. At one point it seemed to turn politics into a big fan of movies. If you are looking for a slow moving movie and little no scheme then this is the right movie for you. As for me I felt we were wasting 2 hours when I could do something else.
