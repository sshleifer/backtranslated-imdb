His drama drama ill and unharmed. George Sanders was a superb character actor. But it is quite implausible here as the lead, a rogue eighteenth century known for its philosophy and great looks good. His costume is, in all, Akim Tamiroff. Some French! Then there is Signe Hasso, in a black wig, as the virgin daughter of a wealthy family. Carole Landis fare best. The movie opens with him in silhouette. She is a slumber, and a naughty girl in that. He disappears for a while, but turns up in an unobtrusive situation. But it's right. She was always an attractive actress. Here he is cast close to his usual style of role. It means to be a little naughty, kind of ooh-la-la. It should have a light touch but it's a lead affair to start finishing.
