If you want to make a movie like this, the threat must be real. Do not surround your patsy with lots of people on Bonzos. There is no credibility here. The plot is dull and unbelievable. The act is even worse. I thought I was watching Arthur Lake (Dagwood) who is one of the worst actors in history, when I saw the main character. Oh well, at some point he faced the music and get angry fighting. I do not care. Do you? There are all the long scenes placed in this office that say (the furniture made from cardboard or mouse). People talk to smoke and do nothing. Most of the action occurs within a five minute sequence. And it's over. Do not bother.
