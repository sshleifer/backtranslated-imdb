This "vice comedy" looks very compelling. Indeed, the TRY actors are very difficult to make a go to an essentially unfunny script. And, as a result, it does not really go anywhere. The idea of ​​a woman to get out was pregnant after receiving a quickie divorce just not all that funny. Then when Cooper sneaks off with the baby because he does not want to wear for adoption just looks terribly unfunny and he really pushes hard to turn this into a comedy. It's really a shame, too, as the actors were more than the script and I found myself just bored by the whole chaos. Considering that Cooper has made great good comedies, I recommend you see them instead.
