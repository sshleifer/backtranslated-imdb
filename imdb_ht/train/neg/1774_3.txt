Ok, I saw this first movie at 9:00 on Cinemax a few weeks ago and thought it would be awards, my boy was 180d so. This movie is great. I mean, the mother of the monsters shows her true form only at the end of the movie. I'll "That's it? Why it does not show it a bit earlier in the movie." The plot is being held by the mother and son on the blood of women. Would not it be better if they just went on, you know, a killing spree killed as a couple of young women each, then the sheriff or a cop has found out about and get into the old find a way to kill the monsters, save the young women, and have 1 or 2 more people die in the process? I think it would be a hell of a lot better this way. It is also absent because the son is the main character and was killed first. Why not get rid of Mom first? Plus, how has this force at the end of the movie when it starts killing people? She said she herself was too weak. What the heck was wrong with Stephen this time? I can never, ever act on any movie by any actor, after all, to try their best. If it was not for good act, I would have given this movie a 1/10. 3/10.
