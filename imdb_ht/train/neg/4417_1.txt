I am a Catholic teaching elementary elementary by people, taught by Jesuit priest in high school & college. I am always a Catholic practitioner, but should not be considered a "good Catholic" in the eyes of the church because I do not believe some things or act certain way just because the church tells me. in the movie ... its bad because of the people killed by this now who is supposed to be satire as the embodiment of a monastic figure girl. There is no comedy at that and the satir does not do well by the act on Diane Keaton. I never saw the game, but if it was very different from this movie then it might be good. <br /> At first I thought the gun would be a fake and first shot of a plan by leading female four-year-old students as an attempt to demonstrate emotional and intellectual expression of Sister Mary of Faith. But it turns out the real bullets and the story has tragedy ... The tragedy of loss of life (besides the ex-students ... the lives of babies are tackling, the mother's mother's life), the tragedy In dogmatic authority over love for people, the tragedy of organized religion replaces true faith in God. This is what is wrong with Islam today, with Judaism yesterday and Christianity.
