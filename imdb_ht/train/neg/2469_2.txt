I suppose if you like endless dialogues that do not send the story's effects and flashy camera effects such as the transition scene to the _Angel_ TV show, you will enjoy the movie. I '? All I wanted was a nice, tight little story, and it was not there. The rhythm was practically backward, the plot points were buried under a sea of ​​unneeded dialogue, and there was absolutely no sense of fear, or tension, or anything. <br /> <br /> Is it redneck? Is it Wendigo? No, it's a cameraman on speed. That's not scary. It does not generate a single note of tension or atmosphere unless you are scared by MTV. Like those who revised me, I even point out that at the end of the film invoked demonic dreams to the audience. <br /> <br /> Terrible movie.
