This movie is not funny. It's not fun. It does not have one single second of originality or intelligence, nor does it take you to take the slightest interest in the characters or situations. Added that it's about to be a young film like anything in recent memory. It's like a group of 14 or 15 year old high school kids who have never actually met or had any kind of relationship with a real girl sitting and writing a movie based on their correct imagination on what was a grown man would be like that. This movie is boring, obnoxiously mind-numbing, and at offensive times and disgusting. In most cases, it has one or two moments that makes you laugh. Also, it looks twice as long as 85 minutes run its time.
