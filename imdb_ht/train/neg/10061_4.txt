The 'Curse of Frankenstein' Mary Shelley's faithful faithfully for a word of the title, which would not be so bad if the changes were any good at all. The tragedy of the beast destroying the Frankenstein family was completely excised and replaced with ... nothing. The heart and moral center of the story are gone. It does not help Frankenstein this is a cancerous bandit; she deserves everything she gets. The plot is basically a list of Frankenstein funds. Even taking on its own terms, this is trash: a bland, rambling movie featuring a shit-looking creature and a pair of bowl pudding. As the first of Hammer's horror film, directed by Terence Fisher and starring Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee, his place in horror stories is safe. But it's crap.
