Fred Olen Ray is a disgusting director, even as far as B movie director goes, but 'haunting fear' is probably one of his best films. Yes, he's overwhelmed by Poe's story of 'Burial of Burial' and yes, it's seriously rhythmic and uneven at all, but it's also very fun. Queen Brinke Brinke Stevens is better than usual than a lovely, vulnerable housewife (Jay Richardson) is drawn to doing away with her because she needed money to pay a gangster (played by Robert Quarry). Delia Sheppard, a veteran of many 90s soft-core movies, actually gives the best performance of the movie as a slutty mistress. You will also enjoy the small role played by Karen Black as a psychic, Robert Clarke as a doctor and Michael Berryman in a beautiful comedy at one of the best performances. The finish did not make much sense!
