On a distant planet a psychopath is saved from execution by a space mwk. He releases a few fellow prisoners and breaks out of the prison in a spaceship. They dock on a loukrously enormous spacecraft that is orbit a supernova star. This massive craft is populated by only three people, presumably because the budget of the film did not extend many hiring actors. Anyway, to cut a short short story, the three goodies end up in a game of cat and mouse and the villains. <br /> <br /> The psycopath of this movie is curious in that it is annoying. 'Teasing' is generally not a single theme would use to describe a digging - unhinged, scary, dangerous perhaps but not 'annoying' but it is. The three people who have launched the giant ship are seriously convincing as guaranteeing these important roles - this boat is practically the size of a city! Considering that the film puts about 50 years in the future, it is somewhat optimistic that such a great man-made craft could exist, never mind the fact that it is used for such a relatively mundane job. Despite the vast size of the spaceship, the crew of all with appallingly kitted out, small rooms and the dining room consists of what looks like a plastic table and chairs. But there is a lot of corridors. The movie is fairly well-known and works as a medieval Sci-Fi Thriller. But there is nothing big.
