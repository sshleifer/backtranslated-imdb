This is simply a review of the pilot episode as it appears on DVD. <br /> <br /> TV has moved out of my life in 1981, so I never followed the series or any part of it - which means I am immune to the nostalgic charm that Moonlighting seems to have for most reviews. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />! want and need. The site that "excused" the script based on the previously felt stale around 1950. It also has some frankly bad writings, as in the scene where Maddie demolishes the furniture instead of shooting the villain, banned in order to prove himself The Wounded Woman Who Need Masters Assistance. I often feel that Susan Faludi overreacts in chauvinist male scheme of simple entertainment, but in this particular case I am all - Moonlighting has BACKLASH to jump on all of her. In a sense, however, this DVD is a must for all fans of Bruce Willis: in addition to the pilot's episode, he has the screen test that landed the Willis work. Both features show the amazing degree of Willis' ability to act between 1985 and 1988/89 (Die Hard 1, In Country). Impressive! <br /> Rating (and I'm _am_ a Bruce Willis fan): 2 out of 10
