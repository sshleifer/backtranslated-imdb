This film was the most horrible film movie I've ever had, and what's worse is the fact that I've observed it, and they did not have the opportunity to stop it because it was for the school! Admittedly, the storyline was decent ... but I found the acting awful! The exception was Marianne Jean-Baptiste, I thought her performance was nice. He emphasized the only, without it, I doubt I might bring her to watch the movie. Every time I hear someone say "daarling" i cringe! I almost attacked a customer the other day because they said "he". It reminded me one of the worst and one half hours of my life! <br /> (I'm sorry if this was offended by anybody, I only expressed my opinion)
