... but it will make you wonder if we had any in the first place! This movie is just as bad as any of today's terrible horrors. A man goes to semi-clad damaged aging, trying to decide which one to kill so he can give his girlfriend a new body. A scene involves a man abducted around and spouting all over the series for a full three minutes, all of which must be well on ten gallons of "blood." The film also attempts to create a sense that what the man doing in his girlfriend is wrong and against nature, but the movie is so seriously making it impossible for the audience to dredge up any feelings of trauma or outrage. Without black films and impressive disasters, this film can not even get its own right - credit start saying "the brain would not die," but the credit ends its list as "the head that would not die."
