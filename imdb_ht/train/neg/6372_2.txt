Do not bother. A little prosciut could go a long way, but all we found is pure bed, particularly from Dunaway. The plot is one of these outstanding car episodes ... bounce off the car in another and every direction of change again, until we merely scratch ourselves if there was a plot. Gina Phillips is actually good, but it's hard to play across from a mystified Dunaway play Lady Macbeth lost in the Marx's Duck Soup. Ah, the Raven ... now there's an actor. And there is the family that just lies with bed and looks ghostly. Or Dr. Dread is full of gloom and no working remedies. I'm one of those suckers who just have to see a movie at the end. Quoth roar, "Nevermore."
