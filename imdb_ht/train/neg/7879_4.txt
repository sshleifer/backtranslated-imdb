First, I must say that I loved Animal Farm book. I read it with my 9th grade class, and it was great. We also decided that watching the movie would be beneficial. The movie was so disappointing to me. The film cuts out some characters, and misses a lot of the main points in the book. He jumps around, and does not explain anything in detail. If someone watched this movie without having to first read the book, they should be confused. The most irritating thing in this film, I ended up. The end of the book was the most powerful, and in the movie they changed it! It was supposed to be the pigs and men in an alliance with the sort of "melting" together, but instead, the film made it seem like the animals went to rebellion against the pigs. In fact, I do not think that this movie captures the real meaning Orwell described in his book.
