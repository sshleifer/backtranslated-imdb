This movie begins to introduce an original idea somehow, but it has become a big frustration later on. What faces have an original start if the rest of the movie did little to avoid a sharp draw? The movie itself is very incredible. I would like to know how exactly someone went into a clinic, becoming a nurse outfit, killing a doctor, taking a patient on his bed, putting in his Chevrolet pickup and leaf? I guess no one could answer this question, so they just jumped the other scene to hide these little details. Their performance is just plain bad. The villain is just another "annoying crazy ants", no deep, totally linear character. After 20 minutes of film, most of the incredible scenes, seemed to have been just because of the 90 minute since being totally unneeded. A doctor sees a woman clearly under strong medication, refuses to examine her, gets chased out of the house and simply leaves quiet? The unfinished scene made me burst into laugher, only Mickey Mouse could make it more out of reality. I give it 2 out of 10 for the first to allow say 10 minutes of film.
