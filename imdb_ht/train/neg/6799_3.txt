Do not expect much from this movie. In many ways this movie resembles a movie that Doris Day starred in in 1956, titled Julie. In this film Doris, who was a flight attendant, stewardess, in those days, landed the craft when after her husband denied, played by Louis Jordan the captain. He did a better job, more convincing, than Kim Ojah, who took control of a 747 and manages his land without much help from the control tower. I know a little about 747 aircraft, I used to be a flight attendant myself. As I said, do not expect much from this movie, he did on a cheap budget. The producers were cheap to use an aircraft and name a plane on it. Ocean is a name that many cinemas have used. Only written on this aircraft is the company's name that made the aircraft.
