Poor Would roll over in his grave if he could have this horiible German-TV adaptation of his classic play. It is obvious that a lot of money was spent on it. A tricky step, a catwalk and some columns randomly placed as a set. The film was impressed with the arts in English, with the English voice actors occasionally mumbling lines. The whole production was an extremely dark and sad feel it. And just where was Fonterbras in this movie anyway? MST3K has given this production regret the treatment it just deserves. <br /> <br /> Should not you be? I wish this movie was never in the first place.
