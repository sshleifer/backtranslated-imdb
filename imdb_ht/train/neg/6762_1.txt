This is the kind of movie that everyone involved with them should be embarrassed. Move direct, over the above act and a plot that rambles over with no other points than to show violence. I thought when I first saw her that she might be a satire in the media and how she shows violence but it's not. I'm not sure what makes the movie worse. Oliver stone makes it worst ever. From scenes where Woody Harrelson's face does not make any grounds or performances Robert Downey Jr's brilliant as Wayne Gale is a reporter who looks totally bonkers, this film is simply a mess.
