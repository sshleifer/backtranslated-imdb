With a Kiss Derek movie, the audience finds just what to expect. A thin piece of paper drawn with a few shots of Ms. Derek in clothes no. 'Ghosts can not do it' is just that. The first fifteen minutes are ordinary TV dramas, as long as Scott [Anthony Quinn] is still alive. He is a very good actor and long experience in a lot of different roles, but it seems like even a famous actor needs to work just for money sometimes. Kiss Derek is the opposite, still playing a woman tapping pretty teenage or with no clothes. The film is a complete waste of time. If you want to see Quinn, rent Lawrence in Arabia or La Strada. If you want to see women naked or devious, rent any porn movie.
