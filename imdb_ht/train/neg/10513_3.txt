This movie was pretty much a waste of one hour and a half of my time. I generally love the movie movies of cheap movements, but this movie was a disappointment. The main defects were the lack of explanation of the animals. When they entered the house and found the man he could have in lease explained. He does not really say anything about them other than being killed by his parents, and unless I missed the thing did not say how he managed to escape either ... Not to mention the fact that he does not give any signs or reasons which only survives to stay and essentially feeds the animals after his own experience near death. It would seem that he would have the opportunity to leave after the "cross incident".
