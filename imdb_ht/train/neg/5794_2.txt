The Germans all stand out in the open and get down with a machine gun. The good guys never die, unless it's for dramatic reasons. The "scheme" has its many holes holes. (Where are the German soldiers going once to roll the gas tank towards the train? Erik Estrada? Please!) And the whole idea, hijacking a train? How Mental is That! The Germans know where you will go, it's not like you can leave the track and drive away! What a waste. I prefer to head myself over the head with a 10mm hammer ball 10 times then have to sit in that again. I mean, seriously, it's FELT like it did in the 60s, but it was produced in 88 !! 1988 !! A-Team is more credible than this sad excuse for a movie. Just watch it if you need a good laugh. This film is television Sevalas that Green Beret was John Wayne.
