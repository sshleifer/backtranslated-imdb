This is an informative film quite in the PBS Frontline vein. The problem is, Frontline has already made this piece and managed to bring L. Paul Bremer to tell him around in the story. More upsetting is the fact that the director of the film, Charles Ferguson - a former think tank wonk, was a warrior supporter until the occupation went south. What did he think would happen? <br /> <br /> The invasion of Poland has gone really well too until it has messed up in those nazis room. And that's what this movie feels like - an apology for occupation rather than a deconstruction of the act in war itself. <br /> <br /> Ferguson seems to suggest that the war could run better - as if any war could be better.
