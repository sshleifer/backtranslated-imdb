This movie sucks big time. He reminds me of the movie Resurrection (Christopher Lambert), which I also found very boring. And "Semana Santa" is in any way an even poorer movie. <br /> Only one fine of the cast does something for this movie is Alida Valli. Alida is one of the grand old ladies in European film history. I liked her maniacal look at "Suspiria" and "Inferno" (Dario Argento). I will not spend more time dealing with this movie. I'll say another good thing about this movie ... use it if you want to fall asleep very fast ...
