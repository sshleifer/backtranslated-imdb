Another great movie by Costa-Gavras. It is a great presentation of Latin America and American involvement in Latin American politics. The facts may or may not be accurate but it is a fact that the US has deeply involved in coups and support in Latin America's dictatorship. Despite this though the spirit of the film follows the typical left / communist propaganda in the Cold War era. Costa-Gavras is a sympathetic well-known communist and his movies are still partisan. For example, it presents American actions as brutal and brutal, while representing Tupamaros' extremist activity as a positive thing. <br /> <br /> As it turned out it was a blessing for Uruguay and the rest of Latin America that the US was involved. Europe is full of poor European Prostitution East. I have never heard of poor Uruguayan girls or Chilean prostitution themselves en masse as it happens in most European countries. The US fought a dirty war and God blessed us all the monster of Soviet communist beaten. It is unfortunate that the US did what he did in Latin America (and elsewhere) but sometimes you need to play room. This is not an idealist world as Costa-Gavras and Matamoros love to believe. Matamoros had come to power in Uruguay, we would have had another Ukraine in Latin America. All in all this film follows corrupt ideals and leftist evolution of past times and try to pass it as idealism and morally correct.
