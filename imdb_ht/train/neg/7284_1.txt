Wow. I read about this film and it sounded so awful that I saw it, and my gosh, I can smell it in St. Louis. Where do I start? National Lampoons tried to track up 5 years later on the success of Animal House, but they completely missed the brand. I will go chronological with these short flicks. <br /> <br /> Poor Riegert (Boon from Animal House). Apparently, he did not work back then, so the boys at National Lampoons probably called and he said "hey, we're doing a movie ** movie, wanta in it?" Peter was like "well, I do not do many days, why not?" It was a great side of Animal House, but he could not bring this short sorry flop for 5 minutes. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Played: Leave it, and need to find himself. It's too weird that they are actually in a happy marriage. So he chases him, has it gone, and Cooper is in charge of the kids. This, of course, led him to burn down the house, losing several of the kids, and sleeping with a variety of New York bimbos (including a young girl Diane Lane). Then the wife returned, wants the kids, and the movie ends with a flip coin that will decide the fate of the kids. The idea was actually a bit smart, but the director sounded. The characters all seem like they are falling asleep, they should be doped. Forget Boon, your legacy has ended with this flop. <br /> <br /> Short movie # 2 <br /> <br /> More spoilers <br /> <br /> Place Dominic Corsaire. Pretty girl, recently finished college, is not sure what to do with her life. So he gets a pig, starts to sleep around with some mega rich guys, taking their money when they die, and does not stop until it's the most powerful man in the world, Fred Willard (Ooops, I mean the president of United States). Again, it could be funny, and even though I was delighted that Corsaire (Ann Dusenberry in real life) was not afraid to do all, it was terrible. What a waste of time. <br /> <br /> Short movie # 3 <br /> <br /> I can not believe I made it this far. Here's Brent Falcone's rookie cop (Robby Benson) and veteran Stan Nagurski (Richard Widmark). Falcone is young, naive, thinking he can really help people, even though it gets shameless after being shot thousands of times. Nagurski, really, he just gave up taking care. He watched muggings, attacks, or names, and never intervened. It's the face of the world is cruel and it will probably get sued if it does anything. Even Christopher Lloyd (at the end of the running of the taxi) gets into action, getting the police calling on him, committing a crime, but having his lawyer has to protect him. God bless America !! <br /> Once again, could be funny, performance was intentionally camping, but goodness, no energy too. Henry Jaglom and Bob Giraldi should be ashamed to have their names on this slip. I think the writing was not bad, the ideas were there, but the execution was pulled off as well as the rescue attempt in the Iranian hostage crisis. If I was part of this movie, I would like my name to remove it, terrible. And again, therefore I look upon her. <br /> <br /> The only good thing about this garbage is that Dr. John has scored in film (repeatedly "Going to the movies" over and over again) and the movie is not much longer than a hour and a half. Show this one in the movie class with the title "what you should NEVER do in movie-making." This script should be left on the shelf because yes, it's bad.
