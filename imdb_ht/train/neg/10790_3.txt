First of all, I am not a big fan of contemporary Turkish cinema, which is because the usual pattern for creating a box office success is not hitting the bottom of the waist. This film has nothing in a skating masterpiece that deals with taboo, as the director and marketing advertising means. In my only opinion, the sole purpose of this film is to make money by touching a tender moral (in fact it is mostly considered taboo in the native country) Cheap populists might provide with a brief definition of what I mean. However, the act is near perfect. In fact, most of the cast had a theater background and tried hard to compensate for that Altioklar was missing; talan! All members of the cast were perfectly fit into their roles and are well qualified for the work, even those less experienced. (Like Janset) At least, Altioklar deserves a word of appreciation, just because he knows well how to choose the cast. Other than that, it is just a media monkey, who assumes himself a director and an artistic talent. Come, art is not something that only consists of dealing with naked / half naked women. And just because media has a lot of cuts, no director has become an important step in the history of Turkish cinema. Just close your ears and o something realistic, I'm waiting for your next job appeal. Hope, this time you manage to achieve an artistic approach. In short; For good acting, hot women (just kidding!) :) Account> Each and every thing, other than the throw
