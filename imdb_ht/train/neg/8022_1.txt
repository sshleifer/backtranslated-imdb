I see that someone already thinks of an analogy similar, which looked like the first thing that came to mind after I watched this movie. They said that the ingredients were there, but there was no plot. In addition to the sexual scenes that are prohibited on child pornography (which I feel could have been edited out or have presented more suggestions in nature rather than graphically, I would compare this movie to a recipe that was torn in half. It's kind of like Release a list of ingredients, which has no direction on how to put them together into a finished product. From the beginning, character development and history development are lacking ... unfortunately, many times in this monotone we have teased and Bits of conspiracy and we think "Ahh-OK ... finally we'll find out something more about WHY this scene is going on ... or ... THIS character is ... or maybe we'll finally get they know and appreciate this more character ... or understand and participate more with this inter-character relationship ... etc. "But there is no chance! On the contrary, many times I was tempted to just turn it around more than once, but stuck it out when the carrot was tangled, only to find that all this mini-plot of wk lkeswa mini-plot (and that misrepresent) was just a ruse. Why did I stay with it until the end is a mystery other than usually IFC has better selection and given it 2-1 / 2 stars (another mystery). It's not that the characters are not possible for some degrees, or that you can not identify with them or humans at all ... it's just that this could be so much better and just a little more effort. I noticed this shot at Santa Cruz and found myself wondering if it was someone's school film project. I wish I could give this a better review, but honestly it was a waste and disappointing in an hour and a half.
