Inept, boring, and inconsistent "thriller" supernatural in which Cassie student Cassie (Melissa Sagemiller) is the constant victim of hallucinations and nightmares after a car accident claims the life of his companion Sean (Casey Affleck). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I can not start telling you how this is ... nothing of any importance ever has ever been any sort of real value entertainment. I did not like this cast in this particular film - they are all very compelling (then again, their role is not good). Encouraging this as a horror movie is a joke. Where are they afraid? There is no sense or suspense - there are a few good songs but that's about it. How on earth did this project get the green light? Writer-director Steve Carpenter has no displayable or talented vision that I can sense. Worst of all, the conclusion really makes the film all pointless. <br /> <br /> The alleged "cut killer" that I watch is 86 minutes of pure tedium.
