As a long-time fan of the Star Trek series, I found this a disappointing episode, and I wonder if the liberal use of "flashback" featuring Will Riker's exploit, both positive (and hugely romantic) and negative ( lots of pain, and death of a crew) was a money-saving device, as many of the "show bottles" (episodes in which all scenes take place on the Enterprise). Diana Muldaur (who also appears at least twice on the original series) deserved a better appearance than this for his character, Dr. Kate Pulaski. Faithful TV (in the Star Trek world, are there any other types?) And they have changed. It was the last episode of the second episode; So the season ended "not with a bang," but with "a rimol."
