Question: How does a bourgeois director treat a topic like immigration? Answer: Do not turn it into a parable of exoneration. <br /> <br /> Yes, we're back in the early 90s, just after the disintegration of the eastern block and the subsequent flood of immigrants in the EU, and what are the best ways to deal with and the topic than to make a movie about a fairly middle-class survival existence, a formerly economized top-class politician, has already alienated wealthy wives, and so on. , immigrants are asking for asylum in a non-Greek city near the border. I guess that way Angelopoulos can show some social awareness, while dealing with upper-class troubled existence. I mean honestly, the scene where some top-ranking host-cursor officer destiny destiny he sent his daughter to study in London is enough to make you pig. <br /> Anyway, it can not be that bad, Angelopoulos is a master of the art of cinemas after all, right? Move. It's at this point when its manners begin to get too artificial, sort of like a filter image in Photoshop. Its usual tricks show: there are windows cloudy, cloudy skies, a strange wedding, a walk along the river-shore, and people with yellow water-clothes. Also Mastroianni breaks new ground for most sleepwalking performance ever. Avoid really. Go for her early movie.
