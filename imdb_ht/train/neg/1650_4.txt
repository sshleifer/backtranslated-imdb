Four best-known young chauvinist pigs (with pig emphasizes) meet weekly in a NYC diner for telling the genders of this entertaining and visionary comedy. Peet is the common denominator who dates three undergraduates in the group that leads to conflict with the inevitable "whipping". Although the film has potential and there are some funny moments to be had, the overall flick of the film does not work especially at the end of the girls being made no better than the guys who run contrary to the novel of the story. One of these flix band people with a dozen producers, "whipped" is likely to be enjoyed only by the kind of genes that think "The Man Show" is material to Emmy.
