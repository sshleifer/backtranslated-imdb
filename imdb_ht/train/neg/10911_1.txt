I hate this movie so much I remember it clear. It's not funny. Any movie that relies on unfunny sex jokes and racist humor does not deserve the money it costs to do it. In the first half hour, Rob Schneider blown a rationed milk carton. All I could think was "she deserves it, to make such a bad movie". Do not waste your time or money on this one.
