Dr. Tyrr's Thousands of Thousands are on a journalist who travels to a crazy asylum to write about a new technique used by patients. However, the journalist soon finds that things are not what they seem to be, and asylum is run by patients, and doctors in cages. First of all, some parts of the movie are just plain boring and just makes you want to fall asleep, and the interesting parties are interesting for every reason (A guy who thinks it's a chicken, for example). I must admit that the story is actually very good, but the movie itself bombs. Music in the movie is really odd and like something you'd hear in some crazy comedy, and yes, there's a scene involving chicken dances, which pretty much made me want to close the screen. Watch this movie at your own risk! <br /> Rated: R for Violence and Nudity.
