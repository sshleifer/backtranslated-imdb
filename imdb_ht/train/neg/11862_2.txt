This film probably has some potential for something; My confusion is how these themes are utterly prosaik unfunny kept in the theater, it's as if ideas were recycled just because of their generation. Often the deerebrate hedgehogs behind most films like dogs, they return to ingest their own vomiting. Well, they're 19 richest bucks right now because of me. This was not at all imaginable, there was no rachemini moment, anything remotely funny showed in the trailer (and nothing entertaining was in the trailer), performance was exaggerated (especially Molly, totally compelling). What was theoretically supposed to have some funny relief were friends in homoerotic and a trendy Disney movie; None of his analogies were struck home, his little moral speech was flat, I was literally waiting to go on to say something meaningful, just to find out he did. The so-called "hard 10" is the most insuperable plastic animal (apart from having a horse-like figure and a strange smile); I honestly find her friends Patty (referred to as the Hamburglar) to be better looking than her. But then again, the guys prefer to brunette;) Well, anyway, the whole quote is that the corporation is superficial and if love is true it transcends all social facets; The way to show this, with a dude scratching another scrotum with the minimal-times-mutilated-and-beat-the-death-horse routine ejaculation routine (with obvious allegations of American Pie and Happiness - the letter of the divine disgusting lousy involving dogs in the family). I feel as if the movie was like adjoining ridiculous jokes in a normal ball informing in seawater. Going to marketing shows can push out anything, shudder mass humor and call it gold, people are coming (work for me). Iron and tirade.
