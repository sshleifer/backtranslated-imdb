It's a bit hard to say that most of the great reviews for the movie on IMDb all come from those who have just reviewed one movie movie film at IMDb all and yes you guessed it, that film is "Parasomnia". I've often suspected suspiciously good reviews of IMDb for what seems to be a good but good movie marketing as marketing marketing, but it looks fairly transparent in this case. <br /> <br /> This does not mean Parasomnia is terrible, but it stops very briefly for the good or big movie being the potential to be. <br /> <br /> On the plus side, she has a great baddie of Patrick Kilpatrick who does a brilliant job threatening and wrong, I could easily see her have what she takes to play a really memorable baddie a par with Hannibal Lecter. Some nice visuals in the sequence of dreams, in fact if the movie has decided to explore that more terrain it might be something better. The current concept of devious use of hypnosis is also great. Although I understand the suspicion of the disbelief needed for immersion in any good story, it's the brand of a good story that it succeeds in letting you do this. If you find yourself being annoyed in what you get logic or just plain funny, then the story will lose you and that has been happening over me with this movie. Other reviews have been mentioned here and I do not want to get into the beke territory, but I'll tell the configuration of the end was particularly funny and irritating, not too much to mention the mental age of a character that is just supposed to have experienced a some years of life. <br /> <br /> All in all, having the microbes in a great idea here in hypnotism debate, but this movie sadly failed to achieve it in anything special.
