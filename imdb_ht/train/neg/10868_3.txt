With a story and similar movies written by a high school, the 'seduced art' fails to deliver his romantic, sophisticated experience trying to bill himself. The two main characters have the potential to be interesting - both male and female lead are "single singles (or in the case of female lead, engaging)", but 'art of seduction' does not even try. Often from a frank examination of the characters 'character, the art of seduction' eschews anything in substance for a base of thin, lean stereotypes. <br /> <br /> The 'art of seduction' is insulting - insulting to his characters, insulting men and women, and insulting his expectations'. It captures the terrible people we all know and play out their painful interaction while waiting for us to idolize them. Ji-Wan is an immature, spoiled, manipulative bitch. The viewer is expected to love and forgive his flaws because he is beautiful. Min-jun, well, it is exactly the same. Nobody is beautiful. The "Humor" of this film primarily revolves around Ji-Wan and the Min-Jun's unusual attempt to outdoing each other in the honorable art of lying and manipulation. There is no character development, and we never learn why Ji-Wan and Min-Jun are like this. We are simply hoping to take them as they are, and they do not ask questions - they are beautiful!, And that's all that matters. The copious references to the celebrity of the main actors of revisiting movies in the movie can be your tip off of 'Art of Seductive Jumping. If you are still in high school, you liked to grasp, or you are a victim of yellow fever, you can love this movie. <br /> Despite its tag "Romance", this is not a very good movie date.
