In the first movie seemed to be great, they had the character of wearing ... The plot seemed to be going in the right direction ... however, as the film progressed, it seemed the director focused on the kind wrong of these things. or just a lot has been edited from the movie. The characters' characters change for the worst of the movie. Also, there seemed to be a lot of implicit meaning - in other words - they had stuff in the movie that did not seem to fit the movie itself. AND THE TITLE ... there is no place in the movie to make the title fit the movie ... I suppose the title works for the forecasts .... Actors did well with what they had ..... if they had a better director and writer, maybe this would have worked out better. But he did not. So now there is a terrible new movie coming out this Friday .... my opinion! .... Do not waste your time or money.
