AVAILABLE AVAILABILITY ***** A movie really stupid on a group of young excursionists in Italy that finds a weapon of mythical warriors and a demonic soul. One of them puts it and gets possession of the spirit of a demon. He's killing time and several of his friends died under his blade to revive the devil body. <br /> A waste of time for the viewers, as the young fine ladies in the movie left their clothes, the gore is the best of humor, and the act is terrible, perfect apparently for such a bad script <br / > <br />
