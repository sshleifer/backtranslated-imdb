I hope that coaching those losers on accents have been fired. The only high points are some of the characters supported, 3 of 5 in my favorites were killed at the end of the season (and one of them was a cat, to put that in perspective). The whole scenario is centered around sex, and nothing else. Sex with vampires, gay sex and gay vampires, gay sex and straight vampires, sex for vampire blood vows, sex after drinking vampire blood, sex vampires, sex vampires, non vampire sex, sex because we are scared of vampires, sex because we are angry in vampires, sex because we just became a vampire, etc. <br /> There is nothing against sex, it would just be nice if it was a little more subtle and they were peppered in the storyline. Maybe there is a storyline and then shoehorn some sex in it. But they did not even bother to do that ... and Anna Paquin is a top-dot bitch head. Whether it sucks or sucks it, I can not know that. <br /> Another part of the scenario that I find extremely implausible is why 150-year-old vampire Bill seems to have its things together should be interested in someone like Sookie. He constantly flies through the handle of him for something he can not control. He leaves for two days and has already decided that he is "not coming back" and suddenly has feelings for dog-man? Give me a break. It was supposed to be a 25 year old woman, not a 14 year old girl. People near her will die all over, and she smiled to shine on her face because she just gave away her V-card to some dude because she could not read her mind? As the main character of the story, I'd expect the show to do a little more to make it understand and someone to invest your interest, not someone you keep secretly hoping to kill or put in a coma. I can not find anything about her character that I love and even the fact that she can read the spirit is impressive uninspiring and not the least interesting. <br /> I will not waste my time and watching Season 2 coming June.
