This was a disappointing movie. People seem to have no substance, the lead protagonist Martin Cahil has zero redemptive value, in fact all of it including Jon Voight epitomizes sleeze. I would not recommend this movie to anyone. Violence is pampered, even if artistic. The movie is black, at least the print I've seen fit this category. A deception.
