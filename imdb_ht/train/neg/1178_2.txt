Completely ridiculous "period" film is only a thin excuse for its extensive graphics illustrative of the heroine and the "beast," a monster that supposedly appears every century violating some women. That's pretty much what he does, and the movie's depiction of the beast is really really awful; It's basically a height guy in a fur suit with a mask and a large PVC tube for a hard-on that squirts abundant amounts of white liquid. For fans of fake animal porn, I guess maybe this is a real turn-on. I was amused, however, by the open shots of horses having sex in a public square.
