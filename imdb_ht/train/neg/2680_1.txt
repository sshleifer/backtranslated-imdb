Brokedown Palace is not the kind of movie I'd ever like to see. I also did not like the movie when some Aussie man smuggling drugs in Thailand and accused Claire Danes and Kate Beckinsale of drug smuggling. I would not go to this country no matter what I saw this film. In fact this movie feels. I prefer going to Germany to meet beautiful single women. Germany is my country of tolerance. I would rather stick to the U.S. instead. After I saw some of the film in the theater including false accusations of drug smuggling, I left the theater and had the money I repay because I could not tolerate this movie. If you are going to Thailand to meet someone there who can be a drug smuggling, forget that!
