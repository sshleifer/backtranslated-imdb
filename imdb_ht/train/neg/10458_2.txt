I went to this movie with expectations, out of the hype, that it would be insightful and uplifting. Certainly something more than a cheap promotion for the band "Wilco." Instead we get a lot of moping and rubbing on the "process," an unattractive and no doubt one-sided painstaking of a member member who was kicked out of prime donna lead singer / songwriter, an insult- wrenching by the felling member - for about 18 years - said: "The friendship has run its course," and this whiny, incomprehensible story about how one record label "hurt their feelings" by the people , only so that the band can instantly get 50 offers in other labels (oh, the tension ... not!) They tried best to make it look like it was a strain, but I suspect was all smoke and mirrors to generate a tragedy that did not exist. This does not even take into account the long stretches of which we get many of the newest songs that have been pushed to us in full without any storyline, insight or even a decent job of cinematography. These tempting tendencies in emotional sincerity or real-life perspectives made me sick to look. From the movie, this group sounds like a bunch of little little babies who are keen around finding a voice they do not have and think they have some kind of guardians for the art of music, which are most definitely not . And I thought that the music sucked, and I did not even understand the lyrics due to the mumbling style of the lead singer. <br /> I give it a 2/10.
