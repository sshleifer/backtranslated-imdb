The only scenes that make me laugh where the same ones and Christopher walken in it (the foreground movie) the rest of the movie was just boring. The first hour or so there is nothing really happened.jok which is supposed to be funny not and zeta jones douglas is really overacting.julia roberts doing a routine job of the former ugly duck (yeah right!) at the next girl door (where i saw this before?) that gets the guy.for short.i really does not did not care what would happen with the main characters.If Cakak really fell into the building in a suicide attempt the movie could have more interresting to watch.
