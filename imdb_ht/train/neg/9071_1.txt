Dave (Devon Sawa) and his friend Sam (Jason Segel) and Jeff (Michael Maronna) scammed their way to college. When winning puppet (Jason Schwartzman) discovered the secrets, she blackmails to help her score with beautiful, happy-happy Angela (James King) students. <br /> <br /> Stupid and incompetent "comedy" - a lot more plain -Enhanced than laugh-induced. Movies are trying to appeal to its target audience and its disgusting gang - but none of these works. What's more, it's full of worthless characters, unappealing - and Schwartzman's character so stack it is a great turn-off. Movies even try using 50/60 sexpot of actress Mamie Van Doren in the most outrageous movie scene. YUCK press <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />! something I liked James (aka Jaime King), who was very appealing - and deserving better. <br /> <br /> This gets no more than one out of ten from me.
