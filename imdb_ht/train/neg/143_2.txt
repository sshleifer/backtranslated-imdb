In an attempt to bring back the slasher teen genre that was taken by parody such as Scary Films and Shriek if you know what I did Friday last 13th, Valentine failed. Why did people love Halloween? Because it was original, new and beyond beyond anything ever made. Why did they like to call? Because at least it made sense. Valentine is just a stupid-flicking slogan that has hardly any gore-ever. The plot is so similar to Halloween and Urban Legend it's not funny. With this moment the killer comes on screen, you know who it is, it's just sssssssssssooooooooooooo predictable. The slasher teen genre is DEAD GET ON IT! <br /> <br /> 0 out of 10
