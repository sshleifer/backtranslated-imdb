What was supposed to be? A remake of Fisher King? Why Do We Care About Sandler? What a slow, sad, boring, who-give-a-modi-on-those-those movie !!! Just simply dull to sit down, I turned it before it ended. It is so obvious that Cheadle needs help as Sandler; As I said, can you say "Fisher king"? And how does this psychotic function function in his everyday life? We do not suppose that deeply, I guess. Why does Cheadle continue to give Sandler a chance to turn violent on it? If these friends were good, how were they grown up apart? If Cheadle is so in control, why does he continue to seek advice from the shrinking of the street? We never said. That's why Fisher King was a better movie on many levels and why this just sucks. Almost 8 out of 10 average scores? I do not agree. At all. Even these films themselves are likely to find such a high average rating, and this crap does not deserve to be in the same universe with them.
