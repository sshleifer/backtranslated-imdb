A friend gave me this movie. A friend of mine is now in a hospital being a team of doctors trying to surgically remove a DVD box from his ****. I quit smoking excited by the candidates of another Michael Coal movie. After all his novels made me many entertainment and scenario adaptations before they were great but boys, I was wrong. <br /> <br /> First of the people who made the casting were asleep while doing this. I imagined the silks went something like this. "Tell me, did you love fish?" "Yes I love so much fish." "Wonder full, you are hiring. Some money." <br /> <br /> Pass the script. I had read Carbon, whom I expected to go blind before he could see this piece in Dong, and he has absolutely nothing to do with his novels. I'm not sure if it's annoyed me as he did, but he might have something to do with the fact that listening to a 90-year-old problem drink duck hunter having a dysfunctional right crannial eagle would have a treat The one-compartment comparison these 2 March massacre children's models spied out. <br /> <br /> This is a current line from the movie; "If you tell me something that you never said loudly to anyone before, spend the time becoming unique!" Unique? Do it? Is it really? Off course your beam. Please, Imitate the Imodium. I will have a whole lot of land. <br /> <br /> The report is ... well. I do not have anything. Perhaps Rawson Marshall Thurber just received his grandmother word exploding or something. Stick to direct comedies. No wood for direct marketing. This movie is so awful he let me hit myself against a wall so hard it brought me back to the stone age. I give it 2 stars because I do not want the guy who watched a movie star 1.
