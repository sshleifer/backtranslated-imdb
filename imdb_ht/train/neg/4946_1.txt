Admittedly, I looked at this piece and already very low expectations. Dieter Bohlen is a rather untalented composer who has lack of talent is only more power than the size of his month. This was the first cartoon movie that I watched was 100 percent free humor. It is rude, offensive, redneck and blatantly anti- woman. As such, it is a creation of befitting Bohlen, but the average viewer will be rather put into it. No wonder he never showed up in a movie theater: It would have been BIG BIG time! <br /> Not even the expense of 6.5 MegaEuros could save this piece off of crap. Save your time ... with money!
