It has all the clicks in movies of this type and there is no substance. The plot went nowhere and the end of the movie I felt like a sucker for watching it. The production was good; However, the script and acting were B-movie quality. The casting was poor because there were good mixers in and crew actors. The good actors did not keep their own, nor did they raise the others. <br /> <br /> This movie is not worth the further words, but I'll say more to meet the minimum requirements of ten lines. James Wood and Cuban Agent, Jr. play karikatures at the top of other cinemas. <br /> If you are looking for mindless entertainment, I still would not recommend this movie.
