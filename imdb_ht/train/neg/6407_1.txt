I watched this movie for 45 minutes and counted 9 mullets. This is a mullet every 5 minutes. However, this film is living proof that formula works. If it does not break, it does not need fixing. A street-yet-vulnerable street heroine, a stubborn master of martial arts cop with a heart of gold and a serial killer and 'problem'. Best Magic.
