The movie is selected after the recent renewal and military environment up electronic monitoring equipment in the desert where the attacks of the first movie happen. The team died not long before a group of soldiers in a training exercise showed up to get one around. You can fill in the rest. <br /> This is a paycheck picture all around. There seems to be no passion in anyone's performance, nor to anyone behind the camera. This is a movie that has been made for the money and nothing else. On some levels this would have worked, it could be a much more terrible South Comfort (where National Guardians run afoul of some people in the swamp), but instead it's not much of anything. In large part you can blame the script, writing unbelievably in part by Wes Craven, which hit the same old goals again and again. Add to the mess the fact that the direction is dull and the series in sequence is so lacking glare as to remove any inherent tension in any scene. It's not bad as such, but seriously made and dull. Let me put my feelings in context: The reason I saw this movie was because a local multiplex went up and ran this movie instead of the kids mimicking the movie Mimzy last and I wanted to see what caused Crying out (I mean these films have so much in common-she says sarcastic). I am convinced that this film will only scare people who love the latest Mimzy.
