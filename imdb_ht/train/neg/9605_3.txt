This Italian film from the '70 is NOT even in the classroom and the dog warrior, the intriguing, or even terrible American werewolf in Paris, but ... it is fun to watch. I'm talking about watching the lead actress, a stunning blonde, running amok in her birthday suit. We're talking about graphics, completing stripping ... it's obvious that it's a real blonde ... great humma! The story is a crappy, SFX is childhood, and the act (for the most part) feels. The only redemption value of this film is all (and there is a lot) the scene and sex gender. Tasted by HBO standards, but always fun to see when you find yourself without a date on Saturday night. OK ... HERE'S SPOILER ... There is no werewolf (except at the opening stage of the heroine's ancestor? ??) The girl just imagined that she's a werewolf ... in other words, a clinic Lycanthrope.
