This is the biggest charge of crap that I've seen in a long time. Last time I hated a movie so much was also watching "28 days later" and "Magnolia". There is absolutely no point in this movie, except seeing gay sex scenes really sick and twisted, Gillian Anderson relieves herself on the roadside, with every single phrase in dialogue that has to use the word "F" at least a couple of times in it . It has been very cheap to act and is very low budget. My friend and I eventually turned off the movie after about half an hour. We tried to give it a chance, but nothing could save this crud. PA WATCH IT !!!
