I saw this in the premiere of Melbourne <br /> It is fundamentally, two-dimensional, unaffecting and, hard to believe in the matter, boring. The actors are beams, but they did not have much to work and provided the plodding with impressive script. For those who might be worried that Ned Kelly would be over-intellectualized, you can take comfort in the fact that this storytelling is utterly without any literary depth at all, said entirely on the surface and all central casting standards . However, it does not work as a popcorn film either. His rally is too off-kilter and its craft is too short to satisfy even on the level of a menten shareholder. <br /> I very much gregor Jordan was able to sit back and say to himself "this is the best I could do with the material." Ned Kelly is a fascinating figure, and as is his national response. It is possible to have popular genius, perhaps warrior class, possibly psychopaths and probably all of this, has dominated Australian mythology true for over 120 years. Again, its history has failed permanently on the big screen. <br /> <br /> These are life.
