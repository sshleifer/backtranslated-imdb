I saw this movie thinking it would be one of those old movie B which fun to watch. I was so bad! This film was boring and obviously aimed at men who like to look at cooperative women. The story was so ridiculous and implausible that it lost my interest altogether. It seemed to be in the same manner as the Ed Wood films - bottom of the barrel.
