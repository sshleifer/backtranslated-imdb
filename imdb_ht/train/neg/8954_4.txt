I had high hopes for this movie because I liked the book so much. However, I do not think I would understand the site of the movie if I had not already read the book. The film is a tremendous attempt to show the despair of those who are trying to break the bonds in the rule of government, but the book shows their suffering more closely. Corruption government officials have comfortable life, almost abundant, while the common people struggle to find their need for survival. Perhaps most people feel this way toward leaders and their leaders regardless of whether they actually oppress or repress. The Orwell Dystopia looks as if it could exist in many places in our modern world. It was several years since I read the book, but one heard the referral to Big Brother, the Police thought, and Newspeak often in the media and casual conversations. Probably many people who use these terms do not realize where the terms come from. I recommend that you read the book.
