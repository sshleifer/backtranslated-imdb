Looking at the other comments, I'm surprised that there are no warnings of potential viewers of these having to look forward to renting this waste. The first, I rented this thing with the understanding that it was a completely rerored Indiana Jones hit-off. What I got was one of the most offensive cinemas I could remember trying to sit down, made all the more shocking by the comparatively movie production value. <br /> I do not think this is a spoiler, but if it is, be warned ... <br /> <br /> If your idea of ​​entertainment watching BIMBO getting violated from behind by Fearsome Tribal Chief, while he stared at the eyes of the other significant other, by all means, renting this cops. If not, I would advise you to look elsewhere for entertainment. <br /> <br /> Come to think of it, that scene so succinctly sum up the movie that nothing else I really have to say about it.
