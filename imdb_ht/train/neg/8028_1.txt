Please! Do not waste any money on this movie. It really is nothing more than a German razor wig ripoff witch made by some high school kids. I could not end up watching it, and I usually love watching all kinds of b-movies. How Can the World Find a Distributor? !!! Funny however: Check Wikipedia for "dark areas". The guy who wrote the entry must be completely out of his mind. Perhaps it received loads of money from producers. Money should be spent on actors, cameras and corrections. Even that would not have helped, since there is absolutely no interesting idea behind this movie. Unfortunately, "black areas" have already become too much attention. Please, director, producer and author of this film, Stop making movies like that ... you do not make yourself a favor. The world would be a better place without this movie.
