Hamill brand would have felt vibrant bustle with CORVETTE summit! This time, he uses a new kind of "force" to regain possession of his dream car, a bright red green. It looks like another green-aged teenager shouted the first half-hour film and made a U-turn of heading for the wrong direction. Works with direct writing to perform, with a few scenes you can not hardly take. You are expecting this to happen anyway, and you're also sniffing the center at end-70s hodgepodge. Only an old Newcomer like Annie Potts would easily steal the show and save this poor movie from the breaks to break! Personality is impossible but delightful to keep your interest in good, and this is the finest chance to see her in a swimsuit. Hooray for Annie! Sorry, Mark! I guess the force was not with you this time around.
