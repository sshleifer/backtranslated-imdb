What ever happened to one of the most innovative and brilliant stories in our time? Well, he did the kind of normal movie action summer that could have been directed by anybody available from movie school ... and in fact, they probably would have done a better job. They would have at least put half of a thought in the obnoxious script. Mark Wahlberg plays an astronaut who traveled in some sort of wormhole and landed on a planet led by Saints. (gasp!) Except this time around, the boobs are tied to cranky diapers, nonsensical plot, and bursting special effects that constantly boost in my mind that this money could have been put on 10 independent films would have been considered 'chief' next to this. <br /> As many as I love the superb acting talent that is Tim Roth, her performance as ill Thade leader is nothing more than an intense composition of slouching and heavy breathing. Luckily, the makeup allows it as an actor to maintain some dignity and most of the crap-dialogue is hidden behind her plains and sniffles. <br /> And alas, still the traditional Hollywood tradition of taking the male and female driving and tuning them up to the end without any relationship development or cause. And "haha we are so clever, are not we?" Hollywood intermediate way from the original POTA to this one. Signs ... <br /> Instead of seeing this, spend the night in and call up some friends and rent 'Ed Wood', 'Edward Scissorhands',' Batman ', or even to a lesser extent' Sleepy Hollow ', and reminisce about the days when Tim Burton was a man of visions and originality ... not ashamed and ridiculous.
