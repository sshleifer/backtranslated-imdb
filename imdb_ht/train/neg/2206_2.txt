A scientist on an island is deeply grieved over the loss of his son who died of kidney cancer. So he thinks: why not turn my son to death in a math shark. Well, who would not? It is a little hard to deal with the fact that the hammer shark that's to kill everyone is constantly calling "Paul." Also, cast William Forsythe as a MacGyver-kick-ass-save-save-hero hero miss credibility. On the other hand there are a few hot chicks that make you actually look at the screen while shark Paul bites another one to death. As a matter of fact, I find the bad b-movie quite fun. But for my taste it would be a better movie if it had to say 1,000,000 less bucks. Then it might have been fun.
