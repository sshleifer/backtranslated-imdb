"Washington Square" is a flat, shabby adaptation of the short novel by Henry James. Indeed, the novel is very good, but far from the level of James' prince. In addition to his simple, unprecedented story looks like it's made in a movie (although William Wyler, with his "heiress", gave a beautiful version of the novel in 1949). <br /> In any way, the movie completely betrays the spirit of this great American writer's work. In the novel, the heroine Catherine is shy, not very beautiful and somewhat clumsy, but it is a sound, intelligent young woman, and not as swimming as it may seem. His attachment to his father is worthy and respectable, with no morbid place in him. Along the three quarters of the film, Catherine (Jennifer Jason Leigh) just seems to be mentally delayed, poor stuff. In the last quarter, she suddenly (and incredibly) gets smart, aware of her dignity as a woman, and all that. <br /> <br /> Director of Agnieszka Holland added two vulgar scenes in the story. The first, when the nervous child Catherine has, well, problems with her vesica. The second scene, when we see on the background a sort of open-air broth, and prostitutes take their customers back to tents, and so on. There is nothing that can be most contrary to the spiritual ideals of Henry James. It is reiterated that the writer was very decent and even demanded for the standards of the Victorian age. I challenge anyone who finds any cohesion anywhere in the big pages of James James' literary page. I was really annoyed by these two scenes. <br /> Yes, I know that a director needs unreasonable freedom in the adaptation screen of a novel. And if a direct director ignores or misunderstands the art of an author (hereinafter Henry James), I do not see the point of using his work to make a bad movie. <br /> <br /> The adequate act of the movie: poor and flat, in spite of the talent of Albert Finney and Maggie Smith. "Washington Square" is definitely a movie that is not advisable.
