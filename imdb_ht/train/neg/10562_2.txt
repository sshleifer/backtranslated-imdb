This very comedy budget budget budget succeeds only in being budgeted. Dialogue is dumbfoundingly stupid, chasing scenes are exactly boring, and most of the money on screen seem to have been saved for a series of crashes and explosions in a lot of parking for the last five minutes of the movie (a short glimpsed port -a-toilet early in this scene is sure to break and spit crap over the movie's bad guys - no one is here without a goal). The whole movie is reminiscent of those that occasionally came from the studio Rodger Corman when it would give a first time director of a few bucks and a camera - but without Corman's discipline would be imposed.
