Oh ... i ... God ... this is without a doubt the absolute movie movie I've ever seen. The act is bad, the story is weak, the weakest characters, and the movie all just do not make sense. This couple and mediocre led, really strange scenes (like one in which the kid reaches the ravine and mysteriously falls into), and quite plagued dialogue ("Look!" "Musta peed his pants!"), And you get one complete failure. Not to mention the fact that the only thing Mr. Atlas seems to have been able to defeat is a case in chocolate bar. But this is part of the movie's charm. Sit down and watch it with a few of your friends for a good laugh. <br /> I love this movie because it's just so bad!
