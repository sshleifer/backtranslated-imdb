Well, I remember watching the first one, and her boy was sucking. After watching it, I just laughed off and said to myself, "oh boy, just another B-movie low budget. I will never see a part 2 of this one." Then, about 1 1/2 years later, became part of. It sucks even more. But I just laughed it off again and said, "There is no way I ever will see a part 3 of this one." Then, about 1/2 a year later, part 3 was out. I was stupid enough to rent it with boy, I just broke after watching it. God, I never realized how many movies can be sucking these days. Just save yourself $ 7.50 and you do not rent the entire set. Trust me, it's worth every penny.
