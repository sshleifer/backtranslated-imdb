Well first I would like to add that I am a bit of a historian so what I look for in a movie based on historical events is that it is actually based on historical facts. But this is however not the case here. Make sure the movie is fun and all but the fact that it is not entirely based on true reality is more than annoying. Hitler was not anti-Semitic in his youth, he even worked for Jewish pre-war world wars. He was, however, during a world war and after that he formed his views on the Jews. Her development of this film is also incorrect, Hitler as a child was not a little disturbed. It has a normal increase or less normal. There is nothing to mention about losing his brother and other important pieces added to the puzzle that is Hitler. Robert Carlyle is a great actor but does not really fit into the role of Hitler. Hitler was not as impossible and unstable as it is portrait-ed here. Under his younger years he was a charismatic person who "manipulated" people in his charms. His unstable behavior and rage crisis began at turning point into the war. <br /> I would like to see a movie about Hitler's life based on real historical facts and not accusations. I really hate when people show a finger blame in for Hitler's example and others and tell correct stories just to paint a picture of them as most evil. It is best to actually tell the story exactly as it was for everyone to learn what it was like! People behind this movie should do some research before they do this. Because it seems as if they did not even know what really happened. Hitler was not even shot in the revolutionary mass of Munch, his shoulder was worn out of his grip. It gives you more view of a good documentary than seen.
