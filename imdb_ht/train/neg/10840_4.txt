I have come to love the growing show, along with millions of others. So I tuned in this movie, thinking if not good it might be at least a bit dazzling and fun. <br /> <br /> LAL! I just have to ask, at the end, was Charlie's Angels really boring? I do not seem to remember it as such. But this movie, as bad as the movie this kind of case, made little resemblance to the excitement of this time period and show. I've seen it all, in spite of the negative, it was not unequal. But it was very bland, which I am not the fault of the performers for all, particularly the women who played angels as they really did. The movie just was not that interesting. He tried to make each angel a "character". (An angel is feisty, one is "the good girl," is one of her husband ....), all the characters have been described with one major feature defined and a little beyond stereotypes. The excitement of the show was lacking and the dialogue was .... dialogue. That's pretty much it. <br /> <br /> Not terrible. Not worst in television movies. But miserable.
