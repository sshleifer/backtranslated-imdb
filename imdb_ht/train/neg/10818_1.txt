Having read the novel before seeing this film, I was greatly shamed by the wooden act and arrogance of the producers of their flagrantly disrespectful draw in the draw. I feel this film in no way reflects the brilliance of Bronte's work, and rather gave the impression of a deep love story. In condensation of the film in a short 2hours, the film lost much of the key features that make the book understand and progression, thus resulting in a slightly juggling plot with little bases. There is no need to build up the romance between Rochester and Jane Eyre, so it appears rather abrupt and lively since the characters have such common interactions you can not but imagine 'love' are superficial. This is such an injustice in the Bronte novel; They do not give you any impression of Jane's meat blow and conviction that attracts her Rochester, with her arrogance that attracts her to Jane. <br /> <br /> Despite poor scripting, I think a few of the characters have been described as very astronomer, namely Mrs Fairfax and Grace Poole, however the overall production was poor. Give a better scripting, perhaps the movie would be more successful. See "Jane Eyre" (1970) and Zelah Clarke and Timothy Dalton for an outstanding production.
