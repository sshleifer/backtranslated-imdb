I went to watch this movie knowing he was not going to do great. but that I was witnessing was terrible for words. I do not mean to be tough, it's just the movie was terrible. Overall it was bad, I mean the special effect AWFUL, the act was not too bad, but it's not good either, and sasquatch itself was like .... well, not sasquatch. In my opinion the best sasquatch film is Harry and the Hendersons. It's not violent or horror, but it has the best deposition of sasquatch. at least one lawsuit and not some half cgi rip-off ass. only see this movie if you are desperate, or really appreciate anyone in the movie. or go look at the saints boondock, it is best.
