This self proclaimed "very talented artist" led the worst worst Spanish film in the 21st Century. Lack of emotion, coherence, rhythm, agility, humor ... it repeats the same situation over and over again. It shows no character development. It does not even show any violent and / or sexual content, and does not add anything to the sub-psycho-killer genre. So his army should show off film school as an example of "what not to do" in a movie first. <br /> <br /> BTW Where Hell Is The "Talent"? There have been almost identical scenes; there are scenes with two or more meter shots and it is quite awful to see the action jumps from one meter to another without a reason. The camera almost never moved, as if the "talented artist" was afraid to show his lack of visual skills. The actors play their main role to act like amateurs, and cast in support is hardly credible. There are more holes than traces of the script (if ever there was one) ... A really discouraging movie, and a director too.
