You have been fouled and beaten up by submitting my harsh statements about "femme fatale" / "guns n 'gall" movies! Now comes another lot of disappointing rediscovers: ninja movies! Many of those I've seen before, and let me tell you, they are not all that cracked up to be! They usually do not stick to the point. This, among all others, suffers from no originality! What's a Ninja made and prevented a nuclear burn in Russia? And is not supposed to be a "martial" movie, too? Do many sounds like an incredible action movie for you? Is without number one reason for the love of death? Will you be wasting some of your hard cash earned on a lady in the top-seeing tank? Answers to these important questions are found in the Ninja Mission, which should be in the martial arts section of your video store. For fun even more nonsense ninja, try to check out these Godfrey Ho movies to put out of the Trans World. You get what you deserve, and that's a promise! Recommended only for hardcore ninja drugs!
