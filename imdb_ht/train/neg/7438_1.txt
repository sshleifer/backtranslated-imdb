This film is a waste of time writing, the plot is terrible, the dialogue is awful. <br /> <br /> The act is OK, but the actors have absolutely no scheme or script to work with. The photography and some of the special effects are OK, too, but yet there is nothing interesting in this movie to watch. There is no logical progression in the story, the story line is utterly nonsense. It's not even scary. For a movie to be scared, there must have been at least a small part of credibility. This film has no credibility at all. <br /> There are only three characters in the movie. Each character is fundamentally and has no personality. Most of the special effects and their work are both seriously done, or most mediocre. <br /> I hope you read this and not waste time on this movie unless you are curious to see an entirely horrible movie.
