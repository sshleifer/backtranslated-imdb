I love Memory of a Geisha so I read the book twice; It is one of the best books I've read it last year. I was looking forward to the movie and feared that the book would ruin the pleasure of looking at the movie. I did not expect the movie to be that bad. Some of the best parts of the book were missing from the movie and the characters were weak and Hatsumomo (Li Gong) was the worst. If I do not read the book, this movie would be a bit confusing and inexplicable. County map of the state film "Nitta Sayuri reveals how he crossed his fishing ..." Did anyone see how or when Sayuri became Nitta Sayuri? Forget the movie and read the book.
