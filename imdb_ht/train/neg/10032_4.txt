The scenario was okay. Akshay Kumar was always good and was the only good thing about the movie. Karena Kapoor looks bad. There was so much to cry about her size zero but she did not look good wick. I do not know why Hell made Anil Kapoor accepting such a bad role. There was nothing much to do for her in the movie. Just because it is a Yashraj film does not mean that an actor should accept the role however bad he is. Said Ali Khan was well. I think it is high time that American directors and producers begin to think of American as many intelligent customers. What are we? foolishly ... What they think will show 2 people taking on a SWAT squad and we will believe them. Is the American police so stupid that they are trying to wet some criminals .... they took a whole squad of 100+ policemen and no one surrounded the palace. The action was crap and I never saw the bad actions. Akshay Kumar was between a circle of 30-40 policemen all shot at him ..... and he shot back at them. None of the policeman bullets touched him, but killed all the policemen. Krap. CRAP. <br /> I think the battle director who thought at this stage should take retirement. <br /> <br /> I recommend you do not see this movie.
