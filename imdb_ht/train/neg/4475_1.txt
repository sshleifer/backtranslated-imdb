terrible, just awful! My old bedroom spouse used to watch this junk and drove me crazy. The book is one of my favorites and its a shame that some people will never know what it is really like because their first impressions are from dribble like this. It has changed so much is hardly acknowledged. who checked me since the book read as a soap opera anyway, providing enough fodder for modern day entertainment. It's like one of those films that say "based on a true story," but are completely fictional. No of the emotions or depth of the book, just goodbye melodrama. If you are a high school student looking for a way to get out of reading, I suggest you try another version.
