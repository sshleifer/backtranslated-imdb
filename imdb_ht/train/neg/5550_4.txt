You realize that you've been watching the exact same show for eight years, right? I could understand the initial curiosity of seeing foreign co-exist on an island, but you would think that after watching unkempt, jerk-loaded hero runs roughshod into the bush and an egg on a spoon for a half Decades would be enough to get you committed to something a little more original (and interesting). <br /> And I even do not even talk about showing the validity of the file I get skeptical. It's just hard to stop disbelief for "Billy Bill" eating a rat when the entire crew of producers and those cameras is housed in a bio-dual-air conditioner to skip the dual mochcinno brown and moxy. the appeal here? I do not care about these people or their unexpected lives. I just do not get it. But if you find yourself being fascinated by hairy, tired people, I suggest you close your TV and just take a trip to your local bus stop where you can see people like this in their True Habits . They are called PEOPLE, and they are free, you can sit back and marvel at their unearthly ability to retrieve various cigar debris from a multitude of garbage canals, eventually hit "pay-dirt" and fashion a homemade cancer. Frankenstein-styled-sticks, while begging people to change food when stinking in "Aqua Velva" on their breath is enough to suggest otherwise. And the best part? Many like survivors, each week one member of the "leaf" branch "island" when they unceremoniously send packing to the local institution when the unmedicated scary state of schizophrenia has blown kicks at gears! NOW THE INTERNET!
