I really did this show, once upon a time. That is, until I realize all the faults in it. So unrealistic. I know it is fiction, but it is not even the slightest bit credible. But why. ** Spoilers before people ... ** Are we really supposed to believe that a kid like Yugi should come down from a Pharaoh in ancient Egypt? C'mon! It is the biggest nerd on the face of the Earth. And what's up with Pharaoh (the hair and / or the yami)? Last I was checking, Pharaoh was shaved (except for a little bit of hair over the head) and wearing fancy hat. <br /> And, we are convinced that a wealthy wealthy genius, called Seto Kaiba, can legally run a business business while still having time to go to a little little school like 'Domino High' ? Scary-laws! First, it should legally be an adult in running a company. And that would make him not really too much of a boy genius, since he would be the only adult in his class. And secondly, why would he go to a school like 'high domino', when his business is quite successful enough to go to an animated snobbies academy? Plus, the side cemetery and his little brother are so happy and lame. Each time you turn around, kidnapping was kidnapped by the goons for the baddie. * Huge * Nothing new, nothing new. <br /> <br /> Joey is the poor kid, who lives with a good father-for-nothing. He says Joey earns all the money going to his school, because his dad is an alcoholic, but you never saw Joey doing anything similar to work. It does not even mention work. And her sister Serenity is a complete moron. Why would he choose a snob like Duke (who dressed his brother in a dog suit and publicly outraged him on television) about a beautiful guy like Tristan? Is it really that clueless? Various characters throughout the show, get possession of demonic forces, get stolen souls by demonic forces, and fall prey to mental illness. (Oh, this kids-safe, PA.) Tea is the typical type of girl-next-door, whose only goal is to be Yugi / Yami's girlfriend. And while he has some cool point, he just does not have enough time to shine as a main character. <br /> <br /> The animation is simply awful. All the characters look ill and anorexic. Perspectives are terrible (especially when making pre-ups from someone) and the colors look good, but not stellar. <br /> But the worst pitcher series was the fact that Yami says it's Millennium Puzzle can send souls back into their bodies. If so, how did he not save his father Yugi's father in the first place, when Pegasus stole his soul and saved himself from the trouble to return it? <br /> All it really is, is a commercial for itself. Only the most part of it is "Yu-Gi-Oh: The Abridged Series" by LittleKuriboh. Do something more refreshing. Like, look at the abbreviated version. <br /> <br /> 1/10
