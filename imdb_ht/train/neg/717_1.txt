He meant to be a parody of the LOTR Trilogy. But this was one of the most terrible movie I've ever seen. Bad act, bad scenario, bad things. THIS IS MY PERSONAL OPINION. I do not doubt any second that people will love this sense of "humor", but there was better parody about the acclaimed director movie as Mel Brooks or Zucker Brothers. I am working in a movie theater and in DVD Shop and the success of this film has appeared in both areas: In these films, it was a nice (but not big at all) success during the first two weeks but then When the comments of those who saw it were not too good, the film fell very fast. In DVD sales it was good for short but then nobody asked for it yet. In the past ten years, the worst movies I've seen are the Bag Bag and Torque. I can not decide which one was worse, but I'm happy to have a very good movie so I do not have to think too much about this issue.
