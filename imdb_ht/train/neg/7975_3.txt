As I sat in front of the television watching this movie, I thought, "Oh, what Alfred Hitchcock, or even Brian DePalma, could do with this!" Chances are, you will also. It starts out intrigue. A British ranger living in Los Angeles (Collin Firth) married a beautiful, brunette woman (Lisa Zane) whom she met in a park just a while ago. Then one day she disappears. The police can not find any documents that he has ever existed, and Firth does its own research. So far, so good. Just as she's about to give up, she turned to her best madam friend (Billy Zane), and stumbled upon her former life in her sordid smearing of drugs, boxes, and film ametueren, and then her story of mental instability. At this point, Firth's life is in danger, and the movie falls apart. None of the characters from Lisa Zane's past are remotely interesting. The movie moves slowly, and there are very few actions. There is a subplot regarding missing drug money, but it's just a move. No chases, no sequence cliffhanging, and no suspension. Just some dirty beatings and a lot of cats by boring characters. One thing is worthless, Lisa Zane and Billy Zane are siblings, but they never appear in a scene together. By the end of the movie, you tear between wondering what could have been and trying to stay awake.
