This is just the usual American garbage that turns out to be a cinema, as Indians can proudly boast that we have the biggest movie industry, however it is also the worst. <br /> <br /> How can other poor countries have films and real characters that challenge the views of their respective societies and we just keep on pumping out garbage. Take a look at Russia, Iran, China and Latin America, look at the brilliant films they have and get crap like Kisna !! <br /> find real people, not surprising the international community of street cinemas in Indian movies.
