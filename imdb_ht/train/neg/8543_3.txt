I admit, I had to speed forward in this wrong DVD transferred after about 30 minutes - NOT passed, and all those who already described the "scheme." But there is someone mentioning the opening scene - a stab knife is stabbed in a wig and it stamped on the grass in the front yard! I guess the gross kid did it, putting it never explained. Really trippy opening. <br /> I wish this was a better writing or thinking out movie, because what we are leaving with if beautiful Daft and a movie that makes no sense is not a "smart" movie, it's just a bad movie executed. <br /> I would like to see a cleaner version and if there were any missing feet, I would like to see if it would help. Otherwise, this is an odd little movie that is best if fast-throwing across!
