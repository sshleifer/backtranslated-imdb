Alone in the dark is one of my favorite role-playing-games of all time. I remember spending whole nights facing the PC screen, trying to escape that castle and actually being amazed at times when monsters became surprisingly loaded in. Now your mind - I'm tired of "computer-game-producing" movies. I do not remember a single success story of this new Hollywood genre, although some are fun enough to be watching. And yet, I'm like a big fan of the game that I can not resist. My case was that if the film had a plot that was so as to say that the game, it would be OK. <br /> <br /> Man, these 90 minutes (which seemed like 300) in my life that I never will get back. If I was lucky, I'd be happy to replace my socks instead. This is not even in "so bad it's funny" category. You would think even Christian Slater had a bit more sense than joining this Stink Bomb. Now Tara Reid ... I'm not complaining about her presence. However, if the purpose of putting this chick in a starting role is to have a sex scene - which I totally understand and support (hey, I'm a guy!) - I've seen more of her body on press conference. <br /> There is no draw to talk. Will not waste time you launch it to you. Credibility of the sinking story below 'I did not have sex with Mrs. Lewinski'. The act is but a fewer above 'Street Fighter', which, by the way, being one of the worst films I've seen, I'd recommend passing this one. <br /> <br /> Kids, I recommend Video Game. It has far better history, acting with many more emotions. As for the movie, here's a spoiler - it's STINKS! Wait for the version of pornography.
