Raymond Burr star as a lawyer caught in the assassination of his best friend (Dick Foran) thanks to his affection for his friend's wife (Angela Lansbury). This was a full year before he started making Perry Mason, so the movie might be of particular interest to his fans if he had the inspiration for his filing. <br /> <br /> There is not so much else here interesting though. Lansbury is always good, but her character here is only one dimension and the motives for her crime in the mystery are totally obvious. There is an interesting performance by Lamont Johnson as a painter who also loves the "femme fatale", but the character Burr is pretty straightforward. It's frankly scary to see an actor such as Burr doing these romantic scenes with Lansbury, and his delivery keeps his matching character here very well as he does in the movie I've seen him in. There is no The whole mystery, and whole suspension, is supposed to be around the title of the movie and the way Burr's character is setting up the character Lansbury implies itself (double prevents the attempts to re-murder the original, presumably). It does this with a very large tape recorder that it does not notice when it comes to the room I guess. <br /> A few maybe thankful moments of fun and basically the rest of the stuff made for TV.
