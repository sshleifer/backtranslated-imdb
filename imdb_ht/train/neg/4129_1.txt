After watching about half of this I was ready to give up and turning it around, but I endured in the end. This is a movie that tries to have a romantic comedy and fails. The act is poor - worse than acting in the 80s T & A movies. There are several attempts at humorous weakness and the film is 100% predictable. Perhaps if you're a teenager movie that will hold some calls, but for those who have seen many movies, you'll know how the movie turns out after the first 10 minutes. The rest of your time will pass through agony waiting for the finished credit to roll. <br /> Do not waste your time watching this.
