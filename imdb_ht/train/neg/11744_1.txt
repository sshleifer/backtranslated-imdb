After finally watch this movie in its entirety, I completely mystified by the worship she received by critics and online users alike. Is it the worst Western ever? No, I would not say so. But "the last big Western American", a phrase I've seen applying to it more than once? Do not even close. <br /> A movie that tries to tell a story like this needs credible characters who speak credible dialogue, and the dialogue of this movie is among the most popular and ceremonies that I've ever seen. The film can be measured in complaints per minute; as in, how often is an actor or actress forced into the script to say something that no one could say in real life? There are so many cases that it's distracted. Cheesy lines come to you in waves; predictable, unoriginal, and often. <br /> <br /> If bad dialogue does not hurt you, then how about bad gunfights? Some Westerners can show you gunfighting this completely incredible while desperately trying to take you seriously. It's okay if there's a funny edge such gunfighting, as in Silverado, but in very stunning scenes with very stiff bumps in the early gunplay is just another reason to leave this movie in the list of Western viewers. The final confession somewhat smashed the director on this note, but not then I was so interested in the film that he was beyond saving. <br /> <br /> Other than these flaws, I can say the visuals are stunning - good movie shot and the settings all look great. Acting is beams, especially considering what the actors have given them to work with. However, if you are looking for the last big Western American, do yourself a favor - go leasing Unforgiven instead. <br /> <br /> 3 out of 10
