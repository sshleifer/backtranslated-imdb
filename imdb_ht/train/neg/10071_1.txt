I saw this movie in his prime minister at Sundance 09. <br /> Since Indian Beauty is a movie that has something to say, I was hoping for Towelhead. Unfortunately, it was a disappointment. In fact, in countless movies I've seen in nearly a dozen Sundance festivals, Towelhead is the Sundance movie only I've ever wanted to walk out early from. The worst problem with Towelhead is that it is so obviously out with a collection of "provocative" concepts regarding cultural stereotypes, rather than with an organic human drama. Simply come from the same name novel by Alicia Erian. The famous Edith Wharton quote comes to mind: I never knew a woman who was good enough to be good in spite of having adapted to the author's political opinion. This observation is especially devastating for Towelhead because its political opinion is so stingy and simplistic. If ever there was a time when white towelhead men bandits, condescending portraits of black, ironic treatments in foreign cultures, etc., were cool, it's been long past. <br /> For a more detailed review, please see any of the many professional reviews available online. Almost all of this film rate is poor and exposure to deep and manipulative tissue is based on. On the other hand, the amateur reviewers seem easier to bamboozled. While reading these revisions to these sites and similarly, you will often come across extra: "stunning," "breathtaking," "profound," "shocking," ... It embarrassed me to read but it does not make surprise farms. Indeed, I met many people who seem to consider any books or films related to racial, cultural, sex, or sexual issues as deeply moved, thought provoking, full of profound thoughts. If you are like someone, by all means, rent towelhead and be moved by it. On the other hand, if you set your standard higher, you can safely pass on this one.
