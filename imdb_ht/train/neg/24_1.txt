I must commend this one-approved genius. Edward Furlong, you are not as you think mate, you can not grab on every piece of low low price low, which only intended had to get some bucks. is bad, and I mean BAD. Anyone with a camera might get the same result, or better. Acting, allow just say: do not go to the grocery store looking for actors. Goods usually come with a degree or, at least, some damn experience! The director .. Mr. Jon Keeyes, please find your goals in life, as a director or simply suck. Your direction is poor, the angles are all messed up (not in a good way), the lines seem like they're reading out of toilet paper, and the damn music .. it always comes when it should not go out for any reason noticeable. And do not go for writers either, by the way. Making movies is not like serving on a coffin, it requires art and skill, things I really doubt you will ever have. <br /> Instead of doing a badass shootout movie, you should have shot this one back in oblivion and wait until a good thing has come. Or just go get a job on a coffin. You will have less stress and you will save movie spectators some money with a bad night. <br /> <br /> vote: 1/10 (my first time)
