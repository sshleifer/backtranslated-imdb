This is a rip off of the Old Frankenstein property. An acclamated scientist killed in a freakish accident with his father, a brain surgeon survivor saved in the brain. It is then set in a robotic body to design his own. His brother, an electric engineer, gives one 'kolos' one to transfer thinking in motion. The whole project goes bad, when the creation goes berserk. <br /> <br /> Special effects are being developed. Script is missing. And it is funny that this does not scare a bit. Well, very small children will think this is a good thing. If you are wide awake in three in the morning and this comes over .... night, night. The lead characters are played by Otto Kruger, John Baragrey and Ross Martin. Ed Wolff played the 'Kolos'.
