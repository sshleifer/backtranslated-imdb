Think of the end of the Grudge 2 and the following: <br /> - a man who repeats the word Sunshine - a cowboy - a love story - Sara Michelle Gellar cuts himself - with a creepy ice <br /> < br> O and animal underwater SEA ... yay ... <br /> <br /> not a good movie ... I seriously did not enjoy it too. The poster for the film is sad to deceive as well and I found that he just sucked the person to look at it ... I can not believe I was gone. <br /> <br /> Save your time and money ... go see Saw III ... a movie where the writing makes you feel like there was effort put in it ... Mike and I come out
