It seems that the cast should ensure at least one average film. So I sat for 102 minutes of unbelief. In addition to Ed Harris, no one seems to possess the skills of acting. Even Sean Connery, who I normally worship, must have been a day-off during the entire movie Just to be. Not once during the movie one actor was able to convince me. This movie has made this movie look cheap and real. <br /> <br /> The story makes up a little. It is thrilling, and the plot is unexpected. <br /> Conclusion only watch this movie if you really have nothing more to do.
