If you've seen other movies like this, they're probably better. The Omega Man comes to mind. In the studio's studio, avoiding the expansive, unnecessary, high budget techniques that indicate this cinema. In addition, the meteor and citizens were excellent: the last four people are normally irrelevant in trying to get away from a fatal illness infection. What's wrong is everything else! I get tired of endless stupid, negligent, wimpy, effective, barking character in a movie. It's pretty much describing everyone in the movie at some point. I rent it and found myself crying in the TV repeatedly, "No, do not!", "Why are you so stupid," "Look out!", Etc .. A true lack of character development is Obviously about half an inch a movie should give you a strong personal connection and at least some of the characters so that you actually take care of what's going on. This does not. Also, there should be a longer, more involving end of the movie as well.
