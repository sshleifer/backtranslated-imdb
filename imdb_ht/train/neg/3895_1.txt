Once upon a time some people have made a movie about a guy who got shot in space, supposedly going to satin, but really only in some stock stock of solar flashlights, and then he gets a nose bleeding, and before you know it, she's wearing a head hospital head, and then a nurse is overweight and a sick-fitting uniform comes in and gets eat by the guy, who is supposed to melt all over the hand never seems to lose any mass, and then NASA, or at least a guy in NASA, gets mad about it and calls another guy to hunt him down, but the guy was sent to Hunting the fusion guy went home and they had first soup, with his strange-shaped wife forgot the crackers, so he can not have crackers, and then he went out and looked for the guy melting with a Geiger counter, and who does not really work, so it really only follows the trail of half-food corpses, and then there's something about a sheriff, The ugly old man in a lemon grove, with a woman with a spreading meat, a few types of industrial plants and fire-trigger safety-happy, and since I can not tell you how the movie ends, all what I can say is Jonathan Demme is in it somewhere with some guys and the stupid name of Burr DeBenning, and if there's any justice in the world all people connected to this movie have died a horrible, violent death can make more movies, and the world has lived happily ever after - the end!
