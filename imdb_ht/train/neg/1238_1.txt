This Tim Burton rumors of the original "Planet of the Apes" from 1968 (and begins Charleton Heston) is a far, far cry from the quality and the original plot. <br /> <br /> Certainly the special effects have been improved since 1968, but no written. Characters were boring and the dialogue was awful. I sat in the whole movie with a friend (who fortunately only leases it) and fully understands why, before Christmas, all the game "Planet of the Game" in the targets were in the clearance bin. My advice to Tim Burton: Do not put this on your resume. <br /> <br /> My advice for everyone else: look original 1968 "Planet of the Apes" movie.
