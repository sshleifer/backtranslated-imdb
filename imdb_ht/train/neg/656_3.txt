Note: I could not force myself to actually write a constructive review of Prom Night. It just can not do. Instead, I went to what I thought about while watching the movie. <br /> <br /> Things I Thought Over Night Prom Night: <br /> I'm so tired of these dreams where these elaborate deaths will take place, only for main characters wakes up right before it bites it. Of course, when I say "elaborate death", I mean in the scrub sand or elbow stomach screen. Was not all "it's just a dream" thing to get lost by Dallas? Speaking of that, I wonder if a couple of couples in the gut will cause immediate death. <br /> <br /> The movie is only ten minutes and I can already count the horror clips on the two hands. Not a good sign. <br /> I even after meeting the protagonist companion, I am convinced he will die. Who wants to bet? <br /> <br /> The killer in this movie is a teacher who is obsessed with the main character, Donna. (By the way, anyone thinks that "Donna" is a horrific name for a main character in a horror movie?) He spent three years in a maximum security prison before breaking out and finding Donna celebrating his high school high school. While there is no accounting for tastes, I seriously ask who would take all this time into a person's feet like dough like Donna. <br /> <br />-High school allows the bullets to take place in hotels and not to keep track of their students. Apparently students are perfectly able to buy a hotel room and go in and out as they please. I suppose if this point drawn was not in place, the film would be 90 minutes of people being bored out of their minds and randomly biting the dust every time they went to the bathroom. I suppose the trade for excitement is my whole boon and everything. I've already played "counting the pieces of gum bubble mill under the chair" and "guessing how much I have in my wallet" and I only in the 20 minute mark. What else will I entertain myself? <br /> - <br /> -Not of yourself: Do not forget milk and bread on the way home. <br /> -Get Finder: You've used up enough fake fakes to get into this movie and all other horrors noticed this year. The 1980 version of this movie was not that good but compared to that note it was like Citizens Kane, or at least the Godfather. She had Jamie Lee Curtis in one of her many post-Halloween horror cops and she had a little "twist" in the end. I miss Jamie Lee. I hope he would act more. <br /> <br /> -Apparently, there's not much dance going on. Instead the girls get in the fight with the boyfriends as they plan to go to college. I hear all colleges that are being brought up by name, and I can not help but wonder who these girls have to cheat off on the entrance exam to get in. The assassin must carry a bag of material Cleaning is really effective and wet up his mess between scenes. It's only logical explanation for what it could break someone into death on the carpet or toilet and by the time someone goes up to the hotel room, there is no trace of a struggle. (On another side of note: This is a very lazy killer Michael Michael went hunting after his victim .. Just said.) <br /> It's Official: The whole audience in the theater will rooting on the assassin. What triggered it? Was it anytime Donna went back to her hotel room while the mermaids went to order everyone to get out of the building? Was she her constant dream, and how even after going to something dramatic of her dreams she insisted on reenacting her step into a tee? Or was Brittany Snow's compelling performance? I'll say it was all above. <br /> <br /> -Okay, who was "dead on screen in the third act"? You have the skin. <br /> <br /> Finally, the movie is over. My friend came back to me and said "Donna was not too clever." That's the worst of the week. Types like saying a tornado is a small gust of wind, or a week long break hanging is a slight inconvenience. <br /> I can not wait to get on Rotten Tomatoes and see if anyone has given this a favorable review. <br /> I can not recommend that. I refuse to recommend that. This is as lazy in a horror movie as any, and the only way to enjoy your smoked cheese scheme is if you are under the influence of at least ten beers. And unfortunately for theaters, alcohol does not serve. <br /> <br /> <br /> Rating: * from ****
