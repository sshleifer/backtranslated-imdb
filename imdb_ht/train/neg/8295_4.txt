I tend like character-driven movie. I also think that Hope Davis turned to work still good, so I had high hopes for this movie. Those people hope they were soon. <br /> <br /> The main flaw and this movie is the direction. There are a lot of scenes that are the sequences of dreams. The movie often uses the Denis Leary's character as the month changed to the character Campbell Scott. It does not work for me all. This would work better as a play than a movie. <br /> There are problems with the scheme as well. It is important that the characters of a movie take a trip and end up in a different place from where they started. I did not feel that the characters grow in the experiences described in the movie. <br /> <br /> Finally, the correction was not properly done, either. There was a great sang among the movie that was exceptionally boring. <br /> <br /> Except for acting, which I felt was still strong, this movie failed in almost every aspect of the movie.
