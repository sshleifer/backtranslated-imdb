When you see Boris Karloff and Bela Lugosi as co stars, you hope to get a good horror movie, but this is actually quite different, representing how he did what I would describe as an early effort in science fiction. Karloff and Lugosi both play scientists (Rukh and Benet respectively) - competitors to a limit, until Rukh wins Benet on with a demonstration that proves his great theory. The science here was - to say the least - somewhat rough around the edges (so science fiction, with the emphasis on the fiction) but somehow Rukh harnesses some sort of ray from Andromeda that allows him to watch in the ground "several millions of dollars last year." In what historical prehistory, a large meteorite was slammed in Africa, leaving deposits in a substance called "Radium X" - therapeutic and destroyed. A great portion of the film is placed rather tediously in Africa, on a search for the meteorite deposits, which Rukh eventually finds and equipment to create a great weapon, unfortunately infects itself with some sort of disease that makes it a great weapon too. <br /> <br /> Karloff and Lugosi were both very good here. Lugosi pulls on a role in which he is the good guy very well, although I honestly found him somewhat compelling - especially during the scenes set in Africa. The story also plodded along a bit, and while he kept my attention and did not catch me. Given that this is really a sci-fi rather than a horror film, and that sci-fi was in its early stages, I suppose the film needs to be cut off a little bit of slack. It was OK - nothing more, but nothing less than that. 4/10
