Rarely I give up on a movie without seeing the entire show. This is particularly true when I've leased it on DVD. Syrians was the one I gave up. Halfway through me I turn it into boredom. This film is disjointed, boring, confusing and subtle. The act was dry and without credible portraits. The overall scheme was good but developed in a fashion like acid and boring that it failed to attract my attention or interest. The several sub conspiracies often failed to connect with each other and seemed more like random stories than a current sketch connected. Too such a serious topic and the great actors can create such a flop. I can not imagine this film receiving any nomination much less a premium.
