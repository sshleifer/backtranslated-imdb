I do not know what you guys are to breathe, but please stop. This film was filled with garbage. Macaulay Culkin as Kevin McCallister was lovable, beautiful, sweet, loving, and very fun to watch. It was innocent but at the same time, it was strong as well. <br /> This new kid, Alex? Teaser like all hell! Just a blatant ripple of trying to match Culkin's charm and grace, he is not miserable. <br /> <br /> The bandits, complete crap. Harry and Marv, were such an entertaining on screen team. They were comedians, were funny, and just did you really want to root for Culkin even more, that is what a good villain would do. These guys Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern, absolutely PERFECT for these roles. On the other hand, at 3, we have 4 new idiots that just bicker and again, try to capitalize on the charisma and duo charm of the bandits at first. Do not say they were horrible, but they were not memorable or even really fun. More on the reindeer side actually. Then we got the real movies. Part 1 and 2, classic. Memorab. Perfect to look around Christmas and bring a nice Christmas feel and carry out many emotions. It makes you fall in love with the story, and care about the characters. Simply, memorable and close to being prince. Part 3? Chief Crap. Ase said. <br /> All and all, I do not know why people like this. I think people really do not know what a good movie is yet. It's a rib-off offender with more unrealistic traps and a new kid character that I wish the thieves would at least beat the crap out. Run, run away from this garbage. And do not even start with Part 4!
