If you have plenty of time to waste ... it's OK. He moved at a fast pace but pulled this movie into it would need a little longer and slightly more background on the sitter. <br /> <br /> The act is OK. Mariana Klaveno as the sitter does the best job and is the most credible. William R. Moses has played a very good part as her husband. <br /> <br /> Gail O'Grady, as the wife, had a weak part and the reason to get to work was not developed. <br /> <br /> The party is sort of unusual. Like most of these sitter movies ... there are interesting parts ... but in general it leaves you wondering why you spent the time.
