Director Robert Atkins is certified crazy. The ultra-low film film recorded a few days in a Harry Russo life (Jan Giancaspro, who also co-wrote), a black-work that receives a rubberneck doll from her bitch girlfriend. It begins to take the order of the feather to take massive amounts of drugs, rape and kill, not always in that order. What starts as a ball-to-wall explosion film, well kept like that, but it gets VERY repetitive very quickly. I lean more toward the falsification of the oven. It's hard to forget once to see though. Kinda as if Tom Green ever made a horror movie. <br /> <br /> My Grade: F <br /> <br /> Candy eyes: Laurie Farwell gets completely naked; Jasmine Putnam shows tits and bushes <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
