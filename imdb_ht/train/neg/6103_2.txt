For honest, I am surprised by the positive votes that this film has received. The movie just drags along its span span of 81 minutes, and the audience has suffered all the way through. Actually there are some positive moments in this movie; Charlie Spradling provides a decent performance. He gives some very pathetic dialogue and cares very well. Scott Valentine (Merrideth's companion in family relationships), on the other hand, is a very rough look. I guess the highlight of her performance is to witness the guy laying on the beach wearing tiger-patterned chummies .... giving me a break. Also, Valentine gives us a stuffy and pathetic spite of a vampire missing missing day (to see a more compelling pronounce of vampire in suffering see Denice Duff in "Bloodstorm: Subspecies 4"). The movie moves so slowly and is only positively punctuated by, and to be honest, Charlie Spradling's dance scene. This film can be honestly only recommended to die the hard fans of Charlie Spradling (who I am, and I still had a rough time watching it!).
