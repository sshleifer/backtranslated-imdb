Do we talk about the same movie? This film is totally ridiculous, the plot is lousy and completely without logic. It's a typical straightforward DVD / TV movie that contains all the ingredients needed for a horrible movie experience: Over acting by actors, side steps from the strip are left unexplained, the girl shows T * TS ( why, God, why?), people do not react to things as they would in real life. I will not even bother you with details, it would take all night. Well, OK, just one: If two people were murdered in front of you as you were walking down the street, one of the victims practically died in your arms without spurts out of head injuries from all over the world about you, your first concern would be; "Oh, he left the world and the last thing he saw was my angry face"? Think I'm going to Harvey and his lost career.
