I was so disappointed in this film. I do not know much about the true story, so I was eager to see it playing out on film and educating myself on a little bit of storytelling. With such a powerful true story and great actor it seemed like a surefire combination. Well, somewhere the scenario fails. She was so thrown - is this movie about her childhood? love his life own disability? ability to speak it? his passion for people with disabilities? I'm sure there is a way to incorporate all of this into a good story, but this movie did not read. I left the cold watching the characters that were unfair because of the disabilities, but because of their personality. Other small flu: 1. Soundtrack is heavy-handed. It's the sixties - YOU get it all! 2. If it is such a public speaker phenomenon, why not treat us more than a shingle here and there - and even then especially in montage?
