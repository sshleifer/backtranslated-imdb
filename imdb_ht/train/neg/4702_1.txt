I hate this movie. I hate the show. I hate just about everything. It's so annoying and stupid. Everyone says that mat and alex wolff are heroes of the music world and that they will do it great. HOW MUCH OF THE DRUGS YOU DO ??? !!! ???!?!?! Naked and Alex will end as either hobos or ending like Jane Hudson from "Whatever happened to baby Jane?". I could only get in not even 20 minutes to this one, barely 30 seconds from the show, and I managed to survive about half an hour in 'Battle of the Bands'. How anyone can appeal to these guys at the hearing of the Kid Choice Awards, I have no signs. Days before Nick's film premiere, most of the young actresses on Nick (Jamie Spears, Emma Roberts, Lindsey Shaw, etc.) have appeared in an influencing brain-dead comedy about how awesome nat and alex wolff them. The first, they did not, my trick, and second of all, nat and alex probably either the drugs or pay them loads of money in order to say that with convincing sounds, because I do not see how anyone can Find this fun show / movie. The music is just awful. Soul sings like a sick, dead Moose over crack. Alex is the most annoying / TV show ever. It's not funny, it annoying, it's really weird, and she thinks it's hot and knows everything about girls. lucky guy if he ever managed to get put. Do you know this show is false when you find that some of the characters (in real life) do not even exist !! The character Jesse actually played by Nat and Alex's cousin Jesse Draper (they mustve had some budget problems). Daddy is not alone, she is married to Polly Draper, but she does not appear on the show, making it seem Wolff's are mother-less. Rosalina does not exist either. His name is Allie DiMeco. I'll say, the naked brothers will be in some sh ** deep when their "fans" get all the scene. 0/10
