Actually, it was very funny ... in a "god, how the hell made this film to get made" kind of way. if your life makes fun of movies ... which I somehow do ... go ahead and watch it ... but if you're actually thinking "this is a good movie?" Eff in. <br /> This movie sucked out of the very start and worst scene I've ever seen in any movie .... usually found five minutes in it before you realize "this movie might suck" but no, you know right off the bat. This film talks about edgar all poets ... never tried to explain it though, to those who do not memorize the life story of the po ... So I do not know if any of what is said is reality. <br /> <This film is about a writer "pounding poet" hookin up with her cousin "ann" .... they are both edgar Allan poe ... or are they?!? Apparently, people give ancestors what they did. This poet actually picks up "Usher," who is supposed to be the grandson of the story "The House of Usher" written by edgar all poets. Ann's show shows sometimes to try to break it ... Let's also be backed up, at one point in the movie, by three different people on the same street (seriously, three ... are like good rear behind it and not even achieved). The characters being murdered at all, show up in the end to try to save the day .... but they can not. In the end, shoot at Ethan while trying to kill his best friend. Of course, before he launches it he has to call out "nevermore!" this should see movie never!
