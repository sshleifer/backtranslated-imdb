This boggy journey never comes close to match the wit and crazy of the excellent adventure these guys have taken in their first movie. This slice is trying to veer away its prequel to capture some new blood from the joke, but it takes a wrong turn and travels anywhere interesting or fun. There are almost half an hour wasted on showing the guys doing a rock concert (and many people watching over "free TV" - since then)? The script writer might have done something more creative; look at how all the random elements of the first movie were neatly tied together by a convergence of presentation in science. Not in this movie, which pretty much ended the Bill & Ted franchise. The joke was over. <br /> <br /> Grim Reaper at the top of the mix, for whatever reason. This infusion, like the whole plot, hurt and spark action for comedy or audience participation. There is a ZZ Top impression, the layer for no reason. There are light, smoke, mirrors, noise. But there is nothing really creative or funny. <br /> Skip this stuff bogus.
