Despite some oddly-thought-provoking oddities in the script and the film's overall curiosity value, Wolfman's anger appears as a dull, refreshing display of lyanantropy, saved only by the presence of estuaries in villainess Perla Cristal. The rest of the players, including Naschy's Amocrats, are a complete write-off (though admittedly no have been helped by often drabing). Despite the scenario package of enough variations on wolfwares / Frankenstein / Dr. Moreau theme of meat out a dozen movies, the plot is so unbalanced to develop, weakening the characters and the dialog for ridiculous versions (at least in the English version), that any Inactive interventions in turgid procedures are soon shipped. <br /> <br /> Zabalza's direction seems like even amateur. His platform is clumsy and effective. It does not help in the lighting of Villasenor. Even promising to lay down, so without the photo atmosphere that some directors attempt to give the audience a very awesome signaling far ahead <br /> <br /> Other credits fall into a similar pattern of incompetence, though the weird note on-ephytic and legitimate, totally primitive special effects deserve special conviction.
