I was told that being a fan of people who created Halloween / Fog / Christine / the stuff - probably his best movie. Then you got this POS. I can not logically think he had put any effort into all this as he did with Burns Cigarettes. At least his son made a decent band. <br /> You have to look at this from the point of view that it does not seem like a movie. He looks as if someone else directs it for one thing. I will not believe Carpenter put any effort into this at all .. I just listened to her old school H2 / H3 / band in fog and was scared, especially for the times. <BR> <br /> It used a style that no one and worked so well for its movie.
