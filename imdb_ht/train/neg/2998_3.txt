For dead-hard Judy Garland fans only. There are two (2) numbers that are really good - one place to make a number and a bigger lady cleaning (you've seen all the pictures), and a very good number at the end of many. There are a couple of scenes where the lines are funny. But basically, the script is so bad and the movie is so dated that it's hard not to cringe at the terrible of all. But it's worth the 2.50 leasing the movie - just to prepare it fast-forward.
