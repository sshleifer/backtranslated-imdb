Men's Radar from the Moon is a very typical ticket in the 1950's. The special effects are very cheap, the riders are obviously the Second World War jealous surfers and painted plywood on them, and the like. Acting is just so-so. It inspires the imagination of the children, whom I believe this has led them. By today's standards, it's boring, cheap, and bad. There are also a set amount of stock stock in the first 9 episodes of natural disasters.
