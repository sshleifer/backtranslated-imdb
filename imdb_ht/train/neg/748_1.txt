I love movies, and I'll watch any movie all the way through, just give it a chance. I can finally say that I found a movie I can not look all the way off. The act is terribly stagnant and monotonous, the CGI looks like a computer geek made it to his mother's basics with minimal software, and ..... the scenes are long in fair ... walk !!!! And this film is THREE HOURS LONG !!! I did not even do it 15 minutes until I quickly send the DVD. Scenes and aliens are very short. Ummm, instead of naming this "War of the Worlds", allows the name "War of the Long Distance Markets". This cost 5 million do! What are the spending money on, the song opening dramatic? <br /> Oh, but on a positive note, one scene you need to watch is when the aliens first start killing people. This hilarious, not because people are dying, but because when they turn into skeletons, they always squirm for 20 seconds later. So .... like I said, if you're a fan of boring, stale, action-less movies, here's one for your DVD collection. But I did not write this to you, I wrote this for billions of thousands of others who will hATE this movie. It's not worth your time or money <br /> I know this is not the book, but the book is not that long, and I'm a book / nerd / geek w / whatever, but why? Just finding Steven Spielberg the version, it's not all that good, but it's 10 times better than this !! <br /> I give this a great, zero fat from 10.
