So they hyped the violence and it was labeled as ill. Well, the violence is the best I'm afraid, but unfortunately the characters do not develop enough to allow us to understand why they are going (they are predictable) rampage. This movie has a really obnoxious script. We never get a chance to get to know Robert and his actions in the end are just plain pathetic. The act is not the best, either, the worst of being the TV chef and the school teacher. The direction is clumsy, the pace is enough to send you to sleep. And what about the world is the movie project all about? A commentary on the movie itself maybe? The use of newsreel during the climactic killings is ridiculous. These guys obviously think their intellectuals are hopelessly out of their depth. How the earth has received great Yorgos Arvanitis in her light I will never know. And how they got the money to make it in the first place is an even bigger mystery. Absolutely terrible beyond comprehension.
