From the Star of "MITCHELL", From the director of "Joysticks" and "Angel's Revenge" !!! These are taglines that would normally keep me from seeing this movie. And the worst part is that all the above statements are true !!! Ugghhh ... Joe Don Baker feeds every five other minutes in this movie. It's like a bad rumor of the "Coogan's Blur"
