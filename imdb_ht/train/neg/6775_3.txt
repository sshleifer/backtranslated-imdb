I was glad to find this movie in the local video library - Cary Grant in a comedy series of services, director Stanley Donen, so far this is not like? It is the movie that has me asking two things - when all involved (including some well-known names) realized they had a turkey in their hands, and what is the worst thing about it in the midst of a number of controlled aspects? Always meditate on the first, but my vote for the letter goes to the diagonal storyline, ahead of the wordy sometimes unpretentious script, the uncertainty tone, the lack of consistent and well-developed characteristics, and the lack of relationship between the characters. You must add many unmatched active in the criticism but it's understood that the actors are fighting with this thing and in addition looks like under-repetition. Quite often they can hardly find their lines out loud enough. Cary Grant tries to show her usual good and urban character but at times seems uncomfortable with stakkat in his delivery. I must say however that I was relieved when the initial suggestion his character was scared and Jayse Mansfield unspeakably vulgar went with the appearance of Suzy Parker. What's the love of the movie? - For me especially the Parker beauty that also acts with constraints and a Grace Kelly-like dignity. Generally speaking the movie is beautiful look at. The naval characters are very clever in their uniforms - however you have to really be surprised at the fantasy black Fu Manchu clothes they don in luxury hotel suites. Even Grant can not look elegant in her. Returning to credit side, Ray Walston has done a laudable job with his character, and for me there was an interest in hearing a pre-Hogan hero to Werner Klemperer speaking without an accusation to inducing German!
