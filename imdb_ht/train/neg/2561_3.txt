666: The child starts as an airplane crash, only surviving in flight 666 was a boy named Donald (Boo Boo Stewart) who was adopted by news reporter Erika (Sarah Lieving) & her husband, cameraman Scott Lawson (Adam Vincent) after covering the incident for news chain 6. At first Donald seems like any normal kid but death seems to follow him around, after warning from a Nun & Vicar Scott begins to believe Donald is wrong with cause of all the deaths ... right-to-DVD movie horror was directed by Jake Perez under the pseudonym Jake Jackson & one said 666: The child is really rather poor. Whenever I see the Asylum responsible for a movie I get worried, I get very worried since track recordings are awful. They seem to specialize in making and / or distributing budget support films that are usually rip-offs in some recent successful film films of supreme film & in the case of 666: The child does not need a degree in rocket science to achieve that is a complete rip-off of cash in the recent Omen (2006) that was released the same year. The script by Benjamin Henry & Austin Laurel is awful & simply can not match the ambitions of the Hollywood equivalent, I mean just what exactly the Donald Antichrist hopes to achieve from a middle class family in a small town? It is hardly a big point to start over the destruction of the world is it? Each character of 666: The child is some form of the main character in Ommen, the parents adopt, the priest who tries to warn them & babysitter of disaster. There's a lack of incident, there's a little gore & the plot is poor. I mean Donald killed a dentist because they tried to fix his teeth is just so random & needless, that all the lousy pictures Donald had drew everything about, where the babysitter came from & there's just nothing which links all along & it's just a chaos mess that just gets pretty boring very fast. The references to number 6 also become annoying and they are very insuperable. <br /> <br /> Director Perez does well I suppose it's competent if nothing else. There is usually no blood or gore, there are a few sprays of blood, a hand cut and one gets a circular to see stuck in the face but it sounds a lot better than it looks on the screen. It's certainly not scary, no atmosphere thanks to a very turbulent temporary setting in a suburban house & there is no tension because we never really know what Donald is trying to do & there is no threat to him, . <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />. Acting is not that great but at the same time I've seen worse. 666: The child is a poor Omen rip-off, I would soon see either the original or noticed on this any day of the week. Not good & definitely not recommended. They followed by the end of 666: The Beast (2007) which also went straight-to-DVD.
