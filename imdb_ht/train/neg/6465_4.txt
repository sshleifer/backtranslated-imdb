This Charles trip is decent but this is a nice low-key performance. Marlon Brando means. There is a subplot with Mira Sorvino and Donald Sutherland who forget to develop and hurt the movie a little. I'm still trying to figure out why Charlie wants to change her name. Each film and "Charles" were very bad.
