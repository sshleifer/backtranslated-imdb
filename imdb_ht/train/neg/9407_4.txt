"Horror Houseboat" is often regarded as the worst Australian film ever performed and described as a typical slasher movie, which brought the promotion of 'The Film That Can not Find A Academy Award' .A disaster-based member begins Deadly Reducing Death Does not Burn Maniac as they try to shoot a music video on a remote lake in the Australian Desert. Mostly acted and writes slasher flicker film and zero suspension and annoying character. It certainly delivers the throat: the cracked heads in half with a machete, the throat cut and a woman are dying with a horseshoe.If you like your cheese slasher movies you can give this one to try but you have been warned. At least it's better than the Swedish "Bleeder" .4 from 10.
