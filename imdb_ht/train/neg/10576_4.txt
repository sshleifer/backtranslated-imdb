I was very excited when this series premiere in 2005. Most of them were very simple and appealing: every episode would be a one-hour mini movie directed by a famous, noteworthy director. Then when I finally looked at it was a bit of a disappointment. There are some good episodes from the first episode, but all of it was a mixed bag. I attributed it to the learning curve, and calculated that season 2 would be a lot all better. <br /> <br /> Boy, I was in for a shock. At least one season had a few good stories here and there. Season 2 (with the exception of the "Black Cat" begins The Excellent Jeffrey Combs) was a complete and total loss. The episode of "sounds like" can very well be the worst thing I've watched on television in the last 10 years, and most of the other episodes are not the best. I really hope that season 3 turns this around next year, but I'm not holding my breath.
