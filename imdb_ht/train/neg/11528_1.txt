Anyone who wrote the "good" post on this must have been a friend of these guys. This is bad even for wrestling grounds. In fact this is not even a real struggle, it's a few guys hit each other on a trampoline. Each man is about 45 pounds of wet and no one ounce in the entertainment value of this. It's just a few kids bored that even give a bad garden a chance, if possible. If you want to see some fun playgrounds, pick up Backyard Wrestling A Pain Pleasure. It has the 2 biggest names in BYW, MDogg20 and Josh Prohibition. These guys are good. They have actually gone from her yard and have trained professionals trained as "real" per writer. They went legitimate and became better. I recommend checking these guys 2. MDogg is crazy and cut the hook. So do not waste your time or cash on this crazy DVD, there are "best" back video yards out there.
