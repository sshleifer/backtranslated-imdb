The film has the longest, most tortured and agonized ending of any movie I've seen in a long time. Unfortunately it starts right after the opening credits. January Jones provided such a wooden performance, I was surprised he was not up in flames when he was near the candles in the movie. I do not really remember it from the other films it made (a blessing I have to believe .. I never criticized a performance actor because of film there are too many things that can affect it, but in that case, it is so bad that It actually means from the ATROYOUS script. Granted it was given to the line and situation Meryl Streep would have problems with but I sweared at reading times from a cue card replica set. In other times I thought he might actually be learning disable or slow in some ways to REAL! The scheme, dialogue and rhythms are as bad as you'll ever see, but there is no excuse for this performance or for the director who let it be perpetrated. I feel sorry For other actors, little Indian / breakfast clubs are pushed into a rotten torturely then regurgitated by a school principal writing school.Take that back to this has crayola executives all over it.
