I honestly had a high up expectation when I first started to watch this movie, but it turned out probably one of the most boring films I've ever seen! <br /> <br /> First of all, the pace is incredibly slow, so it looks much longer than it is (and not short) .I am certain when Jane Austen wrote the book, he did it several long pages , he filled it with descriptions, and it was not intended for people to read in one day, or it could drag and lose his appeal, which "Emma" most certainly did. Now, "Sense and Sensibility" had this defect at a slow pace, but at least it was the lively way to make up for it, as well as some good performance! <br /> <br /> This brings me default # 2, which is of course the act. While I do not come to care for basically anyone involved in this movie, I'm sure they can be in good work, but I did not see much of it in this movie. It was like people being trying too hard to be witty, too hard to be "top-class", too hard to be British (well, some of them), for them all just came up as a bunch of actors and not like people. <br /> # 3. The cast, as I said, seemed only like actors, and not actually like people they played. Maybe that's a good thing, because the people are really playing they were not all that nice. Why did everyone like Emma, ​​for example? Sure, it was the rich people who were beautiful in front of them, but it was a terrible gossip behind them. If his friends were "ugly", then he did not even bother going back. So why is this girl so great? Why do people have to tell stories, "just make it laugh?" Of course the snob could not even do that right. I have enough problems with Gwyneth Paltrow as Gwyneth Paltrow, and her "Emma" did not exactly change my opinion. Well, it's easy to see that I did not care for this one. I'm sure it's a nice book and all, but some books are really not meant to be done for the big screen, and "Emma" is one of them.
