I kept this fragrant bomb in a movie recently on a cable channel, and she recalled how horrible I thought it was in 1980 when first released. Many appraisers do not have enough enough to remember the enormous hype surrounding this movie and struggles between Stanley Kubrick and Steven King. The enormously popular novel had army fans longing to see a supposed "master" director to put this multi-layer supernatural story on the screen. "Salem's Lot" has already been lost in the late 1970s as a mini-series TV, directed by Tobe Hooper (it's "Texas Chainsaw Massacre" fame) and was wrongly handled, turning the villain In the book of a "Chiller Theater" vampire with no real threat at all thus destroying the entire site. Fans hoped that a senior director of Kubir would succeed where Hooper had failed. It did not happen. <br /> <br /> Sure, this movie looks very much and has a terrific opening sequence but then some achievements, it's all down. Jack Nicholson can not do anything but Jack Nicholson. He's always crazy and did not bring anything into his role here. I do not care that many reporters here think it is all that's in this claw, "Johnny here!" bit nonwithstanding ... it's just awful in this movie. So, is everyone else, for that matter. Scatman Crothers' character, Dick Halloran, was essential to the plot of the book, yet Kubrick killed him in one of the "locks" lamest sequences ever put on film. I remember the audience in the theater I saw in booing repeatedly over the past 45 minutes in this miserable cops, those who stayed there ... many left. King's book really does not translate well into films since many of the narratives happen internally in its characters, and often metaphysics. Kubrick has justified the tensions between living with the dead in favor of style here and the resulting chaos so far from the original material that we finally do not really care what's happening to that person. feeling and why many think it is a horrendous prince is beyond me.
