Here are some examples of Pat Robertsons' doubts claiming "good good track record" on predictions <br /> In its comments are widely reported from the January 2 edition of the Christian Broadcasting Club Club of 700 Club, during which He predicted that there would be "severe terrorist attacks" and "mass kill" in the United States in the "second half" in 2007, Pat Robertson host was happy that he was "a relatively good track record" about earlier predictions. But a review of the 2006 New Robertson Prediction declines that claim. He predicts, for example, that: <br /> <br /> * "President Bush will strengthen." Violence <br /> <br /> * "Elections will fall down, but the result of the war and the success of the economy will leave the Republicans in charge." WHEN <br /> * "The Iraq War will come to a successful conclusion. We will begin to remove troops before the end of this year." WAY OF LIFE <br /> More, as a January 3 Associated Press article reports, Robertson has a story of dubious predictions: The television predicted in January 2004 that President Bush would readily have re-election. Bush won 51% of the votes cast, beat Democratic Senator John Kerry in Massachusetts. Violence <br /> In 2005, Robertson predicted that Bush would have won after victory in his second term. He said that the proposal for Social Security reform would approve WRONG YET AGAIN! He claims to speak directly to God ... If so, God has a good sense of humor watching Done in a fool himself again and again.
