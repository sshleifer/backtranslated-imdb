I love horror movies. I can even appreciate most cheese (facing it, 9 out of 10 movie horrors these days are Cheese), but this was just ridiculous. Terrible acting, writing terrible writing, completely hollow and incredible characters (no actor Meisner here!) With a total lack of enough body count. I wish I could salvage 79 minutes into my life I was just wasting. At least the Crook brothers are well-known. The only good thing about the movie was watching Alicia Silverstone's wanted-to find the hole in the face. How this everyday made it to Sundance is to completely disassociate me. Most of the plot was absolutely unrealistic, even by standard slasher movie. I mean, come on! Who would run out to get a cheap earrings 10 seconds after a guy creepy stalker just left the doors? Lame.
