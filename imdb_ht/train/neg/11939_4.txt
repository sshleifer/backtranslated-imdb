Let me tell you something about this movie. I saw it twice. The first time I was a kid and the movie was quite fun at me. I really like it. I thought it was funny and interesting and the main character was kind of cool. <br /> I've seen it a few days ago. It was terrible. Really. I do not know why I thought it was funny before but now ... I did not laugh at all. There was nothing even a little fun. It was just mute. The story was weak. The act was nothing special. There are big actors in this movie but still acting is the best mediocrity. <br /> <br /> What's worse is the fact that this movie is racist. Really. Do not get me wrong, I usually do not complain about racism in movies. However I saw people complaining about the lack of black men in movies such as the 'Shaolin Temple' or about the fact that only black people in the 'Street Fighter' are one of the bad guys or ... Regardless, you get points . Some people see racism everywhere. I wonder how they would react to a movie like the 'Meteor Man'. Why? I'll tell you why. There is no asian in this movie. There is no white man among the good men. In fact there is only one white guy in the movie all and is the leader of the bad guys. All the good guys are African Americans. Do not get me wrong, I do not care is the good guy is black or white or yellow or pink or green. What I care about is the fact that we can barely see a white man in this movie. This is the only movie like that I've ever seen. It is just not realistic. If there is one black man in a Japanese film that is the case with the 'street fighter' there is no problem - in Japan most of whom are Asian. But if there are only one white person in an American movie there are some sort of issues - in most of the USA people in USA are white. It is like filming a Japanese movie and entirely white and single Asian cast as a bad guy. Just not real. <br /> <br /> That is it. I give the movie the 4/10 rate. It would be 1/10 if I did not have fun with it as a kid.
