This is definitely one of the films of the 70's filmmaker, and it's most notable for kicking off a decade of historic Bigfoot. It is also remarkable for the little touches of folly throughout the film, especially when the dark, Moody first half replaced by a musical interlude of everything (as another user pointed out, one of the songs dedicated to a character, Travis Crabtree, which pedals around in a temporary raft, then ... leaves, never to be seen again). Although it's painfully dated right now, I'm still a fun movie scary to show the kids, and anyone who enjoys either Bigfoot Folklore or hillbilly 70 culture is bound to get a kick out of this. My favorite part: a guy gets so scared that he jumps headfirst through a door (!?) And the narrator explained he went unconscious in "shock." Yes, I would say that breaking a door with itself is most likely why it went unconscious, but all. <br /> <br /> 4/10 stars, or 7/10 if you like bad Americana.
