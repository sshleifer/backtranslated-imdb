I went to the AFI list at the top of the 100 comedies, and I must say that this is really one of the worst. Not only in the 90 movies on the list I've seen, but in any movie I've ever seen. The funny drunks sometimes, Dudley is not true. Liza has almost made it refreshing, but alas ... just go look at the Developing Development if you want to see it in something good. Seriously, Dudley laughs and drinks is supposed to be funny? I would highly recommend almost any other movie on top of 100 AFI comedy for more laughs than that. If you want to see a "drunk" funnier, try the thin Man. Funnier film in general, any movie Marx Feet will kill (especially if you're as drunk as Arthur).
