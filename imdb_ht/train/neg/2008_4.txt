Not to mention whether Ann Rivers Siddons adapted the material for "House Next Door" in the 1970s in the same title, or someone else did it. This ever-made movie was directed by Canadian director Jeff Woolnough. Having read the book a long time ago, we decided to take a chance when the movie showed up on a cable version of what was clearly a movie made for television. You know that when the critical moments come before the ads, which of course, one can not find in this version we watched. The movie star is Lara Flynn Boyle who sports a new look that thaws this viewer curve because of cosmetic transformation this actress has gone through. From the new eyebrows to other parts of his body, Ms. Boyle is hardly recognized as Col Kennedy, the character in the center of the mystery. This was not one of the best moments of actress in front of the camera. This goes for the rest of the Canadian merchants who deserve better. The movie has a feeling of cross between "Desperate Houswives" and "The Stepford Wives" and other best known features, combined with a mild dose of criticism. The best thing about the movie was the home that serves as the environment.
