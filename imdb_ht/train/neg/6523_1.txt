Please take a moment to read my FRIEND. I DO NOT COMPLETE FILM FILM - ONLY DVD VERSIONS are currently available. <br /> <br /> I really wanted to give this movie the same two stars. I mean how it may be a mere 1 out of 10!?! <br /> Here is how: An epic film adaptation of the Tolstoy's "War and Peace" novel and historic battles, the courtesy of the Red Army, and a very faithful, scene-to-scene adaptation of the novel would be difficult but worth sitting in for seven hours - if that's what you've seen. <br /> <br /> The problem you can not see this movie - anywhere as far as I know. <br /> I try to watch the version of RusCiCo DVD - Widely considered the best version available since it's box box and restore the scenes that were off from other DVD releases. <br /> But it is one of most of my movie imagery ever seen transferring to DVD. The picture is muddy and consistent, often strobing. It's almost tolerated if you crank, your color and photos are up to the maximum .... but the problem does not end there. <br /> <br /> The sound is also consistent, heavy in part, usually bleak in others. <br /> And as for language, it's a big problem for English speakers - the armed option has some good actors, and some really horrible people have scratch performance, and parts of the movie just are not armed at all, slip back to Russian and even French randomly. <br /> <br /> The subtitled option is not much better. The subtitles do not appear under the image, but right on it - obsolete some of the beauty (or what's left of it) in the landscape. In addition, the subtitle is often a poor translation (a shame given that the script took the pains so close to Tolstoy's current word), and the subtitles too seem just released from party. <br /> So, even if you max out the color, brightness and photo settings, and turn the volume way up and select subtitled * and * armed English, you will always be getting an annoying movie to watch and listen. <br /> <br /> Is it in content to overcome that? It might have been, but within seven hours - who can stand it for so long? <br /> <br /> Perhaps one day someone will come along with this restore - and maybe then I'll see a masterpiece - but for now, I just can not give more than one star Something I could only stand up looking at the first 12%.
