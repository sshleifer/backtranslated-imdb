I'm not keen on Pallbearer, it's not too bad, but just very slow at times. As the movie goes on, it gets a little more interesting, but nothing is brilliant. I really like David Schwimmer and I think he's right here. I'm not a massive Gwyneth Paltrow fan, but I do not mind it sometimes and it's okay here. The pallbearer is not a highly recommended movie, but if you like driving them then you might enjoy it.
