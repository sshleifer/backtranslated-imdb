I could barely keep myself in either nodding off or just turning this turd, but I decided to stick it out if only for the reasoning that maybe * something * would happen. This works by a writer / producer / director / special fx, Kenneth Herts, who wants to make a statement about ecological damage while doing a monster movie. That's what he wanted, anyway. What it turns out to be is a lot of acting, either a little host or just mundane with many merits, and scenes that seem to repeat themselves as the monster ATTACKS in the river waters (oh, and what luck , a woman just happens to be naked in her ... though she has already disappeared!) This is just nonsense, but I suppose it's not too dangerous; It's not very reckoning at the youngest and once or twice we have a semi-interesting look at Brazilian "culture" (which is the father walking in town with his sheep or other pieces in a pretense of ' hey, this is NOT America! '). But the hope of the director of Mitchum or Carradine is wasted on the best pedestrians and worst interconnected dialogue with bamboo. It does not help when we finally find something in a good look at the monster and the "action" happens, it is also stupid scene and only call sleaza. Generally, I would feel sorry for a moviewriter who had a lot of trouble getting a particular photo finish - in which case she took the best part of the mid - 70s but with monstroid or monster or whatever it was called. .. close. > <br /> If you reach Elvira DVD dual-feature (bad imprints and bad transfer quality) and Blue Sunshine, make sure you skip this one. Unless, of course, you are an Elvira dead-hard and can not help yourself listening to his appetizing word; Personally, I'd rather find Joel or Mike Nelson and their robots from the Theater Science mystery about this roast turkey.
