I'm sure deep in the foreclosures of Jack Blacks mind character in Nacho Libre is absolutely hilarious but no it is not. You can tell Ol Jacks with a candle in a hamming time to play a smarmy, thin Mexican friar and dreaming of becoming a wrestler but this film is a total misfire in just about every single department. just sit there in most of the film thinking "Does this suppose to be funny" and "This is the guy from right D right". The truth is this movie is nothing to offer. AT ALL! It's a stunning script with crappy characters and really naff acting. You will look endless moments where you think something funny is surely about to happen, but it just does not. I was bored to stupid about 10 minutes but it would probably pick up. It was not. 90 minutes later I would barely manage to stave off an anus that she was painstaking. <br /> It is like, remembering years ago when you would see anything with the actor expressing you in it, even some of them really soon will not come out of them before they were famous and you should really be embarrassed Actors were actually in such a burden of plows. Yeah is like that. <br /> I've enjoyed some of Jack Black's best films like Shallow Hall and I'm really looking forward to seeing Select from destiny but coming on people. If you do this again Jack I'll have to come here, with your kneecaps hammer or something. At least you give a serious talk. <br /> I know it's a clich√©, but this is one of the worst movies I've ever seen and for many reasons.
