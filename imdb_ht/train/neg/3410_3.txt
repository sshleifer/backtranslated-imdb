Yes, this movie has kids going to space camp and starts out okay enough as you have kids meeting with each other and learning the ropes. Then they introduce Jinx, a robot that can not possibly exist in 1986 as they have nothing with the kind of artificial intelligence right now. Kid gets buddy with robots and robots to reimburse the kid's kindness by shooting it, and a group of other kids in this camp in outer space with an extremely limited oxygen reserve and the no-signal radio reaches into space. This camp is also not very fun as these kids are placed in real training and instructors find all over their missions or do not do the right thing. To give it a rest, they are here for fun, do not become astronauts just yet, just give them the space flight experience by a military such as camp. However, you get to see Joaquin Phoenix in a fairly early role. So at the end of a movie that tries to be realistic in some areas, but with the introduction of Jinx and other factors you might as well have the Space Battles alien space on top of everything else that was happening in the movie in as that would make the film a bit more enjoyable at least for me. Probably for some, too, others would like to see Kate Capshaw's face worn apart by some strange strange aliens.
