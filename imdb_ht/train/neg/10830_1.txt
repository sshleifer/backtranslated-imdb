1999 will go down in history as the film critic year leads the public to the public. First we were sent to EYES WIDE SHUT. Then they hyped up the BLAIR WITCH PROJECT and now MAGNOLIA which is by far the worst film of the year. What is it? Who the heck knows. It is filled with self-indulgent and charitable acts. I still love to stay and watch the credits, but when this was about me could not get out of the movie theater fast enough. Most of the audience attended the show that I was in, felt pretty much the same. Date was discussed with each other as well as foreigners. It's an ugly and hate movie that will make you feel ugly and lovers.
