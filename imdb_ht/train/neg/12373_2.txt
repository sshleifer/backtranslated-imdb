The script is so ridiculous ... this in turn, making the actors' lines sound stiffer and unrealistic and should not believe. There is repetition of sentence - "sweet little my daughter of God" and minor variations in the lines that come to mind ... and it's just sloppy diapos opera dialogue. <br /> <br /> Worse yet, the music is so bad! Plus, the main theme "bluesy" is horribly picturesque and entirely wrong for that. And he feels too much because the system, texture and arrangement of this theme never change, even when the emotional scene performs the scene. <br /> <br /> Immediately, every time it appears, it sticks out like a thumb thrash as the main transition from one scene to another. <br /> <br /> The cock's music, and it as if the writer wrote music for a soap or sitkon - a budget low 80 budget of Sitcom in that - and this makes it feel as if we still on the brink of a commercial. <br /> <br /> This is so miscast, there is a lot of overacting and it's a real stretch that many of these characters employ only one kind of NY accent - an Bronx accent era. I do not know if it's a matter of limiting the actors to just knowing * one * accent NY - or whether it's a matter of the director's ability to notice such a blatant abnormality. The end, it's the amateur script and lamenting lines that make this all "movie" ... blow. When any foundation is unstable and unstable, it is impossible to build on it without it's flaws to reveal themselves to more exponentially damaged and unflattering exponentials.
