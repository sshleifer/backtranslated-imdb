This is one of the most exciting films to watch from an academic perspective than from an entertainment perspective. I made my assessment based on how much I enjoyed or was amused by the movie, so I gave it a 4. If I should miss it as an academic film, though, it would get a 10 <br / > <It's injected into a very interesting way, like a pseudo-silent film with elements of sound effects and reality. It is meant to convey memorized memory and fragmentation of the mind, and it is interesting in what they respect. However, the movie has a lot of disgusting elements in it that I did not find all that fun. They are mostly just disturbing. It has some very interesting prints too, with some interesting concepts, but some of the character relationships (especially between mother and son) are very disturbing. In all, this movie will either appeal to you or it will not. For me, it was interesting in an academic perspective, but it was not a good look, and I'll probably not come back to it a second time. <br /> <br /> 4/10 if you are looking for entertainment. 10/10 in an academic way.
