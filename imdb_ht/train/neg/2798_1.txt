This movie is bad. If you're thinking about watching it, there's only one decent scene in the movie, and it lasts about 5 seconds (Amanda Carraway's topless scene). The rest of the movie is terrible. I think high school play probably has better acting. The plot makes no sense at all. The series was very lame, and it was not even good to make fun of. It was just dull and very pretty bad! I watched this on Starz so I thought he had to be at least decent. The miniature soundtrack sounds like it should be good. The girlfriend killed herself for apparently no reason at the start of the movie, after having watched some awesome music videos. The transitions between scenes are very abrupt and people like it just put a ton of clips into a movie without even thinking about their transition. Just off from one scene to another, there is no harmony. Kinds like switching me out to talk about how bad the movie is, explaining why the draw suggests. The audio gets low at some point, where you can barely hear it, then become loud and 'ureterally horror' thrown in at random in the movie. It is the same sound every time. This is now officially the worst movie I've ever seen <br /> Actress: 0/10 Effect: 1/10 Storyline: 0/10 Music: 3/10 <br /> <br / > Army Master: 1,000,000 / 10
