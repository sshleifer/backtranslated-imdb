Anyone familiar with my comments on the Internet movie database will know that I can be a flaming bomber from time to time. There are a lot of films I do not like that, for some reason inferior, I felt encouraged to review. However, if someone out there is curious to know the name of the worst movie I've ever seen, look no further than Transylvania 6-5000. Without question, this takes the title of all the time no. 1 horrible movie. I can not believe I actually did it from the start of this clunker to the finish! It is clearly meant to take delight in the young Frankenstein Mel Brooks, but where the film was a funny take on horror movie tradition, this one is a desperately exaggerated and foolish attempt to laugh out of embarrassingly weak material. Jeff Goldblum and Ed Begley Jr. look disappointed to be here as a pair of journalists in modern day Transylvania (maybe they are happening early on being completed in this Dud). During their search they came against all the chief monsters from past horror favorites, such as vampires, werewolves and mummies. Anyone who managed to brave this movie right at the end may be praying for a pole to be driven into The hearts of relieving them from agony of boredom. It marks a career nadir for everyone involved and proves that when comedy fails in a great way, it awesomely lasts the result of entertainment.
