For some reason, various young couple hikers across the Italian Alps split up to see who can reach the first designation camps. James (Gregory Lee Kenyon) entered a cave, found a skeleton of an ancient demonic gladiator and became possessed by the spirit of "Tyranus" when he placed on a helmet belonging to the corpse. He then spends the rest of the movie running around in hunting to hunt down his friends and hacking off the branches adding to some broths to bring the undead "Demonicus" back to life. This shot-on-digital full moon release is stupid, meaningful, awful acting with sounds and the Los Angeles National Forest is a poor substitute for Italy. However, it's very high on mentioning the empowering grave primarily to the overwrought lead performance. Whether pest runs around at cheap-branding weapons a sword or spouting neurotic Latin gibberish about demon and resurrection, Kenyon's ridiculous facial expressions and left-line delivery must be seen to be believed. Oh well, at least it's not boring as most of the rest of the cast.
