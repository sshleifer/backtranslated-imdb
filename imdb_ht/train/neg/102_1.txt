My girlfriend once brought in zombie history to look like a joke. The little we realized the joke was about to pay Â£ 1 for her. While watching this movie I started coming up with things I'd rather do than watching the Zombie Story. These include: <br /> 1) Bleach drink 2) Rub sand in my eyes 3) Write a letter to Brad Sykes and Garrett Clancy 4) Re-adopt the U.S. civil war 5) Return tax 6) GCSE Maths 7) Sex with an old lady. Garrett Clancy, aka Sgt. Ben Draper wrote this? The guy could not even dig a hole well. The best thing she did was kicking a door down (the best part of the movie). This was the worst movie I've ever seen, and I saw the noise of the White: Light. There is never a movie that has so many mistakes in it. My girlfriend left her here, so now I'm living with the shame possessing this piece of crap. <br /> <br /> News just in: Owen Wilson watch this movie and tried to kill himself. Reality. <br /> <br /> NOT WATCH
