My grandmother took me with my sister from seeing this movie when she came back from the theater back in 1998, and so we happily purchased tickets, the popcorn and soda, and went straight to the theater, he sat down to watch the movie. When it was over, the audience did not applaud strongly, I remember that I heard some people saying they did not like it at all, I did not like it, I thought it was rather stupid, and are not worth seeing. Eddie Murphy was hysterically in this, but apart from him, the movie was all bad, I rarely laugh at the parts of this, I also remember that the others in the theater almost hardly even laugh. And what I really thought was bad was to make the animals speak, because talking animals only exist in cartoons, in live action movies, they are totally a scuffle! I said that apart from too much Eddie Murphy's torture she brought in, this movie is not worth watching, it is rather stupid. <br /> I saw Eddie Murphy in several cinemas and I thought it was funny to those people, I just said it was only the comic part of this movie, I also did not see Eddie Murphy in the movie really "big", the adventures of Plush Nash. This film is not a movie that I would really recommend that you see, because apart from Eddie Murphy, you probably will not like this, especially because of a lot of animals talking to it! <br /> I'll give this movie a rating of 3 stars from a 10 possible stars.
