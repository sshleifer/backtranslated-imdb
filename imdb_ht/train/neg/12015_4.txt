Alfred Hitchcok is not my favorite director by any means but imagine what he can do with this! The plot holds great potential for suspension. John Garfield is as nearly always excellent and Raymond Massey is scarily cast against quality. Nancy Coleman is not a very impressive leader but cast in support is great and very capable. <br /> Yes it begins to sang right early. There are too many coincidences. And an important topic is trivialized by it being done in little more, in the end, than a love story. It's fun to look for Garfield, Massey, and the character performers. But it's not awfully good.
