This movie is one of those I am sorry to have invested 90 minutes in my life that I will never get back in. The first is really interesting - essentially it's a zombie flame from the perspective of the undead (let's not crack the hair as if they are actually dead or not} Unfortunately, they fail to deliver a compelling story of this foundation. Almost unbearable monotony in the lives of central characters can be added to the realism of the movie, but it absorbs all the right entertainment value out of it. If they put a little more effort towards keeping the viewer engaged, it would be more likely to drive home social comment.
