Della Myers (Kim Basinger) is a top-class housewife who lives in a private condominium in the suburbs with her twin children and her abusive Kenneth (Craig Sheffer) husband. Della gives full attention to the twins, neglecting their home and appearance and troubling Kenneth. On the Christmas Eve, he drives into the local mall in the night to buy paper packaging for their gifts, and found no parking space available. When she saw an old car parked on two spots, she left a message to the landlord calling her "self-reliant selfish". When the mall is closed, Della's car is kept by the old car driver and is threatened by four punks ?? Chuckie (Lukas Haas), Huey Afro-Americans (Jamie Starr), Chinese Vingh (Leonard Wu) and Latin Tomás (Luis Chavez). When the security guards at the mall to protect her, she was shot down by Chuckie, Della speeding up her car trying to escape from the criminals. However he crashes his truck nearby a forest while chased by the gang. He took the box and hid in the wild, fighting the gang to survive. <br /> A couple of days ago, I saw the trailer in "While It Out" and I was worried to watch the DVD. Unfortunately the trailer is better than the movie, and I'm totally disappointed with this dull and implausible collection of glaze. Della Myers presents as an insecure housewife and negligence and exists as a wife; Maternity is her only interest in her family concept. He was chased by four criminals but he defeated them with a toolbox similar to Batman's utility belt. Therefore, the plot is so absurd that irritates. Gang crimes are formed by the American favorite, with an American Afro, a Chinese-American and a Latin American and an American master to be politically correct. Kim Basinger has a decent decent, but children are too young for a fifty-five-year-old woman. My vote is four. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Enquanto Ela Está Fora" ("While It Out")
