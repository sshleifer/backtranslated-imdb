This movie was crap with a capital "C." The opening scene showed promise. But that "promise" was broken shortly after the viewer learned where the plot will be. And the wooden statue, Morty, who was rather creepy into the original movie, looks like plainly in this one. It was thus obviously just a guy in a cheap plastic suit. (And by the way, who else thinks "Morty" is one of the most un-feared planet earth names? It's just the Hang with "Jimmy" or "Fred" when it comes to the horror of the Henry Law "Kissinger, it's Dr. Kissinger!" That would be as frightening as "Morty.") Then there's a scene where "Heroes" hit their father's tombs and --- "a sledgehammer? " Would you guess - "a two-by-four?" Someone might venture out. No, he kneels to beat his father's builder and a hook-a freakin 'cock. Worse than once, once the characters walk away, the tomb is actually, and inexplicably bleeding .You fee! <br /> There is also a Native American guy who lives with the main character's grandparents, but apparently, does nothing except Morty-Maintenance. It pervertes Morty-legendary creepy, warns those who scoff, and even fixes the mortal air it gets damaged during a child tourism. But for all his respect and tenderness toward Morty, Does Morty give a rats a rear shoe? No <br /> <br /> The movie shoots on, and eventually several people die in the way that corresponds to the worst fears (sort of). This movie is a real yawner. Do not rent it.
