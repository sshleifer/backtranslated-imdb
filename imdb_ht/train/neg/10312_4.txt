As a 10 year old impression, I liked the "love of conquest" philosophy of sitcom in 70s "Bridget loves Bernie." I understood the conflict, which was about romantic complications between a Jewish taxi driver (David Birney) and a teacher of Irish Catholic school (Meredith Baxter) and both parents' parents (Harold J. Stone and Bibi Osterwald as Bernie's parents; Audra Lindley and David Doyle as Bridget's parents) who have problems with the couple's intellectual wedding. <br /> Look at the show now and years of personal life experiences, I'm surprised that the show was even a success for a single, albeit, highly-rated season. Created by TV veteran Bernard Slade, who a few years after canceling the show would write the play "success, next year", "Bridget loves Bernie" was a very light, superficial comedy that falls under her own airy weight them. <br /> There was no denying real-life chemistry between Birney and Baxter. But in later years, both actors show that they are best actors in other projects (Birney's short-lived role in "St. Other Places" and Baxter's "Family" and "Family Families"). Here, they were trying to breathe life into a show that needs a lot of funny corners, which might have given the extra depths of a very controversial topic. <br /> <br /> The show reveals Saturday night between the two CBS powers: "All in the Family" and "Mary Tyler Moore". Both of these shows were smart, funny and had enough of a corner (more so on the former that letter) that kept my interest in the situation with the characters. "Bridget loves Bernie" was not clever and only had some occasional chuckles. <br /> <br /> This was another example of a show that really was not as good as I remembered.
