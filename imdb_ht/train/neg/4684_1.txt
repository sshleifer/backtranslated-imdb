This movie is a reproach of ALL submarines. He was stupid. It appears to be written by monkeys. The act was absurd. If this is the look of most people there in the Navy, then I cry for our defense. This movie was awful. I put it below the "Voyage in the Sea" as far as submarine movie goes. Gene Hackman must really have to rent money to make this crap. Denzel Washington must have been high. Little in the plot makes any sense. And finish. For a mutineer to be rewarded for his crime? Only Hollywood would think of this waste. If you have not figured it out again, I did not like it. But if it were not for all the pro comments, I would not be bothering post.
