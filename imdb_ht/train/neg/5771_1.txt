I'm going to start by apologizing to filmmakers everywhere for using the term "cinema", "film", or "movie" in connection with this, but "criminals" and "crimes against humanity" seem a bit harsh. <br /> <You can not understand what you can do for you. <br /> <br /> So you can not do that. <br /> <br /> The technical skill used to gather this atrocity: NO WHATSOEVER. <br /> <br /> This waste of waste can hardly be called cinema. The majority of movies in the family come closer to touch than the Revenge Quest's distinction. No, this is just a 10-pile batter-up hold on video. <br /> We will skip the plot of this review, because there are too many pits to be covered at once. Let's just say it feels worse than the rest of this movie. To call the dimensional measure should give them credit. What little there is, atrophors are starting to, and made much worse by the terrible video and editing. Worst part of this atrocity, though, apart from the plot, should make the effects ... or rather the disturbing lack thereof. There is no space in the guns, no flashpots, and some sound effects exist either stock "guns" sound, or they are produced by mouth (yeah, or read it right). The movie was actually audacious to record a "shh" sound for the elevator doors; I guess he felt he made them more futuristic. This is supposed to be put in the year 2031, after all. This does not explain the sounds he created to the point-fighting scene, however. If it was not bad enough that sound quality is awful (it was just using the microphone that was mounted on the video camera, and it shows), the use of sound stock gun was almost worse than not using any that sounds at all. The sound effects stand out from the rest of the band as a yak drunk into a herd of sheep, and they're just as clumsy. This picture: The bad guy went into an office building to explore his pets. A lady starts to run in fear. He increased his weapon (a usury), and trembled. We hear a sound that is clearly not a U.S.. The woman ran away from camera, and suddenly one hundred packs (only 1) exploded against her (look like she was hit by a paintball), and she fell flat on her face. mind that my description of too much justice in the incompetence of the current sequence. <br /> In another sequence, one is almost- but not quite - making the movie funny enough to look, taking place in a stairwell. The bad guy threw the guy good and the lady he was protecting down the stairs, shaking his plastic weed all the way. You may want to duck; There are bad effects of sound effects flying all over the place. <br /> I suppose Alan DeHerrera can not be closed away for the design of this train wreck, but has been tracking along the way to editing and releasing it. If there is any justice, there's bound to be some karma out and his name on it. You should decide to look at this flow of industrial waste - and I would strongly advise it - be sure to look for the scenes all up almost vagatim from Bladerunner, and the AM radio that doubles as a walkie-talkie. Try not to focus too much on the draw; it will hurt you more if you do. <br /> <br /> 0 stars at 10. And this was generated.
