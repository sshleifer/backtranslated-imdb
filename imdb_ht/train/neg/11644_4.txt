Yeah, I "get" Pasolini and his midfielder, but at the same time I feel that "Decameron" is largely overrated, and more than a bit disturbing. Stunting assumed the "realism" it introduced (fresh crowds, crumbling architecture, etc.) are mooted by the absurd and downright way the characters behave. In pursuit of realism, Pasolini uses many non-actors, but the deer-in-the-eye stars ahead with harmful delivery lines give the whole of a terribly off-kinder head and inconsistency to feel. And frankly - many of the bowels, those who are sick-featured paints are looking at. And the Pasolini "Decameron" is disturbing (at least) because of the casual content and prevalence of homosexuals. Not because I'm prudish or homophobic (I'm not) but because the emphasis on Pasolini on homoerotic images and situation is contrary to the neo-realism, it otherwise fails, so it comes as free and forced. One can almost hear him say "Ooh - I had to stick a beautiful boy, naked at this scene!" Sometimes it seems that Pasolini tries to play homosexual couples in thumbs of criticism, and in other times because he enjoys aspects himself, regardless of what audience he prefer. In 9 or 10 different stories of Pasolini's Decameron hit me as being a Pasolini pacifier as a storyteller, rather than being an aspect of neo-realism. It seems to get bored with every story and thus wrap them up unconvincingly with a little conviction. Even the final passolini line of dialogue in the film, which some people seem to find pithy ("Why create a work of art when dreaming about it is sweeter?") - Me, it just makes me wonder why Pasolini would harassed to make a movie if he felt that way? In my opinion, a better-fabricated film (and with more homosexual contexts) is the "Satyricon" Fellini. It is also full of people who are scarce and absurd, but it succeeds in its rhythm, direction and storytelling. Considering that "Decameron" fails not to be the same element.
