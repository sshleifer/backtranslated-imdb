Throwing in this movie includes some new actors in New Zealander, many of whom I have seen in fabulous roles, but this film is full of a deep shame just to be from the same country as they . The fake American accent is the first indication that things are about to go spectacularly wrong. As another review rather cheating noted that the luxury cruise ship is in fact an old car ferry, decorated with a few of the multi-colored flags stolen from a much used car. Most of the cast appear to be from (large) long run New Zealand's soap Shortland Street. It's as if this movie was dreaming of a Shortland Street dropping Christmas party, resulting in very many kits, and possibly a bit of salmon. Imagine "under siege" meets the "Love Pirate", scene by your local elementary school and directed by a autism and you get the idea. <br /> <br /> If you are an actor, I recommend you see this movie, as a study on how to destroy your observer.
