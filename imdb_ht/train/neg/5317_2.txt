For the first 20 minutes or so (I looked at it on a PS2 so I really had no idea long ago it took) Alienator sets up an interesting site. I do not think I saw a slasher movie with an alien from another planet as the baddie before. However, interest soon turns into unbridled disbelief as you realize the 'alien' is a great woman-body builder in a steel bikini. Yes, Alienator is particularly ridiculous. <br /> Do not think I'm keeping it up. In the world of trauma-terror, ridiculous patience can often be a good sign. However, the blatant sort of quotes it is all the movie really has gone for it. Alienator is funny as hell, but it is also a shambolic suckfest in the highest order. Bulb actors on failed attempts at gravity, capable of engineering in pure cheese dialogue are stumbled upon and incompetent unnerving and the direction fails up even one or two decent set-pieces. Since the finish film you can barely see the original concept of the big tree in the total throttle team pick up on it. <br /> <br /> Add this to the fact that the 'alien' just kill by the vaporization, as opposed to making any 'slaughter' as such and you have a giant pile vibrant of good ideas being left rotten. You will laugh at Alienator, but in it, not with it. If that's your thing then go ahead and check it out.
