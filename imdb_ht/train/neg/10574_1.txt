With the exception of FAMILY, this new season is worse than the season. I can not imagine what they are thinking. As a fan of horror, can tolerate a lot of wars and destructive destinations, but this series worsens with each trip. I can not imagine how discouraging it must be for the actors and crew to go to work every day, work in churn like crap. History! Is this too much to ask? Character! How can we humiliate the fate of any of these stories? If we are not engaged, who cares if they get carved or whatever? Nearly every episode ends with bloodless minds, goes for gross out of any unpleasant trace of revelations or conclusions or explains why we have suffered an hour of bloodletting. Even Dante's efforts in this season had some disturbing sexual violence and run down to a futile conclusion. Ironically, the production values ​​and performance tend to be up to speed, while the content is pronounced crap. I have great expectations for the MAGAZINE VALID VALUES under the STAIRS, but we'll see.
