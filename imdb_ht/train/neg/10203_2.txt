Well, the writing was very sloppy, the ruler was sloppier, and the correction made it worse (at least I hope it was the correction). The act was not bad, but it was not good either. Very beautiful none of the characters was unmatched. At least 45 minutes in this film were wasted time and the other time or so was not used anywhere near its full potential. It was a great idea, but again another wasted good idea went by. It could have ended up in 3 different places but it just kept going to a Hollywood predicting that predicting. and what was not predictable did so seriously that it did not matter. The finish was not worth looking at all. sandra bullock came from his element and should stay away from these kinds of movies. The movie also looks like running. The movie just was not really worth seeing, and I paid for it I would have been very upset. Maybe I was more disappointed because I expected a really good movie and got a bad one. The movie on all was not bad, but I would not reccomend it. I gave her 2 out of 10 b / c I liked the idea very much and I did as a character (just believe, the super spirit). and it also has some pretty cheap way to cover trail holes. It was like trying to cover a volcano with cheap mascara tapes, it was not nice. Anyway, if you see it, wait for the $ 1.50 or video theater, unless you like pretty much every movie you see, then I guess you'll be like this one.
