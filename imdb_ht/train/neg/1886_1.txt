I once promised never walked out of any movie (a personal policy that made me suffer from different types of dreck, like Rambo 3, Baise Moi, Deep Impact) - but Mr. Seidl almost succeeded. Hundstage was a really awful experience. Anyone who sees this movie will think that the Australians are a miserable, bunch of domestic slaves. It shows a world where love and humanity does not exist, a world where people are humiliated only for one reason - they are distracted from their own miserable existence. By choosing a documentary style that is similar to non-professional actors (most of them look like straight from the Australian shock-cartoon fantasy) director Seidl wants to believe that this is real life in Australian (European? West?) Suburbs. The viewer is confronted with rhetoric of sex orgies, violence against women and people with disabilities, madness and degradation. But this is not social criticism. This is just the best trauma without any aesthetic value. Instead you get bad acting, bad movies, bad movie. If anyone needs a movie like this to realize that there is something wrong in our society then this person must have walked in life with eyes. This is critical pseudo-social with a sledge hammer. And it looks down on people in a disgustingly condescending manner. It shows ugly people - this is not the reason why I hate it. But she painted average people in an ugly, mementy manner. And this is why this movie is really jerky.
