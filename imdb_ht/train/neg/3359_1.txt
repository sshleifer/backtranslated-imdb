They are aiming this story! At the end of Nell is all heroic and take over for the team to save all the asses from Hill House and a bunch of people like that! They added heads getting off, wire cutting people faces, and the ceiling turned into a giant hand! What the hell is that over ??? I own and love the original movie, I read the book and I love it! The purpose of the original film and the book is to be great because it scares you much without even showing the ghost. There is no gore. There is no ceiling but. Only the ghost is how ghosts can really kill someone. They can not kill us, they can not throw us into the room or fly a knife into our heads. No. They can only drive us mad. Take away all our sense of security. Nell was a selfish woman. He only wanted good things for himself. Yes, he cares little for the others, but not too much. David Self and John Bont took a crap about this great story! I hate this damn remake!
