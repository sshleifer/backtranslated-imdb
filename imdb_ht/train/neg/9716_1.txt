This is, without doubt, one of the worst films I've ever seen ... <br /> <br /> The plot is so full of holes, the story is such a bad rendezvous in a bad suspicion film The actors sound like being read directly to the manuscript for the first time. Worst of all is Steve Guttenberg. He plays his character as he was in the "Police Academy" - even foddering the dig - and that's not suited for a man who leads to what would be a thriller. <br /> It's really hard to believe that Hanson would make the "confidential" ten years later ... <br /> <br /> Avoid this as the epidemic ...
