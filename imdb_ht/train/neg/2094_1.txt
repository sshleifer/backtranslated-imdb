I had to endure young children, early childhood and family conflicts for almost all of the show. I really do not care about high school fretting girls on their relationships. I spent my time in Hell dealing with these issues and I'm not worried about fictional teenagers going through the "lite" version of the horrors I endured. I want science fiction. That's the only reason I'm here. There was a few seconds of science fiction late in the show. We finally see a protective Cylon. It was good but with one problem. Red eye-dot would close on an object of interest. We all know that Eyedots Cylon always scans back and forth, giving the car a map of the world. The red eye-dot has never stopped moving back and forth. <br /> I really hope this writer to fix this abuse before the second episode.
