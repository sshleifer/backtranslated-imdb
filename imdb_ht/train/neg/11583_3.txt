This film introduces quite an array of characters and their relationships in the first half hour or so. None of them generate any interest or positive response. I waited for the intrigue to begin, hoping things would get better and ended up sticking around until the bitter end, but there was no reward for doing this. <br /> <br /> If you want an overview, look elsewhere. For me the action is not worth recalling. Not that the story was that bad, I guess you might say I had some trouble with the script - Yes. I thought it stunk. A look at credit will show you that there is a very strong cast here, use no profit. Most of the old advantages in this film flicker make good work; Of the actors I did not see much of them before I especially loved Deborah Kara Unger. That's all I can find good to say about this picture.
