The director stated clearly that this movie idea and conspiracy are totally original .... however, as those who read it 'funny dunk', we can clearly see the characters are very similar and even some jokes ... <A The other notes are Jay Chow himself not known Kung Fu, he just will not impress anyone if he tries to act as he can, many today can see the differences. Luckily the movie does not include many of Kung Fu fights and many are enchanted by stunners with visual effects ... <br /> I think Jay is still a pain to look, especially when almost everyone else in the movie is so much better. The only reason I think why Jay is the main actor is simply for his popularity. Despite how hard I would want to stop anyone from watching this make this "original" movie getting what it should not have, it has become one of the best budget films in China for this year.
