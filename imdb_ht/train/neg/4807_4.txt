"Hug" has no ordinary action flick. It's the bad thing to be ordinary. One man walks toward another with a blazing machine gun. The other man fires one round and nails the man with the fiery fire power without much as a nick from the hail of lead rain down on it. Guess which one is the good guy. Duh. These are "ambushes" in and through. Not a good action cops, not a good drama, not a good movie, "ambush" fails on all levels and dropping it into B-movie veterans mechanically goes to the motions almost as if they know they're making a real loser. Do not recommend anyone. <br /> <br />
