They took this by accident on a t.v. which shows - and can hardly believe how awful the terrible experience at all was. By comparison, the original "A man named horse" was spell-binding because he was making an interest one at a time. But this piece of nonsense - my weakening word. It was bad enough to have some kind of "story" featuring all the impact of a wet cake of bread, but this was mistaken by the obvious lack of subtitle at all times when the so-called "Sioux" spoke. For good reason, could not the filmmakers found enough North American Americans who were also actors and pre-actors to perform as "Indian" in this farrago instead of the imposters actually used? I also found it quite nasty watching Richard Harris cavorting all around the province of the obvious behavior of the director standing just behind camera, telling him to run and jump from pointless point to Pointless point B just to make up foot movie and minute. Absolutely terrible in all respects!
