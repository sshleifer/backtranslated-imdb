STUDIO 666 (aka push in the UK) is another sub-parody slasher that has the appearance of a straight-to-DVD movie. <br /> <br /> Also many of the straight-to-DVD movies are fast-paced or hilarious impulses in this bad-to-good sense, STUDIO 666 is a plain failure. <br /> <br /> At the time of writing, each comment on the first page includes a negative rating and a negative review. Each of these people has hit the nail on the head. <br /> <br /> The people (at the time of writing) who wrote comments with a rating of 10 out of 10 should not be taken seriously. Obviously they have seen some slasher movies and have an even more limited understanding of horror. <br /> Only really positive point I can make on this movie is that it makes far far more than CHOKE tickets and one of them is very blatantly bleeding movies that I do not want to worry about my worst enemy! <br /> <br /> The plot of this movie has to be done hundreds, if not thousands of times. The movie only has a slight twist (and one that is seriously occupied) in the usual expectations. A depressed singer committed suicide. Soon after, his spirit returns to possess one of his surviving friends. This is said owned friend goes on a killing spree. The rest of the plot really is too scarce up. You'll just have to see it for yourself, giving your interest not yet to the point of extinction of course. Acting in the movie is very poor for the most part. The actress who played Dora was an exception to this. Her character was always interesting and seductive when she was on the screen. It helps eliminate the movie above their contemporary efforts. Unfortunately, some of the lines have been said to have been badly written in putting it mildly and thus preventing it from saving the movie. <br /> <br /> The direction was equally poor. The villains did not seem to be bitternessful, each killing was totally devoid of suspicion or tension, the non-existent atmosphere and the camera-work was extremely basic. Some of the special effects (if you can call them) remind me of the TV series, GOSI STORY. Unfortunately for the producers of this movie, GHOST STORIES was intelligence writing scripts, credible performance and made superb use of camera angles. Perhaps if the producers were watching TV series well, they would have collected some more techniques that could save this excuse for a movie! The music is completely reckless to the tune of the movie. It's just rock music and not the best examples of this type either. Do not get me started on this horrible song playing at the start! Some aspects of the film, particularly dialogue, are unintentionally funny. Unfortunately, they are not funny enough to move the movie (or you should go down) at this bad-it-good level. <br /> <br /> In general, STUDIO 666 is a mound mediocre slasher and very little remarkable aspect. I recommend this only to those who are fond of straight-to-DVD movies and have a desire to see each single slasher made.
