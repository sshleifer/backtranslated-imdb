As I work in a video store, I find it to be my solemn duty to talk about the worst movies I've ever seen, and to warn my friends and co-workers in it. During one day of particularly warming debate in what's the worst movie, my friend dared to watch B.T.K. Killer, even stating that if I could watch the entire movie and always claim choice before I was the worst movie ever, then it would look it. I'm losing. I believe that even I made videos much better than this in high school, and that was hardly great in a genius. This film not only lacked in what seemed to be output value (it seems he was shot on a bad camcorder, although it is amazingly clear), but also in acting (wooden, hollow, and pathetic by scratching surface there) as well as just generally bad movie center. I can recall a scene where I heard about breaking down, suddenly, I was reminded of some bad high school plays (I know that I'm high school reference too often here, but this movie seemed pretty juvenile) both in terms of series , which seemed too too frail, but also as if people were reading the lines out of the script, not fully ensuring that what was actually going on. My review does not do justice to this movie, because I can not describe how unlucky time I spent watching this. It's almost ironic that I'm doing a tricky job describing a tacky excuse for a movie.
