Even though this was a made-to-TV production, there's absolutely no excuse for the results under rock rocks in the finished product. This film has a budget and has a depot, so if you're going to make a movie about a true life story, and actually put the "true story" to the title, there should not be some effort put forward try and capture some realism? First of all, this film is absorbed. These actors are part of daylight soap, or movie cinema all these ridiculous, and not in a gangster / real criminal history. Everything about them, from the looks of the manners, just shouted through the 90's-shopping-center-old-stone-eared generation. What about the script? Two words describe it - stupid and insulting, and yet it's way too 90ish to sound. I do not think the real Clyde Barrow has ever said the words "I'm outta here." It's as if a bunch of "New Kids on the Block" fans got together and decided to make a really "kneeling flashlight" on Bonnie and Clyde, you know, one that should totally dress with Rockin '. Well, this file does not even rank on the Rockin Rock clothing. All that can be wrong with any kind of movie here, from the casting and acting in the correction and music. Everything is one very bad thing .... and it empowers that the parties responsible for this arthritic turkey had the nerve to set the "true story" of the title. It certainly does not tell the story, but even worse, it does not even remotely entertained as a popcorn movie that accepts its own theme. As I stated in my title, it's simply terrible beyond words, on every imaginable level. Believe me, or look at your own risk.
