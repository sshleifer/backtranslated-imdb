I was hoping a documentary focused on tobacco industry in North Carolina. Instead I watched a man who hated the fact that his great grandfather lost his tobacco empire to the Duke Duke. And then went on and off. If Mr. McElwee's family was stronger than the officials, I doubt that Mr. McElwee would have no problems with the number of deaths caused by tobacco-related illness. I grew up near the area where family McElwee started to read tobacco business; I expect more than McEwee's continuous focus on her family. I have learned a lot about tobacco stories in NC economies and the state's economy division by most tobacco regulations. The countless references to the movie "Bright Sheets" are out of place - so what if Gary Cooper played Mr. McElwee's grandfather? Does the viewer have any understanding of the role of Tobacco in the North Carolina economy by showing off old movie clips in a fictional manure? I did not.
