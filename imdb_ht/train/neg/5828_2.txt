I could not agree more with another review that mentioned Jodorowsky. Barney seems to be boring and uninspired "content-wise". It can produce candy eyes (and I love candy), but its pretense and fundamental artistic skills just diminish the joy. I'm scared that many people do not distinguish the same (but really only on the surface) work in Jodorowsky or even more linear movie-makers such as Tarkovski or Kubrick (I love 2001 Odyssey and never been bored at the ending scenes .. .) This type of art as M. Barney makes adding confusion and spending to the viewers who might otherwise begin to appreciate experimental movies. Typical empty post-modern "conceptual" art. And check its interviews. I just do not buy it, sorry. So boring. <br /> I was never bored to see Alejandro Jodorowsky's movie, while Restriction 9 was a complete deception. Especially while offering the possibilities to be something, actually saying something in a non-linear orthodox way (such as the beginning and the great dance choreography and preparation for the ship to sail out. "Meeting" boat on the sea. The idea of ​​pooping as a valuable object (if it was poop.) These are "various shades" ... All could build a huge surreal film with some content.But it was not .. These anodes Horrible scenes of dressing up with fake ceremonies ... How prosperous and fake and philosophical firefighting, but empty can it find? <br /> I have some picturesque scenery, but the movie all became so boring and pretentious completely empty and fake that he made me .. I like to slow down movie cinema, but this was just boring in some scenes - because it was firefighting and fake - so I was just forced to witness extending the stage of artistic futility ... <br /> This kind of cinema just kills the art and spiri t in my look. <br /> I want more Jodorowsky!
