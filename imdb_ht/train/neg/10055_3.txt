I grew up in the 'devil II' theater version ("S2T") and as a kid, I loved it more than Part I since not only was he more Superman and three Superman bandits, start off with a bang? ? Best Clark Kent in superman transformation and rescue scene. The children did not look impatiently wait for Superman to appear on the screen, as in Part I. Now, as an adult, I can see how the warriors have fallen and S2T (See my review.) I've always been heard about back-stories about how to prematurely and unfairly shot the original director, Richard Donner from Part II. (It must have been a rarity back then films of cinema separated together, now it's common: 'Back in the Future' and 'Matrix' 2 & 3 for example.) Unfortunately, after finally seeing Richard Donner Cut (or, S2RD ") I still can not fully recommend it.Gone, the great Superman change scene, all Paris's rescue, as was the wonderful reminder of my part of the opening of the S2T. wrote the words "Previously about Superman" in S2RD. The special effects were not great at either Part I or S2T, but S2RD, were mostly outright scam ?? like Lois dropped out of the Planet window window day I'm going to admit, some new scenes worked and some were taken to welcome departures, like any scene of "honeymoon." Overall, if you grew up on S2T as I did, and loved it as a child ?? not nitpicking as I do as an adult, you should absolutely see S2RD as it's almost a brand new child experience and dozens of new scenes. oiler) Unfortunately, the worst change comes last: go was also kissing in unusual amnesia in S2T replacing with the exact same finish as 'I.' This is not just a lazy, unoriginal copout, it does not make sense of why Clark would be back in that diner, if these events never happen. And will he continue to "return time" for every confrontation?
