Ghost Crap. This was the worst movie I've seen in a long time. All performances are good, but no draws. Really! No plot! A bunch of clowns talk about this and that and in your movie. Ug ... Robert Duvall's character is agile and keeps asking people the same Qestions on and over. This earned him the same answers over and over. I'm pretty sure that this movie has got up to a six because people think they would like it. Good performances and famous and well-known actors, but the actual work is a steamy turdy. Well, maybe that's a bit trumpet since steam rising from a cool pile sounds a little like something happening and in this movie there is no HAPPENS! Bag
