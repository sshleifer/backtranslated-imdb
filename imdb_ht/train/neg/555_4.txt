The movie is very confusing and funny. The plot is awful ... but on the other side the act is very good, with a few good talking and annuities. Sharon Stone is OK this time ... not even half as good as the original idea. Kill people are not as gory as one of the first night, which is a shame. It's not everyone unpleasant everyone says it is though. The sex is very graphic at times while others are clear it is fake (they are completely dressed). The script weakens most of the time, but the scenes and plenary and arguments between Dr.Glass and Washburn are highlighting. The conspiracy twists a few times, but the finish is terrible. The tension is still constant and a great dollop of 'Oh my God!'. The sequels kick their brilliantly directed, and shots and camera angles are impressive and bring a bit of class to an otherwise sensational feel-feeling. Sharon stone is a bit old for this too. The bits where we see her breasts were, in the first one, have fun. This time around, they are too serious to describe. The self films are rather average, but it's worth a go. Mostly because the movie deserves some good buzz ... and the opening sequence being a highlight. Not to be critical, but if you liked the first one - leave this one. Do not break the run. You will be pleased to leave this stone shining.
