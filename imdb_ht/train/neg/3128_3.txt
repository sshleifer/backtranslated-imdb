... in this horrible movie! There are many things that are wrong with this movie, acting, writing, direction, editing, etc. It's amazing that something got up from the top and proved himself to be the sheer worst. The music! I noted that the movie has two composers listed. This must be the reason why every single frame has music, in the absolute worst "D" movie drivel style. They never heard of the expression "less is more". It was painful to listen, I had to sound the sound every time there was no dialogue, not the dialogue was that good. You have to feel sorry for Robert Wagner and Tom Bosley, I'm sure they did not see the role of this in the sunset in their careers. Watch it at your own risk.
