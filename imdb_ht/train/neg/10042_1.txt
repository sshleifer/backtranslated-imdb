As a movie long-awaited .. But she was ashamed of my friends who went to see the movie in the first day. From the trailers it looked like a movie movie, but it turned out to be there an out & out comedy (a bad comedy). But one thing deserving appreciation is the actor by these professional actors, being part of the movie very well. Good act, but I do not think that can save the movie .. India has been shot very well. Kerala, Rajasthan, (Ladakh?) All were saturated with colors, well. But the road was the intrinsic beauty of the places I was shooting to want to find out exactly where the places were and when I was able to go there ;-) <br /> <br /> Action sequences were shot very Chabili, no one can do out heads & tails in the exhibition, they used Akki (akshay kumar) very well, but could've done much better .. The worst I've seen in the latest cinema (The 90's movies had the best animation scenes I guess (the first scene where the car crashes in 'flying should be the best word' way in the lake). mentioned almost every 20 to 30 min, just to ensure that audiences do not forget to name my movie guess.
