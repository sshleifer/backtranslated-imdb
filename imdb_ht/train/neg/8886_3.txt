Not very impressed. It's hard to offer any degradation to this movie, because there is almost no development of the draw. All become clear in the first ten minutes and out there on it as watching dry paintings. The act looks very poor as well, and reminds me of the old black and white Maoist epoch films featuring occasionally on Chinese TV Day. Although this hard to say and the role of female, Yuwen, as the story seems only to require her to walk around like a wooden mannequin. She reminds me of Gong Li Manic who somehow got a reputation as a good actress in the West to have a scowl on her face all the time. Tian Zhuangzhuang's film 'Blue Kite' was a far better movie. But do not be fooled by the fact that Springtime in a small town was set at the end of the '40s. Unlike Blue Kite, the fact that this movie set at a time of change is irrelevant to the plot itself, the ruins of the city seem to be nothing more than a panoramic set. <br /> I wonder whether Tian Zhuangzhuang is simply trying to rise on the Chinese film popularity of the West and appeals to a foreign audience who can not tell the difference between a movie that is 'pretty' 'profound' or 'hypnosis' and one that is simply tedious and inappropriate. <br /> If any movie fits the description of 'overrated,' this is it. I see no reason here to stop worrying about the state of the Chinese film industry.
