This film essentially deals with the Inspector The Archer-nemesis gadget doctor who has returned after many years in the now-peaceful city of Metropolis. The Planet Claw is gadget paper once and for everyone using a new "crimefighter" to help destroy the popularity of the gadget. Unfortunately the movie failed miserably, the series was great, but it was revived almost 20 years later with tragic outcomes. Without the voice of Don Adams as his Gadget Inspector it just does not cut it anymore; Dr Claw is not only visually less scary, but sounds more like a wrestler and a cold, than the original self-intimidation. This award is a movie of a child, but the plot is so painfully weak (the heavenly forgiveness I mentioned the animation) that it pales in comparison to the original set. One has decided to update Penny as well as bringing her two decades up to speed, and now has some style quasi-punk rebels and does not play half the role that she did in the TV series. Gadgetmobile talks, as well as including a drawn angle that focuses on talking about cars. Perhaps I'm just a kid who likes the show that grew up jaded, but I thought that the live-action version was more painful than I could carry but now they went with this spring filled Watering-down in the quality TV series on us. It's more than I can take.
