This film is very boring, she tells a story of a female girl station owner and her life. There's nothing interesting ever happens. The director really "holds it real" and feels just like a camera after a woman around as she lives her life. I had to watch another film by this director for a class, others were not like boring. This movie has also looked for an assignment ... it's best to be worth the brilliance and a good grade !! In general, unless necessary, do not watch the movie. But not other movie discounts by this director, because they are not as bad ... and do not discount other films about Africa, they are usually good, especially when done by a Western director.
