Serious black Serendipite on a cosmetic salespeople, with odd links at Elvis Presley, runs in a sea of ​​Elvis impersonators while speaking at the Nevada Convention ... and accidentally kills each one of them in his own fault. Kim Basinger, an always-attracted actress of considerable merit, loves to choose the original movies to play, but this scenario scenario (not Mitchell Ganem and Adam-Michael Garber) does not have a good humor iota. Stereotypes and low-gays are not meant to be the thing of classical comedy, but even on a shambling, shameful level, the picture is tiny and sloppy. If you look, see if you can count how many unusual shots have in Basinger behind the wheel of Cadillac pink, but always in the same position with a look that does not plussed on her face. Hopefully both her and Elvis were well paid. NO STARS from ****
