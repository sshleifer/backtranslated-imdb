Much has been done in Rohmer's use of digital technology in the 'complete' background. Sometimes it works fine, where Grace and her maid maids come from far to King's execution is particularly striking. At other times it gives the film a weird amateur look, resembling a home video. However, big failing is that the absolute artifact of the highlighted scenes creates an alienating effect of the viewer. We know that what we are watching is not real so how can we feel for the characters? They must be frank, I did not care for all that had happened to the Lady or the Duke. <br /> <br /> Other major failures, I'm sorry to say, is the performance of Lucy Russell in the leading role. It is in virtually every scene and the success or otherwise of the movie rests on its performance. OK he speaks a foreign language but can not express real emotions. His emotions at the scene where he recounts Mme from his friend Meyler (an excellent performance by Helena Dubiel's debut) seeing the head on a pole that caused some nasty laughs at the audience. Also, look her hands when it expresses emotions! <br /> All in all a very disappointing movie, particularly giving the reviews positive on this site.
