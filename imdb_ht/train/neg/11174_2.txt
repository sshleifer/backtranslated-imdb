Al Pacino? Kim Basinger? Tea Leoni? Ryan O'Neal? Richard Schiff? My lips were watering. I dropped everything to watch this movie on cable. 30 minutes at I had problems stay awake. 60 minutes and I hit the record button and dropped to sleep. Finish it in the morning. Should not be bothered. What a waste of a great cast with an idea that could be an interesting story of a "Day of Life ..." Heal your insomnia if you have it and watch this movie. I guarantee you at least an hour and a half of uninterrupted sleep. Terrible dialogue. Continue non-existent. Case work can be done with a hand held Super 8 and look better. <br /> <br /> This movie was a total disaster.
