This was a disappointing movie. Considering the material --- the life of the host is still good for a laugh --- and the stars, this movie should be a downward laugh. It was worth a couple of chuckles, at best. Steve Martin has been much funnier than this and it appears that Dan Ackroyd should stick to dramatic roles, where he might follow Robin Williams' lead and one day win an Oscar.
