My wife and I found this movie to be very satisfying. While the plot keeps you interested and busy asking just what is going on, when you leave the theater, there are just too many loose ends that make no sense at all. (SPOILERS AHEAD) Christopher Plummer, enormously rich head of a NY bank has a secret hidden secret. Profits of WW II deals with the Nazis and hid robbers stolen from Jews and kept the evidence (including diamonds and documents with the Nazi swazi) in a security deposit box at his bank. Why? If he wants this never to be revealed, why he does not burn and destroy the documents years ago? And the Diamonds? Obviously, it does not need them - why keep them rather than cast them? How do the bank robbers find her secrets? How did Zero know about this # 232 warranty? Ace detective Denzel Washington also discovered bank records show SD Boxes No 231 and 233, but no # 232. Curious. He meticulously found time to somehow conduct a tedious search of bank records to stretch this curious fact. While dealing with a red hot hostage situation and bank robbers threatening to begin executing for a while. Wow! Talk to super powers for a detective. <br /> <br /> The bank robbers left behind millions of dollars in loose money in the vault were opened. Only those belonging to SD Box # 232, officially for the purpose of blackmailing the president bank. This challenged any rational attempt in a logical explanation for that movie painted as a criminal master, or for henchmen with lesser brain. <br /> <br /> Jodie Foster, using his political connection with the Mayor of NYC, enters the bank which is under the control of the bank robbers while maintaining many hostages. He offered the bank robber a deal to buy back the documents he now has at hand, but he is not interested. So what's the point (if any?). My wife was offended by the arrogance of all players, Christopher Plummer (Bank President), Denzel Washington (ace detective), and Jodie Foster, cracking problem shooter for high-power. <br /> <br /> Last movie by Jodie Foster I saw, "Flight Plan", was also riddled with holes that had made no sense at all. I thought I liked Jodie Foster, but I'll probably avoid her future movie. <br /> <br /> Now my problem is that I can rarely convince my wife to go to the movies. I can not agree with him on this one ... "A WAST of money, and a waste of time." Be cautious. A well-crafted film, fine actors, written script writings.
