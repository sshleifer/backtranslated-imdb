The TV guide called this movie a mystery. What is my mystery is how is it possible that a culture that can produce complicated music and classical complexes with brilliant mathematicians can not produce a single movie that would climb above the level of this movie's junk so perfectly represent. This is Bollywood's best / worst, I honestly can not tell the difference. Nauseatingly sweet, kitschy clicks on each level, story-line, situation, dialogue, music and choreography. To put it down, you must have a rest to enjoy it. I looked at her to satisfy my cultural curiosity, but there were times when I had to walk away from her because I could not take her any more. The only quality of ax in the movie is the exquisite beauty of the leading actresses. <br /> <br />
