This oddity of the new DORIS DAY collection does not really need to be included as it is only in the movie for less than 30 minutes. What he does however, is bright when he's on the screen. More near the movie is just an excuse to show some Warner deals in the day. JANCIE RULE shows promise and is a shame he did not become a big star. RUTH ROMAN manages the role of "go-getter" with aplomb. Best if this was in color. Travis Air Force forces base and some projection work well. What is best about the movie are some wonderful musical instruments. If you enjoyed your THANK LIKE STARS and Hollywood chat you will like this one.
