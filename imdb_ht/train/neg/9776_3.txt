I do not know much about film-making, but good movies have to say some sort of a story ... your characters have to start and complete their journey. At last from Brooklyn they can, but not in any way satisfy, and I do not mean a happy ending, just any ending. <br /> <br /> Last From Brooklyn, set in 1952 Brooklyn during a very brutal strike strike, sets out a number of wireless storytelling movements. Most involve some of the most unlikeable characters ever walked through a movie screen. But Last Last in Brooklyn failed to bring these stories into any conclusion ... he left some of them hanging with no finishing, or the explosion in some rare stratosphere for an end to "artistic". at points, and include crowds. <br /> A sad transvestite character (an important character in the movie), is hit by a car and killing. And that's it for him in the movie .... he went for good, erased from everyone's memory .. by reaction of his friends, enemies, lovers .... nothing. <br /> In another stupid thread, clueless, and secretly gay leader strike, was rejected by his gay lover, and found out by the neighborhood thugs, becoming stomped by the thugs. The scene close to the beat shows the streets of Brooklyn, and the streetlights are very, very similar to those in the Nazi death camps ... with the scene of shooter over and over and over ... and the camera pans down in the body of the leader, and was crucified ..... ppppuuuulllleeeeeez. And of course, be it too ... brain heura ... go away. <br /> <br /> Bottom line .... no matter what the revikers originally said in 1989 on this movie ... This movie is a piece of depression of deposits. Avoid it. But if you do not have to be warned, it really deserves an NC-17 rating for the massive physical, emotional and sexual impairment rates ... do not even let the teens look.
