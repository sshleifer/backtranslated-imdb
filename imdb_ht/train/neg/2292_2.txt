First of all, I must admit Batman: The animated series is the best beats series by far. We watched it when it was used to be on TV. I did not realize that there was a four season. Actually did not have. BTAS finished season 3, and it should stop there. <br /> <br /> Why were chaos and a good thing. Catwoman and Ivy Poison now have to face terrible gray. The joker looks fearsome, it seems that each time to review its appearance it looks more and more creepier. It does not seem to have students anymore, and now it does not even look at human remotely (although it is). <br /> <br /> Bruce Wayne is voiced by Kevin Conroy who makes Batman the best. Although it now looks superman. There is nothing that sets him apart because they both look the same, Bruce Wayne now has blue eyes. <br /> <br /> Night wings really need a couple, please! Alfred just has students out of sight, looks more like a character from the 80's. I watched three episodes from Disc 1 in the series and I already found that this version is more violent and graphic (there's blood to every episode). <br /> If you're a fan of Batman: the animated series, no season 4 batmanas. They just include this series as season 4 for marketability. If they just drop it as the new Batman adventures I do not think many people might buy it. <br /> <br /> Save yourself the deception and bat in season 1-3.
