Zodiac assassins. 1 out of 10. Worst acts ever. Not really worst ever. David Hess (Last House on the Left .. No one of the sixties .. Rent it really good) is the worst of the bunch (Pretty stiff competition but it is amazingly god-awful.) One might be strongly pressed for Find a home theater participant with the presence of this awkward camera. The movie actually screeches into a stunning painful stand when it is on the screen. <br /> <br /> It's not that the movie actually has any kind of royalty for Mr. Hess Crush. It is filmed with a home movie camera and does not seem to be a very old one complete and mike attractive boom. No post production either. Come on there has been some shovelware a five year old computer could use that would be cleaning this picture. Dispose of bad stock photos in the autopsy and insurance companies and this is one visually aiming up picture. The autopsy photographs interjected the way Italians cannibal films interrupted the creatures of animal creatures-terrible animal life. And the navy foot is supposed to have some anti war declarations (Cause we know all the manic of the killer joining the navy) What's in the world is the lion's door to divulge this waste? It would embarrass the Troma. The plot is about the killer zodiac (Last seen in Harry's room .. Not one of the sixties .. Rent it really good) Somebody gets shot in the stomach in LA and cops to assume the killer Zodiac is back? Uh-huh. What can you expect from a movie that does not know that DSM IV is a book by a psychiatric disorder and where the relationship of younger boys is similar to a congressional and congressional page? Yeah haircuts and production values ​​meet a Nambla snowboard. My sign.
