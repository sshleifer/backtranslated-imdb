This has to be some of the worst directions I've seen. The lock can be a very powerful shot, but when each scene consists of anything but close-ups, it loses its full impact. Tony Scott has some very beautiful scenery to work with, backdrop in Mexico, the cantinas, the beautiful estate where Anthony Quinn lives, and the costner dust villages cost off on his travels for revenge. Unfortunately, we only catch rapidly in those places before the camera cut off a picture of a giant, giant head. Even the transition scenes where Costner is driving alone through Mexico quickly cut off a pre-up. <br /> <br /> The note is over-dramatic and persistent, dictating all the emotions we should feel. The story itself should be very busy. Among other things, too many people pop up from nowhere to help Costner along - it's just writing bad. <br /> It's a scenario storyline storyline, but many others have taken the same quote and doing things outstandingly with it. Costner's No Way Out had a slightly simplistic scenario, but it was a better movie. <br /> <br /> The finish was completely antiviral and suffers from the most melodramatic notes of the movie. This film will never be great, but if we've seen more in Mexico and less of this giant head this movie might be watchful.
