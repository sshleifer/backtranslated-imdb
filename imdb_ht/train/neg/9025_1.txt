Sorry - this movie is just a cheap TV-production. I have seen many promotional materials and I hope a professional film like "Stormriders" - what I presented was a low-budget film like "XENA" or "Hercules" on TV. No atmosphere, very boring, more then worsen-scene scenes. There are some good ideas - no more. I hope I'll get the chance to make a movie like this and then I show how to make such a movie <br /> <br /> My ASIAN-Tips: "MUSA - WAR", "STORMRIDERS "," SHAOLIN SOCCER "," BATTLE ROYAL "," VERSUS ", etc. <br /> <br /> Sorry for my bad english!
