"They are among us" is poor science fiction at best. Mediocre acts bog down this movie. The plots are very numerous. Aliens who somehow came to earth on a meteor and were hiding among us for over 100 years, but needing a plastic surgeon to make them appear human. In the form of foreigners they supposedly have echo-skeletons (which are why they need plastic surgery) but when you see them they have teeth and nails. Father's heroine "disappeared" after Blue Book Project closed, but was supposedly a F-16 pilot. And over and over. If you want to see an alien movie invasion, select "Invasion of the Snatchers of Body", and see how it does right.
