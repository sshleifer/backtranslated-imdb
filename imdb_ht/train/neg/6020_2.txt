I love end-of-day movies. I love b-cinema. I was hoping I would like this movie. <br /> I could ignore the effects of the music, often on the pencil-induced lines. I was able to ignore the events unreasonably, and the fact that the movie is still dependent on old decks machina is unkind, given the matter. I could ignore the fact that people who struggle hunger and try to reach peace in the world are the bad guys. None of these kill the movie. What to kill this movie is that it's just simple boring. Nothing happens actually; Nearly all the scenes of the film are designed to push the moral film creators on viewers, at the price of actually having a coherent story, or any kind of suspense. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a fun b-movie, look elsewhere. This movie is just boring.
