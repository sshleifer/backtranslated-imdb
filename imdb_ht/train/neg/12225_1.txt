My personal vision of hell being locked in a room without the ability to close my eyes or block my ears and have this movie play for eternity on every surface available in that room. The whole notion that Streisand plays a boy / person only begins to scratch the surface of how ridiculous a quote this movie is. One of the most important things in watching any movie is the concept of "unwanted suspicion". . . it is impossible to do this in this movie.
