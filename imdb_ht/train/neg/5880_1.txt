The movie begins slowly when we arrived at the movie we thought it looked good but after about 5 min we were all bored out of our minds and wondered what kind of movie we came to seeing, I do not like this movie and not would recommend it to anyone, the best part of the night was the alarm and light back on because the project broke because we thought we could all go home. This has to be one of the worst films I've ever seen we've all been bored from or spiritually and most of the people in the cinema actually ranged from the doors to the end because it was so much waste. I'm surprised that no one has walked out earlier than that. if you go and see it sure something something keeps you busy, better still do not go and see it at all.
