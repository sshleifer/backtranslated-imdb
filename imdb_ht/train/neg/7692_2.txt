There are a couple of comments before here that are outlined on this flick of abundance in the whole glimpse - and agree completely, both with regard to the characters and the dialogue. <br /> I would read about Elizabeth Berkly's terrible performance of the equally-awful "Showgirls", which I never saw - and her performance here, while not terrible, is barely up to the standards of faster fare for life. There was not a hint of depth character, but then there probably would not be. If so, it would put the film completely out-of-balance, since not a hint of charisma or charisma - not a track - to any character, scene, or painting. The principal filed the first complaint after her boyfriend kissed her in the room. Her husband's reaction and advice were similarly (Forrest Gump, attacking Jenny's companion in his car to give a more realistic, intelligent, and hell, he was mentally-challenged). (The rediscovery excuse) the father of the student lying actually doing something probably deserves to praise his performance: it was both scoffing and quite annoying at the same time, no feat meant. His lawyer was more of a sensitive Nerd, also unknown to the profession. <br /> <br /> Finally (and honestly, I rather enjoyed this part), the police were like a collection of sensitive oafs that you would rather rely on Barney Fife, without Andy, occupying all the police and investigations in your community. I know that most real ones like Cops fall a little bit of sharpness, intelligence and sympathy levels that appear by most characters on the series "Law and Order", and the love - but DOL at this level seems to have a chatting "Lifetime" <br /> <br /> Finally, I found a kind of "story of a story" passion and Josh's caution in being the "victim" of his teacher. This scripted performance in the story was even worse than its general performance in the main story. This was something of an achievement, as going from "F" to "F-minus." <br /> This lethal situation should have been solved - in real life - in about 15 minutes, after a realistic meeting between teachers and school authorities, with involved partners. But then that would have prevented the drama compelling drama and left an empty movie an hour in the camera. <br /> But the writer (s) here, prove and end up, they might do even worse. When the situation was finally "resolved" and "right", it was accomplished in almost 45 seconds, without any indication of what measures could come to any "real-world" against the perpetrator or parent, or if they might have been able to find some sort of way toward redemption. <br /> <br /> This one in a * presentation; second "*" because it has some mild "passion."
