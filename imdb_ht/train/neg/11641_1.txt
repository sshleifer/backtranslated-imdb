Although I'm generally an opponent of the well-designed movie, I do not limit myself to film that escapes these boundaries, and most often than not I enjoy and admire the movie that successfully "breaks the rules." And it is true that the director of Pasolini breaks the rules of establishing cinema. But it is also my opinion that it does not break them successfully or at any real point. <br /> <br /> Pasolini's work is visually jarring, but this is less a matter of what's actually on the screen than how it is filmed, and the fragrance of his film seems less a matter of artistic choice than the result of amateur movies. This is true of DECAMERON. Pasolini often preferred non-actors, and while many directors did this with remarkable results, under the direction of Pasolini non-actors tend to remain non-actors. This is also true of DECAMERON. Pasolini often includes images that are traumatized, offensive, or otherwise disconcerting the audience. These elements can often be used with thrilling effects, but from the Pasolini these elements rarely seem to actually contribute anything to the movie. This is also true of DECAMERON. <br /> I've been given to understand that many people love, even admire Pasolini's movie. Even so, I never actually met any of them, and I could never read something about Pasolini or his work that made the reasons for likinks or admiration I understand. Judging him from his work alone, I am of the opinion that he was essentially an amateur director who did not "break the rules" many by choice as not lack of competence - and who was initially applauded by their intelligence in his day for "Existence conviction," thereby simply confirming him in bad habits as a maker film. I find work tireless, unimpressive, and firefighting. And this, too, is true of DECAMERON. It is also, sadly, true of virtually every film Pasolini it was my misfortune to keep.
