My wife and I rented this movie because some people drew parallels between him and "Office Space". Blockbuster and IMDB even won it as a "recommended" selection if you liked "Office Space". Now I've seen Space Bureau probably 15 or 20 times. I love it. It's probably one of my favorite movies. Witty, funny, and featuring characters that remind me of those I worked with over the years. "Haiku Tunnel" is similar to "Office space" in that they are both films. That's where the similarity ends. We sit down in the first 50 minutes of HT, giving it the benefit of doubt, hope, nay, * prayer * that it would get better. It was not. We could not take it again, and stopped the tape. Thank God it was a free rental. I would have been p *** if we would actually pay for it. We should reimburse to have to sit in it. Now, since we have not seen in the end, maybe it miraculously comes along with redeeming himself. I doubt it. <br /> <br /> Haiku tunnel is so bad it is hard to believe that it has ever been produced. The film is SO unfunny it's painful. Just send friggin letters already !!! The situation is asinine. Jokes are awful. We got as far as the "printer did not work" scene and stopped. We could not take it anymore. This film is an EMBARRASMENT for Josh Kornbluth. <br /> <br /> If you're a fan of space space ...... do not waste your time with this turdock. 0/10
