It seems that Salvatores could not decide what to do with this movie: some of it is a very weak comedy (and I say very, very weak), some of it is an attempt to explore the relationship between the main characters . Both things have been tried in psychological stairs, but in this case the film can not keep things together, due to poor, superficial scripting, bad acting with too much black, too dull sinogram. I would say that Salvatores gave his best to other genres and other settings, where he was free to look at the characters without having to think about the plot. On the whole, a B-movie, hardly worth your money ... Vote: 4/10
