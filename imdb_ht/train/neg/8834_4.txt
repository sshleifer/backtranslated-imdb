there was some truth about this movie. I remember a story reported from 15 to 20 years ago at 4 fishermen found a body in the water and was chosen not to report it until their journey ended. I also remember being charged with interfering with a corpse (or some of these charges). I'm not sure if he's in Australia. The outside viewers in Australia must think that we are living in a country full of violent and serious killings. Wolf Creek and this movie would encourage this perception. The film itself reminds me of a simple plan. But as well as being one of the best Australian films ever, as someone claimed, I can not be generous. Put it in this way, I would not bother watching it again.
