AntiTrust could be a great car for Rachael Leigh Cook, but the director cuts out her best stage. At the scenes that he is in, he's just a zombie. It involves a sub-sketch that is similar to a sub-draw of "Get Carter", but it occupies the sub-draws best of "Get Carter". (I blame the director) Hommekock director Hitchcock was rehabilitating. (It is the scene they are Characterist Ryan Philippe to realize he can not trust Tim Robbin's Charactor, at least I think it's a Hitchcock homage.The DVD shows the scenes that were cut out. I think the director should trust its instincts and do not listen to the audience test.
