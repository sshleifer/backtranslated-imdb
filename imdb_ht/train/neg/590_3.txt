I was unfortunately disappointed by this film due to the fact that he felt fake and the characters were not strong enough to bring the film very weak attempts at horror. The basic idea for the film was interesting, but unfortunately it was not able to arouse, really scare or hit me - was part of the entire movie that I thought was wholesome, but even that did not buy it . I did get Kate's love of love at the end of the movie as it seemed to soften and become a little more realistic in the end, the character played by Jeremy Sheffield was not actually needed for this movie and I think the director / writers carried away with the myriad of characters used for no reason, if he left it to the basic character to make it more of a solo effort in Kate's part, he might have worked - Jeremy's act was the hardest to say The small and I felt comfortable watching the bad on screen - or lack of it. Such a shame. Irritating.
