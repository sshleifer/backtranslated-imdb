Wow ... where to start ... take this up in Big lots for only $ 2.99. This three bucks I will never see again ... ever ... and for what? I'll say yes. An hour and fifteen minutes of boring, boring, boring cats and college engagements that seemed more appropriate for a lifetime film than the horror cops published on the box. (Let her droids marketing be burned in Hell for all eternity). Follow that up with a little bit of cheap Gore (not even mind yourself ...) and a plot twist to the end that comes out of nowhere, and it makes no sense. Terrible, horrible, horrible ... <br /> <br /> Is there any kind of redemption? Well, on the Joe Bob Briggs scale, SE has had six breasts involved, but that's hardly worth the long lost three bucks. Without these people, this could be on the sci-fi, say, two or three in the morning ... <br /> <br /> Bmoviefreak
