This movie has been published on radio, television, magazines, etc. Almost every hour or every problem. So when we went to multiplex Kinnepolis our expectations were very high. But oh boy, how sad this movie is! It's a movie in Hollywood style on a movie in a movie. Shades show clearly that we are not ready to produce 'big Hollywood movies'. I'm not a movie critic, but I think a good movie starts with a good script. And the script is a nightmare. Like line items I say, it's nothing, and then looped. You could just starve in the TV as well, without really seeing anything. That was the feeling we had when we saw all the colors. Color is a PRODUCTION BATH !!!
