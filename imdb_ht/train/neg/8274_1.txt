Ahh this movie has a lot of potential! A good cast of quality actors B, their thighs of Jessica Simpson and ... who are on it! I believe some guys in some marketing departments had an idea. Basically, allow to make a kind of legally blonde film, but do it in New York. Which big city shines in luck, power and money and where everyone is a heart, power / hunger people. Let's add this Jessica Simpson, the small town of Bimbo, who is Owen Wilson's brother and for some reason not clear Andy Dick (only because of it you should ignore this movie). <br /> <br /> Basic story line: <br /> <br /> Boys leave girls for NY, girls follow, boy cheats, girls stay in NY and cousins, gets a job under false pretense , mucks up, is correcting other boys (Brother Wilson) and simultaneously saves the day and kisses. <br /> <br /> A few words come in mind when thinking about this movie, meaning yourself, awful, unbearable, intolerable and xenophobic <br /> Just do not watch this movie, you will be happier . A review referred to Guantanamo and I definitely agree with him. This film provokes trauma. And I know what you're thinking ... at least at some point I'll see Simpson naked or close too. It will not happen, spare yourself the time with her YouTube. You will have better sexy time! <br /> <br /> The movie is flimsy, the act is unbearable, and why are they using blue screen? In conclusion; this is chronicle betrayal that should punish the maximum <br /> Another question why Willie Nelson still plays a kind of father dad in almost every cops Jessica Simpson and why they have no black, Latin, Asian or European people in this movie a?
