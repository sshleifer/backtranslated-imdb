Or the "Cube" is a wealthy B-rich film with paranoia, meaty characterization, and fine on-the-top performance. It's crap, crypt, and cool. And it stands perfectly well, on its own, without a sort of sort like "zero cube." This third (!) Movie of the Cube series is retreading parts (most of the traps are sadly recycled), party affairs. It takes the stage of bold to explain what the cube is - something that never revealed in the first movie - but, since explanation is bland, I'd rather have kept a secret. Some potentially interesting reference to the society exists outside of the cube, but they never develop beyond suggestions on some kind of political-religious state of the state. So what little social comment has felt flat and unfocused. <br /> <br /> What works? Basically nothing. Acting is amusing amateur peak, the rhythm is slow (how many of this movie consists of two nerds watching a screen?), And the gore effects, while rioting, fail to persuade. In short, "Zero Cube" reminds me of a fan-fic "Cube", a sloppy and sophomoric script in a good movie that definitely did not need an end.
