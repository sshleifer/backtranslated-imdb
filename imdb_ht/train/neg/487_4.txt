What did the director think? Everyone who reads Artemisia's biography was impressed by his intestinal body to face a public riot trial at Renaissance times and even suffered torture in order to show that Tassi was guilty. This fact shows the real independence and emancipation - in the hours it is more terrible it stands its MAN. Why movies that show Renaissance should be so smart and romantic, are we afraid to see the bravest side of life or the Hollywood happy-happy-mood? While I would always defend the liberty of the director to create his own reality in a movie I can not make sense of turning Artimisia's life on himself. Very disappointing choices by the musicians in this movie.
