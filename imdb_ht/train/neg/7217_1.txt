I just got to watch this DVD at home. We love Westerns, so my husband is renting it. He started exchanging my way to half. Saddles, costumes, accents - everything was there. The part that made me so upset is where the guy did not shoot the "collector" and his bow and arrow as he took the soul of the guy to have a lot of. His only excuse was "he only had 2 left arrows." We've watched it all the way to, and, as someone else said ... too many bad things in one out any reason a reason to suck. I mean, the fact that the boy got rid of the evil stone from the collector in the same month and day he found, what is the point at that? And why did they have a grave courtyard where everyone died on April 25 but those who had the souls taken from the collector were still walking around? If you want a movie to make fun of after a few beers, this can be your movie. However, if you want a real Western, you will hate this movie.
