With no avenue towards any kind of movie, and a healthy appreciation of documentary, I can honestly say I was angry at myself for bothering to sit at the entire length of "20 Dates". I will not waste your time with the draw, you can read other reviews. I'll say though Berberitz's humble, Woody Allen-style narration was very annoying. You either wanted it to lie on the coffee or ingest some tranquilizers. And it's potentially apparent Berkowitz himself that this movie was a bad idea, as part of his detail tries to finance the documentary. Forgive me for insulting as compliment, but I'll give Berkowitz credit for having the skills to convince some idiot to finance this piece of wonder of ****. I appreciate the limitations with the movie's intent here, but even when Berkowitz's standard is set for itself, it burns off and misses on every level. In closing, I'm sure many of these female companions were not in easy going on a date with a twitchy wanna-be movie theater, and that's why I question the movie's essence of authenticity. Hey Myles, I loved your movie the first time I saw it ... when it appeared as an episode of Seinfeld or was a movie directed by Woody Allen or Kevin Smith.
