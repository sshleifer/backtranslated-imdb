Considering the risk of gender-related relationships before the late 1980s, Best People could do better to play same-sex relationships between Hemingway (Chris Cahill) and Donnelly (Tory Skinner) as an experimental phase in Cahill's life. <br /> It seems to me that the creators of this movie are thrown into the same-sex relationship between two women fairly attractive in order to attract viewers. Also consider the 90 seconds to exhibit the crust of several women jumping back on a high jump pole. This random scene was of great importance to the film and it seemed as if this was merely holding the audience interested in this bold movie. I suppose the producers were trying to counter the boring plot and the even more boring environment of the movie (1980 counties in Oregon Track and Field). <br /> <br /> This review may seem harsh, but it is true. The exploitation of young Muriel Hemingway's body and the same sex relationship lost any credit that I would give this movie. <br /> <br /> Pepper Thompson
