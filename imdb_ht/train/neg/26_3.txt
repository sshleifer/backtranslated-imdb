If you assume this will not end a released-to-video release, I should say that this title is canceled at all costs. Unless you're bored of good, well-executed movies, that's what. I saw this night in AFI Dallas, and I left with 20 minutes left, simply because I did not care again (on the plot, not on the insult director ... that is awkward). When you can spot a goof only 5 minutes of the movie (a shot out, break the window before any shot is shot ... and then the window breaks with the first shot), things will be bad. Let's just say this is just an indicator of things coming ... unfortunately. <br /> I'll spare you all the details, but this is sub-par in any way, even half-act acting by Michael Madsen is disappointing when waiting for half-acting acting from him. And the scene of rape ... Christ! "Closing and taking it" should never be used in a rape scene. Still. <br /> <br /> 3/10
