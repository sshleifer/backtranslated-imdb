Tony Scott heads a revolve sports cops who should attract even the non-sport fan. And some say baseball is a dead sport ... boring too slow. Good racing up! On the outside it seems to be a misleading seller (Robert De Niro) while on the inside it's a psychotic San Francisco Giants fan. Together comes a new slugger (Wesley Snipes) and designated to deliver from the doldrums. Our seller harbors a mani murder when hard to hit all stars falling into the worst slump in his career and the Giants are afraid to confuse him with him. De Niro is awesome personality. Snipes are very natural as the ballplayer. Other notable attributes include: Ellen Barkin, Jan Leguizamo, Benicio Del Toro and Patti D'Arbanville. You are a free agent ... so enjoy. Violence and very strong language is to be expected and you get your money worth.
