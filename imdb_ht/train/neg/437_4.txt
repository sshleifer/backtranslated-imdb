(Spoilers) <br /> I was very curious to see this film, after hearing that it was clever and witty. I had to stop half because of the unbearable boredom I felt. <br /> The idea behind the film would have been acceptable: describing the way the relationship between a man and a woman evolves, in all the problems and difficulties that people living in a big city can experience. What made me flu the whole movie was two things. <br /> First of all, the movie was so down-to-earth that it looked as though, did not describe the issues that a couple had to settle on a day-to-day basis, it became itself ordinary and mat . <br /> <br /> Second, the general sloppiness of the output, and the dialogue has barely understood. <br /> <br /> Too bad.
