I'm spark that the reviews @ IMDb gave this TV movie as a high rating as they did. It's a usually sweet, simple 'clip of a movie that has two big names from the past (both of whom made a decent job), but this movie reeks in the budget work that gives us can see any day of the week less cable channels. I love a good romance as well as anyone, but as my wife and I have watched this - and before we saw the rating - we said, "There will be those movie films this movie too very simply because There is nothing in it to challenge the brains, their faith, their comfort levels or their cultural preferences .. It is possible to make a good movie like that (and Away from it is an example), but this was amateur hour .. Some Good films rated much lower than this one. Of course, another in a long line of film films flooded enough.
