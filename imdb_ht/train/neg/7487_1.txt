Unfortunately, this movie is so bad. The original August of Towners was faint and very funny, of course used the script written by Neil Simon. For some reason, Neil Simons script is not used in this film to fall flat and time again. Even the audience I was never laughing. The direction is very slow and tedious and when there is a joke it gives away the joke's death. The couple having sex in the park. Announcing it is a lighting ceremony for New York, well we all know the lights will come on them and we will be able to see cute and hungry Goldie & Steve doing a bit of slap sticks. The whole movie wind up being like this ... is a joke set up and given away. Why is not Hair Goldies ever messed up in the movie? You will also notice each lock up of Goldie (to use a very intense soft lens). I suggest that you rent the original with Jack Lemmon and Sandy Dennis, that's if you want to laugh.
