I mean the act is bad, but I think he's headed that made it so. I never thought so much of Highlander (same director) but that one might blame over the 80s. <br /> <br /> This one however, there is no excuse. People get injected while exiting a man in front of him! Those types of errors, along with a clear line of lines, strange fighting tactics, sub-by off and poor visual effects, make this one a sub-par by filmed all over. Then, as many others have commented, all this American junk. German in general were practically frightened by capturing his private American. Prepare to swallow a lot of it, although in small doses. <br /> <br /> To sum it up, a war film is not terrible but still definitely sub-par in every aspect.
