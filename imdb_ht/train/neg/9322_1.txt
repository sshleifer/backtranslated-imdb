Please do not leave the cover in this crazy movie. But if you're looking for a movie movie to laugh at: this is not it. Generally, I'm going to go for stupid if it's funny, but this stupid was so stupid it's almost (or possibly made) to make me stupid. The movie quality is better than a handheld, but not much, and it is quite possible that the music was created by pressing the Samba key 2 on a Casio keyboard. These issues should never really have a decent in viewing a horror movie but adding this amazing (weeping) cast, and you have a real humdinger. <br /> <br /> The story is about a guy who invited his friends up his family cabin in Texas for the weekend. She also extended the invitation to break her lady in her office. On the way there are to meet a woman in distress, who then invites them to come along by the other girls. <br /> <br /> The stay of the cabin includes gender and stripping and soon all of the panties are in a bunch when one girl disappears and odd items turn up at home. <br /> From there you (the audience) and the Moors, um, actors, try to figure out what's going on and they soon begin to challenge each other. In general I think I made it sound better than it is. The main struggle with this movie is that the characters are very underdeveloped, drawn to convince, the bad act and motivate the clueless. Once more this would be forgiven it was bit bit funny but alas, it is not. <br /> <br /> The finish twist is just a twist in that no one would guess it simply because if you really thought back in the movie it would not make sense anyway. Please do not let this review stop you from seeing the surprised girl in this movie. (Woah, my nose just grew eight inches.)
