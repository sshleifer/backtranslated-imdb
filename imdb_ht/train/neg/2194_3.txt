Neat site. Very unrealistic. What I learned from this film is that crazily speed out of control to go to the weekend cabin can not be the best idea after all. I liked how Bill readily rolled out of the car and down the hill with no crash at all! Unfortunately, the same can not be said for gal. Oh, and the police never seemed to find the car or draw the owner of the wreck. <br /> Many of drag out scenes including a plain strip (still have nightmares from that scene). Poor assistant guy with his hand but useless. I admit I was intrigued to see what the mysterious "thing" was behind the door, but when it appeared, I just laughed. HA HA HA ... The girl really seemed sadistic mad about being revived. Personally, I really want a new body after a diligent experience like that!
