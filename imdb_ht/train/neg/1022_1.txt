Starting with the poster (featuring only Morgan Freeman and Kevin Spacey), the film was all a fraud. A stereotype after another, this movie was about nothing - or nothing new, at least. After 10-15 minutes, you realize that you've just paid to see Justin Timberlake and LL Cool J reciting their way to another movie-flick movie. <br /> <br /> Basically, the story is about the corrupt system in some of the cities, all secretly supported by the business scandal and city, under the watchful eye of some hot-shot politicians. Is the organization that hosts the above-mentioned law called FRAT and guess what? They had a kick-ass tire vengeance and beat at will - suspects, girlfriends, or names. FRAT cats are corrupt and greedy, so they make mistakes that get discovered by a youth and talent (!!!) journalists. An hour later, following a series of unbelievable evil shooting scenes made with stereo lines, everything ends happily and we get to serve the final line: you can not beat the system. Bah! Do not see this garbage in movie rolls. Freeman and Spacey barely have 10 minutes altogether!
