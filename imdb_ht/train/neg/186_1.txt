I did not know whether they laughed or cried in misrepresentation of this Canadian story, particularly the drug making in the history of the Police up to the Yukon. <br /> I'll leave it to Pierre Berton, noted historian, born and raised in Dawson City Yukon, and author of the definitive story of the Gold Klondike Rush, Klondike: The Last Great Gold Rush, 1896- 1899 expressed my excitement to this comic film: <br /> The American minds of an unlimited boundary, submitted by armed individuals armed with six weapons, were continued in the Far East, another story about a cowboy from the west The American - Wyoming this time - drives its beasts into beef in gold. The picture is a nightmare of geographic impossibility, but the real incongruity is the biggest assumption on which the draw draw ?? that there was only one polis mounted on all the Canadian Yukon at the time rushed to gold and that he could not cope with the lawlessness. When James Stewart and Walter Brennan arrive at Yukon's borders and cows, the custom cottage is empty. <br /> <br /> "Where is the shelter?" Ask Brennan. River. Problems with the Chilkats, "someone replied ... He had a tough, hard-working task, which he patrolled some ten or twenty thousand square miles. Sometimes he did not get home for two or three months at a time." <br /> <br /> The historical story is that the Yukon territory during the Gold Rush was the closest thing to a British state-run British North American state ever to see. The Northwest Mounted Police was stationed in the territory in considerable numbers before the Klondike strike. They control all roads in the Yukon and have no tired nonsense. They pick up custom work, often on the sail of the new arrivals, made arbitrary laws on the arena on river navigation, and they returned to people if they did not have enough material, or if they simply looked bad. In all good Canadians, morals are set up for the community. On the Day of Dawson, the Lord's Law was strictly observed; It was a crime punishable by a fine of cutting your timber on Sunday; and young custody women arrested for what the police who had been called was "providing a risky performance in the theater," generally nothing more than dancing suggestions on the scene of low reveal bar. <br /> In such a community, a gunbelt was unlucky. A notorious bad man from Tombstone who tried to pack a gun on his hip was personally disarmed by a young Xtreme, who had just ejected him from a saloon for the crimination crime to speak too loudly. The man was bad like a lamb, but he protested when the policeman, on discovering he was carrying a gun told him in his hand. "No one has yet taken a gun away from me," said the American. "Well, I took it," the stable said mildly and did it, without further resistance. So many revolvers were confiscated at Dawson that they were auctioned by the police for as little as a dollar and bought as souvenirs to keep on the mantelpiece. In 1898, the great year of the debacle, there was not a serious crime ?? leave for an assassination ?? in Dawson. Unlike Skagway on the American side, which was a city that did not run by Soapy Smith, the confident Denver man, was remarkable. But in the distant land of Dawson is seen as a community without any law, which a Smith Smith character from Skagway ?? he called Gannon in the picture? can be easily controlled. (In real life, one of the Smiths who tried to cross the border had all his equipment confiscated and was frogmarched right back again by a police officer mounted). <br /> <br /> {the movie in the mountain stretches}} "Yes I am the law I represent the laws of the Yukon Territory .. about fifty thousand square miles of it." "Then why do not they have more of you?" <br /> "Because yesterday was a desert. We did not expect you to pour in by the thousands .. Now that you are here, we'll protect you." "This will make a post here established in Dawson early in May." <br /> <br /> "What's happening right now?" <br /> <br /> "What about the rest of the time?" <br /> "Pick a good person, swear it in. Make it act as marshal?" <br /> <br /> The movie Mountie leaves and does not appear again in the picture. Its amazing sensation ?? that a Marshall American city, filled with tin stars, must be sworn in by a group of townsfolk living under British jurisdiction ?? accept. Of course they want to make Jimmy Stewart Marhal; It clearly fits the party. But Stewart plays the role of the Loner who looks after Number One and so someone else is shot. And he did so. Others take injection. Even Walter Brennan is shooting. Stewart finally comes to the conclusion to hesitate that he must end all the shooting and shoot some of his own. He stumbles on the tiger star and he and the bully, Gannon, blast away to each other at the highest point in the west inevitable. <br /> <br /> For anyone who has a knowledge of the Canadian North, this bald re-tell in the story than rational beliefs. <br /> <br /> Extracts from Canada's Hollywood, by Pierre Berton, 1975.
