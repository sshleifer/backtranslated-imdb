I go to the cinema to be entertained. There's absolutely nothing fun about this movie. From the beginning to end, there is no respite from the grid, grinding reality in this woman's life. It is one-rhythm, with no change in mood. I stayed until the end only because I was convinced that things should get better. They do not, and I do not think I was the only one, as evidenced by tightly sounding around the movie as the film was sad mercifully in a lock. Honestly describing social scrutiny is no crime, but your boring hearing is plain not the way to enjoy the sympathy of the public. A horrible movie.
