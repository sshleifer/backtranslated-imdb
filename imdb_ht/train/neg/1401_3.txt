Someone mentions correction. This is edited seriously and what started out as a bit intriguing has become an incomprehensible mess. For starters, let us know what it is you are trying to do with these experiences. Why are these people the best choice for the type of experience they are participating in? And, what exactly are they testing? Apparently there are some grand plans that some agencies will exploit. The act is very bad. Everyone is embarrassed. Everyone is kept secret. They often mention that if it was not for the money, they would hang it. There is a disruptive minister that justifies writing. On and off. But again, the biggest hanging is the lack of laying out a playing field for the actors. Some elements really cheese. Those small rooms with these chaise rooms. The terrible picture (it was photo?). It was interesting but did not seem to go anywhere.
