When the movie started the first 4 minutes to appear as a California traveler, I asked if I had the tapes mixed together. Then I breathe a sigh of relief to see Paul Thomas in a scene with the beautiful Joanna Storm and Laurie Smith. This is being visited by Jimmy (a young Byron). Janty Aant (Honey Wilder) is concerned about her behavior for her employing a private teacher (Home Parker). I could do without the beast, robot role-playing, or the incest.There aspects are one good sex scenes, between Byron and Parker, but it's not good enough to save this movie. <br /> <br /> My class: D +
