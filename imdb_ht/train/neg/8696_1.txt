I'm Anthony Park, Glenn Park is my father. The first I mean that the story behind this film and the creation of Amber Alert system is a good one. However the movie itself was wrong and the act was terrible. The biggest problem I've had with the film participated in the second half with Nichole Timmons and Grandpa Glenn Park. The events surrounding this part of the story were not completely incorrect. My dad suffered from psychological disorders at the time and picked up Nichole without any intentional harm at all. She loved her as a daughter and she was under the thought that she had saved her from some sort of malicious or negligence that she likely believed came from her mother who had paid little attention to her about 3 years ago The more that my dad cared for him and his resume summarized so his mother could brush over. The movie shows my dad in such a way that he's going to hurt her in a way or shape. The funny thing is that Nichole spent many consecutive nights in my father's place while Sharon should work or do whatever he did. The reason my dad was originally thought to be violent was because he had items that might conceive to be gun on his truck. My father was a landslide. The items they considered to be weapons were field tools that he kept in his truck all the time to work. My recommendation is taking this film with a single tablet, it's a good story and based on true events however the details of the movie (at least Nichole Timmons - Glenn Park portion) are largely inaccurate and they describe the bankruptcy of directors to discover the truth in the storytelling. The funny thing is, that if the director would interview any of Sharon's friends who knew the situation they would declare exactly what I was posting here.
