It was almost 30 years, and I still hate everyone involved in this movie. It remains the worst movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Before that, I never mind the river, one way or the other. After seeing this movie, I have an allergic reaction when I accidentally see it on TV. <br /> I was dragging this - against my best judgment - by peer pressure. However, coming out of the theater, these sworn friends have never again overlule my choice of films. Nearly three years later, we still carry mental scars in this film. <br /> <br /> On my deathbed death, one of my regrets will be time to waste my hopes that this movie might get better. He never did. <br /> If you're ever given a choice, you'd prefer to put your own eye out of sitting though this movie. <br /> I'm registered for comments IMDb just in the hope that maybe I can warn others about watching this movie. If I can save one person from that view, then my existence on this earth will be justified.
