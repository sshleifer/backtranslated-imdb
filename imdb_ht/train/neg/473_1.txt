That's what my friend Brian said about this movie after about an hour in her. He could not hold two ominous off. I was ranting about how exhilarating it was and finally I was annoying and playing it, it ran out of adjective for "boring". <br /> <br /> Imagine if you will, the pinnacle of hack-work. Such an uninspired thing, so impossibly obnoxious, that all you want to do after looking it is sitting alone in the dark and not talking to anybody. Some people work under the illusion that this movie is watching. It's not, not under any form of narcotic or brain damage. I would only recommend this to someone in order to help them understand how really unbearable it is. Do not believe me? Gather 'round. <br /> <br /> Granted, as a nation, we in America do not always show Middle Eastern people in a tasteful way. But how about a kid in a bikini-busted outfit in salaam-fashioned in a fireplace of olive oil castol oil booth? You'll find that here. GET IT? AROUND AROUND. I could not believe what I saw. Having the flying kid flying a skyscraper would have been more appropriate. Who's right idea they thought it was a funny joke? It does not even close to "offensive cunning". It just sucks and makes you want to punch anyone who pays to write that bit of the face. <br /> In the middle of the movie, a group of five-man singing the "Landmines" takes the stage of a ballet officer. Are you ready The joke is TERRIBLY SING and OFF-KEY. Why did I write that in the cap? Because the joke is POUND, POUND, has been kept in mind with a marathon in front sight. They start off mediocre enough; split glasses, punched tumblers crush ... then, I'm 100% serious, a two-frame-motion sequencing sequence of a woman's shoe comes out. You read what's right- the music was so bad, in a frame, the woman's feet have shoes on. In the next lot - the shoes are off !!! Get it, because the music was so bad, its shoes came! What is the F? <br /> <br /> Then there is an endless timetable of stock footage to drive home the point that the singing is BAD. If anyone was actually suffering from this stage of the theater without running like hell, I would be surprised. This film is awesome as a practical joke to see how fast people would bolt out the doors. Robert Downey Sr direction the comedian way his son honors respect by remaining drugs-free. Move badly. Other things to look out for: <br /> <br /> 1. The popular music is shoehorned at all where possible. Each time Liceman appears, a really appropriate song Iggy Pop plays. Plus all the actors do their best to act as it really is chilly for some reason. Barbara Bach's terrible criminal accident. It sounds like she tries to talk like a baby while rolling a marble around her tongue. There is no stripping, and there are several scenes where boys are moaning and writhe out of a glimpse of clewing it, as they are in a community-based community school and they've been directed to act like excited people who delay. <br /> <br /> 3. Lizman feed dogs to recover her a condom. Remember; then the film was left in "abortion" and "condoms" seen as "ass". Tom Poston plays a mining, pedophile boy, back when Hollywood thought "pedophilia" and "homosexual" were one of the same. Flat-out embarrassing. <br /> <br /> 5. Look at the finish. There is nothing wrong with your VCR. That is actually the end. Tell me that you do not want to explode anyone who has ever made any movie ever. <br /> Look at this at your own risk. Up The Academy has been known to actually make other movies, such as the Jerk Circle or Choking, less funny simply by placing the video near them.
