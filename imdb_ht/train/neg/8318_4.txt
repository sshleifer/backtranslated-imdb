I've seen already fantastic stories, but the premises of this one are so incredible that it comes very close to being ridiculous. A rich and young guy undergoes a heart transplant day after her marriage, and she's somehow witnessing her own surgery and the plot of her surgeons to kill her. Even if there is a medical explanation of such an upcoming phenomenon is a mixture of dialogue among ... telling ... soul? ... perhaps with real life where the dedicated mother will do everything to save the life of her son. There is no shadow of suspense or thrill, just a combination of a bad and simplistic plot with a series of coincidences that never can happen in life. This is not to say that the movie is completely lacking type - actually first-time director Joby Harold does a decent job to lead a good team to actors including Hayden Christensen in his first big role after taking in Anakin Skywalker Costume Fabulous Jessica Alba and super-don Lena Olin. Everything would have deserved a better story.
