Monika Mitchell satir satir has some laughs and some premeditated violence. I would not say without dipping; but there is an insult and injury. Max Matteo (John Cassini) is a character actor who has an original adaptable presence on screen, but has a terrible track record of being selected for the party that he goes after. There is still a nephew of the producer or seemingly trivial reason for not awarding the role he is looking for. Well, the best thing to do is get rid of the competition ... Max gets obsessed with these thoughts. The rewarding career is just a swing, pushing and bursting away. Other cast members: Rene Rivera, Molly Parker, Jennifer Beals, Frank Cassini and Camera by Eric Roberts and Sandra Oh. Well, this business show ... or is it?
