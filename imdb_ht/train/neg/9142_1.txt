Just watch this after hearing about how bad she was and wanted to see for myself. Seriously, even if you read all the negative comments about here you will nowhere else can understand how horrible this film actually is, although it has to be one of the most hilarious things I've ever seen! Never bother posting a comment on here before, but this piece of crap really warns it. <br /> <br /> Firstly the whole plot is ridiculous and meaningless. Brother of the lead character (either Ben or Arthur, I forgot that is, and honestly it is never very clear) wants to stop some kind of gay marriage does not kill everyone in sight - because homosexuality is abominable Christian, but apparently mass murder ISN 't. Then some other crap thrown in on one of the ex-wife's old wife wife tried to force her to remarry him at gunpoint. This leads to nothing, but gives us one of the funniest lines of dialogue throughout the "film" - "I do not make sense? You do not make sense! That makes sense!". Brilliant. <br /> Then there's act, which is just atrocious. It must be seen to be believed. My favorite is apparently called civil rights lawyer lawyer, who is clearly reading his line off of something, but still manages to mess up. Ase says. The gay couple would not be less convinced. There's the guy vaguely attractive and completely gormless, with her boyfriend who looks like those little cartoon creatures in the advertisements are. Only Fatty. With less talent. <br /> <br /> The "movie" was also filmed by an incapacitator in keeping a camera even remotely still, and the number of errors of all is amazing. All the stuff kicks off with the main fat guy in the bed and a pair of boots on. Yep. <br /> But anyways, we all know how awful this thing is, so I'd like to highlight some of the most prized moments that the "movie" provides. <br /> - When the fat guy lays the church on fire and then prances like a six year old girl across the car park makes his escape. Hilarious. <br /> - Dildo! There is no idea that her relationship is the main characters - sometimes known to her, sometimes they do not, but she pops up in a couple of scenes nonetheless. Hilarious. <br /> <br /> - The lawyer stoned. Already mentioned it, but it's so funny it's worth mentioning another. <br /> <br /> - evil dinner dinner in crackers that she lays on for his guests. Potion gay. <br /> <br /> - The evil cat cat. <br /> - The finish, which I will not give away because it must be seen to be believing. I warn you though, make sure you're not eating at the moment !!!! Pompos main main characters / directors / producers become naked. It's bad. Basically, Ben and Arthur are indescribably bad, but unintentionally the most funny thing you'll see for a long time. Literally, nothing is good about this excuse for a movie, goon to a director even managed to make the credits open in a joke by writing his own name about 15 times.
