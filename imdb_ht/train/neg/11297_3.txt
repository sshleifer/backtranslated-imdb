Jenny Neumann (from MISTRESS's Sexual Flick from APES, the American Slasher HELL NIGHT and others) is Helen Selleck, an American actress who becomes a lead role in Australian stage production. She is a virgin because such a girl has seen her mother have sex and then accidentally caused the car crash that killed her. Meanwhile, a black-gloved killer prowls around the theater splits up people with chords of ice. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The assassin is obviously Helen (he speaks in his mother's voice, wash his hands off after killing them, and she sees killing a child molesty with a broken bottle as a girl!), but this has FREE heavy-handed POV camera-work and hides the identity of murderers until the end so many as it supposed to have some great surprise. <br /> <br /> The whole cast seems obsessed with talking about, having or trying to sex, and, in one case, even blackmail the roads in getting laid. There's quite a bit of nudity and blood, but there is no sense of continuity, photography is quiet and the correction (by Colin Eggleston, who scripted and produces) is awful. The theater environment for a slasher movie predicted the Soavi film with the same name as OPERA Argento (both of them are better than this one) by five years though, and Neumann is very hot.
