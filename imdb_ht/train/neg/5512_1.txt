Put a DVD in this cops in a time capsule, and it will definitely be illustrated for next generation a perfect example of one that guarantees the minimum rating on a 1-to-10-star scale. <br /> <br /> Bill Cosby and Ray Romano were at the top - in ratings with tens of millions of wages each year - and the TV series. But each had no success in the big screen. This is also true for other television personalities - perhaps because many of the stories are presented for two hours or so seems more suited to either a 10 minute sample, or at most, 22 or 23 minutes of drama during a half- This movie, however, does not have one single element that would guarantee two or three minutes of time on MAD TV, SNL, or anywhere else on a screen or step. <br /> <br /> The date of its originally listed as 2002, but released the date - the only DVD - to show as 2004. He also filmed not long before Rodney Dangerfield's death, so one returns his value that he probably provided in lease a few hundred thousand more dollars for his heirs. <br /> I would never hear about it, but it was found when my turn-on series, and frankly became fascinated by it. Some movies, so really terrible that they rate a sort of top rating in reverse - so badly that you can move call to call a 9 or 10. "Plan 9 Out of Space" is the best example - and Bruce Jenner / The Village Opus People, "can not stop the music," is another. Unfortunately this flicker movie even has. Though Rodney's earlier work (as well as some of his fellow-cast members) falls short of "Citizens Kane" or "Casablanca," there were plenty of humorous moments and a story giving at least a modicum of interest. > <br /> Unfortunately, this presentation does not seem to possess even a minute or two of the worth of these materials.
