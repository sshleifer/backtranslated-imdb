This is a pretty little show about the paranormal although it feels as if Art Bell and his ilk figured out how to carve a career from the mood that Carl Kolchak illustrates. Of course there probably would not be an X-Files if this show did not prepped this hearing for it for good. Darren McGavin is not exactly the super-heroic type but it is a compelling (enough) guy to deliver heroic deeds. Check out her work on some of these Olds featuring Alfred Hitchcock. Here it is the main attraction, there does not seem to be a girlfriend or wife in a distraction. In fact there is not a whole lot of sex appeals to the show. Something I've noticed as well is that the rhythm is not really thrilling in a typical way. There are a lot of humorous moods that show. Sometimes it's just pokey to get to the climax. There's a thread from this show coming all the way up to the featured MAD show people in terms of style. Not that David Chase writes Men angry but those who worked under him on Sopranos are definitely imitating and inherited his serio-comic tone.
