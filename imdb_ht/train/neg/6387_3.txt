When I first took that movie up I was intrigued by the basic idea and longing to see what would happen. I'm a fan of animation and love it when it's successfully merged with foot action action. However, the animation of this movie was about all I enjoyed. Although it must be said that the performance of the actors was excellent. The visual look - including the animation - gave a wonderful time to the nniran piece. However this quality of anxiety was lost amongst the relentless imagery, both visual and in the script, that you were practically coating on the head with. Most harassment on this was relative lack of importance in the scheme. It seemed that the sketch was the corneal shoe at irregular intervals to give a sting effect that was destroyed massively from the sink to the piece. The ovaw voice from Felisberto - especially the one in the end - many felt like a desperate attempt to fill in gaping holes in the plot that was ignored in favor of side problems like the whole thing (and even that was not well addressed ). I fear the whole piece reaches at all, at best, a 'reasonable first attempt', not a teenager who has spent so far time reading DH Lawrence. Not what you expect from seasoned movie makers at all.
