"The National Lamp goes to the movies" (1981) is absolutely the worst movie ever made, beyond even the "Plan 9's out of outer space." The film lamps unreels in three separate and unconnected stickers, each featuring different performers. The only common company is the total lack of any kind of levies. <br /> Well, maybe there is only one. Another review on this site said that the nude vaccines are nice, and it's right. Missing Ganzel and Dusenberry flash assets are prettily, in part and two parts, respectively. But their glamorous shows, alas, wasted. Directors seem to have forgotten that even T & A needs a credible story to surround it, and nothing in sight. The third segment, starting Robby Benson and Richard Widmark, is the most disgusting of three, with an unfortunate choice as windup in this movie. Benson plays a young-eyed policeman, brightly reported for his first day of duty, ready to get rid of the streets of evil. It is scary with an old, cynical cop who plays by Widmark, and when these oil and water partners put out on their first patrol together, we feel a possible redemption of the movie's earliest chess. Perhaps, just maybe, the cynical old-timer will be reformed by his current partner's sense of duty and loyalty. Perhaps all will end up happily after all. But alas, this movie is right for the bathroom, with no redemption, no happy ending, no coherent history of any kind. Before the "National Lamp goes to the movies," I thought I had already seen the biggest key that Hollywood might possibly turn out. Unfortunately, I did not see half of it. <br /> <br />
