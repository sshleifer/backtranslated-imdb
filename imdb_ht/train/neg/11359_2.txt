While the 3-D animation (highlight of the show) did its job well, most other elements fell flat. It was as if the filmmakers thought "well, it will have 3-D so we do not have to work hard on the plot or character development." And the fact that it's a movie of a child is absolutely no excuse. The public is drawn in three dimensional characters (Shrek, Nemo's father) as much as they draw on three dimensional graphics. The only scope of any of the main characters showed two scooter scope that torsion the plot from time to time and forcing him to eat everything in sight. <br /> <br /> And the absolute kicker? The appearance of Aldrin's Buzz at the very end (after watching a very robotic Robotics version of the same historical figure for an hour and a half) comes on the screen and breaks everyone's everybody's time by calling the main character's movie " contaminants "and to announce that the situation set out on screen was actually an impossible. <br /> <br /> ??????? Do you just want to tell the kids Bunny Easter and Santa Claus does not exist while you're in it?
