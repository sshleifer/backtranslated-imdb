Cutting cops come up with some and far between now a day, so when I heard about Cutting I had high hopes, she heard good about it. These good things I heard were all wrong .. like evil! This flicker is bad and I mean BAD. It's just plain stupid. Everything about it. Especially the killer's origin and how it lives and how it is taking care of the end. There is nothing original or outstanding about this movie flick. Just another slaughter wannabe with these "Hip," "Self aware." "Savvy movie" character. I'm sick of that crap. Someone does something different to cause the genre to cut new blood needs, literally.
