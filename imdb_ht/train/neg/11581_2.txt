This is a really horrible movie. The plot (as it is) is totally indefinite. (I think he has something to do with blackmail, but I'm not entirely sure.) Half of the dialogue consists of useless clicks. Other half are speaking to the various actors of the immunity of these immunities in the "south" accent that (fortunately) words can not be recognized. But the only true tragedy in the movie is that as a historical talent as Mary Tyler Moore has apparently been in such circumstances as financial or personal situation as it appeared in her. <br /> <br />
