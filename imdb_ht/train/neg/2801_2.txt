After a quasi-Gothic, all-fruity music video, the movie begins with Cassidy singer to lead suicide. In a perfect world that would be that and the end credit would roll. We do not live the world. Members of the untidy band decided to go to some clowns to contact his death. When I say clown, I mean current clown. He tells them they're all dead on Cassidy's ghost (the spirit possessed Dora, one of the band-peers) We could not care less as the characters are all boring, stupid, and very horribly acting. Written by Adam Hackbarth (an unbelievable name over there if ever there was one), and headed by Corbin Timbrook (who after the Assistant, and the Blood Tower, HAS they know that it keeps crap for a living) This movie is a constant struggle between the movie's incompetence and the viewer needs to stay awake. It's not enough to keep the gore-meats, or even nudity to satisfy pervers. This movie in fact has absolutely nothing to recommend absolutely anyone. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Where I see it: Starz on Demand
