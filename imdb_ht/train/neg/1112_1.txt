I like to watch western movie but this film takes the biscuit. The script and dialogue are mockable. The act was terrible, where did they come from? Music was OK I must say. Luckily I did not buy or rent the movie, but it is now disposed of. <br /> I was gearing up to the start when the stranger (martin sheen) started telling his story. I must admit I enjoyed the confrontation between Hopalong and Tex where Hopalong shot Tex's finger and told him to practice 40 years of his league. But where it all went to be weight-shaped afterwards. I had to watch the entire movie in the hope that he would get better, never did.
