What was this movie goal? I suggest he has done a handful of actors and producers and directors of a great deal of cash. Even my favorite actor, Bruce Dern, could not keep my interest in this boring movie. An ancient pugilist braiginad fell in with a strange woman and her family. She starts out as a row-she's man for the woman, and winds up beat a man and getting caught in a kidnapping plot. It was so confusing that I could not even write a decent criticism. If you see this one, my sweetness, make sure it is after dark so you can go to sleep right away.
