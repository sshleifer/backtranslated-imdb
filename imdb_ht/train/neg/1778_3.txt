I have nothing against a fast-flick fast, but this Stephen King is out of mischief is too fresh-rubbed, too bright and modern. The plot, about a new young boy in a small town that is a "Sleepwalker" - sort of a cross between a vampire and a werewolf - and feeds on the blood of virgin, begs for a more mysterious, limiting treatment. This thriller gives an inappropriate look and feel, and hardly any atmosphere. Children are predictable beautiful and energetic, but the attractiveness is Alice Kridge as the boy's mother; Kridge, from Ghost Story, never fills out the filler-mold, and it is a great loss that it has not used more. Its performance is creepy and intense, and it gives hint that "Sleepwalkers" might have been a better movie with a different focus and tighter direction. It's too over-the-top with commercial-driven, with an unmatched tone that swings wildly from drama comedy drama. Stephen King pops up in a comet, as director of real life John Landis and Tobe Hooper. * 1/2 from ****
