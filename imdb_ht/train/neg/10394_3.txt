With Knightly and O'Tool as their driving, this movie had good options, and McCallum as the bad guy after Knightly, maybe some tension. But they threw it all away on frilly evening frills and then later on with Maudlin warriors. It was of course utterly superficial, beautiful English land and seaside or not. The one single mistake was dumping Knightly early in the movie, when she could easily play a couple of years in the older , instead of choosing a person ten years older play party. They miss all the chances of having great conflicts among the cast, and rather stupid pull of the easy and low coststring elements.
