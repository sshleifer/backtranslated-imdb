I've discovered this movie with a retailer selling OOP. And this one surely is an OOP. A year after the exorcism he returned to business with this movie but what we all new was that the Blair career never broke, he never became a mega star. This is one of the many reasons in its film are OOP. He gives a good performance in this movie. It's about a registry not recognized by his parents and have no friends. Played at a age of 15 playing a girl at 14, this funny. The film is also known for the rape scenes of the showers were to stick a broomstick up her girls. In most editions it cuts out, why, I do not know, no blood is involved, okay, Blair is naked but nothing to show, no T & A so there is nothing to offend people. But the movie is slow, very slow. He's not happy with me, but I'm almost feeling asleep. It's just about 14 years old to become a rebel against society, but there is no bloodshed, no gore is nothing. Why this is the horror category is always a wonder. If you're a fan of Blair, buy it if you can find it otherwise leave it as it is.
