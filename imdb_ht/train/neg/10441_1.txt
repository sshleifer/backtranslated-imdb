I stopped watching this post as the snakes began to "take over" the plane. <br /> At first I thought maybe it should get a "one" for the comic relief. But then I realized I could just look at the three stooges for free and more laughs! <br /> Whatever respect I could do for Samuel Jackson was irreparable was destroyed. And Hollywood demonstrates once again how to remove from reality they really are. When I was a kid we used to catch snakes for fun. The only thing Snake would do is huddle at the bottom of the Bay Cargo. And there is no amount of snake cartoon size that can change that. This movie is not worth a trip to the blockbuster. Warn: If you pay for it, the only "victim" is your mute donkey. If you want them really scary, I suggest the descent. If you want humor, go to your local standing comedy club. Worst sinks will be a million times better than this waste.
