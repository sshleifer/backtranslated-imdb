The package implies that Warren Beatty and Goldie Hawn are pulling on a huge bank robbery, but that's not what I got out of it! I did not find anything! In the first half there is a new character (without introduction) in each other. The first half-hour is completely incomprehensible, the rest is just one long, annoying, staged scene scene. There's still a disappointing sound in the background whether it's a loud look, a blearing mermaid, a whistle, or even the awful note by Quincy Jones. There are a lot of bad parts, too. Like, the bad guys chase Beatty on thin mires and a car! Or, the police came to the scene about fifteen times. I really hated this movie!
