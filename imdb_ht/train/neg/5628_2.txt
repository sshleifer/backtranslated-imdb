I'm not someone very inclined to inclinate. I'm a mad scientist wife and I felt that this movie was perhaps one of those artsy films artsy films on a budget. I watched a part of it with my fiancé and my next steppe daughter. We tried very hard to find something in this film to keep our interest. My fiancé and her daughter voted to her and we moved on the 13 Ocean, but this is another story. Not to be discouraged I got up in the morning and gave the movie another shot. I started again watching this movie in seriousness. I just do not get it, I thought I would get it. I thought the funniest part was flushing in the ashes and the urn found a place in the fireplace that was used as a vase for what appeared to be dead flowers . Interesting and still there were things that are dead inside. It was an odd and scarce film. Perhaps this is what they were after, but I'm not going to fool a second!
