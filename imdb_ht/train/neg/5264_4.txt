The disappearance put in the Mojave Desert as Jim (Harry Hamlin) & Patty Henley (Susan Dey) more of the children Katie (Basia A'Hern) & Matt (Jeremey Lelliott) along with Ethan (Jamie Croft) a friend of the Family Travel Together, they stop at a side street diner and ask about an old mining town deserted on the map called Weaver. No-one claim was heard in it but it's definitely there & the family decided to take a detour in order to check it out & take some photos. Once in the city they take some pictures & have a look around, but when it comes time to leave their cars will not start & they have to spend the night there. While looking around to find a video video that they play only to discover the footage of a woman scared that all her friends have disappeared, in the morning and the cars disappeared like things to take a very disaster turn. What is Weaver's Secret? Has ever left Henley left alive ... <br /> Writing, co-executive product & directing by Walter Klenhard I was told that Disappearance is one of the films I've ever seen frustrated. For the first 85 minutes it was a very good mysterious mix of thriller and horror movie, but then we are treated to one of the highest endings ever in motion picture history. The script suggests many of the different things but never elaborated or confirmed & I sat there to really intrigue on what went on, from the mysterious machine families disappeared, recent graves, the stuff of the abandoned mines , the supernatural storm, the sudden and disappearance without exploiting in pond & its just as unmistakable comeback, the sheriff's disaster motive, the compass of the car went crazy, the plane crashed, the denied townspeople Weaver existed & the side effects Possible of a neutron bombs have fallen near Weaver in the 40's but they are all out of the window & for all we know could completely separate random events. Everything has come together nicely & has set up for a great twist revelation but none was forthcoming & instead I was treated to the Most Limit, Strange, Surprising & Outright Frustrating Ending Possible. If there is nothing else there is a lot of contradiction to what has gone before & leaving the viewer with more questions than answers. It's almost as if the musicians had the great ideas, but then did not know what to do with them & just made the end up on the spot. I just felt I put great effort into watching the movie that can be very slow at times without any sort of reward & in fact the finish felt more like a kick of the teeth or a good hello finger! /> Director Klenhard does a reasonable job here, the old ghost town has a certain atmosphere and where the expansive desert is giving a good sense of insulation. It's well done but what they thought and ended? Nothing fits, nothing makes sense & it's just a big frustration that after sitting in the stuff for almost an hour and a half leave you confused and want to know more. Although a horror movie has no blood or gore although there are one or two climb moments here & there. The movie actually reminds of the Hills has eyes (2006) remake for great parties as that is the movie is set-up to be before a finish finish that has nothing to carry any movie closure. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />. Put in America but filmed in South Australia. The act is good from a decent throw. <br /> <br /> Disappearance is a really odd movie, for a long time it forms to be a cute little mystery terrorist mystery but it never explains anything that's happening & truly the surreal that ends just launching more questions than answer. I really can not see anyone who makes himself neither that, I really can not.
