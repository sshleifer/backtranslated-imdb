When I first looked at Robotboy, I found it cool and interesting, but then I noticed, that with every episode this show trying to teach you how to behave, what is good / bad. Episodes have become predictable. And the main characters are not interesting. Again we see a hyper-smart boy, beating his older brother, parents who do not understand the kid, and his friends: girls and boys fat. Also show that there is no logic. A super-modern robot that works on two AA-sized batteries, and can use a lot of weapons. But the biggest problem is the difference between activated and super-activated mode. We see two different robots, and he denied the main idea of ​​the show: "Robots must learn how to behave in human society"
