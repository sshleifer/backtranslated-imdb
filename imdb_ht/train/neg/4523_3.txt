When this film was released, it spawned one of the ever big movie reviews of Sphinx Stinks. It does, but in a fascinating sort of way. The casting is funny, starting at the top: Frank Langella and Sir John Gielgud as Egyptian? Not enough makeup in Cairo for that, at least not while this movie was made. But it's rather fun to see them try. Performance runs the gamut from mummy-like (sorry, obvious observation) over-the-top, and many stops in between. Lesley-Anne Down Character looks like if he could not find Egypt on a map, much less explaining its archaeological treasures. That at least in part of some really bad writings, one of the curses that will be visited on every viewer of this movie. It is my opinion that movies involving a curse or drawing their bases on a topic that is somewhat esoteric, such as Egypt, are ripe for unusual, exclusive dialogue. It does not disappoint, and the convergence proves a double-whammy. The plot has one source of driven dramatic tension: Does this get dumber and less credible? The answer is usually YES. Where vaccines are beautiful, and the design design is generally very good, only reminds them that this was not some low-budget production. That and the fact that there are many well-known faces in such an unintentional involvement. Cheap, no; cheesy, yes.
