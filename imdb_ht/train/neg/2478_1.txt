This film is S-L-O-W. Most of the movie is currently waiting for it to 'start'. The environment was weak, the weak textbook, the movie was weak, the plot was weak, the budget was low (not that all low budget films are bad, but this one is not there was no detrimental feature). The draw was more consumed with a changeable, slightly disrupted hunter than the current Wendigo who made a very short appearance towards the end of film. This in itself was disappointing as this 'Wendigo' was just a rare blend of a tree with an evil. Everything about the movie was uninspiring. Parents of the little boy appear to be rather aloof and at times seemed completely detached from their son. If this was down to bad act or a bad script I'm not sure, but it only intensifies my deception and boredom levels. <br /> There was no food for thought, nothing sting an interest. With no real intrigue or frost factory, this movie breeds together so sadly, you just could not care less what was happening in the end. <br /> <br /> Wendigo's ambience reminds me of the dull movie shown in the award ceremony toward the end of 'Mr Bean's' Holiday Day: a movie that is artistic and nonsensical, trying too hard to be deep and significant, but coming across as firefighters and boring .. <br /> I would never want to look this again. I only look at the end of the prosperous hope that something interesting can happen ... but it was not.
