The various stripping scenes that other jars are referred to have iron pain and a double body was obviously used. If Mrs. Pacula was hesitant to perform the scenes herself maybe she should have turned down the role of the roles. Otherwise the film was not any worse than other Cinematic cinematic movies. As other jars have pointed out Canadian movies are generally poorly written and lack of entertainment value, which is what most movies they look to find. Perhaps the Canadian movie producer awareness trying to "de-marketer" their films but they have forgotten something very important - movies by definition are something commercial.
