It seems like this is the only movie that John Saxon ever ruled, and that he had good sense to stop then and stay in front of the camera. This movie is a dog, from start to finish, and it's dull and wild that has nothing to do with it. A hero hero of Vietnam takes a job that works for a mob boss, he gets a bit too friendly with the wife, and then the wife is killed by the boss himself and the war hero is framed and sent to prison, death row, especially. Now this particular jail has been experimenting on inmates and will test some formulas that will turn people into the ultimate killing machine (a zombie). Of course, everything goes wrong and then there are all those infected trapped in the prison, some of them will turn into zombies and the rest who suddenly just do not want to be there again. That's just going on and on and about nothing particularly to show or say for himself, and I stop it before the end, which seemed like it came a few times but no, it was apparently only getting put to take on a different and equally dull path. If anyone looks at the end may well become a zombie themselves, so do not risk it. 2 out of 10.
