Being a fan of manga and anime in Go Nagai (DEVIL MAN, DEVIL LADY, VIOLENCE JACK, etc.), I was looking forward to this one. I would see neither the manga nor the anime, so I had no notion of prejudice going in the right thing, too. What we have here is a series of funny comic movies of the type that used to turn up with alarming regularity over cable channels late at night. While it's tame compared to what gets rammed down the throats of regular cable viewers (our naughty hero's bits are either nicely tucked away behind a stratigely stuck-on or symbolic failure with a ridiculous solution effect), having extended scenes of slavery and torture that lends the procedures just enough smarminess to make it unsuitable for the kiddies. While I have nothing against host naked girls, I do not hurt to amateurically make films (there are at least four in this series). On the plus side, there's at least one stunning actress beautiful in each of the four episodes I've seen. It's no wonder Nagay's TESTICLE BOY never do it ...
