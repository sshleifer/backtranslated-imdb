Let me become clear. I've been using IMDb for years. But only today I went to the problem of registering on the site, just so I could give this movie the lowest possible rating. I saw hundreds of films, some of them bad, a few terrible. Never, though, I have seen such a contrast of fervor and incompetence, of high intent and failure. <br /> <br /> Mira Sorvino is horribly cast as the Princess, but entirely incredible as Phocion, a young boy. Fiona Shaw is still a fun character, but the dialogue of the movie is worse, even in the French insipid game that is the source (Marivaux never happened to Hollywood until now, and we should keep it that way. ) <BR> <br /> To illustrate, for example, that Leontine is a brilliant, passionate and scientist philosopher, he showed frantically pouring chemicals from the beaker baker, fame from the famous scientists . And the romance between Agis and the Princess played the same sillier. For this purpose, the pair should receive a 'Clair Danes' joint award, which in a world just should provide for gratuitously anachronist and unenspire re-interpretation of interesting youngsters from literature as brats in the 1990s (see Miss Danes's Les Miserables). Aside from the plot and dialogue, some attempts to portray artistic trends in filming. For example, there are moments when a handful of spectators are faded in and out of view of the action, sitting in chairs, watching the principal characters. The director wants us to realize he has adapted a play. I found it. But it does not happen all up to the movie. At this point, seeing a crowd of people sitting in chair for a moment, then disappearing, is to climb and distract. They like some sort of zombie crowd by scary, appearing in the misery, filling us with fear. When you see the awesome sound and songs that end up this movie, you'll want to rush your own crowd into zombies and kill them all for the injustice of grave in poisoning your mind for 112 minutes.
