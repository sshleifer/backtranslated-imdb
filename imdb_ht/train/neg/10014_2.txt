I saw this film on a drive in 1959. Until the "Howard Duck" I've been considering this worst movie I've ever seen. This movie tried to combine all the generation into one; comedy, horror, teenage engagement, and the hot rod that must have been tired "My mother, the car." Perhaps she deserves a second look to see if she's an accurate reflection in her time.
