This movie was just painful to watch ... not the right dramatic way that makes you cringe and emotions for well-developed characters in dramatic situations (yeah, I pretty much did the last sentence as I went along), but in just an absolute dull way for over two hours. Now you can all think I'm just a little ignorant review that has no respect for Shakespeare or "film-making art" ... well, you should be wrong about both counts. I love the works of Shakespeare, especially the tragedies of Romeo and Juliet, Julius Caesar, Macbeth, and Hamlet, and I watched many films "Arthouse" like the well-made eraserhead made with 8 Fellini Fellini. .. but that was just over two hours of Shakespeare lost-in-translation, too much nudity way (I can understand artistic crafts in some scenes ... but not every other shot in a press film was perfect with NO service for the press story), and basically just overzealous film-making. I had great expectations for this movie in that he was said to be "very artistic" and was an adaptation to Shakespeare's storm ... but this was just an extreme disappointment. I gave this movie a three ONLY because of the presence of Sir John Gielgud's current (which far surpassed all the names of this movie) and the movie / combination design design as it did a lot of scenes look like painting in motion ... however, a lot of this movie would have been as good as just a painting and a text roll below it. A true disappointment ... maybe if Zeffirelli gave the chair director, this would've been better. But this is one opinion member of the audience, many others can enjoy this far more than me. That being said, if you can not find this in any nearby video store (it's now not on DVD), do not try to get too far out of how you get it ... it's not really worth it.
