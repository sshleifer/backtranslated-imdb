This movie was so bad, outdated and stupid that I had time to look rough at the end. I saw this guy Rodney of Natural Terrorism was born and I thought it was funny as Hell in it, but this movie was crap. "The jokes" was not funny, the actors were not funny, nothing about it was not even funny. Do not waste your time for that! Only positive things were the lovely wives :) and Molly Shannon who I assured that her best tried, but the script was just too terrible. That's why I rated it "2" instead of "1", but it's definitely one of the worst movies I've ever seen.
