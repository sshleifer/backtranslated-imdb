I could not believe my eyes when I watched Nuremberg yesterday on Dutch television. It starts very slowly, the origins of the Nuremberg trials become clear step by step, the Germans have a comic angle, but then suddenly, in the last few minutes of the first part of the series, the audience has seen The most shocking, my terrible feet have ever seen. <br /> It is important that people get to see such footage (although I absolutely do not agree with people who declare that there is no minimum age in which children may be exposed to this kind of material), but in this film it has been completely ridikil. It was purely meant to improve the impact of an ordinary TV set. It meant that the audience's shock was very cheap and unbelievably easy. In the place of trying to move us to well-meaning scenes, inspiring or interesting insights, the audience is being tortured with terrible images of poison and poison prison camps. It does not show any respect for the Holocaust victims. <br /> I'm upset.
