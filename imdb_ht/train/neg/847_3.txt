The movie is about two fees supposed to look like - but they are not in any way expected to be smart - one is a surgeon and others are able to write a computer code. Their engineering geniuses call themselves that very exaggerated if you compare it to the personal characteristics you can see in the material of the title. <br /> I honestly did not like the style of the movie. I believe that anxiety, confusion and deep blues he brings are for a purpose, but that I do not find is why there are so many of it. The movie is cheap on stage and tells the story fundamentally no human aspect of it at all. It gives funny books such as experience. However it's visually embracing the viewer, he somehow brings it inside the blues with brief dialogue, monotonous scenes, cutting dynamics, music and abrupt noise. <br /> <br /> The scenario of the movie is very simple, most of what's happening on is being dramatically photographed for a long time, especially by confusing the effect of streamlined streamlining of drugs and dynamic cutting. <br /> I'm going to say openly that this film did not meet my expectations a little bit.
