What a disappointment! I hated the mummy but this one was even worse! It was very tedious and incredible and at some point I found myself sipping and giving all the time. I can not believe that people actually loved this movie. Nicholas Cage's role was not very convincing. The whole movie felt like a grand tour of America's most wanted building. Never stop the flow of suggestions and combinations were not very convincing either. I stopped paying attention to about 30 minutes. What was supposed to be a happy night became a total deception. What a drag ... I guess I just saw many movies enjoying National Treasure.
