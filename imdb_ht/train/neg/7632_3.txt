Many people see this as a classic, but I obviously must have missed something. Life in Anarene, Texas in the early 50's is very dull - which means that a movie about life in Anarene, Texas in the early 50's will be very mature too! What is that many people to see in this? Once the picture shows last in Anarene close there really will not be anything to do in town. Duane (Jeff Bridges) performs this point at the end of the movie. But even before it's closed there is not much to do, so basically everything revolves around sex. High school students plan how to lose their girls - sometimes with each other and sometimes with some of the adults who are equally bored in the city. You see, there is not much to do either - except for sex (sometimes with each other and sometimes with adolescents bored) or in rushing on the local school high school team. Three times something happened that I thought they were going to add some sparks to drama in the movie. Sam (Ben Johnson) died unexpectedly, but nothing really happened because of that, Sonny (Timothy Bottoms) and Jacy (Cybill Shepherd) hugged, but nothing really happened because of that Joe Bob (Barc Doyle) kidnaps a girl, but nothing really happens because of that. The only thing that added anything to the dramatic value of the movie came to the end with the Billy (Sam Bottoms) death that really points out the empty of life in this turbulent city city, as the men stand around the body look to debate where to go for breakfast. Peter Bogdanovic films this in black and white, which is my intention to believe in how hard this city is, but the only thing I found interesting was the early look of actors such as Under, Shepherd, Bridges and Randy Quaid . (As a sidewalk he was scared to see how many Quaid - in 1971 - actually looks like his character in Eddie's cousin in the National Family Vacation Movie.) Classic? I do not think so! 3/10
