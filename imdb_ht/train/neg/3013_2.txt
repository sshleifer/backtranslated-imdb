Starting with long open injections of seemingly endless rows of assembly line workers in a Chinese factory, manufactured landscapes attempt to show the devastating impact of industrialization on the natural environment and traditional societies. Droning narrative he thinks that industrial development in China and elsewhere is entirely unprecedented, as if there has never been an industrial revolution in Europe and America and Karl Marx has never visited the British Museum. This would have been a connection between the current Asian driving for industrialization and wealth and earlier experience of hunger and horror never mentioned. At the same time, there is an effort to introduce Edward Burtynsky's industrial waste to somehow "beautiful". Many of the movie is a slip show of these images. They are well produced, in size museums, and they appear to appear on several exhibitions. For me, however, they only demonstrate that almost any picture can be made to appear beautifully if properly presented. Industrial waste is still industrial waste. The relationship, if any, between the pictures and the talking voice message remains clear. <br /> I do not mean to say that there are no real issues and sometimes desperate when the country is industrialized. Manufacturers, however, offer only desperate and bitter despair. It's such an hourly conference by Noam Chomsky. Perhaps it has some value as a demonstration of evil and the American (and Canadian) Left.
