The far 1973 tracker "Cleopatra Jones" has statuesque black actress Tamara Dobson returns to his signature role as chic, super-hard narcotics agent, here's a heroine ring in Hong Kong. Cross-pollination of action-flickering action film and Kung Fu-film is fun at the beginning, but eventually flags. Finally the shot-out is right off the assembly line, and Dobson himself looks less energetic than before (it's still sexy and puts a unique turn on his comic-treaty dialogue, but these settings may have been too much One thing for her - she was jaded). Stella Stevens plays villainess at this time; It's good, but it can not match Shelley Winters to the Predecessor. ** from ****
