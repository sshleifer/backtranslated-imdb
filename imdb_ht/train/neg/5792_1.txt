Another made for the junk TV feature! This is a diarrhea in a war movie (I use the word movie in it's possible form possible!) I thought the Telly Savalas's career was struck under rock when he made the voice over on Birmingham's video visit show on Tarrant on TV on a regular semi basis, but then I would forget he was involved in this! I would try to push it into my subconscious memory, but cable TV brings the memory kicking and screaming from me !! I love the bit (sarcastic laughing) of the movie that claims to be a Liverpool scene in the forties, but it's blatantly a shot in Zagreb cathedral in the late eighties. Also the steam train commuter is training on the JZ show (Jugoslavia Zeleznice, or the Yugoslav State Railroad) logo on the side of the locomotive clearly, though the musicians tried to black out. Why is not just film in the UK, if it's where most of the movie is set? <br /> <br /> Cheap garbage, with a garbage of seluloid!
