Beat the bad guys ... Again is the tag line for this movie, and it's very much exposed to it. <br /> <br /> Home alone with two, classic movie. Home alone three and four, a good movie if you are three! Like Sharkboy and Lavagirl, as hard as it tries to be funny, it's not. Culkin is replaced by Alex D'Linz or something else. It's a very pretty actor and bold performance, but it's not entirely his fault, the writing is called for bold and swollen expressions. The pranks just copy from the first two with different crooks and you would have to be blind to think these chicken pox are real. A good choice if you are a preschool teacher in which is showing this movie on a rainy day. And doing things worse, a totally different cast, go see if you do not believe me, but you'll regret it.
