This can not be the worst movie Peter Sellers has ever done (I think Laurel goes to "The Prisoner of Zenda"), but it's probably the most depressing. Sellers, especially senseless makeup as Nayland Smith, seems to have just undergone chemotherapy. As Fu Manchu, it appears hardly better and spends most of the movie (the exception of these unusual disturbing scenes where it was troubled and electrically) on the way to falling under the weight of all that makeup. Players also look tired and run down, and South Caeser's presence is offensive even without its constant reference to "Chinks!" (A sharp spots: this should be one of the last times a great picture of Obama would be showing as insultingly ... or, for that matter, a non-Asian star as one!). The film looks surprisingly cheap, with subtle photography and drabs lying - the same elvis-bang Elvis number at the end looks off-rate. Only the stunning Helen Mirren and the tall, slim, guy guy who finds his pants wet add no spark of life to this sad affair. All in all, this film gives a strange warning to the death of a great comic, with a same eerier document of his death.
