Whenever a movie is so myopic in its desire to present a particular finish or opinion that it simply does not bother with a current story, it's annoying. Those are types of movies where the finish or first-born views, and the story simply tacked over. For this reason we often talk about the story "jumping in hoops" as it twists on, trying in vain to progress in the preordone finish of a logical mode. The story of "Comet Over Broadway" is not just jump in hoops, it's a circus three rings. It is so funny, so ill-design, so the embarrassment that, if you are prone to talk well on the screen, you will be carrying on a guarantee before it's been in. <br /> <br /> The central theme of this scenario is Cesspool is that a woman chooses between family and profession. Since it's so horriblely muddled it will end up being offensive to the person either. So, in the end there is no point in the story, the theme becomes irrelevant and, as is often the case with poor scenes, the act does not save something.
