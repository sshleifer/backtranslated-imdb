The original five really good Man made them uneven as an ensemble in Hollywood. Even John Ford has never done so much with so much quality. The curious thing about them all is how uneven are. The Ford I Darling Clementine is worth about two and a half of any of them. Or at least two. <br /> <br /> The real hero of them besides Mann and Stewart is Chase. Chase was responsible for the brilliant Red River. Chase was writing far from land, bending to the river, and probably some others. But none of them are as finished as Darling I Clementine, but then very few films, west or otherwise. <br /> <br /> Each of the five films of Man has huge gaps, or is it six, allowed to see. Bend, far, Man in the West, Furies, Winchester 73, and Yep, Six, Nude Spur. Each has magnificent scenes after magnificent scenes, and fairly fair exchange. But so Red River, which is still the only bigger western ever to do. So perfection is not everything. <br /> But the country is far big, big holes. It's mawkish, and really comes alive only when Stewart and Mc Entire are blocking cone. The rest is beautiful pedestrian, with the usual exception of Mann's camera. The camera camera is a string of people in the movies. It is about as an eye like anyone ever got behind a strip of movie moving. It is almost never in the wrong place, never. <br /> <br /> The far country has an amazing moment. And as usual it comes from Stewart. Nobody in the history of movies has ever received physical punishment and authority in that person. It's absolutely amazing: watch it in Bend, far, Winchester, and people from Laramie: in Bend being beaten up and hanged by a cloth so confident and hated to boil as it looks like someone who moves from Dachau, in Far It is shot on a raft and violence, it seems so compelling that you wince, and of course when it is dragged into the fire of Man, well you find yourself looking for the burn brands. What an actor. Not to mention the moment at Winchester when it was beat in the hotel room earlier, as well as anybody ever made it. But the man's territory was: watch Gary Cooper fight with Jack Lord of the Western Man. As painful as any battle scene ever recorded. Cooper while not quite as convincing as Stewart, somehow is somehow equal to him in looking tired at the end of the battle. In short, nobody has anyone, but nobody has ever seen people in extreme as well as man. <br /> What a great, great director. <br /> See every western he ever did. They are his real monuments, though all are unwilling. But so. When it comes to Roaring and his big scene is as good as anybody, including Ford. And its six western as a best ensemble ever performed by anyone, period. <br /> Thanks, Anthony.
