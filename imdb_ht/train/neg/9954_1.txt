From the beginning to the end, this is the most emotionally overwrought movie about NOTHING I've ever seen. Characterization and interaction between the title character and character Marthe Kller are turtles pure. The hallway as metaphorical gadget is so overplayed that it's borderline cliche, but Pollack's director treats each spin turn as if it was something very important. Maybe there's some value for a MSFT3000 re-play at some of the scenes, such as Pacino getting in touch with her inner girl, for value worth. But even like injury humor is difficult to find in this total turkey.
