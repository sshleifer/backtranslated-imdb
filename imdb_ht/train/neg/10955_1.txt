This is the story of two guys who found a copy of 'Funky Monkey.' Finding this seemed odd at the time when we figured that there are still posters for the movie at the Odeon Cineplex site. After seeing these classics as 'all manner but loose' and 'Project X,' these guys are two faces of movies and monkeys are scared. These guys were in for a long ride as they watched this movie. Some monkeys have been replaced by a MAN suppressed when the sequence of actions was asked. It seemed that the monkey was not trained at school in Shakespearean act. Maybe substituting the monkey and Ben Affleck may have helped the guys think. <br /> <br /> Maybe a strong sidekick would help like a Jackie Chan or maybe even Hogan Hulk. This odds had amazing martial arts and Jet she looked-a-like Matthew Modine. While some may argue that Matthew Modine does not come near Jet Li, camera tricks prove that it is every bit as good. When it becomes obvious that an untrained chimp can not handle the movie, the film leans on Matthew Modine to be the real star. <br /> <br /> Do I mention that some dorky kid has developed a bond with Modine and the Monkey? Is there a possibility that the kid learns confidence and even chooses a girl in this movie? Even Matthew Modine should be jealous of this one (because using the pick-up line 'I'm second in a monkey' does not seem to work with the ladies.) Shortly after watching that The two men's films had a phone call in Matthew Modine telling them 'Seven days.'
