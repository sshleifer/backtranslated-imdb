When his wife discovered the film coils, she had to quickly come up with a story. He stated that he had a movie called "The Brain That Will not Die."

Summary Summary: The main character's mistress was killed in a terrible car crash (which he caused by ignoring the signs clearly posted). He grabs his head from the wreckage and reanimates it. After resuscitation of the head, he goes and picks up a bunch of hookers. That's pretty much what's going on for the rest of the film. In the end, he fights and is killed by a monster who lives in the closet. The monster appears and little has no explanation. However, the monster saves a hooker and I assume that they will live happily ever after. <br /> <br /> Score Score: The end credit credit claim that the movie is called the "head that would not die". /> <br /> I hate this movie!
