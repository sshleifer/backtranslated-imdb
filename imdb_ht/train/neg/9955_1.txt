The whole thing is pretty much the look .. European shot was a good idea. Lead actors are attractive. The note is serviceable. <br /> <br /> But after that SPOKE! And the plot does not develop! And it was all downhill from there. Pacino is sleepwalking and Keller keeps talking about how bored she is..hello, dear, you are not alone. By doing a imitation Mae West, you may have to hide your face, and it's painful to look. <br /> I can not imagine how either actor or director Sydney Pollack participated with this, or a better question, why did she end up stinking so badly? <br /> Since the death is represented in almost every scene, one way or another, perhaps you're supposed to have fun here. Maybe it's supposed to feel as empty and cold as death. But I still can not recommend it.
