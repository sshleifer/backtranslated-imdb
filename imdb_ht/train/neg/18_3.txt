This is an art film that was either made in 1969 or 1972 (National Film Preservation Foundation says 1969 and IMDb says 1972). Regardless of the exact date, the movie definitely seems to be very indicative of this time-general period - with some work-based camera-and pop-ups of early 60s-early 70s. The movie consists of three simple images that distort using different strange camera tricks. These distorted images are accompanied by music and there is absolutely no dialogue or draw of any sort. This was obviously intended as almost as a form of performing arts, and as most performing arts, it's interesting at first but quickly becomes tedious. The film, put it even more rudely, is a total make and would appeal not to one but perhaps those who have made the movie, family and friends and maybe a few just too hip and "with it" They must be understood by us mortals.
