When my wife and I decided to watch this movie we thought she could not fail. I love Billy Crystal, my wife loves Julia Roberts and everyone we talked and said they liked it. <br /> <br /> We were deceiving ourselves, in shades. <br /> <br /> In my part, I felt the Billy Crystal character was incredibly dimensional and made very little for the movie. Sure, he split a couple of good jokes, but as a character he did nothing but took up space. <br /> And poor Julia Roberts. In her past shows she plays well as a strong-self-determined, self-determined lady. In this flicker, it seems completely abused and there was very little fire. This is not Julia Roberts that my wife enjoys watching. <br /> OK, if I found one good thing, it should be Christopher Walken. Now this is entertainment. But just like Billy Crystal, hardly anything to show off his character. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a stupid laughing night and lots of small shoppers, go see it. But if you are looking for a romantic comedy, this is not your movie. Not at the highest.
