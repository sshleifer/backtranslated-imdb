I love Billy Crystal, and I thought she would have fun to watch this movie, since I know she admits Alan King and should be funny together. I thought I had seen Billy's movies but could not remember this one, and now I know why. It is so full of clarity and fraudulent emotions; you can smell every upcoming scene (and go!). Billy does not even get to be funny very often. She is too busy trying to cry tears or show her anguish of how cute her dad let her down. Alan King himself is fairly likable, as the subplot of being an extra of these films. But what a coincidence that Billy just came to visit his father as a great health crisis takes place, etc. etc. Or two occupying doctors can just shut down the practices of moon around in LA. But when the end comes, boy, it comes fast! Almost as though the writers realized they had painted themselves in a corner and the only way to make a death scene. Especially disappointing with a few glimmers of good humor.
