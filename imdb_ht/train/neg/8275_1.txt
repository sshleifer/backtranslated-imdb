(First of all, my bad English excuse) Of course, only a movie that begins Jessica Simpson can include serious goofs like this .. I'm a norwegian and I felt discouraged and shocked the musicians in this movie did not take time in research on making this American / "Norwegian" movie. Even Wikipedia is more accurate when it comes to real estate. So I posted my correction from my frustration: -The country was called Norway, not Norwegia. - "Da" is Russian, not Norway. -New priests never use these black hoods and white paper in the neck as the Protestant church is the dominant not far - It's true we have a traditional folk traditional outfit (that we only use like twice a year), but the outfit of this movie is more like a German outfit. - I could not understand so-called "Norwegian" in this movie .. Jessica did not make any sense .. neighter made the "Norwegian priests" <br /> <br /> The only thing I acknowledge is the flag Norway (and the couple Vikings, but this is so stereotypical that people think about norway - Vikings !: O gosh) <br /> <br /> Well .. I guess who made this movie has never read that to comment. but at least I shone some things up and got rid of some of this frustration. <br /> I am proud of my country and I would like to see if the United States was less stereotypical and more precise when it comes to talking about this country. <br /> <br /> That's all .. Lenge up Norge! ; p
