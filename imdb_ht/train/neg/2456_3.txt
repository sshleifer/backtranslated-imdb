I saw this film during an Interim Tolkien-themed class during my college sophomore year. I sat unfortunately close to the screen and my teacher chose me to serve as a boy whipped - everyone else laughed, but they were not in constant eye. <br /> <br /> Let's get it out of the way: Peter 'The Lord of the Rings Movie' does have to be something of the movie Bakshi. In Jackson's version of the Fellowship of the Ring, for example, the scene in which the Black Rider attacked the empty guest beds is almost a complete carbon copy of the scene of Bakshi's film, shot by shot. You might call this plagiary or homework, depending on your agenda. <br /> I'm sure the similarities do not stop there. I'm not going to do any research to find out what they are, because that means I have some mark in respect of this movie. I'm sure others have described the similarities-look around. This movie is a complete trainer trains across the metaphor, and many, many people have died in the crash. I've decided to list what I can remember in a more or less chronological fashion - if I left anything else that saved me because I was completely overwhelmed, confronted with a wealth of failure (and, at high points, mediocrity). * Due to the heavy use of rotoscoping, Gandalf is not a gentleman, wise wizard but a deeply flailing prophet of bankruptcy (whose inexplicable hat has changed color once or twice during the course of the movie). <br /> <br /> * Saruman White is sometimes referred to as 'Aruman' during the film, without explanation. She puts purple and red for some mysterious reasons. <br /> <br /> Sam is flat out horrible. The portrait of his friendship with Frodo is unusual child and satisfying. Yes, the hobbits are small as children, but they are not kids. <br /> <br /> * Merry and Pippin never introduced - they simply appeared during a scene change and a one-phrase explanation. This movie is filled with mosaic corrections like this. Frodo, Sam, Pippin and Merry are singing merrily as they jump on the road. One of the hobbits procures a lute at least twice as great as it is out behind him - which was not visible before - and starts strumming in typical fantasy fashion as they all break into "la-la-la" s. AWFUL. * Aragorn, apparently, is an American Indian dressed in a fabulous stereotyped fabulous (no pants), filling with big, square girdle pearl belt. It is arguably the worst sword of the entire movie - often it turns out one wobbly swing in before being hit flat on his ass. <br /> <br /> * Black riders appear more like lepers than menacing instruments of evil. They are widespread at a slow pace. This is disturbing to be sure, but not scary. <br /> <br /> * The scene before the Black Riders tried to cross the Ford of Bruinen (through which they set off Frodo, who is on the other side of the horse) going on forever, during which time rider They are behind the horses in vaguely viciously and ... do nothing else. The scene was probably intended to illustrate Frodo's decline as it fell into her wounds. It seems that they have more plodding than anything else. <br /> <br /> * Gimli the nose is just as tall as the Legolas Elf. It's a DWARF. There is simply no excuse for that. It also looks like a David to accelerate the Gnome. It's a bit, but accurate description. Boromir appears to be pilfering Elmer Fudd's Viking gun from which epic bunny epic Bunny. It looks ridiculous. <br /> * Despite the similarity of Tolkien's illustrations, Balrog's lead is induced and the least threatening threat to the entire movie. It seems that someone puts pink slipper slippers, and it's barely higher than Gandalf. "Purists" can prefer this Balrog, but I'll take Jackson's version any day. <br /> <br /> * The battle scene is awkward and nasty. Almost none of the characters show any level of skill and weapons. I do not ask for action-packed scenes like those of Jackson's movie, but they are supposed to fight. <br /> <br /> * Treebeard makes a very short appearance, and I'm sorry he's bothered to show up at all. Watch the movie, you will see what I mean. <br /> Well, now for the good parts of the movie. <br /> <br /> * Some of the voice act very good. It's not Aragorn bad sounds, it just looks kind of like the Jolly Green Giant. <br /> <br /> * Galadriel is a bit interesting in this painting; Like Tom Bombadil, it seems immunity to the ring's power in temptation, and his voice actress is not terrible either. <br /> <br /> The Boromir die is not as heart wrenching as in Jackson's paintings at the same scene, but it's still as dramatic (and more true of her death in the book, though I'm not believe Jackson had made a mistake shot his way. <br /> <br /> * As my teacher pointed out (between the threat of earning), the orcs (especially in the helmet's bottom, if I'm correct) look like the dead warriors that ravaged in soldiers, a policy statement that works very well if you realize what has been tried. While this is not really a positive point on the movie, Bakshi can not blame for the majority of these failures in this movie, or so I said - the project was about a budget Tight and late in its production has lost creative control of some of the highest-ups (which I certainly did not read the books). Let me be clear: I respect Bakshi for even trying soming Hing in this magnitude. I simply have a hard time believing she was happy with the final product. <br /> <br /> Overall, I can not in any way recommend adapting this blasphemous to the Tolkien classic trilogy even for laughter, unless you've read the books and have your own visualization of the characters, places and events. I'm sure someone, somewhere, will pick a copy of this up in confusion; if you do, keep an open mind and pick up what good you can come out of it.
