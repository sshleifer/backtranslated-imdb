Laid up with drugs out, like a kidney stone has changed the way he did in my scratchy urge to my, and absolutely nothing better to do than let the suicidal painkillers in semi-oblivion, I managed to keep this film on cable . I would not want anyone to think I paid to see it in a movie, or rent it, or ?? the sky is forcing! ?? that I watched it STRAIGHT. <br /> Having played this sensationally horrible video game and evidently digging the rooms with scary home passage, fighting trolley (Type 27), stinging person (Type 041), and other impossible sentinel, My curiosity was keen as how the game would transfer to the movie screen. <br /> <br /> The banal plot revolves around a group of "crazy kids"? a Scooby Doo ?? go to a remote island for a world-shaken "shaking"? whatever it is. (You kids today with your hula-hoops and your mini skirt and Bo Boone you ??) After paying a boat boat thousands of cash ferries have (a sort that begs its own network of speeches), they get the "divage" desert. <br /> <br /> Because mentioned is made in a "house" ?? Presumably the Titanic's Home? but most of the action takes place on lying out fake and other divorced sites from any pretending to haunting residence. <br /> A camera camera dropped act as restore filler, showing the island in the truises of a ?? party? Is it? Oh, so this "divorced" thingy is just a "party"? In the grand tradition of re-euphemizing "used cars" as "pre-owned", or "shock shock" as "post-traumatic stress disorder", the word "part" is now too square for your drug addled, silicone- implanted, jagoffs metrosexual? <br /> <br /> It is learned that the party has broken up by zombie rampaging. Clever thinking to stop here ?? <br /> I do not think the pinheads call themselves Screenwriters and directors to understand the myths behind zombie re-animation. Zombies can not die? they're already un-dead. They are not bleeding, they do not know pain. Unless the bodies are completely canceled, they will continue to host. At least that is what Jamaican priestly priest told me. That means that a 45 inch of "heart" will not stop them, nor will they be a machete in the torso. With a shotgun explosion in the chest will certainly NOT carry blood. At least in the video game logic, the shooter pumps many rounds into each monster that it is completely decimated, leaving a heartbeat that can not re-amass itself. But each actor-cut-model becomes the Matrix-circular-camera moment, killing zombies on all fronts and single bullets and karate chops in the bronze. Seriously, these zombies are more effective than the Stormtroopers from "Back to the Jedi", who get knocked out when Ewoks travels. <br /> I think the movie writer, Mark Altman, had been punched out too - "Free Interests", felt that they had to make a reference to Captain Kirk, in character of Jurgen Prochnow, who was needed The latter currency desperately was succumbed to this aromatic eraser. There is also a reference to the prime prime role of the beautiful "Das Boot", when one of the incoming B-actors mentioned that it "looks like a Captain U-boat". "I wonder how many of the movie's target audience in pig-pig's eye pick up on any of the other snap references in other films, such as when Prochnow states," Say hello to my little friend, "featuring his gun machine gunpoint. /> <br /> Aimed in a demographic that does not have this understanding to understand the meaning of Sisyphean in the game video concept (meaning the game ends when you die ?? you can not win), this is simply a movie slasher for the mindless and stupid heart.Accordingly, everyone dies in due course, except for a heterosexual pair of Attractive White People. <br /> A better use for this movie without misuse of budgeting would be The throw in Acting School, although the left breast Ona Grayer did a great job, as did her right breasts and scenes staged: Priceless! I especially liked the final scene and Ona tries to act like It was stuck, but looking like it just eats ice cream too fast. <br /> <br /> Attempts to do something more constrictive and my time, I pulled out my Digitally-restored, 35th Anniversary, special edition, Anamorphic screen DVD in "Manos: but they are in jail." Ah yes! ?? The drugs have been brain-numbing-now has there been some kind of movie-making? <br /> <br /> (manic film, visit: www.poffysmoviemania.com)
