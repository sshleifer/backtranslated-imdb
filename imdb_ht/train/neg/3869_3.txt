This is the 2nd time I've seen this movie in about 12 years. These remarks come from someone who finds Kane and Ambersons to be amazing, worthy movie. But the rest of Welles career is, unfortunately, wasted on diy materials in his talent, and too flimsy to withstand his smoother smoker. But when it does a potboiler like Shanghai, the lack of considerable things hang her tricks on it is just kind of sad. I could not tell you what he was exploring here. It's all as familiar as the Irish wailing struggle; which takes a lot of effort, but adds absolutely zero to the movie. Several project wells became this underdeveloped and baroque. Mr Arkadin (select a version, any version) is a similar project. The material is inconsequential. It just can not bring the weight to all this noodling. For a director's director of reality based drama (as here), he never feels any pull tied to his pack in concert back to reality; or in a coherent story. The murder-to-hire scheme is ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Kudos Welles though, to have Hayworth cut her hair, and catch that performance out of her. The camera likes it. It is the most sorting, the most upscale, the fatigue and the ravishing femme fatale ever put on film. But her treachery comes late in the movie she feels like some desperate decision, made for the movie there are some genres she fits in. The film can not be saved by a noir conference deployed in the last 60 seconds. <br /> <br /> When all said and done in L.F.S., their allies for what? to convince you to see something thoughtful? give Welles more to do? do you roll your eyes? Welles have no sensitivity to the scale of a story, or tell a story directly. One of the wonderful things that Shanghai told anyone who was not a billionaire crippled, arranged a fourth-cross-murdered-for-hire plot, or a fanboy in love and movie theater devoid of meaning or substance. <br /> <br /> Overwrought, preposterous, unengaging.
