This sport is a beautiful, deep throw, but for a thriller you better save more than actors name and talk. The first third of this film was nothing but talking, and more talk. Most of this was a bunch of women bitching on everything with each other. <br /> <br /> The first five actors listed here are women so verify that it's really a "chick flick" and little else. This probably plays on the entire lifetime network. There was a quick-blooded murder scene and then more talk. By half, they have lost me. <br /> <br /> By the way, Sally Gardens looked around 15 in here.
