Notorious for over a quarter century (and often prohibited), it's obscure its greatest advantages. Hey, it is often best to be talk about, rather than actually seeing when you can not become the "legend" up and substance. The movie played in Los Angeles a couple of times lately, and is available on home video, so that the veil slowly got up. While there are still many offensive masses, it is more likely to make them, than excite real passion. Except for a sex scene clipboard and sex XXX between a pair of horses ("Any Nature Documentary" anybody?), It follows almost an hour of a wedding band tied marriages. Once having sex with nudity begins, it is a continuous sequence involving masturbation, a looooooooong flashback to an alleged 'beauty and encounters of the beast, and a naked woman running around the castle (nobody, even his supposedly Aunt protection, seems to even think of putting some clothes on it!). On video, I guess you can be fast-forward to the banality, but it's not really worth the effort. The stripping does not go beyond what's seen in something more solid as Bertolucci's DREAMERS. <br /> Try as one might find some 'moral' or 'symbols' of the carnality, I doubt it's worthy of anyone's effort. Unfortunately, for BETE, now that you can easily see the movie, was notorious of something 'prohibited' was awakened. And this beast was tamed.
