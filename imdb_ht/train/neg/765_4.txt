Seriously what they thought? During the year in the series Colombo tried out some new things and diverted away from the normal formula but this movie really overpower it. This film is basically very different from any other Kolumbo movie but the differences are not for the good of the movie. <br /> <br /> Main thing that of course makes this movie different from any other Kolumbo movie is the fact that there are no murders being committed. The entire company in this movie is totally different and puts the Columbo character in a totally complete situation and totally. Also the general is just totally different and more 'upgraded'. Director Alan J. Levi has made some other Columbo movies in the past, which is very much sticked in the usual formula. He also made it an odd choice that he took to direct this film. <br /> <br /> The Columbo character itself also feels quite different, perhaps because of the reason he gets put in a totally different situation and situations, when he helps out his nephew after his bride disappears right after the wedding. The absence of some good relieved and humorous Columbo trademark also does not exactly make this a good or enjoyable look. <br /> In all honesty, the movie does not start too bad, but the movie begins to become more and more ridiculous and its history as it progresses. It's like a stupid writing kidnapping-thriller and a story that begins to become more and more easy. He also makes the movie more and more unwatchable. This is a little interesting colonbo entry that also really does not know to entertain its viewers in any way. <br /> It also does not help much that the actors are supported by the most talented people around. Despite the fact that his character is put in such a totally different situation and the film is shot in a completely different style, Peter Falk still holds up well and his presence is still somewhat saved this movie. Can you just imagine how this movie would have been without him? It would be a very bad and ridiculous movie movie I can tell you. <br /> <br /> An odd columnar entry, which could be described as a failed experience for diverting from the usual formula. <br /> /> 4/10
