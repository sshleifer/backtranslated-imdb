I'd never heard of that, then found out of the man with the deadly lens, which I would hear from seeing. Connery's presence drove me to buy it, and it's not good. He wants to make a sort of cross between Dr. Strangelove and Mash, but it's just not funny, unless you find the Wombat general (?) Funny name. It comes across as a comedy 70s thriller until the last ten minutes, when it springs into life. There are many, very flat scenes in Whitehouse between the president and his help not working. It's almost as if the initial cut was too long, and the first half was edited down to get to all the scenario ransom storyline and the suicidal bomber attack, which I think they meant to be played for laughing, But again, it's not that funny. The movie where is excellent but the studio stuff looks cheap TV. I could not believe the man responsible for Key Largo, Firefighters and Elmer Gantry did. Only laugh: Connery throws away his wigs before putting on his helmet and jumping out of an airplane. He does not say Never again look like genius.
