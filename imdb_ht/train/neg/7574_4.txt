But it has some good action and a plot that is a bit interesting. Nevsky acts as a builder body and it is not all that attractive, in fact, IMO, it is UGLY. (his acting skills misses everything!) Sascha is playing very well by Joanna Pacula, but he needs more lines than he has given, the character he needs to be developing. There are so many ways in this story, there are zero romances, too much action, and way too mute to a finish. It's very violent. I liked however love the scenery, this film takes you all over the world, and that's a bonus. I also liked how he had some things about the mafia in it, not too much or too little, but enough that he got my attention. The actors need more beautiful ... The biggest problem I had that Nevsky was just too normal, not sexy enough. I think that for most guys, Sascha will be warm enough, but for our ladies who are fans of action, Nevsky just does not cut it. In general, this movie was fine, I did not love him or I hated it, just found it to be another normal flick of action.
