I basically find Eden's curve to be a very badly constructed which made it hard to look. However, there is something I must tell about how the director was capturing something about the atmosphere of the early 70's of the choice of environment and clothing. The "Return to Earth" philosophy and interest in sexual exploration and drugs that have not been dramatically decadent, as described in many later versions of the 70's were good on, as was "not demanding to say" pseudo-liberalism of the brotherhood made up of intellectual east-east, except that I would think this was most likely to be a New England school rather than one in Virginia, where I imagine the "good male boy" mentality still dominating the same elite school as this one. Another thing I appreciate and could relate to is that this was a time when homosexuality was not linked to lots of leather or dragon queens and I appreciate some homosexual roles not related to the images so terribly overused. I felt that she was very unfortunate that "gay culture" took on certain standard forms of the 80 from Castro and Christopher Streets and define the movement and leaving out many gay numbers that were much more moderate in their lives . I appreciate the film primarily as a way to remember the most natural way we were about our sexuality and personal relationship without the "scene."
