An incoherent mess and a radiant bloody murder track, "Soul Survivor" is the latest entry of "who's dead and who is alive" genre of horror movie. Two young couples, Sean and Cassie and Matt and Annabel, are preparing to go to college different, but before they go through Thanksgiving Break, they go to one last cast at a party to divert into some churches burnt at the suggestion lusciously slave Annabel (Eliza Dushku, aka faith, the other vampire). Motiveless guys began to pay too much attention to Cassie (Melissa Sagemiller's generic) for reasons never explained, and before long, the quartet left the party. Driving away from the SUVs, they are prosecuted and then passed by the creepy motivation guys, who promptly and inexplicably make an intentional 180 among the highways, causing a nasty and fatal crash as the SUV bends on a ditch and dive into a river. Sean is dead (or is he?), And Cassie spends the rest of the film to survive with loneliness and guilt (he drives) when he is not being haunted by Sean's ghost or chasing by guys. Many incomplete inoffices as Cassie's mental state degenerate more, until we reach the predictable conclusion. So who died and who is alive? After 90 minutes of this purgatory, is currently cares?
