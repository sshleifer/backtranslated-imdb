This rank as one of the worst movies I've seen over the years. In addition to Cuba and Angie, the current is actually embarrassing. Was not Archer once a decent actress? What happened to her? The action is decent but completely implausible. The iron is so bad it's worth mentioning. I mean, who ever thought about the makeup of a contemporary movie. Someone should say to the artist, with the DOP that you do not actually expect to see. The finish is a massive deception - on the lines of "and then they realize it was all a dream" <br /> do not waste your time or money. You are better just set in space for 2 hours.
