This is a movie about wickedness. Under the speech of a marathon race, we see imagination of extreme animal abuse, including literally running a horse in death IN SLOW MOTION. The guy who did this then his consciousness was spiritually healed by the flames from the burial of the horse, which of course is still dead, being tortured to death. This is one of the most sickest movies, slimiest I've ever been scared of watching. As Gene Hackman and James Coburn near the finish line on their ding creatures, we are supposed to admire their minds to finish the race. I would like to include producers and directors in a marathon race; I'll decide when they're finished, probably about 20 minutes after they stop breathing.
