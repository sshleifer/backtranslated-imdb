I found it a real job to sit in this movie. The sound track was not the best and some of the accents made it difficult to understand what was being said. There was little to move the plot together and often the action simply stopped and had an extended period of conversation that seemed to be anxiety in the movie. These conversations have changed between family groups and the observer has left attempts and pieces along what the thread has been tied together. It's rare that I miss a movie that's low and do this in this case as the whole experience looks let me think "So what" and "why I was wasting my time watching this."
