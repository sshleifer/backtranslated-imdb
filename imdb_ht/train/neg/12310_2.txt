Steve Martin should leave trying to make remakes of classic comedy. It absolutely does not fit this part. Like the rumor pampered in August of Towners, this film fell flat on her face. How anyone has ever thought Steve Martin could even come close to Jack Lemmon's beautiful performance is beyond me and the same is true for this movie. Dan Ackroyd was able to play the best part of Bilko's party. Martin is great when making his own original character, but miserably trying to recreate the classics of others. It's a sad statement when the funniest part of a movie is in the first line of credit when the movie is over. The line "Producers gratefully acknowledge the total lack of cooperation by the US Army" was just on the line only that actually made me laugh. If you want to see the real Bilko, get caught up in the original episodes of the Phil Silvers Show. These guarantors make you laugh, unlike this error that should never happen. I put this movie in the same category as the aforementioned lemmon classic and noticed in Psico. None of them should ever happen.
