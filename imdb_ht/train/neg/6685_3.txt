Although the film takes place in a "Ivy League" college, it was in fact entirely in northern Arizona, especially in Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff in the fall of 1976. I was involved in the theater theater there, and most Of the extra expenses of the movie is then-member of the theater theater. <br /> There is an absolutely funny scene in this movie (if you know your Arizona geography) showing members casting several bike rides at a college. We NAU'ers know that the campus and said Creek (Actually Oak Creek Canyon) are about 35 miles apart, and while the tour has all down, it would literally be impossible to ride a bike back UP road!
