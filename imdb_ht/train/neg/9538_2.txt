When I saw the commercial for that, I was all about to see it. Now, forgive me, but it has been long since I've seen it that I do not remember how it goes. Try to say, the movie I saw to see no resemblance to the "movie" was sold to me. <br /> I was bored, annoyed, and incredibly disappointed in this movie. But if it was not bad enough, it was shedding it even further with that awful music reggae. Not exactly humor-set music for a horror movie, eh mon? I guess if you never saw the commercial (or trailer, I suppose) you might think that's some hot thing. For my money, the commercial was the best way.
