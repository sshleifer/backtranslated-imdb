I watched this film really late last night and usually if it's the end then I'm pretty forgiving in movies. Although I tried, I just could not stand this movie at all, it kept getting worse and worse as the movie went on. Although I know he is supposed to be a comedy but I did not find it very funny. It was also an especially unrealistic, and portrayed in rural life. In this case that's what any of us think of the country's life as it's definitely not. I have to agree that some of the cast members were nice, but the French guy was really fake. I have to agree that he tried to have a good lesson in the story, but overall my recommendation is that no one on 8 looked at it, it's just too annoying.
