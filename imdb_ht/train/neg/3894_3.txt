The incredible man is playing as an episode of six million men, but with violence and some nudity. I know that this movie is a bit crummy but I find it impossible by its kind of love. Acting and scripting are not the best. But the effects are good for a 30 year old movie that has a budget of $ 50 - the title character takes quite a while while it's actually melting, but when it's making it reasonably impressive; We also have a single invented death scene involving electrocution. In notes is also the music, it's crazy - a cheesy-tasting medley in nonsense. <br /> <br /> Check out the slow-lying nurse that jumps into a window of ice for absolutely no reason too. <br /> <br /> * Be surprised by a day in the life of a head off. <br /> <br /> * Beware of psychotic fusion of the humanoid mucus. Named Steve. <br /> <br /> * Be surprised when our hero takes a break from hunting the melting cliff has a bowl of soup and complaining about insufficient biscuits in the kitchen. It's just over 70 years that I hate it. It's tacky and trashy but I thought it was a lot of fun. You could do a lot worse.
