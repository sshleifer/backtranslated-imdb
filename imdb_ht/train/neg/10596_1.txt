Van Damme. What else can I say? Bill Goldberg. GENESIS. Now we know this movie will be really awful. <br /> I saw the first five minutes of this movie about TBS, knowing it would be bad. But not even I thought it would be that bad. The plot is awful, Van Damme gets old (ultimately), but unlike Arnold, his cinema as well. <br /> <br /> Forget this movie. Do not see it. Ever. I would not even pay for this film. <br /> <br /> 1/5 stars - in her heart lies a wonderful ride, action-packed ride. <br /> Well, maybe not, but the markets would be sure to think so, would not they? <br /> <br /> John Ulmer
