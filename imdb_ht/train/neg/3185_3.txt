This movie was just heckled by MST3K and good reason. First and foremost because it is a movie "cop" starring Joe Don Baker, which we all know is about as a cop hero as Michael Jackson is a western singer of the country. reindeer traps, fighting bar, child hostage in shooting outs, bad acting, lame police officer, bad acting, revenge / justice, endless goons, and of course, bad acting. Do not watch this without a MST3K folks folks.
