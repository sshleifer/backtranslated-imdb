It seems there's a bit of a curse out there when it comes to gay movies. So happy fills are not very common. Wonderfully excluded, gay films tend to end in broken relationships or bad deaths. And some, like Come Undone, just end ... period. The creators of this piece of wonder in the nonsense have something or two to learn about plots, directions, and timelines. In the first ten minutes of this film, I found myself somewhat confused, and even more so after the first glimpse of the character Jeremie Elkaim with a small shot shot. It looks like this film randomly pieced along without the slightest attempt of continuity or consistency. There is no real way to say when you look at the present or some sort of volatile flachback. I could only take a lot before it became really unappealing. Stephen Holden of the New York Times called this film "... shimmeringly nice and utterly real." Well, it seems that Stephen invests in beer glasses before they look, as this is really far from beautiful. Thanks to all the praise this film has received, I hope something worth seeing. Unfortunately, the movie lived down to its title. And at the end of the film (which provided no resolution too, I might add) it's plain to see that the writers, directors and films have all come Undone.
