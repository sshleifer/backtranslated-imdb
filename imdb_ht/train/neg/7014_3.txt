What a waste! This movie could really have been something decent, but the writing, in particular, is crap, and the main characters are rather deep and refreshing. Mike Meyers was good, with the historic recess of decades late 70s well-crafted, but in general, this film was a great waste time. Instead, the movie to look, which deals with terms similar to the same basic frame frame, is great BOOGIE nights.
