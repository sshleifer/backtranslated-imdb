This movie is quite possibly one of the terrible terrible cops I've seen. The length was not long enough to have a good storyline. Also, the road to foster parents was just plain ridiculous. Mom suddenly dies in a shower after being tipped on an action figure, and the father was shot by a police officer? I can see where some originals might be what they were going to, but it could be better. Also, cheesiness in it all made me want to press before it was over. After listening to Lucy's name and figuring it was 'Lucifer', I wanted gag. Yes, it's interesting that Lucifer was a woman, but look in the name. It is the name of a man. It should give a male character. All in all, the movie was a do, and could use a better draw.
