Published on DVD in the UK as Ax, the Shock is a teen slasher who fails in pretty much every department: The story is almost non-existent, causing a movie that most of us understand in wandering around a black building; With the exception of characters (well-obviously destined to be the movie survivor), everyone is quite obnoxious, meaning the viewer could not care less when they get killed; Deaths are not large enough (unless a short shot in a book of thin beef is covered in blood fake); and the sex scene freaky scene next to no stripping (an unforgivable error made in a slash movie movie!). The wafer-slim complex saw members of a lot of punk inside that appear to be in the largest nightclub world (there are endless abandoned corridors and rooms, unlike any club I've ever seen) where they were taken away from an unseen attacker. For a low budget effort, the production values ​​are okay, and the cast they all seem to are active fairly capable, but not nearly enough to have genuine seizures, a reluctance to get really dirty (this is a slasher, so where the splatter graphic?), too many serious dialogue (particularly in the battery is not dead-fast enough) and some patients are advised to use tacky video techniques in an attempt to add some style, the movie quickly gets very boring.
