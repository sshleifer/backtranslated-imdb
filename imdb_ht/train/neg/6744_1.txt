As you all can know, JIGSAW did not make his way to Blackbuster because of being a full-time personal member of the Moon, Devin Hamilton. Devin is one of those who sell in all video chains. He recently released a movie, BLEED, which he sold Blackbuster at the same time as JIGSAW. It convinced the Blackbuster buyer does not take any JIGSAW, and double the number of BLEED. The result is that JIGSAW looks like a flop, and BLEED looks like a hit. The biggest problem with this is that BLEED is one of the worst movies ever, and as we all know, JIGSAW is, well, gold. I urge you all to go to the BLEED page on the web and vote for the bad movie JIGSAW, with all your talents. Similarly, you should go to the JIGSAW page and vote very much for it (if you do not already have). We need to get JIGSAW up to at least 8 or 8.5, and BLEED down to a 2 (thus putting it on the 100+ worst movie list). Also, try to convince friends and family to do the same. <br /> <br /> Expect you all doing well, - Matt
