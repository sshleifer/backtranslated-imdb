This is far worse than these terrible Laurel and Hardy designs in the 60s. They were horrible, but at least they were simple ripples in a then Stan and resurgence Ollie. New audience was redesigning the funny pair of geniuses and the drawing was the idea of ​​numbing virtual garbage in the interests of children. It should be expected. But how does one try to streamline this work in ... I can not even think of a word. I'm sure the musicians are hoping it would somehow inspire another Laurel and Hardy revival, but you can not inspire interest in the past with a deep and unfunny cartoon of what made the original for appeal. The Impressionists (I hesitate to call them actors) do a Vegas act and that's where it belongs. The plot is even flimsier than those used in ancient days, trying to stretch out two-reel ideas for a feature. If this film was first exposed to someone in the real Laurel and Hardy, I'm sure the viewer would reject the original duo reputation as senility goes to Amok. The only movie I hate is worse than this is I jump over your damage. And, you know, these filmmmakers basically did the same to Stan and Ollie.
