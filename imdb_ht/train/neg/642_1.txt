First of all, if you're a fan of the comic, well, you'll be very disappointed I'm sure! Low budget film !!! Largo is supposed to be Serb in the comic, now suddenly becomes Croatian, pfff! chicken producers, he gave some spice and intestinal comic (By the way, in the movie, his father spoke Serbian and he spoke Croatian ... lol). Swords N.Ye The winner has become a medium-sized yacht common in H.K. The good looking Largo has become a few Tzigan / Turkish sailing guy. Freddy's 'scarface' fresh pilot gets some fat, out of shape, sad, average guy. Simon, the good friend of Largo, does not exist at all !? He gave some pepper! Largo does not throw knives at all, but just a few Stares ... The whole story is confused and looks like a TV-filmed pretense. The French director and producer, if you do not have the money, the ability or the technology fits correctly, please stick to some romance shot in Paris. Very bad movie, good thing I just rent it, do not rely on me to watch the end (if there is any!).
