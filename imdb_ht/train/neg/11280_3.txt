This movie is about a man's life going wrong. His business does not fail, and he can not empower his wife despite multiple attempts. The plot is complete chaos. It simply does not make sense. In fact, nothing in the movie makes sense. The story is so badly said I simply could not understand it. It's a shame, because the sets and costumes are doing well and are visually interesting enough. The vaccines are well composed of the film. However, these reprehensible features still can not make up for the bad and poor story telling scheme. I am surprised by the great names that have been agreed with the star of this movie. It is like a waste of talent. This movie is very bad. Avoid it!
