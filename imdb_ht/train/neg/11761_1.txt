Complete drivel. An unfortunate manifestation of the hypocrite, toxic culture in a decade ago. In this film, regret pedestrians for slavery to go hand in hand with subtex colonialist (Anabolic Wheat Shake Rice?). Forget historical facts too. Did most western slaves come from West Africa? An American slave easily captures Shaka and a handful of people? Finally, David Hasslehoff could not have been more obnoxious. One can only think about, how would he have varied in the mini? (Rapidly stacking most likely). The miniseries were superb, and it is unfortunate that DH should have his hand on something unique, and made it Munden. (I tend to think it was hand in creating this fiasco).
