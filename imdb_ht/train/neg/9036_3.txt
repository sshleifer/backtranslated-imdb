I can not believe I waste my time watching this garbage! I did because Leonard Maltin gave him an "AA" rating, and for this TV cinema is usually a reliable indicator of some kind of entertainment .. <br /> <br /> The act was OK, but those who wrote it should forever deny access to any means of communication. The plot is funny, the motivations of the "bad guys" are totally absent, and various family interactions are silly and deep. For example, Dad announces that violent reaction of aggression is BAD, but it turns out to be an "admirable" PA because of it "ignoring idiots" philosophy, but because it is very good and his point ... ONLY my message could be picked up in this Pope that the nuclear family is good and other living arrangements are bad. Oh, and the bad people are good people.
