Holy Freaking God All-Freaking-Warrior. This movie was so bad, I thought I was on drugs. In a bad way ... The act acting is the poorest thing I've seen in some time. This movie was most akin to Lord G strings, IMHO (it is a real movie). Most of the movie looks to be done on a horrible green screen. My favorite part was when they are in the carriage, and you can say there's no horse. They are saved from alien monsters, and go on the same speed as a quick jog. Then it changed to a far-injected and a ridiculous CG horse. And the CG in general seems to be sub-parle the 1992 beyond the eye's eye. I mean, Come on, really. He felt like a terrible episode of Hercules, only without Kevin Sorbo has to save the day. Worst. Movie. Ever.
