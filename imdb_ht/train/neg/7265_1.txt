Just see this at the Chicago Film Festival - avoiding it at all costs unless you have trouble sleeping. It is a film filled with pretensions - it opens with a minor quote from "Hiroshima Amour" and it's all down from there. Camera work - imagining a child trying to imitate Wong Kar Wai. Story Line - Smokey Robinson and the Wonders "The Love I Were See You Was Just A Mirage" Expanded From 3 Minutes In Over 2 Hours, But Filled With Repetition. To clog pain in this film rang and give them to the church My Methodist parents dragged me to when I was a kid. I want 2 + hours of life I reimburse. The developer Julian Hernandez preferred the look and comment that the film was "controversial" - which is true only for the effects of the film's narcotics.
