This is only the second time I felt compelled to make the IMDB comment on a movie. The first time was probably the best movie I've ever seen and what was welding. <br /> Darkwolf Saws are in the other end of the scale compared to welding, as in the worst movie I've had the misfortune to see. Apart from the scenes of having naked women nothing in this movie raises it in the trash-pile that it is. <br /> <br /> Let's look, apalling, script cliched, wrong acting and over 90 minutes long. My wife and I laugh at most of her in disbelief in how bad. Amazing I look at the end, how I did what I did not know! AVOID !!!
