This movie does not have any humor for anyone who lives with a family member who has a mental illness. So many scenes remind me also graphically in my own life experience. This movie is the man's version of "Dearest Mommy." It paints both graphically and well life to many children in a mentally ill parenting. It also shows how easy it is for a psychiatrist to become corrupt and act like God. <br /> Someone told me it was funny. No way, I say! It is the best mum humor. The movie is so intense and depressing that my son and I had to leave the room. The best use of this film is for people who do not understand mental illness or who do not believe our family actually lives in.
