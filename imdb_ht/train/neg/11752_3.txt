I like to show animated. I love the nice Nick fare, including Hey, Arnold. But moving a TV screen to the Big Screen is not easy and this just did not feel big enough. It was more like a long episode of the show, and it just did not move along well. Judging by the behavior of the children we had with us, he did not score that well with them either.
