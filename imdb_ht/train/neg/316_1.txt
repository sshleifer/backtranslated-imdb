This film is by far the worst movie ever made. If you have to create a movie costary guy who plays Lars in heavyweights than does not make the movie damn. I said that I could look at Leprechaun in Space 6 times before I could watch the trailer for this POS in a movie. Adam Sandler should be limited to any movie after shame. Watching this movie is like a mix of cher cherries and wanting to put your dick in a blender. Anyone who has half a brain cell will realize that this film is not worth a cent. If I had an extra dollar and had to pass it, I would give it the support of the Lorraine Bobbitt Foundation before buying this movie.
