The only reason I gave it a 1 out of 10 is because the option to give it zero out of 10 was not allowed. This was the biggest waste in my time ever endured. For about 75 minutes, you will be under the action of WORST (and I do not mean that in a good way either, as in the KILLER NINJA which has great hideous act) and a plot that is not only ridiculous but also having absolutely nothing to do with a massacre. The reason I even rented this piece of crap was because it has massacres in the title. That said, there was only one killed in the movie all and was very lame in that. You spend more time watching kids tinkering and doing yard work than anything. Speaking of the kids, the little boy actor is probably the most irresistible actress since Bob at home by the cemetery. Did I mention he was shot on video as well? If you want to throw money and about an hour in your life, then not every means to look it. But if you feel hard to earn dollars and time, then lose as far as possible.
