This film seems to be a lot of people saying it is one of the most brutal of all time. After having just seen it, I can say he does not live up to these claims. <br /> <br /> The idea of ​​the movie is truly the end. But in general, the execution was not worth the harvest. Even the final stage (the eyeball stuff) is not really embarrassing. I was hoping something crazy, instead it was at lower quality than gore laid out on such films as ultra low budget violent Sh! T's. Anyone who wants to see a current movie will be disappointed, since there is no story (though most people know that). Gore fans will be disappointed since, contrary to belief, blood and intestinal here are few and far between. Not to mention the actress playing the victim could be one of the worst in history. Whatever people say, this movie is not shocking, it's just plain all out to suck. Avoid it.
