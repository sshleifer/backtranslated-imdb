When watching this show you are not sure whether it's the most annoying story or act. First of all, the storyline of every episode is very predictable, the writers must have used every possible clich√©, you can guess not only draw in general, but arrangement of the scenes and also the lines of each character, to show off some sort in a collage of every police series out there. On the top of all the "message" of the show, the good are good and bad are bad and that at the end of the day the good will prevail and that we should all love one another, have the best people and best citizens, all doing the most attentive way. The actors, as the machines in this message and nothing more than that, will use a limited set of acting skills: "I'm a handsome bearer" smile, looking at concerned with "The victory is our" body posture, while bad guys have "I'm one bad" frowning and "you keep me" look, followed by "I'm good for nothing and I should be removed from society" top set (this kind of sum up in general development at every show). True story or not, the show is garbage, yet another proof that producers do not give a s ** t on viewers, that we all thought to be idiotic. Well this series makes every attempt possible to idiotize the living brains from you.
