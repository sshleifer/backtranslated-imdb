You love beautiful girls? Yeah me too. What is bad to say about beautiful girls / women? There is nothing immodesty, so why would I give this film only 2 stars out of 5, although it has received the "talents" of Chiaki Kuriyama and Aya Ueto? <br /> If I really want to look nice, I would watch MTV or something in why. This is a movie, a so-called movie so. So, by definition it does not even really need a right plot? I do not agree 100%, but let's say yes to that. So what does he need? 20 minutes feet from part 1 (I might exaggerate slightly, but it felt like over 20 minutes ...)?! That would be "No". But then you never know, those who looked at a party would not know what they had been eating this breakfast for breakfast, so hey let's remember them ... hey maybe remind them the same times? Just to be sure they will not forget ... at least until the credits roll, of course !!!! <br /> So forget about the story, about character development, about real emotions, about "acting" (and no, I do not think women in skirts walking and / or fighting is responsible for acting!). what left? Yes scenes of action. The scene of the actions is not bad and that's the reason I gave the movie 2 stars instead of 1! I gave this movie a chance, but it was a waste of time ... You have the best things to do / look, believe me ...
