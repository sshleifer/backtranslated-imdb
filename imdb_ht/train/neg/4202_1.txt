... i miss something here ??? "unexpected scheme development"? "Wavy Plot and Subversive Givers"? These viewers are watching the same car in Arquette that I just undergo myself (in a sub-now-obvious sub (un) conscious bout of sadomasochism) ... I just joined this site simply to make sure no no one ever this rising stinker. This movie was a troublesome to every one involved ... quick questions: Did Sir Stevie read the script before he gave the toll-up to Kate C.? If so, then it must be the same Spielberg that the green "Howard Duck" ... does not give me that, "it was a hit game" crap - I guess mssr. Reddin is not too happy ... DVD covers promised "surprising corner" with a "tight story ..." Story !! History ?? It's crap like this that makes old Bobby McKee and his lost band in sound structuralists like engineering ... Sundance ?? Berlin Toronto ?? I have a home video of my farting chat that recalls more interest than Arquette's negative dimensions of losses ... and, talking about two old machina for Mr. Stanley T.; thank God, just in time of time o nick he thought they have Dave call the cops! and thanks Shiva that the cops were just holding the true killer ... what !!! Up to the credits I've always been waiting for it to be some kind of Grift against Arquette and her "hidden million" ... no, Ms. Spielberg, you do not escape unscathed: what the hell was that kitchen scene with " foot athlete in my left "gag ??? are you worse in this or just cause? I dako ... hay movie lovers: why do not you make it one blockbuster and rent this along with "jersey girls" and "white chicks" and then commit sepukka (or is it seppuka) ... and take E. Dunsky with you ....
