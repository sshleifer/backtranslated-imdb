The film plot film can be summarized in a few sentences: Three guys go hunting in the jungle. Two of them together get injected into the head without explanation. The guy guy can stand in clear, call and do anything without getting shot. He gets to work in an old factory and has the wrong people right in his scope without a struggle. Bananas are well dressed in black and look like bandits. This is the whole story, not summarized, but in detail. Everything is drawn out with a rising guy ringing a door bell. We wait with it. Long shot of the guys was bored in the woods and sleeping. We can take a nap with them. The one draws out the shot of following a female jogger could be redeemed, if we could see his butt or bouncing noose. <br /> <br /> There is dialogue is less then Terminator and it is not because there are many actions. Characters just do not speak. And then they do not even have something to say as 'I'm going back.' If my friend shot this weekend, I would applaud for him, because it is quite a feat featured out of the camera control. To pay for this rent as a DVD is totally inappropriate. <br /> <br /> The only thing that is a little funny is the extra and the director says, how local police did not realize being shot and treated as a random guy walking around and a weapon. If they would have filmed this, I would make sure it would be more fun to watch the movie then.
