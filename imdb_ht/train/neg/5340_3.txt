*** VITAL VITAL *** <br /> I love Tim Roth, I really do, and he does his best with an incredible role. I can see how this is a movie that might look good as a script, but it's complicated, easy and ultimately funny. I saw the fatal death ending a mile away. Rene Z. is trying hard with a souswritten party, and so Patricia Arquette. The detective whose name I can not remember (one of Chris Penn's) is a great sweep of actor. Watch it if you're not smart enough to distinguish between a movie so smart you can not follow it, and so confusing you can not understand it. See if you love cheesy camera work that makes you seasick. Watch it if you like to watch Tim Roth work with a clumsy script. Watch it if it comes late at night for free. Otherwise, lease Suspicions Often.
