This movie sucks. It really was a waste of my life. The act was atrocious, the plot completely implausible. Long, long story short, these people get "terrorized" by this pathetic "malicious killer", but completely fail to fight back in any way. And this is after taking a boat on a camping trip, with no gear, and shows up in a camp that is already assembled and completely filling with food and clothing and daughter headphones. In addition, after the chips go missing, they panic are stuck in the woods, but then the daughter companion just shows up and apparently never considered that they could just travel from woods as he did to get to them. As I said, this movie sucks. A complete joke. Do not let your girlfriend talk to you in watching him.
