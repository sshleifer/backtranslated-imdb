Quite simply this should not have been done. It's predictable and clich√©. The screen chimney that made my first "girl" for fascinating is nowhere to be found here, and the act as a whole is vile and forcible. This writing also leaves much to be desired, some of the 'memorable' lines such as "earpeircing a custom barbarism" are just shocking. Where my "girl" provokes a genuine sentiment of sadness and some really funny moments, as many suites "My Girl 2" are trying to recreate those emotions produced by the audience, and fail to miserably. Maybe I was tough on this movie because of the great first, but quite honestly it insulted the quality of the original and the drivel slit sort that served up. Surely this came near "Son of the Mask" as being one of the worst end of all time. In both cases, the old says true rings; "if it does not break, do not fix it".
