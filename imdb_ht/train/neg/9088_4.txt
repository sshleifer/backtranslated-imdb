She said several times - not least of me - watching a movie Eric Rohmer is like watching dry paint; It seems that Monsieur Rohmer resists this (he does not deny it, but then how it may be, it's just intense) so much so that his new movie, which can also be his last, Inch Allah, put so far back in time that it is like watching dry water. The wonderful people who gave you the New Wave, Cahiers du Cinema have already called her one of the best films in 2007 so that should give you some ideas. The fact is not high on the Rohmer agenda so that in the 5th century France we have at one extreme a castle that should not be out of place in the heavy valley is also the other house we see is a rugged wooden hut. The story involves nerves and shepherds and how often Rohmer has been cast and unknown that just happened to be passed so that the overall effect is that the yearly class play in a Special Needs Student Specialty was captured on film not crashing. One is almost tempted to say 'come Godard, all is forgiven', but even this pampered production can not make me pronounce these words.
