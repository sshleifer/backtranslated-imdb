The Treasure Island DVD should ask for a look at any movie production course! It's a book example of how DO NOT make a movie. Watching the movie and listening to the writer / director shows the graphically vast difference between what he knows about the characters and what he communicates in his audience. Call me old-fashioned, but I think in movies as a means of communication, and communication is not complete if the audience does not know what the hell the director is talking about. The purpose of the director is to make a movie canceled by the "Hollywood Convention". Among these conventions, alas, consistency is character and clear in concept. The director himself realized that hearing often does not understand the point where he deliberately avoided a "Hollywood cliche". However, it never seems to understand the idea that the clues exist for a reason. They stumble to convey complex ideas quickly and clearly. It's fine to avoid them, but they need to be replaced with some other way of communicating the same idea, not simply eliminating. The movie is built on an intriguing, rich and potential site. Two puppets are assigned to fabricate a personality and background for an identified corpse which is to be used in a disinformation mission in the closed days of WWII. Soon each begins to duplicate their personal imagination and the character and their invention become increasingly real. A person who has less deden for the "Hollywood Convention" in traditional storytelling can create a wonderful movie with this idea. This movie certainly is not it! Husbands do all they can to bring consistency to these characters, but they are all too often beaten by the script dazed and confused. In particular, I became increasingly impressed by Gonzo, who plays the living corpse. In a number of mupet films, she still stands out as a very charismatic puppet.
