I was looking forward to this ride, and they were horribly disappointed. And I am very busy embracing the roller coaster and amusement park entertainment. <br /> <br /> Part of roller coaster was just okay - and that was all in about 30 seconds at a 90 second ride. <br /> It was visually dull and poorly executed. <br /> She tried to desperately be such a mixture of the Indiana Jones far superior and rides Space and Disneyland rides, and failed in every aspect. <br /> It was not thrilling or interesting to the youngest.
