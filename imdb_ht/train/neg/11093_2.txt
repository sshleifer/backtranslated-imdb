If this film was about a fictional character, the movie could stand on its own and be judged objectively. Unfortunately for the viewer, the movie is based on "reality" that is very dark in the direction of Ruben Carter. Many of the few facts have been neglected (Carter was not a single contender at the time of murder, there is no evidence of all that he had saved a friend from a child molested in his youth), but some Larger facts, as apparently being stolen from a decision by Joey Giardello because of "racist" judges, is inexcusable to those of us who saw the battle on tapes, and completely disrespectful Giardello. Why Hollywood feels needing to make a hero out of someone who, at best, was in trouble and in trouble for more than any normal person should (arrested several times to beat women) is strange to me. Ruben Carter had never been, not looking at his actions in the 60's and even now, when he refuses to talk to his son, someone that people can look up to. Everyone knows that Jewison can be direct, and Washington may act, but why they chose this story as cars are beyond me. Are Hollywood very much in need of a black hero that they need to bind the truth of all bio pics to make them credible? (Here is a hint of how Denzel plays a movie about himself? Now is this inspiration) Based on all of the hackers of the movie, I would suggest going on this one.
