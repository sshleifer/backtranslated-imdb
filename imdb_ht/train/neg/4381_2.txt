Cut into the chase, this is one of the five most bad movies I've ever seen. <br /> Not that they did not try. There were some decent writing and some elements of the structure, a good cast, some good acting. I'm not sure where it went wrong, but it went horribly wrong. Some of the elements may have been bad structures and no solid history, a lot of overacting by the lead (which probably is much better when they stop), some wrong direct and editing. I had enough about an hour, tearing my hair from about an hour and a half and very tired in the air and fifty minutes she ran. There was also a bug on it all, being that I was going with someone who used to be an addictive heroin. She was agitated that she glamorized something that had nothing to do with her. This was strengthened by the 17-year-old girl who was in love with the 30-year-old junkie. And the frantic nature of the lead was a spin-enough. There was clunky plot point that was an attempt at a structure, but the end result was smooth and unending (with unequal time line). The characters were colorful but no end, which made me feel bad for the quality actors that you just did not see enough. <br /> <br /> Skip it. I assume that this was a first-time director who was romanticized by his own turds, but he did this before. I wonder how this and many other really bad ideas find someone who will actually give them money.
