I saw this movie for 2 reasons - I like Gerard Butler and Christopher Plummer. Unfortunately, poor people were forced to carry a very dumb movie. I liked the idea that Dracula is actually a reincarnation of Judas Iscariot, because he explained his disdain for Christian things, but there was so much camp that this idea had not been achieved as much as he could. I saw this film more as a way for Gerard Butler's talent to pay his brothers before being truly recognized and a way for Christopher Plummer's legend to remind the public (me and 5 others who saw this film) that it still exists. I actually liked the special features on the DVD much more than the movie itself.
