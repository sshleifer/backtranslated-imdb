Only the quality of melodrams that relieve muscle is the landscape in southern France and the voice of Nana Mascouri singing songs in the theme. Stephanie Powers is angry and betrayed by a false accent. As they point out, it is too old to play a 18 year old and looks far too small as a grandmother and grandson of a college age? Lee Remick is a good thing although he is also worthless in later years. Joanna Lumley's talent is under utilization and also managed to look for ever young when his middle-aged son (Robert Urich) finally married Grandma Stephanie Powers. Stagia Keach's silence keeps you asking what the women have seen in her. Do not know how any viewer can relate to his too much painting? The most credible performance is given by Ian Richardson, who made the rest of the look cast like Amateurs Range. It tensioned the credulity that the lovely male pretenders of this season would stay forever while while patience awaits the subject of affectionately endorsed consent. Does anyone believe that beautiful Robert Urich would be one for decades waiting for Stephanie Powers to finally accept his endless marriage proposal? The WW2 engagement between the Wehrmacht and the Marquis is mockingly. To begin with, the Germans did not handle the Provence section of France until late in the war, it was controlled by Vichy French puppet government. We see the French resistance doing a daybreak attack on Villa Mistral for stealing the leaves where they all dirty under a bridge waiting for a Nazi troops to surprise and prevent them? If you want to see a well-acting mini-set series in a foreign country, do not look at Mistral's daughter. A far better alternative would be the Thorn birds.
