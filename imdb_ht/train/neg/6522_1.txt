This is not a comment on the current movie but on release of DVD RUSCICO for North America. I do not know if there were different releases and updates, but the discs we rented had a copyright 2000 on them, if that meant nothing. Anyway, the sound mix on these DVDs was absolutely awful. Levels are often up-and-down; When the scene cut into a battlefield panorama, the orchestral track would be loud thunderstorms that I did not know would blow out my first or my extreme. When it was time for dialogue, the volume would typically drop in something barren. Occasionally, the orchestra and Foley-work would remain loud while the dialogue was superimposed to a lesser extent. My wife and I found that the only way we could watch this movie at all from those DVDs was whether one of us kept a hand on the remote continuously modulating the volume. And, like another user who has already commented, when we select the English audio dialog keeps switching back and forth between Russian and English; and occasionally when the French-speaking characters on the authentic dubbing track were in Russia, so you are SOL if you understand it. Finally, we gave up after the first disc. Before you fork out $ 50 + for this movie on DVD for your own library, I would recommend finding your hands on a rental copy to see if you can really enjoy this season's flick when burdened by these bad sounds, you never read the book and really want to understand the storyline.
