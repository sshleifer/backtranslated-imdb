We got to the ceiling of implosity and this movie. Basically, the dinosaurs came aboard this pilot ship by some strange old fart named Neweyes (which I needed after I had watched this movie). Apparently, Neweyes hears the wishes of the children everywhere and decides that it should give the child the dinosaurs to bring in modern times to be seen by everyone for cynical exploitation. Dinosaurs eat the most clever thing (Too bad the screenwriters did not have it). By the way, it seems strange from all the wishes of the children of the world, the Neweyes grant willing to bring dinosaurs to modern times? Why do not we want children to stop hunger? Disease? War? I mean come on! By Neweyes there is nothing better to do with all this power it has ??? Finally, when the dinosaurs reach modern times they begin to sing, dance and kick startups (basically the kind of thing you could see on a bad LSD journey, I mean where else you can see a T-Rex playing golf and jumping on a balloon of spider-man?). They ended up in the circus and Neweyes Brother Screweyes (???) to make the kids who were befriended the dinosaurs to sign an empty contract. Why? Why do children sign a blank deal? Screweyes says that if the dinosaurs take some ... "brain drain" that it will let the children go. Dinosaurs instead of tearing apart members of the evil Screweyes members, giving in and agreeing to his terms. What ?! This is stupid! They could have threatened his hand, made him drop the deal, ate it then walked off with the kids. I think the filmmakers were trying to show that violence is bad, which is a point when migrating the dinosaurs with a bunch of scrwave envelops and apparently eating it. Oh yes, that's not violent at all! We're back making no sense, it's not fun, it's jumping, it's stupid, wrong writing and it has some of the holes to draw the largest ever engaged in film. Even for a kid's movie ... this is BAD.
