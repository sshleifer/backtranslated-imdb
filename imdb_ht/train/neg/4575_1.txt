I'll admit that I'm just a college student at this time, a great Englishman. At the time I saw this movie I was a high school student - I mean junior year but it may have been ancient, hard to remember. My experience with physical proportions goes pretty much in my honorary physical course, an interest in mechanical proportions that led me to read up on the subject of a number of books on the theoretical aspects of the field as well as any article I can find in Discover and Love. I'm not a PhD by any means. <br /> <br /> That said ... <br /> This movie is simply awful. It is designed to appeal to the scientific mind of the New Age Guru Guru who desperately wants to believe in how special everyone is. My mom is like someone and ever since she saw this film she tried to find all her friends to see her and bought a copy of the movie. I tried to point out the various flaws and problems I would see with logic in film and science - and they are many - and dismissed my claim because "oh, so a high school student knows more than all those who have PhDs "In this case, apparently so. Leave behind the fact that earning a PhD does not necessarily require someone to correct or, in fact, intelligent. Leave behind the fact that my basic understanding of physics is enough to debunk the half movie. Leave that behind, the movie makers completely manipulate the interviews and at least one of the participants makes it appear that he supports the beliefs when, in fact, it completely opposes them. <br /> I could go over and over but I thought intuitor did a really good job of debunking the movie to feel free to read that if you care to do that. <br /> <br /> http://www.intuitor.com/moviephysics/bleep.html
