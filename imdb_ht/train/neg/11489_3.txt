In the United States, very few films were made about Rome that had not been set in the time of Julius Caesar or shortly thereafter. Hollywood's swaddling and epic sapal mostly have a Christian theme, making it difficult to find in earlier Roman history (Spartacus was probably the first exception of this rule, and encountered some resistance in Hollywood because he did not have Jesus in it) . /> <br /> It's interesting to see at least one photo that not only takes place before the time of Caesar and Christ, but is set when Rome was one of the many cities on the Italian peninsula, and was just hunted The king hated Tarquin and formed the Republic. <br /> However, this is not a historical film; It is peplom, and while production values ​​are not under rock, acting and characterization are cardboard. I can only imagine what the dialogue was like in Italian, but with British dubbing it is very cumbersome. I got a few good laughs from it at first. <br /> I have not seen many films in this genre, she missed most of the Hercules movies in the 60s. It's fun up to one point, but as the movie goes on, it gets a bit boring. <br /> One thing for sure: if I would see this movie when I was ten years old, I would love it. Then I went for anything with Roman and swordfights in it. So at least, this flick was carrying some childhood memories.
