First, I'm not really a fan of all "things eat meat in disgusting new way" genre of films but I'm a bad movie afficionado for my next neighbor said he had the worst movie all around time. This one. So we start watching it. First and foremost - it is recorded on a freeware camcorder! The second voice of the thin white doctor is armed by a big black man! Third, none of the dialogue makes any sense. Fourth, the zombie scenes, though convincing and shocking in poor makeup and tomato paste, led me to believe the director (and my neighbor next) are in need of psychological help. It's funny for about 5 minutes but it gets old fast. It's so amateur it's like watching a page high-high high ambulance .... .... and zombie. A note to anyone involved with this movie - I want the 20 minutes of my life I've spent watching this before I fall asleep back.
