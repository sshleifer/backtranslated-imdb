I gave this movie a rating of 1 (awfully). The only reason that it should even get a 1 instead of a great -0- is Ben Kingsley, which always shines no matter what terrible material is to throw his way. Mira Sorvino is so out of her element here that as a single viewer simply can not get over the fact that she is even in such a piece. <br /> <br /> Stupid, stupid stories and terrible productions. DO NOT break your video rental location.
