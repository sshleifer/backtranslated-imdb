Okay I've heard little about this movie, so when it came to the TV movie channels, I wanted to watch it, being a horror poster. I think I can make a collective "huh?" to all who looked at him. <br /> I decided to move with my life, but at a party with my closest friend, we saw he came over and some of us saw he had already decided we would be able to walk our way In it, both of us proclaim "this is the dumbest thing I've ever seen". He was not afraid; I'll give it to Roth (who I think is a young hack); Characters are changed throughout the film, "Cube". <br /> <br /> But despite your typical "rat in a cage" scenario-who will turn on that, etc., it was pretty average horror. > <br /> A few points: 1.) What was this kid? I did not even talk about it being weird and biting. I talk about all the "slow sling karate movement", what was that? 2.) Okay I know the Riddle's favorite Jordan Rider, but as a young woman, I was surprised that she just went ahead and moled her to her sleep. Uh, or illegal. <br /> <br /> 3.) Roth was in the movie just for Roth might be in the movie. Talk about free writing yourself in! 4.) What was the deputy? 5.) So it was just instantly pulled apart by the dog? And there was little no left? Just a scent of jeans? Anyway, we pushed our donkey and I liked to laugh during horror movies (Back to Living Dead 2, Dead Dead), but I do not know if we were supposed to laugh here ...
