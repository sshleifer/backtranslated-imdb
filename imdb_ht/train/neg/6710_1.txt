I've seen more than 1000 movies and this one stands out as one of the worst movies I've ever seen. It's a shame that this garbage band of Angels 1963 has been singing "My Boyfriend Returns." If you have to make a choice between watching this movie and pain dental work, I would suggest the dental work.
