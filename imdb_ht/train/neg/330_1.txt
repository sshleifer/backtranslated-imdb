I wanted to punch the TV. Watching it was torture. I hated it. Never watch this movie. Terrorists are annoying. Adam Sandler is annoying. I normally love her but not in this one. I wanted to break the DVD. This is the most disappointing movie in the world. The comedy she was jealous of is obnoxious. The only removable party is the rocker and the black teeth are getting all the girls. It was so disappointing I wanted to punch the TV. DO NOT BUY THIS PICTURE WITHOUT ANYONE. If you, like Adam Sandler, do not buy it. It will just make you hate her. Make yourself a favor, if you see it in the store, hide it and put everyone out of danger to buy it. It's a waste of $ 1.99 I paid for it.
