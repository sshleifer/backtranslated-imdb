I think this one sucks on ice, because she left the cube, and gave us lots of information about who is and why. The original CUB never left the cube, and left everything to your imagination. This keeps crap however, gives you it all. and I did not like it ... Even though the act is solid, I think the reason for this was one downer was because it was done by people other than the ORIGINAL filmmakers, if they had Vincenzo Natali doing so The prequel, or even the end I think it would do better and would be the most true to the source. So I recommend you stay far away from this one, and HYPERCUBE, another movie I do not even want to discuss ... (I gave it a 2 to act only)
