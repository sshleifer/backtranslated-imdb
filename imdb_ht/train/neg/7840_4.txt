This movie said in the eyes of a young professor in a Catholic school, watching over as the genus unwound un-furls around her. The movie starts off with a brief explanation of the past history and rivalry in Rwanda. Then he jumps into the story as told in the eyes of a young "idealistic" youth idealist a young professor who does not take life or the situation is too seriously. As he and the driver approach a road block he plays with his driver I.D. Do not realize that this is a serious moment and that if the driver can not identify himself as being in the tribe right the soldiers will die. And so he treats the unfolding story of chaos and unfolding around him. Suddenly realize that every Rawandan (including his driver) involves and that European soldiers and tourists can not and will not help. The media cameras can not stop the supermarket, and there are too many militant touch-pickers also shooting. The title comes from the commander's army saying he will shoot the dogs to feed their bodies dead-around his compound, but they will not shoot Milisia-people who are murdering around the compound. Especially because they were no longer shot by the soldiers. Finally, he realized the despair of the situation with the guy who told the evacuation team that he wanted to give up his seat for one of the victims intended, run with his in-between legs, rather than facing immanent deaths with children His school promised not to leave behind. <br /> It's more of character study, and one comes to Jesus moments for a character, passing a story about the genocide of "RAWANDA". This film did not have to take place in RAWANDA, it might have taken place any one of the hell genocide holes going around this world at any given time.
