I have no idea what comes from San Francisco has come up with this stupid draw, but apparently they need to get into whatever drugs are taking and put analysts on dangers - Now. <br /> Yeah, This is a possible story, if you consider the alien abduction sequence in "Life of Brian" as possible .. This film is little more than a Leftist pipe. The US and Soviet had given up nuclear weapons, the result would have been to eliminate only the real obstacle that held the two from engaging in a war. Bad as Korea, Vietnam and other wars of the era, "proxy wars" fought to maintain their superpowers from a direct commitment. <br /> <br /> This movie made me think about how realist it was when some groups of high school kids would go on a hunger strike against nuclear proliferation. As if someone would say "Mr. President, some kids in high drugs are not eating!" and Ronald Reagan would answer "my God! I would better review my defense policy!" Right. Like this movie? Would it not be better if the Soviet Union had fallen because they could not support their massive arms to build ... wait, what happened!
