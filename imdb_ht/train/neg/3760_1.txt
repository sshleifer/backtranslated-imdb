This is the biggest piece of my camel ever looked. It's excruciatingly boring I'd rather sit down in a seminar on creationism than was watching this if I knew she was going to be as boring as she was. Not even the 40 seconds of the hot chick in the bikini and the big cup would pick up this at anything below a 1. <br /> <br /> The reviews in this movie claim that this film is "unintentionally funny "are absurd and just plain WRONG. Not one thing is funny about this movie. They spend 50 minutes at first or so walk through the woods talking about things you would not understand or care about and it's just like lame when people start dying because you do not even know who they are are so uninterested. Honestly though, I did not look at it in the finish, but that should say something about how horrible it is. MOVIE MOVIE ALL. <br /> Immediately after being thrown in my DVD player, I began to scratch it against the cement in front of my house, not wanting other blockbuster customers to fall on the same mistake I did as renting this movie. Then Zach peped his pants. Thank you for your time.
