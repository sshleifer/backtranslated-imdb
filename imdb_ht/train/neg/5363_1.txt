I did not think that this film was worth noting bad script, bad acting except for Janine Turner, no fantasy, stupid sketch, dumb husband and misleading divorce environment. If you have never seen this film before it even bothers it is not worth it at all. The only thing that was good about it was Janine Turner, did a good job acting. Mary Terry is a close-up attorney-intelligence advocate who has a lot of cases and even gets killed by the capital. He thinks it is so smart but it's really just a black. Her best friend has an affair with her husband and betrayed her. Nice girl huh. Yeah it's a real fishing, not. It's no day at the beach either.
