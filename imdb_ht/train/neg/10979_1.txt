Words can not begin to describe how terribly awful this movie is. I wish he was "so bad it's good," but it's not. It's just dull, dead, and boring. It was so bad I could not even laugh at it. <br /> In response to other posters, Anne-Marie Frigon is not the highlight of the movie. The only less charismatic person is Brett Kelly's director, who as a true statement of worthlessness, threw himself as the male lead. They both look like inbreeds, sisters and brothers. <br /> The Gal, Sherry Thurig, is a looker. The complete opposite of Anne-Marie - attractive. This girl is tall and willowy, and can act. Although you can say it was holding back. <br /> All actors seem to hold back, especially men in support, Mark. I saw less wood in a rain forest, but it's still better than Kelly. Why would Kelly keep his actors out of action? Is it really that bad a director? Everyone else added the story perfectly - no one. Kids are kidnapped and Kelly steps in poo to solve the crime. I know how she felt she was left in the poo, it's how I felt after watching her movie. <br /> Yes, I tried to get my money back from the rental store. This is a home movie that best left to be seen by the friends of the director (and if you search them out, you'll see those same friends being one who gave the movie brand positive).
