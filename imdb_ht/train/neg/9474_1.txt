In modern Eastern Europe's hard days and for young women prostitution is one of the only career options and one to take, reluctantly, by Melania. He attracted the attentions of an American, Seymour, who gets obsessed with it, pays more and more money for time with him until he eventually wants to buy outright him. She has two pimps and her emotional different attachments and is generally passed around as some pieces of luggage with no feelings of her own. However, we are in the "modern art-house cinema" territory, so conventions like narrative structures, illumination of the subject so it can be seen, the added camera techniques rather than distracting from the action and a compelling trait that is consistent can all be abandoned. Many of my time had no idea what was supposed to happen and very rarely I had to take care of. People began to leave screening almost before the last came and I did not think I had ever seen many people walking out. <br /> <br /> The important images of the director - characters slowly emerge from or disappear from a dark screen, we get long persistent shots of nothing in one sex scene and sex sex takes place infra-red. In fact for such an unconventional film sex scenes was considerably ordinary; Missionary positions between those who stayed in bed were very large and there was no drug or related relationship. But perhaps these days being ordinary are original. <br /> <br /> On the whole, almost entirely without merit. <br /> <br />
