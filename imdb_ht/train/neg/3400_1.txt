This film is self trash indulgence. Watch this movie if you simply want to hear Gaelic speaking or enjoy the beautiful band. Look for any other reason and you will be disappointed. It should be good but not - it's just disappointing. Characters are difficult to handle and the act is poor. The stories of the film are also similar to disasters. I was hoping a happy family movie but this also held no appeal to my fourteen-year-old daughter. It is rarely that I can not see a movie at its conclusion but this one got the best of both of us. Although the movie is set at the current moment it has the look and feel of a cheap East European film made during the Cold War. There is not enough of the way to beautiful Scottish scenery and its cinematography gets saved. A real shame because as a movie this is a embarrassment in Scotland.
