It has been great to see some of my favorite stars in 30 years ago including Jan Ritter, Ben Gazarra and Audrey Hepburn. They look pretty nice. But that was it. No character or good line was given to work with them. I did not understand what the characters did. <br /> <br /> Some of the smaller roles were fine, Patty Henson and Colleen Camp were quite competent and confident in their small sidekick parts. They showed some talent and it was sad they did not go to the star with more and better films. Unfortunately, I did not think Dorothy Stratten had a chance to act in this movie only important in this movie. The movie looks like some fans, and I was very open-minded when I started watching it. I'm a big fan of Peter Bogdanovich and I enjoyed his latest movie, "The Meow Cat" and all of her early "Purpose" to "Nickleodeon". So it really surprised me that I was barely able to keep awake watching this one. <br /> It is ironic that this film is about a detective agency where detectives and clients get romantic to interact with each other. Five years later, former girlfriend Bogdanovich, Cybil Shepherd had a TV series called "Moonlighting" stealing the idea of ​​the story of Bogdanovich. Of course, there was a big difference in that the series was counting on tons of witty dialogues, while this attempted with slapstick and a few screwball lines. <br /> <br /> Bottom line: It is not no "Moon Paper" and only a very pure version of "What's Up, Doc".
