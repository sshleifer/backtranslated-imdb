I just watched this terrible thing on TV. Needless to say, it is one of those movies that you look just to see how worst it can get. Frankly, I do not know how low the bar can go. <br /> <br /> Characters are composed of one kind of stereo host-after another, and the obvious attempt to create another "bad news bear" is embarrassing to say the least. <br /> has seen some precious code in my time, but there is no reason to list any of them since this is "Numero Uno". Let me put it on that road and watch the vanilla glass movie, because it was so bad it was funny. This ... this ... is not even good.
