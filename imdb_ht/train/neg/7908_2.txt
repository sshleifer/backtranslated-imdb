I did not expect much when I saw this at the Palm Springs Festival Festival this weekend. It was an alternate choice when two other films were sold out. Still, I kept hoping. He sounds a bit like "bride and prejudice" (L.A. guy falls for an Indian beauty, parenting conflict, blah blah blah). B & P was not perfect, but it was an enjoyable movie with some good laughs and tackling characters. <br /> <br /> "My Bollywood Bride" was not there. The act seemed vibrated and no-numbered. Characters were so outlined that the story seemed like it could have been written by students of high school ninth grade. Technically, the sound really bothers me. It seemed as if there was a lot of over-dubbing in dialogue. I mean so much. I know sometimes it is necessary but it sounds like half the movie shot in a closet and it has become extremely blurred. <br /> <br /> Two stars are being somewhat generous.
