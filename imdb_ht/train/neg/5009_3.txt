This was probably the worst movie I've ever seen. The plot did not make a lot of sense and the act was terrible. I'm a big fan of Amber Benson, I think it's usually a wonderful actress, I can not imagine why he decided to make this movie. Her character, Piper, is drunk for almost the entire movie, with the exception of the opening stage. On the plus side, there were several points in the movie where the act was so bad, I actually laughed loudly. But despite that, I would not recommend this movie to anyone. Only 80 minutes time, but this 80 minutes in your life that you will have to completely waste.
