This was one of the lamest movies we've watched in the past few months with a predictable and highly traumatic plot line (mostly from the characters supported). The interview with Hugh Laurie on the DVD was actually more rewarding than the movie itself ... <br /> <br /> Hugh Laurie obviously put a lot of effort into learning how to dance Samba but the scope of her character only asking that he dipped himself at the end of kiddie in the pool. The movie is based on the appearance of a beautiful girl with great music but these are not enough to make good entertainment. <br /> <br /> If you have never seen Rio, or the inside of a British bank, this movie is for you. 2 out of 10.
