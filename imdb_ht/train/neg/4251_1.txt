1 from 10. <br /> <br /> This is the kind of movie that you cant believe you just wasted 2 hours of your life as you see the role of credit. I honestly think I could make a better Vampire movie .... and I do not know anything. The only thing that does not just suck (harder than a Vampire) is Jason Scott Lee .... His character is at least a bit cool, some mysteries, and envy a little butt.
