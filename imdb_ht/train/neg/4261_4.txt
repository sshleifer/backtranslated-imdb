Pathetic. This is what happens when director comes to work just because someone pays her. <br /> <br /> The intentions were good, great places and environment for a movie of seasonal proportions. But the performance, damn! I swear, in some shots you can see extra on the background set in the camera, or look at the actors because no one tells them what to do when they hear "Action!". The battle scenes are so bad you ask - are these people for real? They could do more damage just by hugging each other. In the slow-word scenes you can see people in battlefields walking around or just standing up, lifting their hands. <br /> Only the first action plan to somehow emphasize. But why? The story is so logical and discontinuous, it seems like random situations in chronological order, sometimes not even that. The dialogues are mute, the love scheme is much more embarrassing and ridiculous than in Hong Kong movie action. <br /> With a budget of $ 40 million, and you can see every dollar investing on the screen, in best case scenarios, the final result of all this enormous effort is a bright laser disk in the thin cover on the shelf in video store.
