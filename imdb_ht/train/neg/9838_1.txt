This movie is horrendous. Battle decent scenes or not, the act is really bad, as you can say they're reading the lines out of a card. With sleek lines delivery by everyone at the disposal. Thinking about a high school play and trapped in the obvious lack of goodness in the actor's interaction (pausing between different character lines, combined with line delivery by others). If the movie was all action, this would be forgiven, but a lot of the movie includes plotting set-up and family Guy style, irreversibly cutting away (oh, wow, they are seriously done). I assumed they tried to be funny with these, but it again came as a bunch of high school students / college goofing off for the afternoon trying to set up a comic YouTube clip. <br /> Now in the fight scene. They are not too bad, consider the quality level to see wherever else in the movie. There is nothing big either, certainly not anywhere near the same level as other declared poster (Nothing like Drunken Master). The battles have a tight feel, and lots of different angles cut and blatant positions differ by those involved. <br /> <br /> In sum, the only reason to watch this movie is if you were one of the guy's guys involved in this very, very cheap production. Which guy can you ask? Oh, even the guy who wrote, directed, produced and stared at this Middle School chief.
