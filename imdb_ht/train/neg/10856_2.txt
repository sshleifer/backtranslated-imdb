Now, look, I will not lie to you, but I've just been filming this for $ 3.99 from a friend because she had Danni Filth, the lead singer of the famous Metal Metal band "Cradle Of Filth" in her. I hope in course of violence and gore in its finest, as this is what Mr Filth can describe as, amongst a draw line. But I love God, I was so wrong. This film is badly biting, great time. Being a low budget film (haha, wait, doing ZEWO BUDGET), this obviously misses the beautiful Howard Stern music orchestra and the Spillberg special effects. Nope, it's all one camera, bad angles, and without bloodstream. <br /> <br /> Take for example when our stars and violent violent, Mr Filth, violence kills a mugger. A catching of the throat, with blood spits out, but oh, she seems to have a pack of juice filled with bloody fox in man's shirt. <br /> <br /> For your crib filth: You will hear two songs in the movie, but with the camera angles and movies, they drag the overall fun of the song down. <br /> <br /> My final comment: Drag far from it. It's blood, gore, breasts, and hey, even a broken story goes with it. So, if you love hunger violence, near no voice (yes, there's hardly any word in this movie), then by all means, buy it. But if movies are not your stuff, then avoid it. Do not waste your money.
