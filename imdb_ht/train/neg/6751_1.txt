My companion and I rented this because we thought it might be a good 'Halloween' take-off. An assassin terrorized young people, a white mask ... you get my drift. We've died wrong! No pun intended. We not only discover one of the worst movies out there, but also that it's a classic kil! It is filling w / trailing holes and makes no sense. The actress who plays Maddy is beautiful, but that's about it. I give credit for being shot on a very low budget - I still support movies like that. Just not one this particular. <br /> <br /> This movie can be good if you are drinking or high; otherwise do not bother. Unless you want to lose your movie privileges as I did!
