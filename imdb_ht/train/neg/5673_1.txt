I quote Oedpius Rex because it is a tragedy that this film was made !!! <br /> This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen! I'm not in any way a Uber Boll Hater like most of the humorless people about IMDb! <br /> Uwe Boll Cinema as Zip and Tunnel are hilariously bad and therefore fun. But honestly, this movie was just awful. I hated it so much that I would give it a zero star rating if I could. The story is just crap! He spends four fifths of the film building the plot and then they have the middle that is just grizzly horrible scene kill kill kill! Finally at the end of it with a "vibrant winning end" which is totally unacceptable but surely it could be more tastier than this! I'm not against Uwe Boll (as I said earlier) or I'm against violent movies! I f ** King loves violent movies! I liked the movie Saw, the movie theater, the Tokyo Gore Police, the New York Ripper, the 28 cinema, the dog soldier, my bloody Valentine, the last house on the left, watchful, Wolf Creek, each film Tarantino, each Sam Peckinpah, even the Canibal f ** king of Holocaust! But this! OMFG !!! <br /> <br /> This was just cruel, sadistic and perverted! And look at the movies I'm just listed! If I liked Cannibal Holocaust and not this then it must be bad! Uwe, do not go all dark again! You are funny when you are light heart, just like Ed Wood. This was just a terrible experience! I felt horrible all over the world after seeing this! <br /> <br /> Do not watch !!!! AVOID at all costs !!!!!
