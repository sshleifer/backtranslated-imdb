This started bad, was worse, and by the time the girl attacked the old lady at the end I literally wanted to take the DVD to those of us lending it off and choking C ** T to death with it . Avoid this movie, a little bit of good movies and some nude shots, would be nearly acceptable if I was 14 and did not see Jenna Jameson naked a million times. If someone feels the need to watch this movie, I'd recommend that you spend the time more appropriately, as an example I'm saying trying to bash a Lego home in your bomber that has no lube would be a good start. I heard that this movie was not the original version, I would like to see the original, as it turns out that this cut version is devoid of all conspiracy, and apparently most of the stripping, someone can say to me, how can I get in touch with Christian Viel it must be an hour in my life back!
