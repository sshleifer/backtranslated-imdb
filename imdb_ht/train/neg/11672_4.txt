Three writers made a vibrant attempt to adapt Jane Stanton Hitchcock's romance to the tube, but this film was injected over too many melodrams and just did not know when to leave. Handmade artist Meg Tilly suddenly finds himself employed by wealthy, enigmatic Ellen Burstyn, who wants a mural painted on the walls of his bullets used. After learning about the past catcher - Ellen party's party came out - Tilly decided on her artistic theme, never dreamed the daughter died mysteriously before the same function started, nor that she and the deceased has made a resemblance to striking each other! Two superb actresses lend their services to an incredible thread that does not bring scrutiny, one that fails to match either female intense emotional intelligence. Burstyn's role was tight on camp, while Tilly became stuck in the dream-eye-waif routine. Only one late sequence of the movie (the morning after the mural ends) is packed with honest feelings, anger and betrayal. The rest is piffle.
