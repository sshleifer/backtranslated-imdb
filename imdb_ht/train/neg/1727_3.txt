We have a lake. We have an anime meteor crashing. We have a stop-motion drugs with flippers. Well, so let's call this movie the critter LAKE MONSTER. What else can we add? Hmm, the idiom called Arnie & Mitch defines the ultimate definition of "funny rescue". We also had a sheriff who does not really do something damn in this movie with whom nobody listens. Oh crap, we have more than half of the film and we forget to put a bad guy! No worries, let's present some guy with a mustache, have him stolen a store that indicates he is a bad guy, then has him pop up somewhere near the lake, making him chase at The woods and all this for the sole purpose of his finish as dinosaur snack foods. Which should work. <br /> A complete, clumsy chaos, this movie. Its logic will twist your mind to force you to laugh. The first movie featured Dave Allen as a "suspended motion supervisor". After this one, he put forces with Charles Band for many years until midnight-nineties, when Band runs out of money to pay him, I guess. The effects of the dinosaurs are good and the entire film is very humorous unintentionally funny. Unfortunately, this is just about the right thing to say. <br /> <br /> Good thing? Yes. The mind-bending logic of the narrative would be enough reason to put it on the list. If not, Arnie & Mitch will do the trick. 3/10 and 8/10
