I have been registering for IMDb just posting a comment on just how terrible this film is ... My cat and a ball in string have a much better storyline than this. No worst act I've ever seen, but when you wipe out almost the entire cast of the movie in 5 minutes, it leaves a bit to be desired. There was not a moment 'hurt' in the movie, with the exception when watching the movie 'Halloween' on the TV. All around, it seems like it could have been a good story, rolling credit and saying that Lasey Lain was in it was a bit of a loss as I did not recognize her right away and the scene she was already on before could 'say' oh yeah, there it is'. I'm so happy I saw this in a hotel and did not pay for it as I would be real to cook if I paid a cents to see this. I normally like or you can at least get an ax hack in a movie, but this one is an exception. It's so bad that it's not that fun-it-bad-it's bad .... it's just plain bad.
