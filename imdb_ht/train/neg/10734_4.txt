I have not yet read a negative professional review of this movie. I guess I must miss something. The beginning is intriguing, the three main characters encounter late at night in an empty empty bar and entertain each other with inventive stories. This is the best part. After the three go separate ways, the film is divided into three wires. This is when boredom sets in. Certainly, the thread and babushkas are Felliniesque who makes dolls from wet cakes is at first a curiosity opening their eyes. Unfortunately, the director beat this one of deaths, even injecting a wildly drawn wildline line in particular. Bottom line: a two-hour sketch-thin lever. If you suffer from insomnia, see it in bed and you will have a good night sleep.
