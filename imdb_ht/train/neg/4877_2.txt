Frank Capra's creativity must have been just over time by the time he made this film. While there are a few good moments, with many wonderful performers, Capra's recklessly recycled in not only the script, but considerable footage from his first version of this story, Broadway Bill (1934), is downright dried up. It is understood that it would re-use footage from the climactic horse race, which is thrilling. But it uses all the scenes of dialogue with minor actors, then bringing back those actors and apparently hoping we do not notice, for example, that Ward Bond is 14 years older! Unless you want to see one of the last appearances of Oliver Hardy, skip this one and watch Bill Broadway instead.
