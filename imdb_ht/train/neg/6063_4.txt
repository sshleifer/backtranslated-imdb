"Masters of Horror" has proven herself a poor terrain for 'episodic messages,' and during a definitive case can be done for 'Joe Joe Dante's Screwfly Solution' (one of the best episodes in the series, period), most efforts Doing so has come across as ambitious-heavy and unimpressive (there is nothing more horror deficit than a soap). And 'Pro-Life' simply ignites reactionary and ultra-violent views; Young Angelique (Caitlin Wachs) saw the run of the woods, almost hit by 2 doctors (Mark Feuerstein and Emmanuelle Vaugier) who just happened to be driving to work in the local (and isolated) abortion clinics. Angelique's father, Dwayne (Ron Perlman), is a stone-cold, far-right holy roller that will do anything to prevent her daughter from getting an abortion. If nothing else, 'Pro-Life' accumulates some buzz for its controversial issues, but John Carpenter treats this entire venture with creepy indifference - it seems even less interested in making a movie than the script itself ( which is badly affirming); The slow slowing builds no tension, and simply brings the plot already ambling in a zoom. Even when Dwayne and his son are stormy clinic, blazing weapons, it's a stunning non-event; Later, when a doctor tortured with a 'male abortion,' the scene came in as gratuitous and unnecessary - an effort to wound out the writing source film. The poor performances (Perlman is sadly wasted here) becomes an outgrowth of the script, and the Carpenter's direction feels exhausted, as if 'Pro-Life' is the source of his next hot meal. By the time a spider-animal with a human head and a guy in a latex lace suit are prowling the halls, you just need to ask what the minds behind this chaos they thought ...
