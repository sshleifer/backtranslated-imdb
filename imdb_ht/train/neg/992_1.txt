This movie was disgusting. It should be a warning that some sadistic recorded writers are trying to make a name for themselves before being held hostage for an hour and a half while watching garbage. What is trash? Bad use of human beings, energy misuse, and waste in all kinds of educational systems that teach it how to read and write. Your talia is a sick loser. Your psychiatrist needs to prescribe most of the medications for your problem. <br /> The act and the plot gave me by choice but soon forward in the middle of the trash. I ended up in a scene that was uncalled for. If you want to learn how to shock people watch a movie Larry Clark. I lost all respect for dropping through this film "no more support from me." How can actors or actresses sit on a set while these gross reputation of human behavior is manifested in the mind of a psycho? I feel sorry for all actors who participated in this stage. I think the devil now knows who this film writer is; Congratulations you had his attention.
