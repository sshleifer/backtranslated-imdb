So, Prom Night was supposed to be a horror movie and thriller. I'm a big wuss and was scared to see this movie at the beginning, but about to see it, it is neither the horror nor the comet. <br /> I've basically made fun of the movie in my place because it was so predictable. You can predict what will happen next. The young actors were well in playing the characters, but I should say the assassin was definitely at the top of the game - wise act .. Yes, I'll give accessory to the draw because it was good, but it not typing or scary. There were almost zero "jump-in-your-seat" scene. So do not waste ten dollars to see it in the theater, wait for it to reach DVD.
