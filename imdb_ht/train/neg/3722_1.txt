I remember being forced (yes - literally FORCED) to see this film by a Southern Baptist philosopher when I was a kid, and even then I loved her terrible. It is designed to scare the poor siblings in being "saved." The only thing that "saved" me was the fact that it finally ended and I was able to go out and have a real life .. <br /> Check out the chapter on this movie in Sarah Diamond's book "The Politics of Christian Rights. "FASCINATING. And certainly more interesting than the movie!
