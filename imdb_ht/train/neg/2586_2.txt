Let's cut the chase: this movie is softcore porn marketed for mass under a name that the studio is treating every last penny from the American theater theater. The period (all that does not mean that there is a lot of things to go through) serves as a vehicle to show the audience more scenes and sex. If you are a guy Guy, and you're too chic to buy current porn, then this is the movie for you. Otherwise, the movie does not have much to offer at all. <br /> <br /> The act is sub-par, the character development is usually non-existent, and the story is a nonsense knarl of nudity, excessive eating disorders and pranks (none of them are particularly memorable). <br /> Go buy real porn if this is what you want to see, and if not, go look a good movie. Animal House, Kids, or even the American American Pie are all great movies, and all of them have oil use and alcohol use. <br /> "It's not how much, it's how you use it"
