This movie is a joke. I mean a "ha ha" funny joke. Why? Because the only thing staggering about it was the good laugh I got in the sheer absurd of sane, drawn to manage and hideous acting. Wow! <br /> In this movie there are many unanswered questions ... for example; why do these women become zombies and how? Why are four black women "zombie" comrades and their goals? Since 6 people have made a "nation" of zombies? And do mascara mask masks "scary" to anyone, anywhere? Even a 2 year old? <br /> <br /> And finally; Why was this movie done at all? Why? why? why? Without answer? That's what I thought. <br /> <br /> On the channel demand are actually given the comment after the film's summary: We apologize for this movie beforehand "lol .. at least they had the act to do so much!
