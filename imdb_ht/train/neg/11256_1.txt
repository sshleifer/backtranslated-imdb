What a waste of time! I tried to sit in 'Sky Captain .. "about 6 times, and every time, in about 3 minutes, I start doing something else - anything else! It's a drum movie outright, the act is awful, the matte writing , and obviously a director of the first time, because it's stiff.And I wanted to love it. I love sci-fi, the old cliffhangers, and I can appreciate the attempt at Flash Gordon Gordon, and Metropolis, but my God, what a I used to work for Paramount Pictures, and I wrote to Sherry Lansing in 1993 on blue screen usage for screens. He told me they would never have an interest or you need to do it. The crap.Sherry was right in 1993, but must have forgotten its own advice when it greenlighted this dog .. Blue screen a shot effect, but not a whole movie. Remember, neither Jude nor Jolie are Strange actors (but easy on their eyes) Paltrow's performance reminds me of a high school effort. Too bad - he could work ed, but only under a skilled director. The funny thing is, Captain Sky's skyline will continue to work, even afterwards drak. It's trading, not art!
