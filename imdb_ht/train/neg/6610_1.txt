This movie should not look as it meant to be a flop. Ram Gopal Verma first wanted to make this a remake of classic Bollywood movie "Sholay", but after having problems with the original makers decided to go ahead with the project and ... I guess leaving all the good parts of the movie (acting, script, song, music, comedy, action etc.) out and shoot the movie just because it's already happened to hire the crew. Waste of money, waste of time. After making movies like Rangeela, Satya, and his company pulled a coppola (godfather) about us; What did you think RGV? Anyways, the story is, though difficult to follow, is almost like the Old Sholay. Ajag Devgan plays Heero (Beeru, sholay) and Ajay, the new kid on the Ajay block (Jay, sholay). Both "bad yet funny" friends help a guy to manage a bad guy first. Later in the movie, now cast staff retired as personal safety and guarantees in the hands of a very loved Bubban played by Amitabh Bachan. In case you were not watching Bollywood movies, guys are good at the end. There I just save you 3 precious hours of your life!
