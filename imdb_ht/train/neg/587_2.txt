This film differs from the "wonders of the human body" documentary to the run-of-the-mill without bravery, if bizarre, choose to fight off the visualizer. In one scene, the camera is locked on a huge 50-foot construction as a teenager squeezing pies and liquids out of it. In another, the camera is semisubmerged in a swamp of half digesting foods and stomach acid as part of a drop of pasta salad from the esophagus and plaque in the goo. In a final tour of strength, the camera takes the viewer on a harrowing ride through a jungle of ... hay hair embraces. Unfortunately, I do not make any of this up. Watch this movie if you have to, but: bring sauce bags, and you do not have pasta salad in advance.
