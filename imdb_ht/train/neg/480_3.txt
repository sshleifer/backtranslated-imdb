2 stars for house Francis - it's wonderful! And he did not deserve this terrible insect that Warner Bros. throw his way! <br /> <br /> Located in two-surges that this film based is ridiculous and incredible in the extreme. Home is a small town and mother who is eager for something bigger: she wants to be an actress. When a big-shot actor comes to town and invited Home to his hotel to talk about their possibilities, Kay says his husband will go to the movies. A glowing buddy's mom puts a bug in the hub's ear that the house is not being true, and she sets out looking for it. She finds her / the actor in the hotel (they're talking only!) And it's the guy's bullet, who falls on a balustrade, face-first ground in a pond (lake?), And dies. Now here's the two incredible sites on which the rest of the movie is based: <br /> <br /> 1) The judge tells the jury that if he determines that the man was killed * before * head he entered the water, which must find the hobbler guilty of murder first-degree. (Whaaaaa ?????? I think slugging a guy in a fit of rage would count for assassination or murder 2 of the most, do not kill the first time. Give me a break! But the plot asked him, found guilty of murder 1 so he could be sent to prison for life .. Whatever.) 2) Hubby's attorney, after the conviction and sentencing, said Kay that he's in all his fault. His reasoning is that if he did not go on in the actor's room, then his husband should not have gone after him with the sluggish guy and killed him. He tells her that she's the one guilty, not her husband, and she nods and agrees. What. The. Hell?!?!?! The rest of the movie is all about Home trying to achieve fame and money in order to get her husband released from prison and his wrong wrong committed by causing him to kill the actor dude in the place first. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I can not even go with this review. The film was just all too painful. Four years earlier, in the pre-rite days, you would never have been holding home playing as a wave! In true Francis Francis fashion, though, he did his best to believe that this woman was a credible character. I give him a lot of credit to try to breathe some life with the credibility of this unfathomable role. This character was a far cry from pre-home roulette home and real life Spitfire Home Francis. <br /> <br /> Steal clear lines in this one! There are so many Francis Francis cars out there! (From personal experience, I can highly recommend Mary Stevens, MD and Flight Jewelery; also good are Dr Monica and Passage Way.I make sure there are other flicker flicks as well, but I only mention them I'm seeing and can be recommended.)
