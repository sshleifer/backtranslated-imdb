Recreation in the 1950s (London) Soho and the up-and-coming people. Based on a cult novel. Julian Temple is a video director. No more, no less. Give him 15 million dollars and he'll make you a 15 million pop video. Here he forgot that two minutes and people can not truly act is one thing - but two hours? What he thought. In addition to the audience? Who cares about a book that has been well remembered way-back-time. The usual London history of the Chancer takes his luck. <br /> What can really drag this movie even further down? Oh, I know, third-rate songs sound like being made up on the spot. David Bowie crones the movie title over and over a few times and that's the highlight. The Soundtrack Album is a dove of pigeon material. <br /> There is only one good thing though. Good recreation in Soho period. Shame they could not think of anything they put in front of him.
