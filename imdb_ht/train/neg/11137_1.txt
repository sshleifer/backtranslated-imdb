All the newly-chested women in the world could not keep me from hitting the button standing on a third of the way in this horrible trash. With the decisory act, equally awesome script plus the poor CGI FX match; This film is a reproach of the werewolf genre. It is assumed serious, that in itself would be funny if this movie can even make it to the level of being a bad joke. This is one of those cinemas where people behind the camera are obviously competent but they are too lazy to do something even one decent season. Avoid at all costs and watch one of the classic werewolf movies instead. <br /> <br /> 0 out of 10!
