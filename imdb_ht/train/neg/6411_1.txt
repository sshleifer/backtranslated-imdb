The return is one of these movies for nesting groups of those who love movies that have made and confused them at the same time. Sarah Michelle Gellar plays a lame buisnesswoman who does not kill vampires or gets naked in the movie.

At the end it seems that he crashes his car to himself when he was young. Or maybe I'm wrong and that was just a flashback. With this movie it is impossible to say. Can you believe the same dude who made the Army of Darkness this crap product? A better idea is to stay at home and watch the Dark Army on Channel Sci channel. This movie has it all: slugs, zombies with a dude and a chain for an arm. Forget that they did not even have one of these things.
