This movie seemed like it would be better than it ended. The cinematography is good, the actor looks solid, the dialogue was not too stiff ... but then about twenty minutes of having this long scene with a doctor who you know is actually a patient in the asylum pretended to be a doctor - and she just goes toward the south. <br /> <br /> On top of that, the devil is on the hellspawn that is jumping since the goddilla-looking thing of the devil's curse. There are also some odd demon worshipers who put the mask that looks like the blast genes from the beginning of the Run Logan. In the end, the cinematography could not save this movie. Despite some very solid performance by the actors, the story just does not go anywhere. I think "Hellbored" would have a better title for this.
