Properly impressive. Twists are pretty much foreseeable, if you've seen any movie in the last ten years, and some parts are a bit interesting (where one uses context clues to make a decision) they are few and lacking punch, since 'secret The 'has already been shown before these clues are explained. <br /> <br /> (deflector, etc.) <br /> <br /> The act is decent enough. The story is simply not very interesting. All 'still awake' quotes are canceled by astral projection (not joking). <br /> <br /> The scene of operation is initially tense, somewhat discomforting, but then becomes utter banal. <br /> <br /> Not terrible, but not memorable. Terrence Howard least interesting role in dating, so far as I saw. <br /> <br /> Type boring, in general.
