"Darkness" was fun at some degree, but it never seemed to have a conspiracy, missing one more than the other films accused of this detriment; It's "Bad taste". It started off really good, and a man ran out of something. It was very creepy for these first few minutes, but after a while the movie just became entertaining on the gore level, which was difficult to make out of some points due to poor lighting and terrible terry recording anyway. The film was hard to believe because of the juvenile, most of the time, seems like some friends talking to a video camera, making up as they went. That, with a shortage of any drawings, made it look like the movie started without, and ended without, a script of any kind. As previously said, Gore was only the movie drawing point, which much of the time was difficult to make out.
