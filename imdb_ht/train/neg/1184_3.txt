This film has a fairly good scheme sounding, but the paste was very slowly ... very slow really. Even if someone thinks this is a classic cult, I think there are a lot of best films from that era to watch. <br /> <br /> The movie is not excellent but not the worst either. sounds are OK. lighting OK. <br /> I still would not recommend this to anyone else than maybe a movie-student. <br /> <br /> The movie does not have music, and the sex horses do not do it a good thing either. and the masturbating woman on the edge of the bed groaned. <br /> <br /> there is no spread here, skipping this utter boredom. I've seen most believe me, but this is just waste in time, and I do not get the good reviews here. especially the high ratings ...
