Standard "paint-by-digit" tie fare, filled with a bunch of routine scheme devices from large-cattle cinema. It's like someone who has a deck of cards and plot ideas from other movies written on them, which was shuffled, and faced. Whatever line of conspiracy and character came to the deal were then top of the script. <br /> <br /> The characters are so cliche-eating, that you can play a game of "guessing that ends up like a monster meal" after less than ten minutes in the movie, and probably get all one right - including the order that will get devoured. Many of the characters are so obnoxious, that you root for the beast to close them. Some of the main characters include: an Billy Idol clone that surfers with sharks, a frown loudmouth that shines bankrolls, a kite. Ahab guy with a vendetta, and Ahab's girlfriend who makes sleaza dance in a bar. Oh, with a large, large animal in need of anger management therapy. <br /> <br /> Along the way, people discuss a lot, pretty girls running around and wet t-shirts, couple making out on exotic beaches, explosions arriving, breaking into a shrine displayed, and greasy-facing pirates drop by . <br /> <br /> Fun, for the most part, but one thing hampered me: humiliation by character when others were killed. After a violent violent, they made one-liner joke. I could almost hear colds vaccine. <br /> Overall, OK, if you have 90 minutes of garbage and you want to laugh at a bad-bad-it-good-movie movie. Otherwise, you may want to skip this one.
