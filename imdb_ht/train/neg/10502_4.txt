The film has several story lines that follow several different characters. The different story lines do not feel like one complete piece of this comedy a very incoherent one and gets even annoying to look at times. <br /> It may sound weak and clich√© but it's true; You are the best way to watch the Crocodile Hunter series on the discovery channel with Steve and Terri Irwin. It's more fun and even more hilarious than this movie is. I'm sure both cast and crew have a lot of fun making this movie, but the film does not give us viewers much fun. For a comedy she simply is not funny enough with Steve and Terri Irwin just by good actors, not even when they play themselves! The antics are simply not good enough to make a movie all around and the scenes feel long, distracted and unnecessary and even annoying at times. <br /> <br /> The movie has some potential, I mean Steve Irwin is a character in a strange way is both intriguing and hilarious to watch, so when I first heard that they made a movie About 'crocodile hunter' first reaction I was; brilliant! The film however heavily suffered from its weak history and the incoherent story lines with refreshing and unfunny characters. The movie does have a certain entertainment value, at least enough to make this movie look for at least once but still, I certainly should not recommend this movie. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie felt like a waste of time. Always this movie might look only once, when it comes to TV, on a rainy afternoon. It does have some good times but their story line really completely breaks the film and its potential. <br /> 4/10
