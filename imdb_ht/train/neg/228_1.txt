I thought it was a new movie-York located: poorly! It's a little British environment setting. <br /> I think it was a comedy: wrong! It's a drama ... Well, up to the last third, because after the story gets totally "abracadabranteque", the symbolic word for a French presidential mandate. That is, close to nonsense even its motives would like to bring a sincere feeling. <br /> <br /> What did I leave? Maybe a good duo of actress: Yes, I know, they are 3 friends, but the red policeman is a bit invisible for me. The supreme doctors do not punch it, and McDowell delivers a fine act as usual, all in delicate, soft and almost mute attitude. This jelly puzzles me, because as other fine art or director, the same pattern will repeat over and over. In that case, it's like, regardless of the film, it's still the same character defining in his feelings, his value, who lives infinite different stories. I still do not know how to set the limit (or the merger) between artists and their work. <br /> Another positive side of this movie is to touch her feminine and exciting different point of view. Women have their own way to live, even if they are all alone. It brings a lot of tolerance and learns how a same and unique reality can be perceived in as many ways as people. <br /> <br /> Finally, the movie is well seen, but the final final cuts the desire in a future vision.
