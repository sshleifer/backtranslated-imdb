I was unlucky enough to see this at the Sidewalk Film Festival. Sidewalk as a whole was a disappointment and this movie was the final nail in the coffin. When a dedicated devotee of Alice's Book of Lewis Carroll I was very excited about this movie premier, which only made it much more comfortable to watch. Normally I'm very enthusiastic about modern re-models if they are treated well. Generally it is interesting to see the parallels between past and present in a familiar story. Unfortunately this movie was less of a modern response and more of a pop culture pervert. The adaptation of the original character seemed juvenile and usually proven to be horribly annoying. It probably did not help that the actors were not very good either. Most performances were ridiculous about the head, which I assume was either due to the wrong direction or an effort to make up for a bad script. I did not laugh at once out the duration of the movie. All jokes are obsolete referrals by current events that are sure to lose them as time goes by. Really, the only highlight of the movie was the sequence of openings in the white rabbit on his way to meet Alice, but even then the score was a poor imitation of Danny Elfman's work. Also, I should say that the conversion of the coquette game into a dance-off puzzle was awful. It was and out of doubt the low point of the movie. <br /> What a joke. Do not see this movie. After my conclusion I was really upset.
