Wow, what a snoozer. Definitely one of the worst films in bacon. The bad act coupled with a formula, if not incredulous, script makes me crave for my time wasting on watching this on cable TV back. Not really I can say about it, a basketball scout gets too attached to its recruitment, who happens to belong to a tribe that is going on the verge of war that is happening to be decided Not (demo) a basketball game. Grade: F +
