This movie looks more hateful Jewish radio by David Mamet than I have ever encountered in an American movie. The estototypes are so overhead that my abilities are still watching. I was so disappointed in Joe <br /> <br /> Mantegna called a bunch, sitting in a New York Jewish center cleaning gun, the common sense hero and I stopped. I'm deeply disturbed by the idea that Jews are not Americans and "different". I suggest that Mr Mamet is one of the causes of hatred by a same healer.
