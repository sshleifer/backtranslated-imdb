I very much look forward to this movie. It's a good family movie; However, if correction team Michael Landon Jr has done a better job of editing, the movie would be best. Too many scenes from context. I hope there is another movie in the series, they are all very good. But if someone else does, I ask them to take better care of correction. This story was everywhere and it does not seem to be a center. Which is unfortunate because the other movies in the series were great. I love the story of Willie and Missy; They're both great role models. Plus, the romantic side of the viewers still enjoys a good love story.
