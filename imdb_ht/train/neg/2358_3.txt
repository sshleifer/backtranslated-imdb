In the future of 2001, Freddy is after the last teenager survived at Elm Street. Forsaking any fear any unfunny attempt in humor and celebrity necessities (come on..Roseanne ??? Tom Arnold ?? !!? WTF?), This is tied to Part 2 is the worst demon of children in leg. Wow was that a piece of crap. Not even the great legend Alice Cooper was able to get the stench of this movie away.

Rachel Talalay, or stink in the high sky, babe. <br /> <br /> My Class: D- <br /> <br /> DVD Extras: Disposal and Crew Bios; Go to the 3D sequence and go to a nightmarish option (the extra extra for the movie can be found on the seventh disc of the DVD Nightmare DVD series) <br /> <br /> DVD-Rom content: Trivia game; History; with web links
