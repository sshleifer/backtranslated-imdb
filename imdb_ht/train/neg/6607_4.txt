Not as bad as some are doing it out to be, though obviously pathetic compared with the original. In my opinion Amitabh was great as Babban Singh's wicked - try not to compare with the original Gabbar as it was clearly not going for the same effect. Other than some mediocre action scenes however, the rest of the movie is flawed. Character development was poor and development of the story was hopeless, with many loopholes, and pieces missing information which I would not know if I did not read back in the case DVD. The worst part of the film was the support roles from Nisha Kothari and especially this new dude called Prashant Raj. Nicha is just plainly harassed since her first open mouth. As for Prashant Raj - seriously who is this guy? where did she come from and why she was present in the movie studio for anything other than serving drinks? Ability to act is zero and has the same tone, dialogue delivery and indirect expression in each scene, whether it has action, comedy, or even a scene when someone just died. Ajay Devgan was average, at least his expression changed that is much more than I can tell her for a boyfriend. Generally, the Aag RGV is worth the value for Amitabh's solid performance, and also a very sexy Urmilla Matondkar in a special appearance.
