This was, so far, the worst movie I've seen throughout my life, and I've seen some really bad movies. I saw this movie in my local video store, and the cover looked like it could be a decent horror movie. Little I knew that the cover would be the best part of the movie. Where to start? Filmed in the movie was spread and boring. At one point, there is a single minute scene in no one talking, just a car driven by a hive on a sunny sunny day. Nothing happened, they just drove silently. The whole movie is boring, and annoying, incredible dialogue and basically there is no plot to speak of. If you rent this movie, watch it with some friends and it might make a good comedy. Otherwise, when you see this film, run.
