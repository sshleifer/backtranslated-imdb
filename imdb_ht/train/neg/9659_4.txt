After I watched this movie, I was honestly so I did not feel the story of the actors, I was sorry - I was disappointed in this movie advertising. <br /> <br /> Trailers have suggested that the battalion "chose the third way out" other than surrender or die (Polish info was even misguiding that they had the choice between being killed by weapons workshops or German weapons, they even translate the wrong title as "battalion that did not"). This was the right place and I bought the movie. The desire started when I realized that the third way is just sitting down and counting dead bodies followed by sitting and counting dead bodies ... then I started thinking "hey, that story can not be that simple ... I bet this smart officer will find some way to save what's left of his troops. " Well, he did not, they just sat and waiting for something to happen. So I was <br /> The story was based on real events in the First World War, so the writers could not make use of their imagination, but even thought I found this film really unchallenging and even slightly boring. And as I wrote in the first place - is not the fault of actors, writers or directors - those marketing have raised my expectations above the level that this movie could deal with.
