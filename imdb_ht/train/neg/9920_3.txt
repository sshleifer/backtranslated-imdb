I love the music of the clash and I love the music of Joe Strummer and the Mescaleros. I went to this movie to hope to learn about this man behind most of that. But I came from the theater does not know much more about Joe than I've already done after entering Wikipedia. The movie never really gets into the person, thinks it, his feelings. What they did was to collect the little material that they were, violent violent video and interviewing some people on Joe Strummer in a fire of fire. It seems that most of these people knew him very little or not all, and that the director just wanted to be in the movie in order to have some more celebrities say, "Oh, it was such an inspiration to all of you ". Like Bono or Johnny Depp (who was asked to keep his boat suit on benefitting from his current success in pirates of the Caribbean). It seems that the director could not even wait until the body was cold before it flew in to sell his version of the "greatest punk rocker and hippie to heart" who ever lived, sanctifying the person without really knowing enough about it. > <br /> Sure, being a fan I enjoy seeing the images of the band, listening to the anecdotes behind the songs with these, but in the end I felt like that left as the portrait of Joe Strummer could Easy to say in 60 -90 minutes. <br /> Go to the movie if you're a fan, otherwise listen to some music in the clash or even better Mescaleros are noneservedly unknown, where Joe Strummer arrives at the peak of his music development before his death, melting all his rich influence together in an amazing sound.
