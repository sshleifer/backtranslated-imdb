As you watch this movie, I came up with a script for a movie, entitled "Make 10 Items or Less": <br /> <br /> Producer: I had good news and bad news. The good news is, we can get Morgan Freeman! <br /> <br /> Writer: That's great! But what's bad news? <br /> <br /> Producer: We can only afford to hire him for one day. I guess we'll have to find someone else. <br /> <br /> Writer: So we hire him for a day. A movie is an hour and a half long. One day work is eight hours long. I do not see a problem ... <br /> <br /> Producer: But ... he will have to spend time getting into character. <br /> <br /> Writer: So we have him play a character that is essentially himself. <br /> <br /> Producer: But he will still need to understand his motivation and all that. You do not say we have him playing a big-name actor who makes a low-budget film, are you? <br /> <br /> Writer: Why not? <br /> <br /> Producer: This ridiculous! But fine, at least we will have Morgan Freeman in our film. And I guess we have to put the movie in Los Angeles too. <br /> <br /> Writer: Of course. <br /> <br /> Producer: This script is a burden of crap. We'd better make money on that. Just in case, Morgan Freeman's character character Wal-Mart or target or one of these stores, so at least someone will want to sell DVDs. <br /> <br /> Writer: Sure thing! <br /> /> Producer: Wait a second ... what's this about a small bodega with a "ten article or less" express line? <br /> <br /> Writer: Oh, I guess which is very strange. But we can not change the title right now! <br /> I doubt my script actually brings much resemblance to reality, but then neither did "10 items or less". This is a case of good acting, but bad writing, and I hate seeing it happen. When watching an independent movie, you hope it attempts to convey some sort of message. I think they might have been trying to be tired of the old "do not let anything keep you back" message made to the best movie death. In any case, with "10 articles or less", the only message I got was "look! Look at Morgan Freeman!"
