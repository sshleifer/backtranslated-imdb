I do not know where to start; Act, special effects and write them all about the bad way you can imagine. I can not believe that production staff reached a point where they said, "Our work, time to release". I just enjoyed the first two of the series never made it as far as the UK. I would actually recommend watching this movie just so you can appreciate how movie films are. <br /> I do not know how any of the other IMDb users might find it scary when dinosaurs are "scared" waddle down corridors and rubber arms flailing around.
