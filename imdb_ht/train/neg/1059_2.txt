I watched this movie last night and already I am struggling to reap lots of it. The story is about a group of criminals who escaped from a penal colony settlement. They fly to the moon at a space-age dust carrier; When there is, they terrorize the dusty men who work on the moonbase. <br /> It strikes me that low-budget sci-fi films often involve either deserted planet or, like this movie, criminal escaped from penal colony. Why this is I have no idea. But I can say with certainty that these films are always diabolical. This is really no exception. It starts reasonably well with a decent credit sequence and a half-way music dance dance audience. He then degenerates into a bizarre sci-fi thriller. So little of the consequences actually happening in this movie that I literally struggle to write a useful review, so if you read this I'm sorry to not be able to enlighten you into the movie's subtlety and nuances. For the record, I remember a tremendous bug in baddies, a tremendous bunch of goodies, some head of nuclear wars and a hologram of a naked woman. Otherwise, I'm fighting. <br /> If you feel you might be interested in the activities of wet male dust then I would not hesitate to recommend this movie. I would also recommend the person who wants to send their friends to sleep and steal their wallets.
