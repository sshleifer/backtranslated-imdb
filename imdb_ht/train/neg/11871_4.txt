Gregory Peck was excellent, as one would expect, and the movies quite stunning even when playing directly in some "momodramatic moments". But the rest of the movie was overacted and hard to watch, for me anyway. I tried to love it, but they were in fast-forward in the last thirty minutes or so. I feel wasted a couple of good hours. If it was not for Gregory Peck, I would not have been there for fifteen minutes. 4/10.
