This movie was wrong to say least !!! Many of the superb cars were ashamed to be presented in this movie LAME. It starts off with a race at L.A. in Las Vegas to be completed at 1hr 45min ... at a Ferrari F430. I did this in 1HR 50min in a small Honda Accord 4cylinder 140HP 1993. Seriously ... this movie does not do justice to these cars. Obviously these writers are just that and probably driven under the speed limit with their hands @ 10 & 2 Ã¨. I remember seeing in the news how Eddie Griffin crashed a 1.5 million Ferrari Enzo away 30-40MPH >>> youtube.com/watch?v=cNVrMZX2kms <br /> <br /> And ... director of ANDY CHENG IS THE GREAT SELLOUT !!! He shames everyone before him. I wonder just how much he or she is just happy to break into Hollywood. She participated in a movie showing Asian Americans in a negative and FAIL manner. Asian women >> cheap grubbing money. Asian people >> lose compulsive gamblers & thugs who get hit all the time. What the heck is all the fear of Asian ?? Why does the need always show them in such a negative connotation? I am sick of the path of Hollywood ALWAYS SHOW ASIANS OF SECTION a negative and false apology.
