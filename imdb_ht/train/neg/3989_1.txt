Who's right idea to play a lyrical song at the same time they're showing an emotional scene between two people? When Flipper meets his wife in the dressing room, the singing song and lyrical content are as loud as the dialogue, so someone can hear, dilute any emotional impact on the scene. The scenes of Annabella are being beaten to her dad with her point, a lamps and then a belt was so cartoonish as to be absurd. This whole movie is a cartoon, the pre-rampant prejudice against white is literally surprising. The discussion by the black women after Flipper's wife found out she was cheating on her with a white woman - as if a discussion by a team was okay, it's ridiculous. The rampant racism might be possible to endure, but the soundtrack and sound mix during this movie too much. It was a technically harmless film. There is no understanding of the basic craft of making films, sounding sounds, the correction and desperate attempts of great actors trying to keep this movie afloat. I was actually sorry for Anthony Quinn, wondering why she accepted a role in this flick - his appearance in this is painful. This is the first movie I've seen this director and it will be my last.
