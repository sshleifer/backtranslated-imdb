Wow. I do not even really think so much about this movie, except that it stunk. <br /> <br /> The plot of basically; A girl's parents neglected her, so this sick PokeMon pretends to be her father. Am I the only one affected? Then this weirdo PokeMon kidnapped Ash's mother to pretend to be the girl. I do not care if she's trying to make the girl happy, that's just gross. <br /> There was no real plot. The girl was just a whiny broth who wanted her own way. He played with Unowns, was "Enemy's" daughter and apparently could grow and shrink to age on a whim with the help of his "father". <br /> <br /> That's pretty much all I can remember, but I think you can take it as a hint, and do not see it. (Or if you see it, do not expect much.) 1 out of 10. <br /> <br /> Seriously. If you want a PokeMon movie, rent "PokeMon; The First Movie".
