I quickly waited for this movie screening since it was given me on the Christmas DVD. Did you reserve a special place for her last night, and I sat down to look at her with my daughter (aged 17 and a Study Study Study), and chocolate in the course, craving an anticipation. We love Jane Austin. <br /> After only two minutes we knew we were leaking. The camera vaccines are worried with angles, general cinema, direction and wooden performance have left us feeling flat and dissatisfied. Since we've seen. Anne, played by Sally Hawkins, looks unusual and has no particular aim, directly to the camera on several occasions, breaking our fantasy-hard at the time 'and engaging us directly to an almost' I'll get you ' fashionable goods. Poor Rupert Penry-Jones, who plays Captain Wentworth, did his best with the script and direction, blessing him. I hope he paid him well, however, as he practically drowned on an occasion by a huge wave that had predicted hacking seawall, dipping him with his co-actor. They were almost swept from the sea. Health and Safety might have had a day garden! Poor Rupert was spitting out sea water in order to deliver his line. Obviously did not have enough money left in the Kitty for a re-shoot at this stage. Anyone who has any sense would not try it on that day in the first place. <br /> <br /> Other than Mr. Penry-Jones, Alice Krige has given the performance only convinced as Lady Russell but his efforts were soon counterbalanced by those of Anthony Head's compelling presentation of harassing Sir Walter Elliott. Towards the long-awaited end of the movie, Captain Wentworth appeared in the unusual favor of Anne and a visit to every two seconds took great pain to avoid it for the majority of the movie. It was as if he had developed a preventive memory that caused him to forget his very reason for being. Conversely, Anne runs, too-ventilation, from the post pole in search of the good Captain who, in the meantime, managed to call on almost the whole of our Bath to say, in the course of only three or four minutes, without even having worked a sweat. <br /> <br /> We have not experienced Anne's charm that has crossed the screen. Indeed, we have left wondering what Charismatic Captain Wentworth has ever seen in plain, spineless, opinion-less Anne and why somebody, anyone, did not say, Sir Walter Walter just closed the box. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />. As they moved closer, Anne kept opening and closing his mouth that had the effect on the screen to make it look as if it was chew before chewing mills finally met. Eww! <br /> <br /> The most enjoyable thing about last night was the chocolate and the half hour exchange of views between mom and daughter about just how bad the movie was. <br /> <br /> What a pity to destroy such an enchanting and engaging story, filmed in some of the finest England scenery. <br /> <br /> Sorry Jane.
