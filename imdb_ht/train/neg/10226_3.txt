"Do not worry to watch this movie" would be best advice, if you like Marilyn Monroe in her other role. This was a great disappointment to consider the big cast, not just Marilyn. The story was just nothing, certainly nothing like that described on the VHS box, of course. There was simply no suspense, precious little excitement and too many dull spots, many of them trying to show why "Nellie" (Monroe) was so messed up. This was not a good role for Monroe, though I did not need to see this character knowing he could act. "Some like it hot" alone was good enough for me. But this role just did not fit it and it does not surprise it was not one of its famous films. It is also too bad a movie that has the garbage of the talents of actors such as Richard Widmark, Anne Bancroft, Elisha Cook Jr, Jeanne Cagney, Donna Cocoran and others. <br /> <br /> Summary: It's not fun and fun is the name of the game.
