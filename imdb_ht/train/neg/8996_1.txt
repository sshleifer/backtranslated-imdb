In the future of 1985, a governmental commission led by Howard Hesseman is holding audiences on the first television network. They sample the program, which plays as a series of skits. I can name 'good' auto movies in one hand, do not use my thumb. "Amazon Woman On The Moon", "Kentucky Movie Movie", "Life's Meaning," and "Mike Mike Mike's World".

It takes some sort of great incompetence on the part of the movie makers do not even get a laugh out of me. <br /> <br /> I Candy: Dorn Dorn goes full
