The dance was probably the only thing to look at this movie - and even that was disappointing compared to some movie. For me, this is the worst kind of movie - one that assumes it's a work of art because it has all the trapings of film-as-art. Yes, it's pretty good photography, but finally misses the depth and tension in the dance where the film supposedly surrounds itself. Tango is a tease, it's hot, it's drama, it's bold - precisely what this film is not.
