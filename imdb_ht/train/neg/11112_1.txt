Wow, how bad can it get. This was badly bad. Not in terms of the Gore - which was mostly scam CGI - but in acting, atmosphere and direction. <br /> <br /> The story was obnoxious - the main character of the main lead was a total joke. In a few nights following Vinnie Jones, she starts to become 'haunted' at the point of crying when her girlfriend photos. For ... Is this all New York's photography, suggested and weak? His character development was absolutely no justification or point - and at the end of many you will laugh loudly in totally predictable, and totally absurd character's twist. <br /> <br /> These moments are particularly apparently just a weak, low-self-esteemed effort to jump on the modern style of MTV modern wagon - all cgi, without yet having any real emotions too. These parts were unintentionally funny - and distracted by self-awareness - wacky camera angles etc. <br /> Overall this film commits the crime to blowing another potential idea. What could have been atmosphere (until the stupid monsters in the end) are losing in favor of looking at self-conscious me'style look. This film was not performed with audiences - it made for a CV - a deeply selfish motive.
