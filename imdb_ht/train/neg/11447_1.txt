Well probably the worst movie I've ever seen; I was ready to walk out after the first ten minutes. The only people who laughed at the theater were the tweeners. Do not get me wrong, I like funny, stupid movies just as much as the next gal, but all the quotes, writing and stunk humor. It seemed to me that they went for a "NapolÃ©on Dynamite" feeling - weird and random scenes that would lead to a cult hearing. Instead, he ended up being forced, awkward and weird. The only bright light was Isla Fisher and I just felt it was terrible that he (with Sissy Spacek) signed up for this terrible thing. /> <br /> Thanks gosh I did not pay for it.
