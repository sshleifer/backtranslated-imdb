You want to see the movie "The Gamers" Do not Die Mr. Productions. This is not movie. This movie is not funny. It's a waste of time. <br /> All of the good comments here seem to be written by (malicious backdoor) fake third party. Those who made this movie seem to be trying to fake fake interests. <br /> <br /> This movie is not a well done mockumentary. Comparison of "Spinal Tap" or Christopher Guest insults. The movie is so mean-dynamic that I can not imagine anyone familiar with the subject to get it funny. When you can laugh at yourself is an important quality, but if you are the ones who have been lampooned in this way, you would have hated yourself to enjoy it. The film is not offensive because of its grand satire in taboo subjects but because of its constant pathetic banalality.
