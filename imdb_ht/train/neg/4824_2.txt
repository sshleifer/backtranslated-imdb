I wanted to love this movie, but many elements lost it for me. The use of a wavy fisherman lens and chip correction did not give me a sense of being in the world of the master's head, but it made me think I was watching MTV for a short moment. The film never seemed to go anywhere and the act was really an excellent example of acting. I love movies that give us a glimpse of the wet dead, but this movie could not decide whether it was a bad horror movie or even getting worse serious comments about the horrors of addiction.
