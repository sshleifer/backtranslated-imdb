The only reason I watched the movie until the end was "the hope" to see something interesting. The movie is really bad and the performance of the girl it is really, really bad, honestly, I am not a movie critic or an expert but you just need common sense to notice that this job it is incredibly bad. <br /> <The first thing that came to my mind as soon as he started speaking was: "He has an affair with William Dafoe and he has accepted his help with the scenario and looks at his movie since he is director brilliant ". Surprise, surprise, the next day after I watched the movie I found out online that Giada Colagrande is his wife. Awesome story with terrible performance.
