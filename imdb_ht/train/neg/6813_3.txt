Jean Rollin artistic history about vampires, aliens and demands for immortality. Women are beautiful and the stunning photography. The dialogue is insane. It's a scandal. Big look at hand as any pretend to a horror movie or throwing peppers terrible. I'm trying to figure out if we're supposed to be scared or not. At the same time is it a set on or not? It is an odd mix of art films and horrors that never quite meshes and while its beautiful look at it never seems to "mean" anything, and its no means to frighten though the occasional shot or sequence create a moment of fruity its assets made firefighter firefighters. Something to leave on in the background as a wall wallpaper for those who love naked women.
