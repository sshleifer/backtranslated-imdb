In 15 minutes, my whole family was rooting for Goldie Hawn's death, or at least for Steve Martin's character left. Within 40 minutes we turned him down. There are only a couple of movies a year we try to turn out so harassing that we can not even bend it long enough for the story to get established. Normally I like both Steve Martin and Goldie Hawn, and I remember enjoy Neil Simon's original. So I blame Marc Lawrence and Sam Weisman. Combining the director of "the worst thing that can happen" with the writer of "Miss Congeniality 2", and I guess this is what we have done with.
