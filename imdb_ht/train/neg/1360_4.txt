A reasonable effort is to summarize the film. A sixty films but lacking in any sense of achievement. Maggie Smith gave a decent performance that was credible enough, but not as well as he could have been given, other actors were just obnoxious! A terrible image. It was not so funny and so it did not really realize its folks as it was not particularly funny and it was not dramatic. The only genre achieved at a satisfactory level was romance. Target audiences did not hit the movie by sending out confusing messages. A very basic scheme and a very basic storyline were not pulled off or performed at all good and people were left confused as to why the movie was not as good and who target audiences were etc. However, Maggie was well And the storyline was OK and moments of ability. <br /> 4.
