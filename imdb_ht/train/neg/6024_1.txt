I watched about 30 minutes in this film before I finally got sick to get bludgeoned to the top with this movie. The soundtrack, the so-called 'draw', and each and every actor. It's like they all think they're the main part of the movie and scream "AVI ME!" over and over again. The bad guy has his bad-guy music going on saying disgusting-guy-like things, just in case you did not quite catch on. The guy good things are brave and noble just in case you did not know he was the good guy. And oh Lord, the aircraft scene. "OR I AM OH MY OWN! I AM WHO I HAVE MY PEOPLE WHO I DO WHO IS GOING OR GOING TO ANY POINTS OR ANYONE, I AM ME!" (And yes, I know, her dress was still there, but honestly, she got up and started to panic before she even had time to look at the damn chair she'd got into.) A religious girl, I want to apologize to the world for wasting the movie that was printed on. <br /> And I want my 30 minutes back.
