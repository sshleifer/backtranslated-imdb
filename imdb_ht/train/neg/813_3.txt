The biggest one that bugs the hell out of me is that they say ZUTS take command DUTCH. But she speaks German to her. Since 2 are completely different, as it says "well it takes French commands" and begins to speak Spanish. <br /> <br /> James Belushi gives the more sense of being a comedy actor by a detective in the slightest. The role just does not fit him, even if he mocks to be a comedy. <br /> For many stereotypes / predictable things. Typical comments or comebacks. <br /> If you do not look at things I think it might be a nice movie to watch if ever it's on TV. But I would not suggest renting it.
