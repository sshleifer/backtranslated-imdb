This movie is a farce! The names are many misunderstood and the plot twisted and gnarled into something that is not recognized by any literature enthusiast. And they have the gall to give Beowulf a ridiculous cannon / spear gun. Beowulf does not need such a weapon! In the poem, she rips over Grendel's arm with her hands! And I can not believe that scriptwriter was doing something like that. Grendel the described way is impressive however. This and the cast are only the positive points of the feature. My English teacher would go crazy if he saw that abomination. Unless you are a dead-hard fan of the epic poem "Beowulf," avoid this movie at all costs. And even then, I would not recommend it.
