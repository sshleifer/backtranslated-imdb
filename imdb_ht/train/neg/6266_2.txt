It seems like anybody can make a movie nowadays. It's like all that you need is a camera, a group of people to be cast to crew, a script, and a little money and walla you have a movie. The problem is that talent is not always part of this equation and often times these low budget films turn out to be duds. The video store shelves are filled with these so-called films. These are not even fun guilty, they're just a garbage of the best seluloid in mind. Troma Entertainment is known for making films, but most of the films are b movie films. However, some of the films that were being carried out had nothing to do with and some, such as 'Weekend Nightmare,' did not deserve any form of release at all. <br /> <br /> Pros: The cast members do the best they can with the disgusting material. There are some unintentional odds. Move at a good speed (should be in 81 minutes). <br /> <br /> Account: Praise praise, including brutal dialogue and untold drawings. Poor lit, especially the night scenes and the finish, which you can not do from all. Do not make a niche in the sense. Bad notes. Good and very effective date. Total lack of character development and you will not care about anybody. This is supposed to be a horror movie, but it lacks this area and is not the least bit scary. There is nothing interesting or interesting to happen. Packed with padding needed. <br /> Last thought: I never expected this to be some gem forget, but I never imagined it would be this bad. I do not know if it's the worst movie ever made, but it's a defender defining. Troma should leave this film rotten instead of giving it a release. Do not make the same mistake I've done and let your curiosity get the best of you. <br /> Rating: 1/5
