The past evaluator was very generous. I'm quiet like the movie first, but can not say I enjoy this one very much. The beginning is escaped, but it goes down very quickly. I just do not see Jon Bon Jovi as a "bad-donkey vampire hunter" and the vampire princess is neither sexy nor scared. A lot of scenes just do not make sense. I mean any normal person would suspect something is up when a strange woman suddenly appears out of nowhere to seduce you, be alone an experienced hunter. Why is Una able to communicate with Jovi? Nothing has ever been explained in this movie, you would not mind if it was fun, but that was too much to ask. This has to be one of the worst vampire films I've seen.
