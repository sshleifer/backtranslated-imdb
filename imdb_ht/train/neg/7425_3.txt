This tedious, plodding Las Vegas casino movie heist is almost impossible to watch and get involved .. It's something you're looking at if you have absolutely nothing else to do. Only two decent things in this movie are both attached to gorgeous Stella Stevens and one to spend the entire program hoping it will fall out of one of these skimpy heads. Many large vaccines in Las Vegas 70s (when it was still a cool place to go) and their fashion modes are good for a giggle. Otherwise, one big yawn. The rhino dvd has a very good transfer shopping but even under 10 bucks it is still not worth it in humble opinion.
