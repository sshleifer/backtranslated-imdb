Received in this movie flick, as it started, about an afternoon where I was home with a touch of flu - otherwise I would have missed it. That probably would be best. <br /> I notice the presence of Lindsay Crouse and Jay Thomas - both very good performers - and this thought might be worth a look. It proved to be in some measure, but only because it is one of those terrible stories fascinating. Zoe McLellan has little to recommend her talent, except for her Jayne Mansfield- or Loni Anderson-like bosom. Unfortunately, ability to act it - at least here - makes Mansfield and Anderson seem to be Garbo or Davis by comparison. The Rat's kid's rat rat, the owner's cat, the young man who had the owner evicted and kept in his own home, and a bunch of doophus (including the young case) run around a bio hazard facility, and the absurd conclusion. I have been waiting for at least some scenes or drawings that have at least one modicum of realism, credibility or being able to convey some empathy / sympathy - but this has proven in vain.
