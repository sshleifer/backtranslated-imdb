Having read it for many years about how this great movie was, how it established Ruiz among the French critics (especially the Cahiers brown people), when I finally watched it about a year ago, I found it Very disappointing (but then I guess I expect they were sky-high). The satire of black and white, this cerebral spray film (made for TV, and mercifully, is only an hour long) said in the form of a conversation between an art connoisseur and an off-screen conference as they ponder a series of paintings (which are shown in the style of living table) and try to find out if they hold some clues on a hidden political crime. (The Dark Kate Beckinsale movie discovered there is a similar argument). Borgesian is a word I read much in review of this movie, but I'd say almost any Borges story is much more interesting than this movie.
