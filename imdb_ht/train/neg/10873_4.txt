Many people thought that this is a good movie but I do not agree with them. At the beginning of the movie, a space shattering earth and some of the aliens escaped from the container, then hey killed some people on the ground, but for no reason. Also, it's in a dark forest, I can not see anything on the screen, I can only hardly hear the sound. <br /> After a few days, the predator came to earth, but no one had sent his signal before he should not know what was happening on the ground, so there was a contradiction. Finally, the predator found the director of the aliens and killed him for no reason. He did not live on earth, not in his business about things that happened here. Lastly, the film's duration is only 90 minutes long, the summary is too short and it can not tell the reviews about the story clearly. <br /> In conclusion, I do not think this is a good movie.
