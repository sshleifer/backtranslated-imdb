I went to know nothing about this movie and I walked out half an hour knowing everything about it. It was one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I'm a generally nice person but if someone told me they loved this movie, I'd probably never talk to them again. Anyone who loves it is most likely to have a very dry, personality type hermit. I will also include that they think they are very intelligent too, just like their own self-centered fart that makes their voices for the movie. I know everyone has different types of humor, some people can not even love me, but that's okay; I do not think this covers any humor series though. This film is as flat and dull as Wes Anderson's mind. Go in and be ready to walk; It is best to get your money back too.
