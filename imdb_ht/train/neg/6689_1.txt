I can only assume that the other "movie" reviews are shareholders of the production company, as well as possibly the worst movie I've seen in the last five years. From the opening shot of a contested street laughs for no apparent reason, it was clear that the actors in this movie would kill them to be considered "B-Level". Both my wife and I were in a great mood before starting this movie, and we were really looking forward to a funny popcorn movie. We knew we did not rent Kane citizens, and we did not expect to see the most amazing movie ever. However, after 40 minutes of enduring little of the unfunny malfunction I've ever seen, we close it in instead of wasting another minute in our lives. <br /> If a "comedy" with no laugh, terrible act, draw thin and annoying characters are your stuff, then this movie is for you. Honestly, trol 2 is better - at least I laugh at the popcorn sex scene. <br /> I can not justify writing a longer review of this photo because I've already wasted almost an hour trying to find a single joke.
