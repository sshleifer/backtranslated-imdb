Looking back at another bad nightmare like Freddy's Revenge, you have at least give it some credit to try something new. And although the dreamer child is more enjoyable he offers absolutely nothing new to the series. Yes, there are creative deaths as usual, as a kid becomes part of a comic book and faces "Super Freddy" but even scenes such as not used in all potentials and parties without Freddy it's just boring. <br /> This marks the official death of the series scariness. Freddy seems to be relieving the comedy now ... but in that? <br /> Rating: 4/10
