1st view 5/17/2002 - 3 out of 10 (Direct-Ewald Andre Dupont): Conversely blaming the Titanic disaster is the first version filmed at this much-announcement event. The catastrophic disorder is not bad, but the drama around it is in some unusual times, seriously acting and over-so-so opera-like. The story is much the same as one of the most recent oscar-winning except that we are showing how the crew tried to hide the current disaster that has happened to almost too late. Good for just nostalgia reasons and get a feel for what James Cameron has competed against (barely ??) in his recreation.
