Hi, Everyone, If you've seen "Singing in the Rain," you remember the scene of Gene Kelly dancing in the rain. You also remember the dancing number of Donald O'Connor, "Make 'em laugh." If you saw "Royal Wedding," you will remember Fred Astaire dancing on the ceiling. If you've seen "Jailhouse Rock," you'll even remember the dancing title number choreographed by the king himself. <br /> <br /> That's what's missing here. There might have been some blockbuster dancing numbers in this presentation. The closest thing was Chuck McGowan's "I can do that." The only fact that you have some talented people on stage moving together by making a great movie dance. Richard Attenborough blamed for this failure. She showed the camera at the scene and she thought that would be a good thing. <br /> <br /> Yelling to audition for part of a Broadway production is not entertainment. Michael Douglas would be just as badly thrown if he was in a west or a comedy. It's OK when it's in a movie Michael Douglas where we see him call someone we'd like to call in. It does not work here. <br /> The cast was good except for Michael, of course. A good movie could be done even using the songs in the stage production, but someone should have thought about how to film it. Next time to do one of those I hope to call me first. <br /> <br /> Tom Willett
