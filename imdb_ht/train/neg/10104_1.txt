I only looked at the first 30 minutes of this and I saw it was a total piece of crap. The scene I saw was as bad as a Ed Wood movie. No, it was one hundred times worse. Ed Wood has the reputation of being the worst director ever, but that's not true; The leader of this junk is the director who works all the time. <br /> <br /> The American Cop has a German accent! The "Police Station" was an office in a warehouse with a sign of "Police Station" hanging on the wall. There is a point where the punches are missing clearly on the FOUND zen. <br /> <br /> This cop pulls women over, the cuffs and leads them to a warehouse. He tells his partner waiting to wait in the car. Then he came out of the store to carry a duffel bag. The cop partner may think something is wrong, which partner he might be a bad cop who killed these women, but it's not sure if that's what's happening because it's a moron! The dialogue is totally stupid, the act is terrible, and the characters act in the stupid way I've ever seen on the screen. It is totally evident to the cop's partner that she is illegally kidnapping these women and it is tapping and taking them into a storage and returning to the car with a duffel bag and a body in it, and yet, the partner, whom which is all together, does not know what's going on! <br /> <br /> The director of this movie is a total hack. I stopped the movie in 30 minutes because I could not take it again. She has one of the worst movies I've ever started looking and I will not waste time writing about this review. <br /> <br /> Absolutely WORTHLESS.
