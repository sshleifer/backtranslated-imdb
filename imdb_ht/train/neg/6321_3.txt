I can not imagine anyone ever, in a million years, wanting to watch this movie. Not because it was one of the worst ever to do (it was not), but largely because it's about 20 years old and oh-so-out of the main. I was trying to find out where I saw a previous actor and this time. So, yes, a kid stops playing small league because he does not love nukes, this highlights media attention and a quick resolution of the cold war. End of. A fantasy, to be sure, but one so cockeyed it would make John Lennon blush. Since terrorism has replaced communism like theismism that makes the evildoer out of us, this film really does not matter, except as a (incorrect) look back at those times. Writing, acting, and craft films are just as unfamiliar. The reason I rated it as pretty as I did because I watched this movie around 50 times while I was 5-6 years old and still has a little bit of my heart for it, but I'm now realize that it does not quite cut mustard. So, if the law of great numbers keep true and someone eventually decided to check out this movie, realize that there are better ways to spend your time, but also many people. (I'm going to avoid a John Q. tirade for now.)
