I saw this on TV the other night? or rather I flicked over to another channel so they often look infomercials when I could not stop watching it again. It was bad. Really, really bad. Not "so bad it is good" just flat out bad. How did he get funded? Who thought this was a good idea? An actor's friend in my auditioned and said he was not good enough to play a bad guy but I think these meanings were "save yourself and runaway from this pile of files to @ # $%." I bet the remaining cast gave the option. To justify the act was difficult to judge because of their terrific American pregnancy. The tire was dullllllllllll. The action was awkward and stilted. The dialogue was insane. Not far from the infamous ship. In real life the Interislander ferry is a shabby boat and his movie does not scrub up properly. Instead of trying very unsuccessfully to make it look like a new crew liner and the jubileur bits wrap around rusting polls, my kid you are not, they might have to change the script to explain or even celebrate the shabbiness. Mute, dumb, dumb. Do not watch this movie, not just as a joke.
