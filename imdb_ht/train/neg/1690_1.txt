This film was awful. I could barely stay awake at it. I would never see this movie again if I was paid. The so-called so-called scenes of it were abnormally predictable and played. There was really nothing about this movie that would have made it original or worth the $ 7.50 I paid to see it. Do not go see it, do not rent it, do not read it online because any of these things should be a complete waste of your time. Sara Michelle Geller has provided a substandard performance and really should be disappointed in herself for sullying her good name with this movie. Shame on you Sarah to be associated with this horrible, horrible movie. Terrible film, never need to see it.
