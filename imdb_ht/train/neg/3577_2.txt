This early Pia Zadora car follows a familiar Harold Robbins Formula: ambitious character character of decadence while pursuing the path to the top of some selected randomly but glamorous world, in this case the film industry. But despite being so formal as to be completely predictable, this film manages at the same time to be completely incredible. Zadora (called inexperienced as an actress is to be charitable) is never convinced as a senarist. One would expect a movie about film-making to have some insights into its own industry and creative processes. But the script gives it any of the qualities that make writers interesting characters: observance, skill and words, a love-hatred relationship and one's own creative ability. Her character is as empty as a donut hole. And this is just a taste of the incompetence of display here. The cinematography is so quiet that it is sometimes hard to see what's happening. And the scenes never really hang together, so everything looks like a succession at random times in the bad Hollywood party. Avoid.
