Funny I find myself forced to review this movie, but here I am. <br /> I reviewed it, because just recently, I had the chance to witness the revival of R.C. Playing Sheriff's "Journey End" on the New York scene, at the Belasco Theater, begins Hugh Darcy, Boyd Gaines, Jefferson Mays and others, as well as being mastered by David Grindley. <br /> I left the theater breaking. I'm not exaggerated, I was flabbergasted. After almost two and a half hours of a repeated and very claustrophobic illustration of the soldier's life of the slingshot of the Somme (I speculate), during the Second World War, brought him to clear life, not everyone involved, I was out in the theater and awe. <br /> <br /> Your Mind, I'm not easy to shock, or I'm too sensitive. I'm a stage actor and a director myself, so I know the buttons that have been pressed to achieve certain effects, both emotionally, as well as psychologically. <br /> But what I was just witnessing came to life, and I was thrilled in my spine as I left. <br /> <br /> None of these emotions came to life, while watching "Aces High", the movie based on this game and even suited to the screen, in cooperation with RC Sheriff himself, a Shortly before he died. <br /> <br /> Adaptation of screen takes place in the sky over France. So going is the clostrophobic ambition to begin with. <br /> <br /> The only plus in the movie is the aerial battle scene, which looks dated in the special effects, compared to today's standards, but still very valuable in the flying tactics adopted on the screen . The grant was a couple of screen adaptations of "all the quiet on the Western Front" by Erich Maria Remarque, which took place in trenches, and not heaven, but that was the vision " German "about things, if one would like to be serious about things. <br /> <br /> The "End of the Journey" is just the other side of the medal, and they would do it in a big movie if they left it alone and intact. <br /> <br /> The transfer on DVD is poor, though in Widescreen and adapted for 16: 9 TV screen, the quality of the movie itself is that of movie theater. There is nothing more, nothing less. It sports various damage, such as minor miners and points, although the copy, for the rest, is clean. <br /> <br /> If you want another WWI movie in your collection, especially for those who like and enjoy seeing aerial battle among old-timers, then this is a picture for you. But I would rather suggest "Von Richthofen and Brown" as an alternative, although this is also a movie full of inaccuracies. For the rest of you, who loves good acting and drama, I would leave this out. Buy the play. Go to the play, if you are lucky to find a decent revival in it near you, but keep in this adaptation. <br /> It is an anti-war movie, granted, but the weakest I've ever seen in my life ever. <br /> The presence of actors like Trevor Howard, Ray Milland, Richard Johnson and John Gielgud, is just a bluff, since they were just seen in very weak and many roles stolen throughout the movie. McDowell, very talented Christopher Plummer, Simon Ward and Peter Firth, all deliver very weak performance, not due to lack of competence, but rather due to lack of true and solid direction. <br /> There are too many gaps in it, and as said before, it drags itself to the dubious end. Drugs because of the original play, none of the guys have come to know and sympathize with, stay alive. They all died on a fatal and ineffective mission. In the movie they all die, except Malcolm McDowell, who somehow managed to stay alive another day, being the commander of the wing of the unlucky bunch, just getting another three pilots to fly and die for another lost cause. /> End of the game leaves a staggering stage of total darkness. You just hear the roaring cannons, the machine guns, and the pomegranate impact of the whole theater. Then, suddenly, total peace and silence. The curtain comes. Light. And here are all. Alone, standing straight and rigid. Obedient bosses <br /> <br /> Far more interesting and far more shocking than final "high Aces", which is also dragged by the hair. <br /> <br /> It is up to you to judge For me, if I had the money and contacts to do that, I would take the play and develop it, the way it meant. Added here and there are some action scenes in the field, just visualizing the "exterior" horror and killing going through the "vast gardens of France", around the men involved, but then, just strictly focusing on what will about, in which little "shack" in the corner of sanity and the world ... <br /> Want to be a movie? <br /> <br /> Then ask for it. <br /> <br /> This is not it.
