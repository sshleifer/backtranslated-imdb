This movie is funny and painful at the same time. The "Cinemagic" almost gave me a seizure. Despite these, "Cinemagic" is not some innovative techniques. It was "developed" as a result of an accident, and was used because it disguised the fact that the "monsters" were so stupid-looking. I also do not think it is a coincidence that the writer is South "Pink". This movie is good for a laugh, if you really looking for a movie that's made in 9 days over 200,000 dollars. It is fun; At least I can say that about it. Stick / rat / spider is the highlight.
