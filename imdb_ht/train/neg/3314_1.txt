Reading through all these positive reviews I find myself bewildering. How is it that much loved what I consider to be a horrible adaptation to my second favorite Jane Austen novel? There are many issues with the movie, which is already mentioned in a few reviews; Simply put it is a hammed-up, over-act, chinty chaos from endless credit to end up. <br /> While many characters are mis-cast and neither Ewan McGregor nor Toni Collette put in a worthy performance, the worst is near Paltrow. I enjoyed her great performance in some roles, but here she is abominable - she is self-conscious, at nose, sclouching and entirely disconnected from her character and those around her. A very irresistible effort - though even a perfect Emma could not have saved this movie.
