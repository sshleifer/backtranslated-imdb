This movie is terrible. The CGI is the very cheap gray CGI shotgun. The crocodile looks like a big gray stuffed. Worst is that no effort at all is given to make it walk or look like it is alive. It's mostly a photo-cut CGI that's set in scene and you almost expect to see the hand that moves the CGI Fog across the screen. This is one of the worst examples of CGI effects that I have ever witnessed, and I've seen many of the highly sci-fi movies very much. Aside from the terrible lack of special effects, the cast is composed of typical low-cost actors that probably work as Waiters / Waitresses at local dinner while waiting for Big Breaks. Perhaps the most ridiculous scene in this movie is when one of the bad guys tries to attack sexual Kate and jumps to giant crocodiles straight from the water on the second floor of the cruel headquarters and in the balcony and pulling the bad guy in Kate and instead of collecting straight down the building (and crushing the Kate) Croc just jumped backwards to the same angle of water. No laws of physics can apply to this movie or the special effects. At least there are honors among crocodiles.
