This film looks as if it would be good at the beginning but never flesh out of its expectations. The director is talented and has some good camera angles and artistic ideas (typical of the Asian directors), but he does not know how to create or tell a good story to go along with it. The story was fragmented and seemed to go through in all sorts of different directions throughout the film, never found a solid, explaining, interesting angle. Basically, the movie never fit the explicit press releases. The act was very good, however. All the actors gave good performance, and Jude Law was outstanding as it always is. It's too bad he's been choosing to make a movie like that.
