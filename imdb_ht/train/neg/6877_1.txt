I sat beside a documentary on Puerto Rico, and I ended up looking at Nuyoricans. When I go to Puerto Rico, I fail to see the 50% living in poverty. When I see people struggling, they are usually Haitian, Dominicans, or Cubans who just arrived on the island. There is no such thing as spanglish ... either you speak Spanish, or you do not ... and in what I heard ... you do not. Pedro Albizo Campos is not MLK for me. MLK was a big man. Campos is a great person for those who want independence which is 1%. The rest of it is as Loko as Osama Bin Laden. Portraits that want independence are a bunch of fools. If you want any evidence of all your dreams in a Puerto Rico independent, see Cuba, Haiti, the Dominican Republic, the Bahamas, the South and Central America, and Mexico. His wonder worked for them. This documentary is not about Puerto Rico, this documentary was about the Nuyoricans and their struggle .. For those who are not enough in Africa was on the show ... he was supposed to be on Puerto Rico ... by Africa . Denzel will be just a little time just for you. <br /> In conclusion ... of those ignorant white people who think we need green cards to come to the US, and want to learn how the prime minister has run things, this is not a good documentary on Puertorican culture. Tell your kids to pay attention to geography, and history classes. <br /> <br /> *** Update *** <br /> <br /> Bocabonita ... "doc." was on Nuyoricans. It encourages it as if it's all we feel. Should they have titles ... "They are soy nuyorican ... lunche ... can not speak Spanish." PLEASE USE PUERTO RICO, RICAN, BORICUA, OR ANY OTHER ASSOCIATION AND PRINCIPALS WITH THE HISTORY OF THE ISSTOR LOSS. God prevents them from playing this on the island.
