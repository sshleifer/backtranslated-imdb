Dewaana as a movie goes into the usual clich√©s. Man and woman fall in love with couples, husband is supposedly killed by a family friend who wants families to fortune, remarried women and surprise surprise husband no.1 reappears. The film is reminiscent of the Chandni Yash Chopra and others. Divy Bharti and Shah Rukh Khan give good performance. Amrish Puri as a villain goes to the motions and nothing more than a standard Bollywood musician by Nadeem Shravan is superb, all the songs were brilliant. My favorites are Sochenge tumhe pyar or Koyi na koyi chahiyye. Dewanna is an ordinary film that goes to the motions.
