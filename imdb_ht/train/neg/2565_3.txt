There are just so many things wrong with this movie. <br /> <br /> To begin with, the first twenty minutes of the movie could be compressed in just five or maybe ten. This movie is generally (mercifully) short already, but this could be made up by giving a little more attention to the desired lion (how lacked a reference to the "Wiz" on one?) And working subplot it a little more to enter the main draw. In short, the script had a good idea, but needed a bit of reworking. Secondly, it could be done without the humorous bitterness. The original also has some that it can do without, but at least it was almost a post-time - here, flatulence and urine has a lot. <br /> <br /> Third, the show is a little too self-aware. The original series was quite good, as did the first movie, but here it's just way, too much way. Brendan's Fraser in the jokes was just a bit on the head (and why no mention of the "new Ursula"?). Other gags and the Narrator, especially a couple of interactions near the end, also surpassed common sense. <br /> <br /> Fourth, maybe a bit more attention was given to the work CGI. In the first it was said that Shemp was not a real elephant (except by behavior, of course), but here the CGI stands out as a malicious thumb. Exceptionally special effects should simply tell the story whether they are good or bad, and at least succeed in this count, so it's a relatively small problem, but it's still there. <br /> All that was said, Christopher Showerman's performance as George is decent enough. It misses Brendan Fraser's charm, but Christopher just fails in specific comparisons - he even managed to give George a bit of personal depth, which would be a major bigger in a Jay Ward-inspired film, but not here . Julie Benz as the new Ursula surprised me as being even better than Leslie Mann in the original. <br /> <br /> Most other performances were pretty standard, not standing out of my mind as either good or bad.
