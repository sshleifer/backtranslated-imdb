This is the worst brain damaged, ultra cheap, super stupid, humorous, useless piece of garbage I have ever seen, an incredible garbage in instant instant situation among fans of the rare. If you think that "The Plan 9" Ed Wood is bad, well ... let me tell you, looks like "Citizens Kane" compared to this one. Special effects? ... again, "Plan 9" is "Star Wars". Â¿Acting? ... Thor Johnson is Al Pacino ... So it's beyond bad, really. And if you are looking for the kind of incredible movies, it's for you! I am a fan of American Americans for many glorious horror movies, the legendary price-Corman-Poe and some great blaxploitation things, but with the "Star Creatures" they go down to the Z level. Of course, I'm 1 out of 10 work at Reverse if you like watching movie movies for fun (the guy playing an American master is great) for having fun and enjoying ... if you can.
