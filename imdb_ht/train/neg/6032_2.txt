I am a Christian who generally believes in the Theological Teaching in Left Behind. That said, I think Behind Behind is one of the worst movies I've seen in some time. To have a good movie, you need to have a well-written scenario. Behind Behind fell on that courage. For one thing, it radically deviates from the book. Sometimes this is done to condense a 400-page novel down to a two-hour movie, but in this movie I've seen changes that have no sense. <br /> <br /> Another thing, has zero character development. When characters in the story get saved (I will not tell who), the book makes it clear that it's a long, soul-searching process. In the movie it's quick and artificial. The book is written considerably enough where people like Rayford Steele, Buck Williams and Hattie Durham look like real, but in the movie scenarios they always provide quick treatment without considerable anything. In another scene where a character gets mad about being left behind (again, I will not tell who), it looks artificial. <br /> I realized as a Christian it's unedifying to say I licked this movie, but I can not be in a good conscience to recommend a movie that I feel was horribly done. Perhaps it would have been better to make the first book of 2-3 films. Either way, Christians need to realize that they must be taken seriously as filmmakers, we need to begin by combining a movie in a quality way. I realized a lot of efforts probably left Left Behind, but that's the way I saw it.
