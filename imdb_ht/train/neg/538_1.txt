Wow, what a waste of talent acting. My husband and I sat there, both thinking, this has to get better, these actresses are too good to waste their time on this crap. Unattractive characters, rack script, and rhythm lists make for an hour of time. I actually could not hack it and left to make the supermarket shopping (cat cats being more appealing than that movie). The husband remained and confirmed that he did not get better - by the time Buddy dies, you wanted them all to get hit by a car and end up miserable life. It would be infinitely more fun. Beautiful scenery and costume can not hold this one alive.
