Now I love Bela Lugosi, do not get me wrong, it is one of the most interesting people ever to make a movie but it certainly has shared it with clunkers. That's just another one of these. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br/> <br/> She is however experimenting to keep her young and beautiful wife.It's revealing that she's 70-80 years old yet Lugosi seems to be in her mid 50's so why she's getting married to this old woman never really explain. <br /> In all of these treatments or experiences involving the brides that are at the altar being married some sort of painful heart how to pass out but they thought they must die. When Lugosi and some of his assistants, steal the body on his way to the mog and take him back to his lab where he's caught in some sort of suspended animation or catatonic state. Then the stolen brides have a needle rammed somewhere in their body, perhaps the neck, and then the needle rammed into the body Lugosi's wife brought back to youth and beauty.We never really saw where Lugosi sticks the needle or what it is that it draws from the brides, but he somehow restores his wife .Old old age makes you cry and pain because the wife Lugosi makes a lot of screaming until she gets back to her younger state .Help Lugosi in her lab is just that good thing on this movie ... a strange old stranger and her defective son ... one son is a great Kawotc houkously looking fellow actors who love romantic snoozing brides and the other son is a little mean ... little man, to be politically correct in today's world. At night these three just sort of pile up and sleep in Lugosi's lorry down laboratory. Who are these 3 and how the pair of lugosi's associations are, as a lot of stuff in this movie, never explained. So, anyway a female reporter assigns the placement by gruffing her editors to find out where all the brides stolen are gone.The quickly figure out th one common thing among all the stolen brides is an orchid rare that they found on them.So he asked around and said that there is a renowned world Orchid living living nearby that just happens are one of those who develop this orchid particular. This expert turns out to be climbing Dr..Lorenz.She quickly tracks him down and troubling his little house into horror. I'm not sure where the police were all this, but they came to mop up after the reporter did all the work place. <br /> It seems that the Lugosi movie still has some sort of line drawn without funny funny that just made the feeling of heaven high. I mean a famous orchid world expert kidnaps brides by throwing them a doped up orchid even known to have developed? D'OH! <br /> Then later it's revealed that the young ladies do not even have to be brides for the procedure to work so why would Lugosi keep kidnapping from heavily guarding church for his experience and creating all the attention and newspaper titles? Why not just take a whore on the street like a normal weirdo pervert would? This clunker reminds me a lot of another stinker Lugosi, the "Devil Bat" ... even funny comic and malicious acting and even funny 'reporters become bad guys' deals. <br /> But Lugosi is always good - it is crappy and disaster enough to keep you interested at least enough to keep watching it. The girl playing the reporter was just a terrible actor .... she had no any emotions, she just delivered her line like a machine gun, spewing them out as quickly as she could.Everything else pretty much blew Also, when it came to being good actors. <br /> But this is to look, if only for Bela Lugosi fans.Lugosi was still so intense even when the picture was a dog.It was to know he had made terrible pictures but maybe he also knew that if he gave it everything he had a little bit of that intensity could shine in the past all the bad and bad acting environments surrounding him. <br /> And it was good ---- Our horror fans will always have a love for Bela Lugosi. He gave it all his timer and was in front of the camera. We gave two f ** ks for you, Bela.
