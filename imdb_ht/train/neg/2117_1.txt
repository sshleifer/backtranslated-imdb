The bride will die at the altar, and the dead will disappear. Everyone is concerned, but nobody seems to be able to figure out why and how it happens, nor to prevent it from happening. Come with me. Bela Lugosi is responsible for this, as it is extracting spinal fluid from these young women to transfuse her ex-wife and keep her alive. Continue with me. Finally, the authorities understand that a person must be dead and extinct, but, of course, can not evaluate the probable motive. Let's just ignore the funny pseudoscience and move on ... If you can get into the first twenty wines of this mess, you will be treated in Lugosi rubbing his assistant laboratory to defile one of the brides he has murdered, explaining that he found himself sleeping in a coffin far more comfortable than a bed, and other vagal parody of real horror movies (the type and budget and plots). Anyhow - a female journalist follows his nose in the culprit (and remarkably police are inept nowhere to be seen!), And then the fun really begins. <br /> <br /> The cinematography and acting are OK. There are a lot of well-dressed, very good looking people in this movie. The direction is just, and the script is slightly better than the material deserves. But this movie failed to support all of the interests, but the most hardened movie b-movie fans. The best thing about it .... It eventually ends, but not soon enough.
