For my first taste at Shakespeare on stage, I can not believe what these people did in a perfectly good play. <br /> <br /> - Let's start off with the good bit, is it for us? - Alan Rickman is well, although some of his dialogues could have been saved with more feelings. The rest of the actors need to pull it together. <br /> <br /> Romeo, Romeo, why do not you die again, Romeo? The actor, while not only completely wooden and deadpan, could not read his line with any good at all. It was completely out of focus, had difficulty even looking Juliet in the face, and absolutely NO favored with the lines he had given. Anyone who threw it deserves to be punished. Juliet is almost beams, but it does not give his character's depth, and it seems to be completely out of touch with the play. Mercutio was incredibly creepy and completely out of character throughout his dialogue. Benvolio was unfeeling and pity overlooked with his line. <br /> I was forced to hold this half-baked production of Romeo and Juliet. The act was stilted and the costumes are nothing short of distracting. I've seen kindergarten puppet shows and more effort put on them. I only want that I could give this movie a rating of zero.
