I could not recommend a Christmas movie more than this worthless piece of drivel (trust me, the double doubts asked here - it's bad). This movie was in trouble from the opening credits when it was revealed that the senarist was the same as the songwriter. Music numbers are all too long and none of them are good ("Thank you very much" has a decent melody, but lyrics are stupid farther words). I would be pleased to bring the chains torn by Scrooge in the secrecy of secrecy of the film than sitting in this insult in movie music again. Only the fun part of this movie (completely unintentional in the way) involves Alec Guinness as Jacob Marley. Dressed in a purple white suit, Guinness fossishly thinks at his scene of what was either an attempt to make it appear as if he was floating like a ghost, or to show his utter disdain and have to be in this movie objectionable. Albert Finney, meanwhile, mixes the best of Alistar Sim and Charles Laughton to create the hopelessly drawn character of Quasimodo / Scrooge. Finney Scrooge is so horrible to someone, it is impossible to believe his transformation. <br /> <br /> Steer clear of this abomination of the movie all the expenses.
