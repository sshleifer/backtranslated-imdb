You can never see either film and still know that Jerk Too is a disaster. The question is not, "How did he do," because if you send money to anyone and say they do a movie, they will do so. The question is "Why, why, did Steve Martin allow it to be done?" I think he needed the money to fight a nuisance suit and was determined not to listen to him. He knew the end would be so frightful, from pride, he would not even count his usage as income. The only way this could not be a troubles was Carl Gottlieb and Steve Martin to revive the nation's favorite poor black family. <br /> And "dcreasy2001" (aka Mark Blankfield?): It's just obvious obvious that you have worked on this movie in some sad abilities, and the only way you can feel better about your involvement is to be indifferent The Lone Cheerleader as a IMDb user comment. I prayed for you to keep on satir, but alas, you really did an effort to turn. Why not 10 stars?
