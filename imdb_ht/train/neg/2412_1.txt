This film is yet another in length with no budget, no effort, no talented movies shooting on video and giving a glik cover of dupe unsuspecting tenants in the video store. <br /> <br /> If you want to know what is watching this movie is like, grab a video camera with some red dye and movie yourself with your friends wandering around the neighborhood at night firmly and "attacking "people. Congratulations, you've just made the "Hood of the Living Dead"! Now see if a distribution company will buy it from you. <br /> I've seen some low budget, shooting on video films that appear talented from the filmmakers and actors or in the effort very little, but that's not. Avoid unless you are a true masochist or amused by wrong doing horror movies.
