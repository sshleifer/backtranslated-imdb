1st view 12/26/2008 - (Dir-Eugene Levy): Corny mystery trading murders and some few laughs. The film appears to be based on an earlier Italian film according to the credits but was re-written by two popular American comedian writers writers. But this one by Charles Shyer & Nancy Meyers does not cut it compared to other efforts. The story is about a couple of Americans down-and-out, played by Richard Lewis and Sean Young, who fell on a lost dog and hoping to make a chance of rewarding money after seeing an ad in the paper to return dachsund la. When trying to return it, they see a stick sticking from a garage door to the lady's residence that they believe is attached to the rest of the body dead of the woman who is supposed to give them the money. They freak out and instead contact the police and tell them the truth they make out like runaway from the scene waiting to be framed for the murder. The other characters in the movie are met on a train before and hang in a gambling resort Monte Carlo doing various things to be pulled into the story. Other cast cast members include actors John Candy, James Belushi, Cybill Shepherd, George Hamilton and others. After the police found information about the death, they began questioning the main characters and, of course, they have to work through their jumps to figure out what really happened. None of the actors mentioned earlier can bring this movie from the state to its mediocrity despite some funny moments mainly provided by the Belushi / Shepherd Couple. This is not a horrible movie, it just is not that good. There are many average movies out there and that's just another for the deck. Try it, maybe you'll like it, you probably will not.
