I'm a big fan of Stooges, but the one and only buy adequate this film there is Curley is in it. Doing so long before he started to drink heavily he's classical in this (and Larry's not bad either). Moe's character is a straightforward part (especially) and this movie would be best called "The Curley and Larry Movie". Not that any of the movies Stooges were very good (in my opinion), but as a commenter here said, how sad it is that this movie was real potential. The casting was good, it was well directed, filmed, and edited, but the story line tried on something serious and just some antique stooges and music numbers (which I guess was good back then) thrown inch the best thing you can do for yourself during this movie you should actually believe it has to be better than cutting the lawn and taking out the garbage (which is subject to debate) is to wait for curley / Larry scene and sleep or find something in the kitchen to eat while the rest of it.
