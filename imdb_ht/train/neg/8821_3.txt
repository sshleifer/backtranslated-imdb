Why, oh, why not learn? When you have a nice, juicy exploitation gadget, use it! Do not go mourning around trying to find all deep and thoughtful; you're just going to wind up looking crazy. <br /> <br /> Christmas Evil is the story of Harry Stadling, who has seen a little too much of Mommy Kiss (Daddy-Dress-Up) Santa Claus back when he was a kid. So, of course, Harry is growing obsessed with Christmas, and finally, when his deployment gets too big, he jumps out, dresses like Santa, and wanders the city to give good toys, and viciously kills anyone he loves naughty. <br /> <br /> Simple enough, and not a bad place to start. (After all, how many other holiday-themed horror cops used the same?) Unfortunately, this movie wants to have more "Santa, portrait of a serious assassin" than "silent night, mortal night". Two-thirds of the movie are spending documenting hanging down but Harry's unavoidable breakdown, when I'd wanted to buy the house by the title time the openings were rolling. You know a slasher movie is in trouble when you find yourself asking the killer just to get it already. <br /> <br /> Perhaps Harry's descent of madness could be compelling in the hands of a competent director, but alas, we had some guy named Lewis Jackson. Apparently, this is his only movie, and it shows. The action giddily jumps from the stage scene, without establishing shots or clear views of the actors telling us where we are and what we see. <br /> <br /> Even once the movie gets rolled, we are always treated to help the help of Harry's self-pity, insecurity, and neurotic behaviors. More depressing than scary, evil Christmas is one to avoid.
