I never actually thought that a movie might be so aggressive, but my misery was wrong. Terrible act, draw terrible, terrible effect. The crocodile was awful and as for the sex scene / kill scene all in one, that was a bad move from the word gone. It was really shocking and that's not a compliment! How to make this film, look it back and then actually say "Yeah, thats a good movie. People will look that" If you have not seen it I ask you DO NOT :-(
