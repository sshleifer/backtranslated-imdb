This will be short. Let me first state that I am agnostic and not exactly crazy about xtians, especially xtian fans. However, this documentary had a tone in the love of some young people angry at her xtian mother for not letting her play video games. I just could not take it seriously. How did CharlesManson think he was the Christ to illustrate the point that xtianity can cross evil? I do not know it was just cheap and childish - made the opposition ignorant. In addition, the narrator just seemed snobby and firefighting. The delivery was overkill. I can not take this documentary seriously. Would be appealing to an angry teen piss3d off her xtian mother for not letting her play video games.
