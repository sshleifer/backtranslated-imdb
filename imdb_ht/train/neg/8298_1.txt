This movie was not fun, certainly NO NOW as original or as good as a Christmas story. Characters (except the least) try to emulate the previous actors and fail. The mountain neighbors from nowhere are not part of the first movie. This really sucks, would be good and the original cast, then again maybe not because the story is so weak. Skip it.
