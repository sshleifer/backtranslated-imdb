(Honestly, Barbra, I know it's you who clicks all those "NO" in my review .22 times? How many people have you been instructed to help you out here? You have nothing better to do, such as looking at yourself at Mirror all day?) <br /> <br /> Steven Spielberg told Barbra that this was "the best movie I've seen since 'Citizens Kane'". That's pretty much telling it all - and it serves as a heavy warning! <br /> What are the ingredients for a disaster that ensure fire-cinemas, and one that will haunt you, never let you forget tears and pain? The ingredients: Barbra Streisand's face, a musician, feminist, Streisand's barbara voice, Barbra Streisand is directing, with an ultra-corny / idiotic quote. <br /> <br /> Hollywood is full of egomaniacs, this much we know. In fact, almost everyone ?? by definition ?? have to be an egomaniac in Hollywood. Why does someone want to act? For the "art" ?! Well, if you're dumb enough to believe what they tell you to carefully prepare them ?? And Streisand has the largest month of them all! This is quite a success. Will be surrounded by Narcissistic Cretins, and yet manage themselves all? Notable. The movie, like all his "solos" initiatives, is an ego trip right out of hell. Each Streisand stage is automatically destroyed. Still. But as it was not enough, she sang a whole bunch of songs to Streisandy ?? You know, the qualities that allowed Mariah Careys, the Celine Dions, and the Whitney Hustons in this world to our precious time-wave poisons for decades now. Just for what he deserved by one but 100 South Park episodes mocking him. Mostly, the Streisand dressed as a man in the study became a rabbit, sounds like a zany comedy ZAZ. Apart from it was a clich√©, the obvious problem is that Streisand does not look like a woman or she looks like a man ?? In fact I'm not even sure it's people. The road it looks like in this movie, well ?? It can not be described in the words. E.T. looks like a high school jock by comparison. It looks more alien than Michael Jackson in the year 2015. It looks horror. <br /> <br /> Singing. They make me tremble. Particularly "Dad can hear me Squeel like a Demented Female Roller in heat?" and "Tomorrow I'll prepare the end, YENTL 2: Return to the Package". <br /> <br /> Did you know that Streisand considers he had a nose-work early in his career, but changed his mind when his voice would change? Can you believe that? It should be done! Kill two flies with one slip, that's what would be known. <br /> If you are interested in reading my biography Barbra Streisand and other Hollywood scholars, contact me by e-mail. <br /> SHOULD BE RELATED BARBRA ONLY INNOVATIVE?
