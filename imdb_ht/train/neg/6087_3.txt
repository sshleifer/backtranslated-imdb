This movie was not nearly as much of a chore as I expected it to be. There are a few seconds of shine in this hardcore little exotic UFO paranoia-fest conspiracy. Most of the act is mediocre, but fairly typical of the 1970s-style stuff replete with pregnant pauses. A photographer and a few tempting witnesses tested in the woods and soon fell victim to the same things. Flying dishes are spotted, more people disappear - but is it the aliens or ultra-secret government of our own government to cover-up guys? Soon enough, a reporter and an "UFOlogist" (apparently modeled on the character of the director's writer) are drawn to this fascist to unravel them and become the target of the ultra-secret agents who are as ominous as they are improbable and insane . Then the fun really starts. The film, predictably, made about as much sense as the average theory of UFO scheme, but should commend itself so seriously. Working in the OK camera for a low-budget film, the rhythm is very good, the script is funny and absurd, and there are continuous issues that are fun to look out for. Which seconds are some of the brightest I mentioned? Honestly, I can not tell you a lot without writing a beck. Sufficient to say that by the end of the film is, at least, worth-throwing if you can not take the middle.
