Let me start from saying I will try not to put too many flocks in this. Normally I enjoy Robin Williams movies, however this gem was not one of them. He was billed as a suspense suspense. The night list was nothing but. To be weakened there were 6 people on the theatrical opening day, 2 walked out, for good reason. The film was in my opinion wrong writing and directing. Acting was fine, but again there was nothing to work with. The movie is about A storybook that reads a good book by a child dead. However * insert spooky here * no one can verify the existence of the children. So Williams goes to Wisconsin to try and find the author, however all he gets is a headache and excuses from the boy keeper. There is that, it's all. You wait for an hour and a half and finish film. She has many thrills and thrills as a dentist's office visit. The homosexual Abondones, or Harmony really did not have anything to do with the story, and the film had a little profanity but it seemed to be thrown in there for absolutely no reason and made little sense. In conclusion I really can not write a decent review on this movie because there was nothing in it, it was as fascinating as it was watching dry paint. I gave her a 2 because the act for what she was worth was okay and she was not headed by Uwe Boll.
