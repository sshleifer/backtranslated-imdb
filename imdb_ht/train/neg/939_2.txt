I liked the Batman TV series and were really looking forward to this. But they tried to do too much. <br /> Why were Adam and West's story tortured trying to restore the batmobile beyond me? I do not want to hit Burt or Adam for the way they look now ..... It was 35 years since they appeared in Batman and Robin, but to see them dressed in costume clothing and fighting badguys was a bit sad. I would rather see just the old stars commenting. Batmobile side story was stupid. <br /> As for the flashback movie, I think it was too short and left out too much way. It was really just a quick overview of my opinion. I would like more background. They showed the penguin and djokor for about a minute each just to say the same thing I already knew. The joker had a mustache under her makeup and the penguin smoked even though she hated it and was a former smoker. It was about these 2. <br /> I would like to read the book. I'm sure she has more of it than this has been shown. Like that, there were 2 Riddlers or why 3 Catwakans or 3 Misk Freeze. Where was Commissioner Gordon, Cheif OHara, Alfred, Mister Freeze, King Tut, etc. The list goes on. Like I said even those who were in this one were barely in it. <br /> <br /> Very irritating. And really corny.
