Why did I go to see this movie? Well, because Jim Carrey was in it and in the past he made hilarious movies that made me cry and laugh, so do you really blame me to wait for that again? In addition, the citizen, the funny trailer, Jennifer Aniston's co-starring participation, and the fact it was a hit state to encourage me. <br /> However, as "My single line summary" suggests, I was incompetent. For many reasons, <br /> Reason 1: It was not funny. In a 2hour movie, I laughed for about 5-10 minutes ... altogether, the rest of the time I sat thinking "I really should have some ice-cream." I admit that maybe it is wrong to judge Jim Carrey on his previous film but that he really hopes to do the Gem as the 'Truman show', 'Lyrian Letter', 'me, myself and Irene', ' Dumb ',' The Mask ', and the' Ace Ventura 'films produced, in Bruce Nolan's own words, as a movie? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Reason 2: Jennifer Aniston's role was criminally sovereign. I mean hello! He's been around in the public eye for about ten years now, and in this film he gets on the four lines they say. Unfortunately. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />: grow the appeal. "A teenager says no drugs and yes in an education - that's a miracle! Want to see a miracle soon? Make the miracle!" God said Bruce, a huge sentiment that seems to have gone down a treaty in the U.S., but could face stronger market resistance that keeps an incling for subtlety. In addition, I always go to school, and this statement suggests me and all my friends are miraculous ... or maybe it just means we have brain? In this movie there are enough funny Carrey moments to make you chuckle and prevent Bruce Almighty from being a total calamity, but you are advised to begin reviewing your expectations down.
