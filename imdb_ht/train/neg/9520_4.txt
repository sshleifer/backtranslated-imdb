[*** MOST OPPORTUNITY ***] This film's reputation envisioned it, so it was with anticipation that I sat beside her in the mailbox on TCM. What a great disappointment. Throw is superb and their production value is first-rate, but the characters are without depth, the plot is thin, and the whole thing goes on too long. For a film related to alcohol, family division, trumpet, gambling, and sexual repression, the film is curiously flat, prosaic, dead, and stereo-dog. An example is the portfolio of Frank Hirsch's challenge: his request is rather heavy for his wife to "go upstairs and relax a bit" followed by his predictable head of a headache, driving - even more adventure - evening bonds 'and his secretary ("Hey Nancy, I had the Blues tonight. Let's go for a drive"), all according to well-defined formula. We do not feel that these are real people, but cutout boxes acting in a puppet game. Also, the obvious friction source between Frank and Dave Hirsch never really explored or explained. Dave's dawn and on-again / off-again Gwen's is inexplicable in light of its fatuous inability to flush or get into the skin. Her subsequent marriage to the despair of the character Shirley Maclaine / Ginny is, from the moment of being presented to this viewer, anyway, obviously does not fail, and it was clear - by the conventions of soap type opera - that he could only be solved by someone who died. Moments of this jealous lover started running around with the gun I started a bet with myself as who - Dave or Ginny - would get killed. The whole thing was upset with a 'P' capital. <br /> <br /> Having this Maclaine's performance with that of Dean Martin are the standouts here. But on the whole I get the movie's interest to be purely that of a piece of Hollywood story.
