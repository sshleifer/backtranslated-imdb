I do not see how anyone who loves Van Damne can love this movie. <br /> <br /> The movie actually starts out with some promises. I would say the action scenes at the start of the movie is excellent. The scene of action and ward of the family trying to save the twins is a great start and is a good lead in the main story. However, the movie is full of mountains down there. <br /> <br /> It would be good if the director could stay with the original quote. These are the brothers who are born in different parts of the world and thus learn different skills. A fee is eligible for martial arts, but the other brother is supposed to be eligible for firearms. How good when the time comes that the brother who never picked up a gun before all suddenly is a great marker, and the brother who has not been taught any martial arts is all at sudden split up with high kicks. <br /> The plot, action, etc. are just plain ridiculous. My favorite scene? How about when Van Damne confronted an armed soldier with an AK-47. The soldier is about 100 yards away. Instead of targeting and shooting at Van Damne she is making a cry of war as it touches a battle ax and runs into it. Van Damne will pick up a pistol from a fallen soldier and shoots it, ... while it is still about 75 to 80 yards away. <br /> <br /> This movie has one of the most irritating endings. Bolo Yeung is a skilled martial arts. However, instead of choreography a decent fight. Bologna is sending barrels to Van Damne like Donkey Kong. Absolutely aggravate the film with lots of promises. If your Van fans, save your time and see the difficult targets or one of its earliest films.
