The phase-by-stage phase of the preparation of this Star-designed story seems to be the ultimate success of all the sublime. The summer Phoenix is ​​very effective as a young female incubator in the prison itself but is never convinced as the actress in the stage of growing fame that both won and the profit from this detachment. Even at Esther's longest lesson scenes, we never saw her instructing the teacher. After suffering from painful ether (largely independent) pain in details, they do not give any convincing sense of triumph. <br /> <br /> The presence of obsessive pain in the heroine seems to mean a guarantee of aesthetic transcendence. But causing this pain (poverty, autism, Judaism, sexual betrayal) never assembled into a coherent whole. A 163 minute film with a simple plot should be able to embroider up its loose finish. Esther Kahn is still not ready to go before a hearing.
