I gave this movie an elevated review of 2 stars as I personally appeared in minutes of 42 and 43 in the movie .... The Side Road Side Bar in Russia. At this stage the film director offered me my immortal lines - "50 dollars .. you drink and talk", but I felt that my Polish counterpart could speak of a more compelling Russia accent than I could, I refused to take this talk on the part. I was a little starstruck like this was my first experience .... and that know ... these lines could end up with lines such as "I'll be back" and "Okay honestly, I'm not doing This gives a lady. " I said that one line then my name would appear in the credits of Rancid aluminum as 'heavy 1' instead of the name of Ryszard Janikowski. <br /> <br /> As time goes on, I count myself lucky that my name is in no way connected with this movie. Even though I spent a whole day on the series, in South Wales hot-spot Barry Island, no one could tell me what the current scenario was. The caterers and the wardrobe lady agree that she has a lot of swearing and nudity in her ..... things could certainly have been worse if I'd ended naked in this aloud in the movie .... <br /> Always ..... On the positive side .... I was discussed in Rhys if during one break. I had no idea who he was, as "Notting Hill" was yet to be released, and not an incling that it might be Welsh. Made various appropriate comments about what was a terrible pit Barry Island has come since my childhood visit to the 70s and 80s. It was only when Keith Allen showed that I realized I was in a quality production ........
