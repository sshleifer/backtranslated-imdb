I've always been a big fan of Woody Allen and constantly for most of what she did in the past, but only a blind lover could ignore how dull, idle, firefighter and most of all dubious movie se.

And what a disastrous idea artificially recreated a "Allen-script actor," which puts Will Farrell's mouth and gestures what Allen would have done in Farrell's place was 30 years younger. The result was obviously funny. And do not speak in the dialogues ... what was meant to be philosophical reflection back to an unintentional imitation of intellectual meditation, unaware of its comic effect. How sad ...
