I'm glad the IMDb was able to decipher what the film's movie has fallen off. I had a suspicion he was trying a comedy, but since he also seems to want to make a dark and solemn melodram I'm not sure. For a comedy he is amazingly bereft of the same smallest venture in the realms of humor - just up until the "twist of wrinkle" finishes, confirming that a recorded waste in the movie time is actually being. It's hard to describe just how the haunting amateur really. Did anyone who participated in this movie have any idea of ​​what they were supposed to do? Actually worth seeing so that you can staring at the screen of incredible jaw disbelief in how terrible it is.
