In her way, Mister Foe (original, and more appropriate, titled Hallam Foe I can not see addressing her title as "Sir"), is a tribute to good act. Both Jamie Bell, like Hallam, an attractive fianc√©e / fitness swinger, and Sophia Myles, as Kate, her roommate partner in sex and romance fantasy, are convinced. The problem comes when you try to connect their roles to anything that's going on in real life. A young man who spies on the intimate details of the lives of the Hallam way would be worthy to beat in a shit. And a woman in Kate's situation should be repelled and scared - she would probably call the police. <br /> <br /> These are not, however, what's happening in the movie. Ms. Hallam died and his father married a woman with whom he had an affair. Hallam, of course, hates her patty and allows her to know her. She had sex with her. Kate's some kind of someone works that put Hallam in a flat washing job and playing sexual games. She looks like her mother's mother. It all ends happily and Hallam "solves" his problems. <br /> <br /> Forty years ago, the game with brilliant movie actors, who in fear Virginia Woolf, had an end to optimistic finish, and characters became harder and better after tearing each other . The problem is, it does not always work in that way, especially when nobody really cares. In Virginia Woolf, compelling the completion of the intensity of emotional revelation. At Nine Foe, the emotional revelation never really happened.
