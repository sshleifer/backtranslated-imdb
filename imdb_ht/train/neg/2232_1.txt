I watch this .... let me rephrase ... have suffered from this because I'm a fan of Eva. I do not think this is a flick he will put on the back of photo shot himself. I love gangsta flix but this did not even close. The budget could not have been more than a few hundred dollars, and that money was probably over the caterer. <br /> <br /> The first was interesting, but the first victim died before you get the chance to take care of it or not. <br /> I will not bother saying that did and how, because it is not worth the effort. I'm happy only because of my monthly rental plans in local video stores that I did not actually pay for this waste. Before you flame me, i love cinema, i thought a flick lotta was good that some of you were blocked, so my junk would tell you all you need to know.
