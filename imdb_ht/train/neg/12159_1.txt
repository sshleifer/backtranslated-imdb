I can not believe I'm actually watching this, but I guess I just wanted to know if this movie would get unintentionally funnier and funnier towards the end. and he did. The highest score was the poorest ever by the defense advocate - so out of real life that even for a fictional story it was far too weird. There is no way anyone on this planet can behave before a court as he did. and probably the worst prosecutor on earth. why was he in court anyway? He did nothing with absolutely nothing to prove he was guilty. a simple search of home would result in getting into the rings. but do not go. It is preferable to say "objection" 2 or 3 times throughout the trial - that was it. The blonde ant was given a true-drug drug that proved her innocence, but not Brett. The digging had almost an altar in Brett in his home that could prove his ill mania. but again do not go. During the court scene I felt in silence to take the needlepoint out of his hands and bang it several times against himself. Even real weirdos do not look at the fake funny "I'm innocent" as he did. and what does this movie tell us? Never married a woman with a life insurance: as soon as she falls down the stairs her husband will be thrown into prison, guilty or not. evil, evil people.
