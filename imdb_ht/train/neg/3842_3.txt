Our teacher showed us the movie in the first grade. I have never seen him since. I just watch the trailer though. Does this look like a first-class movie for you? I do not think so. I was so frightened in this film, I could barely watch it. She was mostly the scene and cut Shirley McClain that girl in half, and then had the boy and ketchup! I was freaked out of this movie. Now, today, being 20, I probably would not feel that way. I just wanted to share my experiences and opinions that maybe kids should not see this movie, even though it's PG. Be aware of the possible outcome of these children. I do not even remember what it was about, once was enough!
