I stayed at one night and got very bored around 2:00 am. So I flipped the noise of the channels and reached H.B.O. where this "classic" played. Initially I was happy to find something at the beginning, but early I wanted to change about two minutes in the movie. The whole movie centered on a painful man who had a fear of women, four handsome but minded men who worked as waitresses on his uncle's diner, and his fat and very miserable courage that also worked in the diner. There are some strange twists in this movie that make it a bit interesting, but certainly not worth watching. Basically, if you have nothing to do some night or just do not sleep best medicine work. However guys have a lot of skin so it can be okay to look with no sound, but even that can get annoying
