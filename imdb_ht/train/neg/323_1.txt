This movie was so bad I could not sit in it without doing anything else. There was no draw and no point. I was quite bored and for a movie about a comedy stand, I could not remember one joke or funny line worthy of the description. Politicians with no charisma talking techniques jargon could not be less fun. <br /> So how did this happen? Is there any quality control in film? Watching the girls in Bikini was the only distraction during this awesome experience. It is difficult to imagine that Adam Sandler became popular and he appeared in fine comedies could survive after that kind of exposure. It was not funny in the smallest of this movie to prove that the writing is so vital to effective comedy.
