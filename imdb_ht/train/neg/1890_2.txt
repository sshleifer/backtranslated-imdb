The problem with this title is that I'm not sure if the director tries to produce a documentary or film. A mix of two folks just does not work and leaves everything hanging in the middle of nowhere. This is more so as the director took the most extreme of what is supposed to pass through our daily lives to make it a compelling documentary. If it means it's a thriller / drama that's too dull and monotonous. In any case, what is the moral or the message that the director tries to transmit to the audience? Where do we have people who are ill-treated other people who want to be sick-treated? Is there so much madness in us? So .......... So what?
