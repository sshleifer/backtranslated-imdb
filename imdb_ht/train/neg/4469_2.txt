This game has the honor (s) of being the first game that I stopped playing right in the middle and felt like breaking into bits and then burning. Congratulations. First and foremost Raider Tomb I'll play I'm sure. <br /> Draw: Just type this word to make me laugh. No one. Neither has character development. We finally have a girl heroine who can take care of herself, who is not a * boom * mary-call, but unfortunately she dresses like a slut and her breasts are great. They have attracted the sexist gamers you see. Anyway, all he does is go to the grave after the tombs things to do as he goes along. Why does he have no idea? I had subtitles over and t.v. as loud as I could and I still did not understand something damn. The development (or lack of) for her, her two friends and her * bandits * were mockingly. There will also be levels that you have to go through that does not give you any hint of what you have to do next and you literally will be in most of the boring as the Tombs for Hours trying to figure out what Hell you are supposed to do. There is a course (out of two) in particular with him on a motorcycle (Believe me it's not at all fun) that you're going to ATLEASE an hour with no points saved in sight. That means you get hit by the other motorist and the men in truck shoot at you or hit a tree or start the long trekking hours. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />! There are most of the music on the longer-eared-ears level, and do not give any hints to the player so they can stay even longer in a place instead of reaching the nonexistent draw. <br /> <br /> Stupid F * ck one: Those are sound like bang up ideas. <br /> <br /> Stupid F * ck two: I agree. Who needs character development, draw, or game to rid. <br /> <br /> Todd: I'm sorry, but these ideas seem like they'll be the pps's * ss ps. /> Boss Stupid F * ck: close Todd. You are fired. <br /> <br /> Game-play: All it does is shoot. Of course it can flip while shooting, jumping while shooting, or kicking while still shooting. But flipping, jumping, and kicking does not erase the fact that all it is finally doing is to shoot. BORING !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Music: The intro music is very nice. I love listening to it. In game music go out to squeeze wanting to cut off your ear. <br /> <br /> Visual: Considering this game was made in 2006, I was expecting the visuals to blow me away. Well I was blown, but definitely not in a good way. <br /> <br /> Bottom line: This game is a draw-less, no character development chaos and a little dressed unmarysuish (slowly) young woman in the lead that goes into boring graves for some boring reasons ( what could I could not tell you) and unimaginative shooting gameplay. Stay away from this ... !!!!!!!! She gets two stars for having a woman who is not a girl in distress (No matter how to alienate she can be) and the splendor of music.
