Pilot TV, do not you like them? Quinn Martin tried this one out after success in a bunch of other TV detective movies, but this one has gone nowhere except in the field of mythology where he belongs. Roy Thinnes is Diamond Head who takes orders from Aunt Mary to find Super Lovejoy Spy, I mean Tree. Zoulou and Tso-Tsing are for ethnic relief and not much else. Tree sucks as a bad guy despite all his disguises that make him look exactly as he normally does. There are more abnormal fiber clothing here than you can ever imagine (required in the 1970s) and the self-esteem is so anti-climatic. Why does not he go in series? You figured it out, it's quite blatant. Again it's fun for STD, but not something else !!
