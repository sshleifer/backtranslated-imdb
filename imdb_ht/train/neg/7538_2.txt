I watched this movie because I liked Nicolas Cage and well, I found it weird and completely pointless ... So I decided to poke around a little and got my hand on the 70s copy of it. Wow. what a difference. The original one was the best way. I would like you all know it was originally actually making a statement, it's existence was a goal. It was really the Christian public to express their fear of paganism. If you dig deeper into it it also reviews about life but I do not want to go into detail, just, simply put, if you were disappointed and you would like to know what it should look like, feel free to watch 70s version , a little date, but a lot better.
