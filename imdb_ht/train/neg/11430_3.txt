Well, let me coin a new word here: polyphobia: Fear polyamorous relationships. This is yet another of a long line of movies that starts out in audience titles about some kind of threesome, only to turn about a cent and go all preachy about how it is oh so unnecessary and the only moral thing to find a solution monogamist. Only one person in a mile understands the pleasure they could love more than one person, and this director is not one of them. Bleh. <br /> Mark my words: a few decades of now, the polyphobia will just be as big as a faux-pas as homophobia, but guess who was too pre-minded to achieve this? Right First: This Movie Producer. And much like it. Why even make a kind of conservative and old-fashioned ridiculous films like this? Pride himself on being open-minded about gayness, he completely neglects the fact that we live in an age where monogamy turns into monogamy sequence, which in turn turns into balancing and polyamory. Open your eyes, people, please! <br /> This is a disappointing, run-of-chick chick-flicker movie. (But damn, I have to say, Heather Graham is the cutest thing alive.) <br /> <br /> 3 out of 10.
