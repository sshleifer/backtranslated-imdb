Another rape in the story <br /> <br /> This movie is a catastrophic; It just uses a historical story and makes a sweet, sweet love story and low budget production. The movie should be 1/3 the time, they just drag the time to make a mini set. <br /> <br /> The scene of the battles is so stupid and logical, welding is open to stupid, costumes are a catastrophic. The Romans were good at fighting in open areas, one of the armies was destroyed by Germans when they tried to fight in a jungle, in this Roman movie to choose to fight in the city, I mean to get real. <Br /> <br /> And by the Cleopatra path came from a Macedonian origin, which means a light skinned person.
