Basically what we have here is little more than a remake of the classic classic hilarious 1970's Sea Lines Kitsch that was ironically like these cobblers, also partly filmed at the underground underground underground Aldwych. In the line platforms now denoted the Charing Cross Jubilee as well as the aforementioned Aldwych, this film has basically the same scheme - dodgy killing angry zombies in the tunnels to preying on the lost riders who missed the last train - originality is not This movie is strong point. <br /> <br /> Indeed strong points are sadly missing. The big chains from the poor in the unnecessary on gory also the sub-Gollum nutter never really explained such as looks more than one under developed scheme. Franke Polente has little to do with a slim script than running down a lot of tunnels and crying all these often, indeed it was as pretty much everyone else in this movie, out-acting by a puppy and a pack of rat don. <br /> If climbing film is placed on the underground London is your bag, or you just want to play 'spot the tube' to pick this up on DVD when it hits a bargain bin. If you are looking for a classic horror, go and dig a copy of the Death Line (aka Raw Meat). <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a good quality writing and acting movie, you'll need to change train .....
