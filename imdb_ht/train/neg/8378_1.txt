This movie most probably the worst movie I've ever seen throughout my life! The plot is ridiculous and all the "Little Man" crap is just for stupid. The movie is unrealistic and dumb. Let's face it, It's just a "Black Comedy". This is just a terrible punctual piece that should never have made it to the theater. The jokes are not funny and the act is horrendous. Please, I ask you to save money from seeing this piece of worth. I supported sitting in Little Man for an hour and a half who want my eyes to bleed. I'm disgusting that something like that might be the same thought! Who wrote this crap? The actors have no talent that forever, how do these people find in Hollywood? They're making money in this junk!
