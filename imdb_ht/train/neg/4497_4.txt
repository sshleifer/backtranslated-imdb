- I planned to write something that explained what I did not like about this movie, but this will be much more difficult than I thought. Honestly, I can not remember much about it. I watched it just three days ago and did almost no impression on me. This usually sign in a real stinker. On the only thing I remember was being incredibly bored by most of her. The Haitian has a look-a-like Humphrey Bogart as the detective has set in real quick. It would be different if he could act, but he is a one-note artist. The kill scenes were ostensibly busy and there was no suspension leading up to them. If you can not spot the five minute killer in the movie, you need to see more Euro horror. The casting is a dead gift and the killer's identity.
