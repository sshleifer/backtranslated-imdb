I wanted to go with the original _Cruel intentions. He went along with the draw and remained true to the characters of one of my favorite stories. However, this movie was, in my opinion, a rashi highlighting and essentially the same story line with clear character choices. I did not honestly care what happened to any of them. The most part of the original story (Les Liasons, by CI) is the characters and interactions, not the events themselves. I was not clear until I read the IMDB that this film meant it is a prequel, especially since the title includes a number "2," I hope an end, but then determines it must be a piece companion. In addition, I must say that this movie read, me at least, as a soft version of Les Liasons. I was not impressed.
