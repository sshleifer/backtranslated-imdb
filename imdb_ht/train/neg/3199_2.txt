Joe Don Baker. It was great at "Tall Tall" and had a nice little bit of "Goldeneye", but here's the "Final Justice" all hope to go ... there's the dark side there. <br /> <br /> As with most of humanity, my main experience with this one was on MST3K, and what an experience it was! Mike and the robots dig the claws deep into Baker's bake meat and skewer this cops completely. Obviously they just started with "Mitchell" on the anti-Joe Don kick and here lies their continuation on a theme. <br /> It does for a funny experience, though: there are so many riffs choice. My favorite - "John Rhys-Davies for sale", "It's 'Meatloaf: Texas Ranger'", "None of them are sponge-deserved," "Why was it wearing his bullets in bed," and most Love me - "Son an ..."? What? What is the son of a MANPERSON'S PREACHER? "For himself," Final Justice "is, as Joe Don puts it in the film," a big fat nada. " But here, it actually has some entertainment value.You get a chance to catch this version of "Final Justice". <br /> Two stars for "Final Justice" Ten for the version of MST3K ONLY. Oh, and try not to visit Malta when Joe Don is in town.
