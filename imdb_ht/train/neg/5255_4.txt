Visually speaking, this movie is stunning. It has some delightful dark funny moments. But on the whole, the plot is very clich√©d, as is its seeming message. If you are a fan of over-the-top violence in mainstream movies such as hostel or seeing, you'll love it. If you are looking for something at all high-top, go away. I saw it as part of the Edinburgh 06 film festival, and I only chose it because I was looking for something disturbing. Ultimately, it's not disturbing. Just grinding and unpleasant are sitting in. If you really want to be challenged, go see something like the Lost. If you want them to be grossed out, or tell your friends about a movie really messed up, then this is for you.
