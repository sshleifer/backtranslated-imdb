I was not at all a fan of the 2005 guru firm hit the "Auberge", and most of these hit hits-compromises are just as bad or worse - again "Live Feed" managed to keep me a bit entertained for about 30 minutes. Began with lots of gender and slaughter surroundings, followed by some good death scenes involving the Chinad Squad organized with a 7-foot, leather-studded butcher ... What put me out of the film was' Heroes in 'hard with guns and a curse to save the day ... I would call to mediocre this movie, at best, since a mostly citizen involving young people killed were killed in a thrilling porn theater, duplicated as a cache for the mafia, is appealing to me. If only the turtle has been extended enough to be quite effective, then my rating would be very different. Unfortunately, most of the gruesomeness is surrounded by one scene, leaving the rest of the movie concluded as a kind of revenge scenario. So, basically, it's just a low-budget "Auberge" rip-off and the use of gender of free sex, almost constant during the first half of the movie ... In general, I would say no to bother with a this one.
