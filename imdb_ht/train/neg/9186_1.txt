You know that the feeling of hilarity you get when you watch a movie that tries so hard to be a serious, thought to pieces pieces of movies and fail miserable? When you can not help but bust out laughs in the sheer terribly terrible nature of the littering screen? House of the Dead writes to achieve the same level of low scores in movies. Since starting the end of "House of the Dead" managed to recreate the feeling as you just woke up to find out which the cat had put it in recruiting business neatly on your forehead while you sleep. It is clear from the beginning that the female actors have been cast for their cleavage size (which are exploiting verbs) whereas men are for their "kick-ass" hardcore attitude. I honestly did not care for any of the characters for any moment in the movie and found me actually wanting to break them so as to spare me a good moment of torture. Uwe Boll should be considered screening two hours from footage from the current game as a movie. At least then we will get better act ?? However not all the blame can be placed on the actors as it is certainly a challenge to produce a convincing film when faced with the script in this movie. It is arguably the worst section of the movie and actually there are such lines as: "These are zombies, pure and simple" and "No cap'n, we must not go there! It's wrong!". We all know that zombie movies will never be to be thoughtfully provocative or full of meaning; At best they are a harmless two-hour action, bloody and horrific closet. Garbage, yes, but fun litter. By type of waste that bursts out of your bin bag as you haul it through the room and smothers your shoes in back letter cartons and rotten bananas. According to IMDb, "House of the Dead" received the bad reviews that no Danish movies had purchased the movie. If only we could have the same privilege. <br /> Final Score: 1/10.
