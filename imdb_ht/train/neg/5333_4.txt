A squashy slackstick disorder poses as a comedy. Elvis Presley plays an American calf that leaves the rodeo for a home stay on its folly desert desert in Arizona, where the government's suit was just investing in the herd of animals (which is in dire need of a stud ). What is the director of Peter Tewksbury is in dire need of some narrative skills, even though he is missing from his ratings to make up for slacky comedy acting (his social encounter is not exactly pointed, but Tewksbury has a satirical bend to his extreme, it has some funny scenes). Despite colorful support turned by Katy Jurado and Joan Blondell, the general wackiness gets way out of hand, and there are too many hooping and hollerin 's to sustain and much interest. As for Elvis, he is loose and frisky at all - and while it's nice to see him enjoying the screen, one asked if he just gave up on movies at this point. This shambles in a picture have a distinction which-the hell feels, and even if the spirits are high, the returns are mostly low. * 1/2 from ****
