Just plain good old asshole. I mean really stupid, not good stupid like Killer Tomato, or Ed Wood Cinema, this is probably the most stupid movie I've ever seen. To give this film a golden turkey is a reproach of turkey. To call that mute film is offensive even to dumb. <br /> If this is the future of American cinema and our art best to start really World War 3 and 4 at the same time and let the cockroaches run the show after. <br /> Now, I've got to drink this wash in my braincell's salt ... <br /> <br /> This is a really good movie if you are suicide.
