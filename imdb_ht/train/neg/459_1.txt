I was looking for a beautiful, simple comedy to spend the time, but choosing this movie proved to be an enormous mistake. <br /> I can not write one good thing about it. First, the script is stupid and not funny at all, relying on white tired, recycled with a farting turtle to laugh. In my book is not funny, this is a bad thing. <br /> Budget effectiveness budget (if I can even call them effect) and terrible movies. In many places it feels almost like an independent film with no money. Actually ... I feel sorry for the actors. Are Pamela Anderson and Denise Richards desperate for some money being agreed to take part in this? (See the recent films, it looks like that.) Although the teams, Pamela showing her age and as a whole, are not even coming across as sexy, let alone funny. Movies are not even in this bad-it-is-funny category. It's just bad, as if everyone involved was sick of it. <br /> <br /> Avoid.
