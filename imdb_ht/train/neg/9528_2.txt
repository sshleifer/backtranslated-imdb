There are a lot of talk about torture these days. That's all this movie is. It's a good person who makes a bad decision. Because of her goodness, she becomes vulnerable to women psychotic. From then on a just-to-envy attack on him. I do not know at what point you do something about it. There is a wife and children outside a place; He has great feelings of guilt and fear. But there would have been some times when he could act. The movie seems to have someone's joke. I suppose in the wake of the Manson murders, we've got a bit of a fix on the liking of these two. But why someone would make a movie like this? What appeals it has except for sadism. The conclusion is totally unsatisfactory, but this could have been remade with an obvious draw twist. Oh well. Another hour and a half in my life.
