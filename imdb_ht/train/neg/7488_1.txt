Anyone who saw the original 1970 movie knows how an excellent cast, script, and directors can put together a comedy master. By the same sign, it's easy to see how the opposite can create another Hollywood make-to-thon acid! This movie was sad! If it was not for John Cleese (a funny genius), I would have walked out about 15 minutes of this terrible garbage in seluloid. <br /> <br /> Neil Simon would not write another scenario for this version (he said he could not improve on the first), and I'm surprised that after this movie cinemas he would not call for defamation of humor! <br /> <br /> Jack Lemmon and Sandy Dennis did such a wonderful thing in the original, what were the producers thinking about when they cast this one? How could the director and editor look at these scenes and think of any of them funny? I do not know, but one thing I know-it's no surprise why foreigners and independent films are becoming more and more popular .......
