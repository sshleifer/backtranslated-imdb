I waited for this movie to play in a great anticipation. Let's suppose it would be best shown as the movie, "The Christmas Box" based on the book by Richard Paul Evans. I have sent many emails to friends and relatives asking them to please watch this show, hoping they would better understand a small amount of my "new" life. After seeing this film I was so disappointed. As a mother who lost her only child in November 2003 and really knew the pain, I hoped that this film would shed light to parents who "think" to understand the grief of a parent who had lost a child. This film was a very clever and painful film by Diane Keaton was a slap in the face to parents who buried a child. It was very unrealistic from start to stop. I had a few calls after the movie, each called the same, "That was so off the mark and it made it appear that in a short time you are on the road and listen to songs on the radio and Life is back "What a bunch of calves! It is clear that the director and Keaton never lost a child because neither would ever have to make the movie to be so off the mark. I guess this Hollywood.
