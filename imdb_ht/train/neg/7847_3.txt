Just recently, I was obsessing about and anticipating this movie so much that I almost saw it. Well, having just seen it today, the 5.8 rating is fully understood. I think if you anticipate so much that it gets a hassle, it turns out not to be worth it. <br /> <br /> Sure, the hills have 2 eyes to have its moments. It has a very cool and well-developed scenario that links to assets and the real product itself, but the whole thing is so self-sufficient that it becomes so difficult to follow. But if it was not for Wes Craven's production on this film, it would not be anything to do with the original rumor. <br /> But the whole thing makes you go "Does this suppose to be horror or comedy?" because there are so many ridiculous things, randomly placed moments of sting and stupid material covered (IE "There is a hand in the sh ** er!" or "You mother!" I'll kill you all the generation of the son b ** tch! ") and the act (God does not even remind me of how bad he was. <br /> <br /> STORYLINE: (This party has flaws, beware!) The movie begins with a women born in a mutant baby (ooh la!), and then the screen disappears black and the movie title appears, and a monologue. Then we go to this office where there are random veterans mannequins put them. You'll find that this is why one scientist keeps track of people looking for mutants. The box holds traces of audio feeds away, and everyone dies! And tone-setting openings, you'd expect more We went to this one team in military recruitment training in Baghdad. As the commander of the Parade "A Good Work of Clown", the latest training days are in New Mexico, the desert where the family of the latest THHE was r summer beca use was stuck. While in training, things go ultimately to evil, dead, and ... I need to tell you any more? Because now I have the attention span of a red fish just forcing myself to sit here with this type. <br /> <br /> The thing that's wrong with THHE2 is that it just dosen't work. No flashlights here, and the finish is very safe ... but with a twist! One stupid, that's what. I am very sure that the Ultra Super Principal off with a hologram cover and a ticket to the Mountains 3 eyes will show all at the end of the term, but at this point I'm not sure if I care. <br /> So, by all means, if you loved the first THHE it's almost a sin not to see this, then by all means, see it. But if others, then, avoid at all costs. Let your own good. <br /> <br /> 3/10
