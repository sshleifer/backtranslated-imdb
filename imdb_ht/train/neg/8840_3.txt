Here's the perfect example of what does not do when you have a great idea. That is the problem is not? The concept is fresh and full potential, but the script and the execution of it lack any real substance. It should grab you from the start and then pull a little off your emotions, make you interested and invest in the characters. This film does not have what it takes to take in and sustains theft, and here is why. First you do not really care about the characters because they are not presented in such a way that people can relate to, I mean this is not Superman or Mission Impossible here, it's supposed to be about normal people putting in a situation stress. They are not credible in how they act and communicate. Example: Jeffrey Combs as a cop on mills is gum, frowning and intense looking at all the time is not the way to go here. I mean what it is? It looks like it's on the toilet or something. I loved him at re animator and the way he played the intense / neurotic, medical engineering injustice was good about the money. But not for that, she tries too hard to compensate not to look so intense with the edge, but in a still moderate, neurotic way, it's not natural, I'm surprised she did not embed her jaw during filming. The movie is basically about life support, it barely has a heart rate and it keeps me waiting for something that never came.
