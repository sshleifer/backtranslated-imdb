Watching beautiful women sneaking in, playing cops and stealing is one of the most delightful culinary delights the medium movie allows me to enjoy. So the House on Carroll Street was not entirely a waste of time, although the story is perfectly uninspired and somewhat disappointing. <br /> There are many different Hitchcock photo alerts, not least of Kelly McGillis's choices in the role. She is dressed as Grace Kelly, and she is not far from the mark. Not at all. But his character does not convince. The way it is presented at the hearing, it should be someone who has political convictions and a purpose in life. After all the film deals with a clear period defining period, true events and a specific issue. But the story degenerates in the first minutes of a run-off-to-mill-crime crime regret with incredible coincidences, high predictability and a series of dimensional characters. This is all the more regrets, as the performance of the actors is good, as is the photography and the design set. <br /> <br /> The Final at Central Station, New York is breathtaking. It starts in the subterranean section and then moves up on the roof. The film can be praised for its good use of architecture.
