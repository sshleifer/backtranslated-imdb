A worthwhile project apparently for Karin Mani (who?), As a hottie Charles Bronson will be around wiping up the 'ramp' that mugged his parents, or grandparents or something, with impressive young hunks and his karate skills. In a pivotal scene it is forbidden to stop a rape and a moron cop throws it into prison, so after a cool couple of scenes and some seductive prison-dictating abuses he has to take the law in his own hands blah blah blah. I guess there was a lot of movies like this? The script is dumber than usual if you can believe it. Mani comes just like the kind of football type that would co-produce his own death wanting to start roles, and I find that type sporadically endearing, but the movie is an ungainly device. Competent actors should waste the scumbag role here, and would actively undermine the fantastic min-incompetent DA and a judge who had to be the uncle of the producer.
