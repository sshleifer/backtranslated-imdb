I tried to watch this movie twice and both times I still could not make it to the end credit. The first time I managed to sit in the first battle sequence then lost interest. The second time I managed to force myself to dig on an hour worth of embryos to act, lame SFX and the poorest direction. Pales in the original comparison. <br /> <br /> Who ever heard about the old ET Atari 2600 fiasco? For those who do not let me fill you in .. It's 1982 ... ET is one of the biggest boxes of smashes of all time ... Atari decides to release a movie tie-in game about 2600 console systems home. To cut a long history with the financial shortness of the short run game time and the thousands of thousands of Atari 2600 ET games have to be thrown into the landfills because they could not even give them away let alone sell them. /> What's Universal Soldier: The Return Should Do With This Story? Look at Rating 3.2 and figure it out for yourself. <br /> <br /> Movie film ... IMDb force me to give it a 1 out of 10 because their rating system does not go as low as 0 let alone in the negative.
