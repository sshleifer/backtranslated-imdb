For the life of me, I can not find why they want to make a movie about the "Jerry Springer Show". So incredible trashy. There are some ways, sadly it's a guilty pleasure. We all have to admit that we've seen at least one episode. It is part of our pop culture. I've seen it on USA lately. It's very bad. I'll admit that. Jerry does a horrible job in what I think he meant acting. Or something like it. Jamie Pressley is in it. He plays himself basically. All she needed was her lover boy, Kid Rock. It would have been they were then perfect. So I would recommend skipping "Ringmaster". Just watch the "Jerry Springer Show". It's more enjoyable than that. <br /> <br /> 2/10
