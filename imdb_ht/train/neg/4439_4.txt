Yikes. This is very bad. The play is not great to start with, and the decision to transfer it to his movie has no favor - especially as Peploe does not decide how he wants to treat the material's theater's origins (we get occasional gunsmiths in a theater audience etc. ...) and decided to go with a smashing style style that intends to keep reminding you that you are watching a movie, whereas in fact it only serves to remind you that you are watching a very poor movie by a director who is overwhelmed by her material. Mira Sorvino's Central Performance is Poor-Poor Poor: Scene-y and Plumy, it's as if playing the party across Meriken's Winter Mercy Helena Bonham-Carter. Only Fiona Shaw delivers a performance of scores - and it may be that his pedigree theater means that it is best to handle the material - but it's hard to watch a movie for a single performance, even though this performance is like light , truthful and all as Shaw. Ben Kingsley turns into an average and unbalanced turn, with Diana Rigg's daughter, Rachel Stirling plays his support role as just that. Unfortunately, no of Bertolucci's magic rub off on his wife if this movie is to be the evidence.
