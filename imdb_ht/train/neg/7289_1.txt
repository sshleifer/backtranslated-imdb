This is a film of immense appeal to a relatively well-defined group (in which I am not a party). I went to a preview of this movie by knowing what to expect - I finally find it disappointing. The story of a malfunctioning dysfunctional (often downright "twisted") Hungarian family is not mine was in tea. An epic legend like this should really give its viewers and something more to the end. Finally, photos like this are on the human condition - this picture drives almost no new light on any of its more meaningful aspects.
