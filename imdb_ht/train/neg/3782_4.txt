Here's the good news first. "Spirit" is the most visually incredible animated film in the release of the theater's home theater. The artwork and the revolutionary effects, and I recommend that you give this movie a look through the virtual virtues alone. Now, for the bad news. I really mean it when I say that the animation is the only thing the movie is going to be for. You can remember that "Spirit" was trounced by "Lilo and Stitch" last summer. The first to argue that because Disney was better established and better advertising was to write me a long page essay titled "Why Lilo and Stitch 'scripts did not smack. The incredible new animation technology on the "Spirit" display, the story is almost * amazingly * matured. There is a lesson here, and (unnecessarily hard) it does not only apply to anime movies. Visually never favors the eyes of a mortal, but if your story is boring, and most importantly, we do not care about your character, it's bad movie-like. can not wait to see what a person has more imagination to do with it.
