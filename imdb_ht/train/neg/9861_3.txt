I was sitting at this in GenCon only because it was quiet and I could sleep. What a waste of time. Beverly D'Angelo and William Katt? WTF? Is the lady playing Flo and Abe Vigoda busy or something? <br /> Surely, a piece of unfunny function. The characters were stereotypes without meaning (I think ...) and wooden, most of them seemed like they were on otopilot. The so-called "hilarious" situations described in some of the other so-called comments were so hackin, I cried for the writers. <br /> I'm confused as how anyone can get this time value, seriously. I only give it 3 out of 10 because in order to be a 2 or 1, it would need to be either five hours or more Kelly LeBrock.
