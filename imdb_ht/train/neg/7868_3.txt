I've seen many of Guy Maddin's films, and love most of them, but this one literally gave me a headache. John Gurdebeke's correction is way too frenetic, and, apart from a tour-of-force sequence that shows a top line of skating look one object, does nothing but interferes with the actors' ability to interact with the audience. <br /> <br /> Another thing I neglected on this movie was that it seemed more brutal than Maddin's earlier job - even though her film had always been black, her sympathy for the characters that gave this movie They are an understatement of humanity. This one seemed more like harshness for doubt. <br /> As I have to add more line of text before IMDb will accept my review, I'll mention that the actor playing "Guy Maddin" manages to make his face expression pretty well.
