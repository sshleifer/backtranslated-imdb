I also like Dafoe as an actor but I wasted a few hours in my life actually watching this movie, I still cant believe I managed to watch it in its entirety. There was actually a point in the movie, and the finish, well, I'm glad I never paid to see this horrible useless horror of pathetic excuses in a movie! <br /> I'm not sure without hunting the information out but Dafoe is getting married or seeing the horrible actress in this movie in real life, if it was a kick attempt to start her career? if so I'm scared must have failed .. <br /> I post this in hope I can actually put someone on watching this movie, though 1 people take attention in my comment and decide they would be much rather than looking to paint paint I will feel did some good in the world if only I had the same advice ...
