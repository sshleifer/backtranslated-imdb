Well, I've always been a Batman fan. I liked the animated series, and even Batman Beyond. I am a funny beats now and then. So, as they can imagine - I was a little excited when I heard about this series, and then I was VERY disappointed. This series has nothing. It does not even begin to compare with the original set. It's been a long tradition of TOY. There is no depth of this. And what the heck was with the Joker? Who, in the most humble opinion, I'm the best Batman villain of all time and to do it. I wish I could say that her design was the worst part. Actually, I wish I could say there was anything about this series that was creative or interesting remotely. In short (because believe me I could say so much) DO NOT waste your time on this show, or your money.
