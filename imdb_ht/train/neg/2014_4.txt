I remember love this show when I was a kid. I thought the helicopter was the cool thing I saw. It was ultra high-tech for it's time. He could repel enemy fire, make all kinds of acrobatics in the air, and take down almost anything in his way. Now I go back and watch it today and wonder how disgusting this show really is. The CAST members are hardly compelling, there are a lot of cheesy times, and scenes of fighting are incredibly fake looking. And almost every end has the same helicopter fighting crap and the obvious review of low quality footsteps. Many of the feet appear to date from the Vietnam War era. <br /> <br /> Airwolf was basically the same as Knight Rider, except the crime-fighting machine of choice is a helicopter instead of a car. After watching a few episodes, I find myself bored. I do, however, love the theme music.
