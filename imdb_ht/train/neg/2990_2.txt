Ohhh people! Now this is what I'm talking about! As far as worn fury / horror cheese went this movie was really in a class of its own. A real gem! <br /> The first, the movie was not originally in English. That's okay because the voicular voice was really exceptional! Here is my favorite extract from the dialog (and there are many more places out there) ?? "I feel a little better. I'm just thirsty for your blood!" <br /> And what drama! Here is a play by playing recalls in the interaction between the military and the scientists <br /> <br /> scene 1? Scientists: "You can not do that ... It will be a disaster!" - Military officer: "It's just science fiction" (he then proceeds to cause a complete disaster just as the predicted scientist). Scientists: "If You Do Many People Will Die !!!" - Military officers: "You do not know what you're talking about." (it does it with many people). <br /> <br /> scene 3? Scientists: "Do not ... It will kill everyone!" - Military officer: "This nonsense" (he then proceeds to kill everyone) <br /> Scene 4, 5, 6, 7 ?? (you get the idea). <br /> If that was not enough? There was a few scenes that really stood out as classic instant! In one scene, the military has literally 10 guys who show the weapon of unarmed men. The leader is walking, "Go get 'em!" with all 10 army guys, one at a time, release their weapons and fists fighting the two adversaries! Instant classic! <br /> And do not worry. No attention to detail left out! This movie has a keyboard / hip belt / keyboard 80's to set the mood! <br /> <br /> And trust me ?? I realized that this review might have some vane, but there are many gifts in this season I really just scratch the surface. A movie in this caliber only comes out once a decade! A true movie watching experience! A masterpiece! Wow!
