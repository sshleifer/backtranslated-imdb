I wish I could give this film a zero out of ten. Before you go to this movie day after it's been out, I've come to IMDb to check out the comments. A comment called the predictable film with cheesy and terrible dialogue. I never went into the opinion of others, so I wasted seven dollars for this crap movie. She had to be one of the worst movies I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> The person who wrote the script should push on a cliff. Have you ever seen scary movies? I swear, I'm surprised there was no HUG ^ - ^ momentum. <br /> I think I'm flying. One time. And this because I'm zoned out, thinking about my research paper for English. The shriek, bird / cat erupting from nowhere to something when you THOUGHT something will happen. <br /> <br /> And the characters were STUPID. My friend and I almost DIED laugh when the alarm goes with the main character said, "I have to get my mom's shawl !!!" You. Idiot. Guess the shawl! Safety is just a few steps away, but NO, my mother's shawl (who did not match the clothing By the way) is WAYYYY more important than my health and safety. And in his head all the same, he took it back to his house, knowing that the killer knew where he lived. God. <br /> <br /> My friend and I also predicted the entire movie. And it's not fair, I bet he was hiding under the bed, moments. Known, "It stole the bell clothes and sneaked out of the hotel" and "It's the detective down the hallway, not the killer!" moment. Movies should never have this predictable. Disney movies are not even predictable. <br /> I'll complete my anniversary now when it says, this was a terrible movie. I'm glad I went to see it in the theater so I would not buy it for $ 15.00 and then hate it. It was just bad. It would have been better if only one thing happened. If, after the injection by the detective, the killer would fall in the same position shot in knife by hand, stabbed and stabbed the girl on his way down. Oh, how beautiful that would have been. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time or money. Go see a good movie.
