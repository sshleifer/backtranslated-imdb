There may be something poetically right in seeing the dentists suffer. Relieved they do, in this sad, really obnoxious movie, but they cause the audience to undergo pain in the non-dental variety too. If you've ever wanted to see a movie full of children screaming, kids barfing, sick children, lots of long, long-meaning sensuals, a scandal wife and a concerned husband: it's all here for you. Boring, overlong, it means from one of the following examples: why? Is there a saving saving? Yes, there. There is a short scene from Nabuko, with some nice good songs. Save your money, or if it's on TV or cable, save your time. You can always read a book or make an omelette.
