The end of the World is a movie that has no chance, which is odd since it is supposed to be the total destruction of the earth. The main character is some kind of scientist, I'm not exactly sure what kind of. He has two jobs at a government agency (?) Which is guarded by four human security. His first task is transmitting surveillance to and from space (although this actually looks more like a fun it does when it does not work on work # 2). Job # 2 requires that he wear a protective suit and go to a dark room ... at least that's the best I can figure out. Apparently the "plant" is not exactly self-esteem, as the scientist carries his wife. He hangs (they're on their way to a dinner) while discovering a message in space: Great Earth Chaos, repeatedly over and over. He says something about it being the first message out of space it has ever been able to decode; His wife tells him they will be late for the dinner party. So they left and went to the party (!?!). Later he found that China had suffered a great earthquake. From there, the movie goes ... nowhere! Yes, Christopher Lee is in it, but that really does not help much. In addition, Lee provided a substandard performance on his appearance at Howling II. This film is boring, but it has enough stupid elements that you might want to suffer through it once if you like Christopher Lee or Z-class sci-fi. Plus, there are many stock footage in the ground being destroyed.
