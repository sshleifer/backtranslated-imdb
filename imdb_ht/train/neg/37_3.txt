Devil Hunter received notoriety for the fact that she's listening to DPF's 'Nasty' video, but she really does not need to be. Many films in the list where God (and DPP) are only known, and while this is not the territory of the bunch; There is not much here that the ban prohibits ... that's a shame because I would never have sat in it where it's not for the fact that it's on the 'shopping list'. The plot actually gives the film a decent basis - or at least more to a decent basis than most film cannibal - and it follows an actress who kidnapped and dragged into the Amazon jungle. A hunter then hired to find him, but along the way he was brave to the natives, led by a man who called himself the "Devil" (hence the title). The movie basically just plods together for eighty five minutes and there really are not many scenes of interest. It's a real shame that Jess Franco ended up doing this movie because the man clearly has talent; as seen by films such as the Zero Diabolical Z, Venus in Furs, Faceless and killed in ecstasy, but unfortunately his good film is just gems amongst the crap and devil Hunter is very much part of the crap. I saw this movie purely because I want to be able to say I've seen everything on the DPP list (just two more away!), And I guess that's why most other people have seen it, seeing it. But if you are not on the lookout for Nasties; There is really no reason to bother with this one.
