If they could find Ed Asner why they did not find other actors instead of people who went to the same church as their producers? And why the protagonist has cast wise characters to give the sage to the ground when it was never in danger. He forces the old guy to mask the crash from pride and so the young guy would feel guilty to leave him with a long life disability. I guess why the main character denies money and why the old guy works him as a dog even when he volunteered for extra work. If the D-bag companion is a bad guy because he is companion long distance then why is a better soldier. He has good reason to be jealous, good reason to make it away from his city and to protect, control manipulative father. All the characters are meant to be unmatched by and everyone else is the bad companion. How did they meet anyway, a wine broker and a mill worker saw?
