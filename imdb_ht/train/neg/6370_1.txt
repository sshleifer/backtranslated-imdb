For some reason, the TV Guide has given this two and a half stars, plus Faye Dunaway is in it, so it definitely looks like something to see. I, oh, I, this can be the worst movie I've ever seen. Ever. From her acting strange (every time the girl asks the boy what is wrong with her, I shout at the TV "I can not act!" When she asks what she needs, I call "I need to act lessons ! "In the unbelievably bad dialogue (" Give me back my org! "). <br /> <br /> And the Wannabe Brian DePalma ended, too, it was all just beyond horrible. I wanted to love it .Dunway is one of the best actors ever And their production value was pretty good. <br /> But wowzers, this was my laugh, happening!, Most of the time. <br /> even need to bother from curiosity, that was my first mistake. Staying with it was definitely my second, and third and fourth.
