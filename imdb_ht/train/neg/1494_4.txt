Yes, definitely better than I look at Tunnel's death. Actually some of the deaths were very original and the Gore was decent. It was kind of like Wrong Turn meets the eyes. But the "kids" (high school or college?) discussing horror movies in the kitchen, everything Shae says is almost an exact quote from Call (1996). The thing about the big-breasted girls etc. <br /> <br /> 2.) Was Steve PA a bootleg randy from Calling? 3.) Besides the fact that it took place in October, what the hell did the movie have to do with Samhain? Just needed if you ask me. I find it humorous when I see horror movies from the 80's explaining that loose ends do not show the fingers of the Druid or a Pentagram. <br /> <br /> 4.) Wow made a reference to Sam Raimi !!! 5.) Why were Gary and his sister in the movie? Character had nothing to do with anything. And hes so psychic that he could not even see his own death? 6.) When Gary died in the bathroom (at that point, the deaths became simply troma-licious) how he could hear the cry when he came down, but did not hear when he stood outside the door ? 7.) Gary's sister commented on Haggis - that's primarily a Scottish dish, not Irish. <br /> <br /> 8.) So the lesson is if you are like Shae and have no fun or crack a smile in the entire movie, will you one of live? 9.) The mutants were very cool, but they looked like dishes in Chile con carne. <br /> <br /> 10.) When being brought to Gary's sister, she was forgotten that Steve HAD was attached and asked where she was going. 11.) Was there more than one killer? Shae beat one, but never encounter any more of them. <br /> <br /> 12.) What were the flashbacks to others? Half of them Shae did not know if they were dead or alive, so what was with that? 13.) Why did not Gary and his sister first kill? 14.) Why did not anyone call the police? And apparently everyone knows these people lived in the woods, why they never organized some kind of attack? 15.) As far as I know, they were not zombies or vampires - so how can it "turn" one to the end? I and everyone else on the giant "huh?" in the end. <br /> <br /> Way better than death tunnels, but still quite sloppy. I still do not understand why they even put it in Ireland, consider Samhain being close to nothing to do with the plot.
