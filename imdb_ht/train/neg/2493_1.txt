A really obnoxious movie. I did not know initially that this was a kiwi effort - but very soon I began to realize that all the characters spoke with hardly disguising the kiwi accent from the American fakes. Why did he need to wear Americans anyway? - It could be set to NZ and then the actors could use their normal voice. Certainly someone in the production team can hear the obnoxious attempts at talking with American accents? A bad movie bad. I wondered he had lasted this long - how did he do it out of the case? It just seemed like a very poor attempt at a Segal / Willis kind of flick action man. TOTAL WASTE OF CASH! If there was any TAXPAYER money in this piece of waste, I should lead a revolution to have all the money put back in the Treasury. I'm always curled (get it? Pun, reeling!) In the absolute garbage I've just seen. Why do I continue to look? Well, I'm a movie fan with help without myself, myself!
