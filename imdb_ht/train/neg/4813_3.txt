I gave up trying to figure out what version I'm watching. The copyright at the end indicates 1983. Even though this is not the least significant of my objection to this movie, I'll say that watching a movie obviously made in the Aquarian Age (including chic long haired chicks and odor station wagons), but with a soundtrack synth sounding 1980s is unsettling. Very anxiety. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />! How to do them. Seriously, it's all like adorable and stuff, but in the two films I've seen him in - this crapfest and the otherwise excellent legend of Hell House - to kill him. <BR> <br /> I would like to put the movie industry on notice. Pamela Franklin has apparently retired from the business, but if he ever decided to make another film and some layers packed to a director trying to kill him on me should ask him to chase. <br /> <br /> NO BEATS UP PAMELA FRANKLIN AND GET IT WORK. I AM LEAVE CREATE. FURY was infinite. <br /> For B-movie fans seeking out a crapfest, you could do much worse than that. On the plus side, this is not a movie that involves Satanism in a peripheral way with the surface - this film is a hardcore satellite movie. <br /> <br /> Wall-satan satanic wall, baphomets, hallucinations, a funny Rat Attack - what else you can ask for. <br /> This excellent thing is quite nearly ruined by cracked plugins over the 1980s to send the music, which is about as mismatched in a movie as it is possible to be. The band reminds me of something you'd hear about the Equalizer. It is really bad. They also made Pamela Franklin squad their good English accent, which was also quite rude, if not a cruel atrocity (against the viewer) as you might find covered by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. I say we can hear Pamela Franklin speaking in her own voice. Who is with me? I could forgive anything else about this movie if they did not abuse Pamela Franklin. So I threw the gantle down, waxing - anyone MESSES and PAMELA FRANKLIN MESSES with me. <br /> <br /> But in a FICTIONAL CONTEXT. <br /> <br /> Good day, SIRS.
