Well, I sat down at the computer and wrote the review immediately after watching this puddle. Why? Because I must let it be known to all you just how bad this movie is. It's incredible bad. Just let you in on how bad it is, I'll offer this detail on the movie. During the scene of destruction, which usually consists of people shooting or kicking zombies, they perform scenes from the video game. Yes, you heard me right. This movie really sucks. In fact, it makes me think about the fact that it costs ten dollars these days just get into the theaters these days. And see full corn crap like this? There is no story talk about and the movie basically nothing to offer other than the occasional boob shot and really cheap kill. I'm really disappointed with this, knowing that I was watching it. OK, I dumbstruck. It's so bad I can not even find the words. KATMAN: ZERO from *****.
