I'm a big fan of David Lynch and they have everything he did on DVD except for hotel rooms and 2-hour movie in Twin Pics. So when I found out about this, I immediately grabbed it and ... and what's this? It's a bunch of black and white animated cartoons that are loud and bad lips and unfunny. Maybe I do not know what's good, but perhaps this is just a bunch of crap that was foisted on the public under the name of David Lynch to make a few bucks, too. Let me make it clear that I did not care about parts of crowds, but kept adjusting the sound because my neighbors might have. All of this is a very disappointing release and may well have just been left in the Deluxe box set as a curiosity. I highly recommend you do not spend your money on that. 2 out of 10.
