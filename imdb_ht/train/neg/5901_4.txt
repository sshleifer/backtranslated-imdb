Something to sing about was produced at Grand National Studios where James Cagney was working while under a deal deal with Warner's brother. She has made two films for this B studio, in which high rank in Cagney credits. <br /> One of the big movie losses is the fact that Jimmy Cagney has made these films that have used her terrific ability to dance. The two come to mind instantly to Yankee Doodle Dandy and parachute paradise. The smallest film is West Point's story and never steals anything tiny. Cagney himself said he never used to watch anything but his music in retirement. So why did he do some of them? <br /> Well this one was all wrong. The plot of something to sing about an anxiety hoofer that fronts for a band that has discovered and provided a movie deal. The usual hassle of a studio boss is combined with a combined press agent being played respectively by Gene Lockhart and William Frawley. Her contract requires a clause no marriage, so Cagney and girl singer girl Evelyn Daw girl get married in secret. Then we get the hassle of an autonomous autonomous driving romance with leading lady Mona Barrie. I think you can figure where this will be. <br /> <br /> The most annoying thing about something to sing About is the lack of dance numbers for Cagney. It dances shortly at the beginning and end of the movie and there is nothing in the middle. Evelyn Daw had a beautiful singing voice and charisma in a ham sandwich. It had the music numbers as they were. I'm sure the public movie has paid the tickets to see Cagney dance. <br /> <br /> Also in addition to giving her some dance numbers a girl dance partner would have been nice. He dances well with Ruby Keeler at Foot Foot and with Virginia Mayo and Doris Day at the West Point Story. Are not Ginger Rogers, Eleanor Powell or Ruby Keeler available? <br /> No memorable songs came from this. And Dawd's voice is waisted as well. He had a soprano Jeanette MacDonald who was so out of place with a balanced band. No wonder Cagney goes running back to Warner Brothers. But they should give him some decent musicals.
