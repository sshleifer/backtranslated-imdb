This film is fairly famous as one of the most terrible examples of ever-present propaganda. The equation insists on Jews and diseases is simply <br /> <br /> pathology, and even worse it almost gets credible for short seconds <br /> in its absolute repetition. The fact that something great works, even <br /> <br /> briefly, is an object lesson in itself. You must have a strong belly and a firm grip on your head sitting in this, and I would not recommend trying unless you have a good reason.
