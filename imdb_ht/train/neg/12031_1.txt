First of all, this film is not a comedy; unless you really force yourself you can hardly laugh. Secondly, the film is slow and boring. Acting is not bad, but no special. There is a funny Lucky Luke about two family (one with big nose and one with big ears) fighting with each other in a small town ... you will laugh more if you read this instead of wasting your time with this movie a. Religion and dogmatists are not the best source for making a good comedy and this film does nothing more than confirm this rule. There is a comedy topic similar to '' Home Professor ''; That was a great time. My final comment is: Do not waste your time and money to watch this unenspired and boring movie.
