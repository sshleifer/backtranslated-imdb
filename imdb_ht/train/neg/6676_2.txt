I might not have been the biggest fan of Witch Witch but however appreciated that effort, so I was looking forward to Altered, especially after his superlatives were thrown around in various IMDb comments. "Unique", "intelligent", "A future culture class" and so ... you are required to ask where people come up with this stuff to describe as a poor effort. <br /> Because alas, Altered is a poor, weak movie that fails to engage in any and every respect. Silliness is not funny. The horror and gore are not scary. With all the "thoughts" aspect some poor friends have seen in this movie were due to great alisin because there's certainly no deep or intelligent thing about this mess. <br /> <br /> OK, so we know nothing stands out. Is it at least tackling? Is the refreshing experience in any way? Unfortunately, no. For starters, get very poor act. It's not a stretch to say most B-movies these days feature better acting. The plot? Boring and dirty. Dialogue? Many enthusiasts actually do better. <br /> It's really the direction of puzzles. I did not expect bigger upgrades on Blair Witch but at least small steps forward. Instead, our director seems to have gotten worse over time, completely oblivious to previous experiences. <br /> <br /> If there is a major defect in Altered, it's the main series. An important part of the plot takes place in one place, where the main characters are locked, but Sánchez has failed to give the place any personality as well. Consider that in Blair Witch, the jungle plays an important part and it is as much a character (an antagonist, if you will) as three students, you would think the director would achieve the same thing needed here. But no ... this place has no personalities whatsoever thanks to sloppy directions and no attention to detail. <br /> There is nothing wild here. Hard players from "Blair Witch" are best suited to following Daniel Myrick. Although its production is far from being gold, it shows better structure than Sánchez and some lessons from Blair Witch are being implemented (unfortunately, in weak but still history).
