I was interested in this movie as a cannibal cannibal. I was quite disappointed. It was the same kind of disappointment I felt watching 'Friday 13th: Jason takes manhattan'. great potential wasted! <br /> <br /> The opening stage is a decent attention decent. Then it grinds to a stand. Breastfeeding and powerless 80s fashion can not help this movie. The only thing to eat near this island of cannibal monks is the piranha! I do not ask for the 'holocaust channel' in gore, but I was looking for the cheap over-the-top exploration gore. I found none of that. <br /> I found a couple party in the scene battling a bit intriguing, hence the 2 stars. I do not think it's really worth the time it takes to watch it, though. I could see her show in a party where nobody cares about what's happening and you just want something about in the background. but I would not tell anyone, "oh, dude, or GOTTA see this movie." It is neither good enough nor bad enough to be very careful.
