Who likes terrible "comedy" shows like Little Mosque on the prairie? Only two types of people I can think of who are watching these are: One, Muslim and Defend Liberal Liberal in each ethnic group that is so thrilled to have a Muslim show that it does not even matter if the show is a good or funny at all (which is not). Two, old and those who have the idea of ​​comedy are incredibly predictable, seriously written, joke. <br /> <br /> CBC needs to really take a look at what they are doing and who is their audience. If they keep only writing comedy for those really old ones then guess what will happen, the audiences will die in soon and there will be no audience left. Should I be curious that even wrote for this show? Do you think it's actually Muslim, or hip, funny teens? No, I bet it is old white guy who wrote the same jokes for the same kind of bad CBC shows since the 1960s. <br /> <br /> When you look at the CBC show comedy there, Farce Air has just finally taken in the air (greetings!) but we still have lame ducks like this when there are 22 minutes and Rick Mercer that we're paying for, not to mention this poor excuse for Little Prairie's "Comedy" mosque. Is it supposed to be offencive and funny? Only the CBC would think that this lame show is at all offencive or comical. Shame on the CBC to wasted our tax dollars by showing only a few people that could bother watching.
