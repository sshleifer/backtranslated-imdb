This is just flat out unwatchable. If there's a story in here somewhere, it's so deeply buried under the terrible characters and jarring camera work that's inevitable. There is a group of vampires hunter who goes to do things, and the vampires kill there are little aliens inside of them. They pop their heads out and talk like Gonzales Speedy. If you can imagine a bloody and gore covering married foreign slogans screaming in horror as a cowboy drug zap it with an animal prod, well, that's what you get here. These people are loud, obnoxious, violent, and just very annoying. Then some anti-human persons, who stand in the CGI vessels were so unbelievably pretentious that it is impossible to take. These people make Hillary Clinton a true right extremist in comparison. They are friends with some vampires, or something ... that cares. <br /> Then there's the camera work. Remember how everyone hated a thousand-cut-a-minute crap from the recent Rolleball renewal? The folks who made this LOVE movie things. There is enough of it here for three really crazy nu-metal videos on MTV. <br /> <br /> <br /> Nuff said. This is odor. In comparison, Dracula 3000 is a masterwork.
