Maybe I miss the meeting when explaining the meaning of "B-movie", but what I saw was ridiculous. Do you want a good summary of this movie? Take aliens, replace the xenophobe with vampires, then remove everything that was good on it, and that's pretty much. <br /> <br /> 5 minutes in the movie, "The V-SAN Squad" (this acronym to dumbest I've ever heard) checks out a "base" that was massacred by vampires and then Bump down (down? What?) A ladder obviously attached to a billboard and an obvious day train present in the background. And should this take place? 2210. Okay ... (keep on, I'll get back to that) <br /> Yeah. characters. Wow, well there's the curse of Asian Chick, the Cowboy Cowboy wannabe, capturing the commander, the wind goth / Hot Topic part-time fury, and the wussy second wook in order. They are all played by their respective actors and even the lack of ambition. She almost puts me to see Micheal Ironside in this flick of films. Is it not enough money to be the voice of Sam Fisher in Splinter Phone? Pretty much the only original thing about Vampire Wars is about how bad it is. <br /> <br /> Look at this movie after all, the only entertainment I got out of the weak-set attempts. Since you have a PC card square on a wall count as a room ready on a container? The money required to make this movie could put more use best.
