I watched the pilot and noticed more than a few similarities between 3 pounds and House, MD .. Tucci's character is brilliant, but social inept out of choice, just as Laurie's character House, but without the Acerbic understanding that Laurie bring home. Meanwhile, the 'Tucci's Right Guy', the Suter Surface Physician, does not develop into a more interesting character, such as the 'Mad' Cuddy's reliability and Wilson. Character Indira Varma's Adrienne Holland is too similar to Dr. Cameron Jennifer Morrison's to be a co-incidence. Someone in CBS obviously noticed success at House, MD and told his staff to get her (her) a similar show, hoping that immigration would prove successful. However, copying a show like House requires even the high balance of sense and suspense with Tucci and companies are just not up to the challenge. <br /> I did not know the show was canceled until I read comments on IMDb, but it does not come as a surprise to me.
