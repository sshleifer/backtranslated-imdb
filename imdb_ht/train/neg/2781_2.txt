This is a movie that attempts a history of Thai history, set in the ancient city of Ayutthaya. I decided to watch this movie because I thought it was on my many Thai films that I watched and enjoyed, one with Thai Thai speaking actors and martial arts crazy. Well, it's not one of that. This film is shot entirely in English, is full of Anglo actress shocks, and its production value is so awful it is ridiculous .... but not funny! Who can we blame for this trash? Acting, dialogue, and most of the sets were bad. Some of the fighting scenes seem like being choreographed by the local club's high school drama. The special effects were also mostly bad, but a few were just cheap browsing patches on the screen that gave a specific cheese effect. It has one big, scene-style scene battling out, where a few thousand extras get to run in a field of costume, but when we see the two armies collide in combat - HA! What a joke! The movie does present a couple of beautiful. What a pity they did not show a little more skin. At least that would be something for the men to appreciate. Do not bother.
