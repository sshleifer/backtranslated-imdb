I watched this almost know nothing about it, other than the brief description I read here. After watching her I was originally going to say that the director shows her promise but looks like amateur, then I look at the other thing she did to see if this was her first or second movie, but no, she made House on Haunt Hill and Fear Dot Com. It sort of missed the brand on both these movies and it was the same with this one. <br /> <br /> The story was very terrible too, could someone just fell in love with a girl because it is beautiful, but was the idea of ​​a child? I gave it a 3 because there were some visuals that I rather enjoyed near the end but as a whole movie this is very awful.
