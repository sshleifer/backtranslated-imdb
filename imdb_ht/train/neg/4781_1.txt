This might be the worst example of amateur propaganda ever made. Writers and producers should study the German films in the thirties and quarantine. They knew how to sell. Even Soviet-style clunky leaders as God-like father-Fathers were best done. Irritating. The loss of faith, blind in the last second church just in time for the fathers to be "saved" by the hoover / God was not too bad. Unfortunately, it seemed running and not nearly melodramatic enough. A few skylier masters shots of the hoover angel climbed to the edge of the screen-shiny and signs - would have added a lot. The best aspect is Hoover only saving the family that deserves and the children who have "proven" worthy. Unfortunately, other poor homeless people were described as readily and even well-again Hoover-God does not help them. A better approach would have the vaccine to drink demons to show justice to their condition. Finally, bright and joyful scenes of recovery (after Hoover saves the country from the depression) should have rolled to the end. We could see then how Hoover-God saved not only this family worthy, but all really worthy. The best amateur.
