Things I learned in the "List" .. A decent cameraman, a hot girl who can act with Malcom McDowell could not stop this movie from sucking. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </a>. <br /> Chuck Carrington desperately needs to act. <br /> <br /> Register a writer. <br /> <br /> Jesus hates me and punishes me by making me pay $ 5.50 to see this movie. film, you do not need an end. Just leave everything unreasonably unresponsive enough so that the audience falls asleep before the end. Engineering. Any random landlord can cure death just by drawing a cross on a window. So make friends. <br /> <br /> Chuck Carrington still needs to act. <br /> <br /> Your roommate will hate you and make fun of you if you bring this movie home. <br /> <br /> apsk accept.
