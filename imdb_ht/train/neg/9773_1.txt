And then released, I thought this was one of the most profitable films ever made. However, thanks to Martin Scorcese and a few other movies like him, there was the worst movie, the language of wisdom, than that .... but this is a very brutal attack on one's ear. Hey, I can take a lot of it, but this got ridiculous. In the first six minutes, I heard a half-dozen use of Lord's name in vain plus a countless number of f-words. I wonder how many people walked out of the theater watching this in 1990? I could not have been the only one. <br /> <br /> Not surprisingly, some of the feature actors include Jennifer Jason-Leigh, Burt Young, Jerry Orbach and Rikki Lake. Since this film, Stephen Lang seems to have improved his image, at least playing God's "Stonewall" Jackson in "God and General." The Role of Languages ​​here is just the opposite: perhaps worst people in the movie's filth with a character that falls in love with a transvestite at the end of the movie. <br /> <br /> Depressing, gloomy, semi-pornographic, stacked: These are just a few of the adjectives of those who are used - even some liberal critics - to describe this story, which is painted even more wrong in the novel. Of course, some of the best-known critics, all extreme libs, praise the movie. However, they were the only ones. Most critics were disgusting, as well as almost all the public pay. It's incredible that anyone could praise smoking like garbage like this. <br /> <br /> Trust me on this: there is no good, interesting character in this whole movie. This is a mean, sick movie: one of the worst of the "modern era." That is, unless you enjoy seeing child abuse, drug abuse, whore prostitution, over and over - two hours straight to nothing but atrocities and just those who are clearly ill. Thank you.
