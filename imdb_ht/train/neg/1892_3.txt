I read Chris_m_grant's comments in the United States. He writes: "A fantastic documentary in 1924. The early 20th century early geography of Iraq today was powerful." Love Thanks to Chris and people interested in Bakhtiari Nomads in Iran, the Zagros Mountains and landscapes and they watched the film grass, fighting a nation for life. The traditions you have seen in the movie have endured for centuries and will go on as long as life supports. I am from this region of Iran myself. I'm a Bakhtiari. Chris, I'm sorry to bother you but the Bakhtiari region of Zardkuh is in Iran not in Iraq as you mentioned in your comments. Iran and Iraq are two different and different countries. When taking an Iranian for an Irankian is almost like taking an American for a Mexican. Thanks, <br /> <br /> Ziba
