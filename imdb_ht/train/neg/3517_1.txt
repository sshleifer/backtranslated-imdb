I do not know who wrote the script for this movie, but at the first moment, I was irritated. In all possible decisions can make up the hills, why the decision, which is most dangerous to everyone? Why do criminals act as mute, although they manage to get a huge amount of money from a bank and get away with it? Why is not the main criminal land helicopter, shooting Stallone, grab the money and fly away with the chick as a hostage? And there are more likely logic behaviors. I would give this movie 5 points for beautiful action and scenery great scenery, but due to the logical behavior of the characters, I just can give this movie 1 point ...
