After the boss crowd Vic Moretti (late great Anthony Franciosa) killed her lady who was cheating on her with Derek, new drivers / Vietnam veterinarian, and blaming it on the poor guy, Derek finds himself in prison where he has implored a corruption candidate, Vic's brother who runs the prison, and, oh yeah illegal experience made by a silver agent CIA (great genre-mainstay and first-time director John Saxon) to turn various inmates into super- people unstoppable zombies. In the course of this course from hand and it's up to Derek, and the rest of the prisoners have changed, to save the day after infected prisoners. John Saxon is a great talented actor & as a Saxon director is a ... great talent actor. To tell this movie (direct single to John directly to date) missing a certain visual flair would be a bit of an understatement. However, the movie is not totally worthless. The dialogue, while idiocy, is just bad enough to be funny sometimes. Unfortunately, this is not really enough for the movie by itself on that alone and it takes forever for the same movie to start coming to his own (which is fairly late in the movie). As such, the most I can recommend this movie is to say that if you are a fan of Saxon (which I really same), it's worth one look, just go with low expectations and you should fine. <br /> Candy eye: Dana list Mason and Tane McClure get topless <br /> <br /> My class: D +
