Having seen a screener in this before last year's season, did not really know why they were given out after the vote ended, but whatever may be exposed, at least, but the movie was a confused mess . Sure, some parties were funny in a kind of black humor in style, but none of the characters felt very real to me at all. There was not one person that I could connect with, and I think it's where it fails for me. Sure, the plot is a bit interesting and very subversive towards Scientology, WOW! What a grand idea ... let's see if that has not been mined to the point of worthlessness. All the bad moments feel fake, out of the lighting, the casting, the scenario effects the visual effect (which is assumed intentional, I can say, and so can be everyone else, no one laughs with you though). Anyways, I hope it makes it out for sale on DVD at least, I do not want a project that a lot of people obviously put a lot of effort into finding completely unnoticed. But it's inhale either way. Boring trip to that.
