This movie is basically two hours of Dafoe's character drinking it - almost literally - to death. The only surprise in this film is that you did not have enough clues or character's knowledge to be surprising. It was just a gloomy, sad garb of time. William Dafoe is excellent actor. Peter Stormare is an excellent actor. But this movie just aspired. Slow down by making the movie bad, it was just bad. The mixed excuse scheme with artistic ramblings in anamorphic detail is not coherently drawn together in a meaningful way for a sketch except to emphasize some gores that are illustrated in many perspectives, ultimately at the end. I really appreciate the artistic vision, but as entertainment, he puts me to sleep. (Seriously, I fell asleep and re-looked at the movie - which was even more irritating.) <br /> I generally do not like to comment negative or review about the works of others, even when they suck, but that movie to guarantee one. It's just too bad that these great actors were disappointed with this end result.
