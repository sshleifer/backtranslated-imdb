Fatal order orders - besides a conspiracy-asserting that the character simply does not remember or even react. <br /> Two examples: A priest walking in a late cemetery at night, suddenly attacked by ghosts ghosts. After the fights off, he calmly summarizes his walk when his friend comes. "Anything wrong?" Buddy asked, he saw the attack. "Just some demonic demonic-nothing I could not handle." There is no reaction, no surprise, just like it would change a tire. Her good friend is equally oblivious ... to be standard priesthood training ... ["Then you put the loaf in the mouths .. Any questions? Ok, moving, demon spirits attack ..."] < /> /> Example of: At one point the priests need a response to a question, and only a demon (or something, who cared for now) could give it. How? Why, you must ask a dead man! So the devil has some random people hung in front of the priests so they can ask the questions in the drawing, gasping people. "Hey, do not kill him!" or maybe "That's not nice!" would be more realistic then the answers. They never ask to let the man go away or stop-in fact, the closer react to finding it is too much annoyance. They ask their questions and go. <br /> I had to close it to this point-my brain started to grow atrophy. <br /> <br /> Avoid <br /> <br /> / **** (one star out of four) <br /> <br />
