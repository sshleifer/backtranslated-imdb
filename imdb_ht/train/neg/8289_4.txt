I'm sorry, but this is like a bad movie in hilarious. Hooligan football discussed at a lodging night? Suits? Any color? Alan clearly had no idea what he was talking about when he did this, it is as far from the truth as you can. It does not look awful, acting scary or even coming across as someone who would like football. And as for Yeti? What the Hell? Suits, shades and sitting in a travelodge childishly taunting with each other and "read about the time you got your layer over". Please. <br /> And the yeti gang spray the ICC underwear? <br /> I do not see how one can even take this movie seriously !. It probably possessed the most exacting of the crisis in the late eight-year vandalism I've ever seen.
