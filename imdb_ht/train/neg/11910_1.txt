Interesting is that the act; was not wrong, just not enough. He preferred lame., Special effects both lines were the sole guilty of this failure. Standing alone they were not horribly bad, but putting together was a tragic move. The show seemed long reversed and slow with special effects apparently designed to speed the movie together, but it failed totally. Many of the blame for this disaster have been put on special effects .Do not believe it was kind of cool. Appleby was not the best choice for this effort. Even though it may have been all chosen out and a bit of fanatic recognition. An experienced actress would bring something to the party, as Appleby has never done. Scfi puts some really good original movies, it's just too bad that this fails so high.
