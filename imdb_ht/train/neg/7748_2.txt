This movie was very bad. Sci-fi is usually my favorite channel to watch all the original movies that play on it. I really do not know if this movie can be called original. Starting a zoo / theme park on a remote island sound is very familiar. What was it, oh yeah, Jurassic Park. But this has Sabertooth tiger instead. The film starts out with a few college stereotypes on an island to make some treasure hunt. One of them ends up dying a rather horrible death and some of the worst special effects I've seen. The blood looks a lot like tomato sauce. Also at the beginning there is a scientist who wants to make as many tig as possible for people to enjoy. 3 of them have already escaped and will be around the tourist feeds, or people are invited to the island to see the tigers first hand. Again, sounds like Jurassic Park. Probably the most cold thing was 1000lb saber who was spotted around on his leg before killing the scientist mad with a tooth statue of kind that somehow shrugged and went to the neck of men. I saw the death of TV. <br /> <br /> Acting very cheesy, the special effects are terrible. The CG Tiger could be almost over for clay patterns, and even some of the sounds were cut. For example, when one of the college students is trying to escape, he uses an ax to break a door, the ax enters the door and about 2 seconds later you hear the sound. This movie was very bad. The cheese deaths were quite funny though.
