It seems that several of those who reviewed this movie only looked at him in the first place because he was filmed near the place where they lived. How is that for an endorsement ringing? If this film was filmed where I lived I would not mention it in my review. It is amazed! The recommendations of several states that this film is a parody film or film-language film, it's not. It is sad to see this movie reviews as a comedy as to making it not only a bad attempt at a horror movie, but as a comedy as well. I was laughing if, in how the unbelievable bad movie was. <br /> <br /> This movie has 2 good things to go for it, the mask and the weapon of choice, unfortunately it would be more interesting to watch an hour and a half of the mask and armor laying on a table Then watching this garbage. The social comment behind the film is also mockingly, juvenile and stupid. Do not worry with this movie, you have already wasted time reading this review by wasting again on this movie. Arrggghhh! It's upset that movies like this even get made. I was hoping the entire disposal of a crew to be credited to Alan Smithee, a name used when someone, usually a director, does not want to be credited with a movie because it's so bad. It's nothing to pick up in this movie, I spent $ 1.19 on the lease and feeling I was torn off. Avoid. 1 out of 10
