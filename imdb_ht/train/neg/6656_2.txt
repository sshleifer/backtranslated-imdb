This gets a two because I liked it as a kid, but it has become so redundant that I just started hating it ... I can not give this a descriptive review because it should rest one thing after the other, I probably would not say anything that everyone else did not say before. <br /> <br /> Only the other thing about this show is that it's very embarrassing, with the kid and boiling in that babysitter tight on the sort that runs around and over at it. I have a cousin who likes this show and it is strange and dumbest who I met. This show should be pulled out of the air. It's always the same thing about and about ... They need to put better shows on Nick. I'm getting really really tired of things like this.
