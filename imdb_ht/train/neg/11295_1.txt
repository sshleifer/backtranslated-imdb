I understand that this film was made for kids and as a parent I sat in many movies that are not particularly caught by my interest, but I can appreciate from a constructive perspective of how it was received by my children. Parents are supposed to be encouraged after all to participate in children's activities and monitor the quality of entertainment they have seen so called in an adult hearing at one level in the children's movies. Disney has always understood this is why it is so hard to understand how it could allow such a complete piece of drek bearing their names. <br /> <br /> Technically, the sound editing is awful and all subdivided and unnatural sounds. Personally I hated this, but it was terrible to consider the dialogue itself as if it was written by a 12 year old for a school project. The "act" reminded me of a school play and none of the actors kids had any set of emotions in their voices. Fortunately it was a very short film. <br /> <br /> Now, before I come as a video-geek to measure a movie movie with an adult backyard, one thing that can save even the movie's worst movie is a positive message. Far from it to me to determine how a message has to be released as long as the right one is. Let's take a walk in this movie to see which messages are provided: <br /> If you lose, do not worry, you will inevitably find your way home. <br /> <br /> Approach wild animals without any fear. <br /> You can win any competition just because you "know" you can. <br /> <br /> And my favorite, the final message left in the movie: <br /> <br /> It's okay to disobey face authority and do what you think is right.
