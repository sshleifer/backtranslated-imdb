The film confuses religious ethics and ideals so much that it fails to create coherent arguments against death penalty on any level. Do not introduce the legal execution of a murderous assassination as the catalyst for the apocalyptic end of the humanity film elevating a parent assassin in the martyr's status of Christ. Somehow, according to the plot, God is outraged that society has chosen to rid himself of a fan who killed his own parents by staring on fire while they were dead in bed. But this god even has no indignation for the acts of the killer. Lead Characters, a non-religious woman-seduced woman, finally give her own life in a provocative, but implausible attempt to save this convicted assassin. In other wires of the underdeveloped plot Jesus has become such a vibrant and frustrating troublesome symbol of the wrath of God. The contemporary moderate incarnation of Christ does not just dehumanizes it, but mocks the mesenetic ideal of all religions too. It can not affect humanity for the good and incapacitated stream of life in life waiting for mankind to destroy itself. Meanwhile, with little help from Jesus, the mentally impoverished pregnant woman finds herself with the ability to reincarnate herself into the newborn child that somehow rescues all mankind from the All-Powerful wrath. I also interpreted as a declaration of support in abortion on some levels. This film that tries to tackle many religious themes in a thriller does not make any religious points that I could easily interpret except to misguide beliefs. It raises many questions that he never even tries to answer. He does not respect the religious values ​​of his audience while trying to show a version of the assimilation of their progress. Funny
