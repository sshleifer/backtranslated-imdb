Lorenzo Lamas star like Jack `Solider` Kelly an ancient Vietnam vet and a renegade cop who goes on a search and destroy mission to save his sister from rednecks to weed. An atrophied film is so cheaply made and so bad that Ron Palillo is the third bill, and yet there are 3 minutes of screen time, and even those are not any good. Overall a horrible movie, but the scenes with Lorenzo Lamas and Josie Bell hang in a bag and gagged bags are worth a few (unintentionally) laughs. Followed by an improved end.
