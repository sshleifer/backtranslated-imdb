Please note that I have not seen the film since I discovered it in 2007, and my city is smaller and does not carry it. However, I really mean something about it. I'm currently looking for universities about the title character Richard Maurice Bucke and would like to point out that those of them based on the main character on was completely different facts !!! Hollywood's ideas of people and artistic licenses are granted, real Dr. Bucke totally endorses the hysterectomies in healing women's flaws, and would never have been practicing anything as liberal as represented in the film. I think it's ridiculous to see the various movie critics written for legitimate newspapers that say that this film has some historical bases! Only the actual reality I can see is the friendship between Dr. Bucke and Walt Whitman. Please do not waste your time on a movie that has a disrespect for real woman horrors that are from the doctor who has been glorified in the film industry.
