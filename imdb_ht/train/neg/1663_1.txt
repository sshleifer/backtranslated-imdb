First of all, this draw is way out - girls want to do it, everyone loves it, snobby girl intervenes, all seems to lose, the girl pulls, everyone loves it yet etc. Throw in the fitting of stuff , an attractive male crush on the heroine, more single-parent problems and it's so predictable that you can practically recite it. <br /> <br /> Second of all, I really hate how to keep on dissing classic music. The message that everyone involved in classical music is impressive and snobby and pre-minded - in fact, I do not remember the quote exactly, but I remember at a point in the movie, Holly said, "Why have they got to be so en ... so classic? "It's really insulting how classic music labels in this way. Third, I went on her dozens of times, but the only reason I could think of doing this movie is to encourage Britney Spears. There is just no point at all. <br /> And oh yeah, while the actress describes Holly (I'm not sure what was really singing him or not) had a reasonably good voice, it was not as amazing as they did It's out to be - especially when it's shining. He oversaw the whole time. <br /> <br /> 1/10 stars.
