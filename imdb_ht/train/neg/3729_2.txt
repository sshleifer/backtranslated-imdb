First of all, I saw this movie when I was 7 years old at a Christian Scholl I went to. Needless to say, I was scared out of mind. Not because he was scared but because the content.Cmon ... I was 7. Anyway, the cinematography was very bad and the act of cheese was. This is very bad to consider that I was only 7 and I remember that. The one thing that always makes me is that dreadful song "I wish we were all ready" where the choir ends with "... you left behind". I would not suggest seeing this one. I probably will, just for nostalgic reasons. Moreover, I'm sure the best thing to do. The best part of this film though, was to be when everyone "disappears"; empty cars crashing, lawnmowers running on their own ... very hilarious.
