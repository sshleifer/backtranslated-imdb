I rarely write a negative review for this site, but this time felt respected. Night readers are without any doubt one of the dullest films I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> There was nothing happening in this movie forever - I did not care for any of the characters, did not buy in of the plot all kinds of mysteries, take care of how it ends .... nothing. <br /> There is no comedy, no action, no emotions, no suspicions, nothing. The highlights include (no deflate - nothing to spoil): a man climbing in a window, a dog barking out a hotel room, a car goes on some rough ground and a weeping truck it's cone. I really enjoyed "One Hour Photo" and I was hoping for a strange role in Williams, but misfortune was severely down. What's more disappointing is that I'm sure there's a good movie in a place - the idea was interesting and I should have liked to feel like the characters, but it just did not work for me. I might even give it 1/10 but this note is noticed by the producers
