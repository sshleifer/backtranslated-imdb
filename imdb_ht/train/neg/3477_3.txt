Not as bad as you've heard. There are actually some funny parts and Affleck and Applegate have fairly good chemistry. Applegate, in particular, is appealing and likable as Affleck's love affairs. James Gandolfini and Catherine O'Hara are professional consumers. They are very good at just about everything. In the end, "Survivor" is not the worst holiday movie you'll ever see. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, it is unfocused and much of the comedy is forcing. The temptations of black humor come as astounding. Affleck tries hard to be indearingly spastic and overhehusiastic but comes across as disturbed. Character cartoon characters bring in high relief when viewed next to Gandolfini and O'Hara's more muted, credible performance. Even by the standards to relax in holiday movies, you never completely buy at the set-up of Affleck's "rented" family for X mas. There are also scenes that borders on the surreal of the weird ones. The X-Mas scene of the evening is filled with humorous humor (a son discovered by looking at nude, provocative pictures of his mother) that not only is not funny or credible, but disturbing. <br /> To make matters worse, the colors of this movie are mud, almost noirish. The house puts on that most of the movie takes place looks like scenes and cheap. <br /> <br /> "Survivor" is primarily of interest as the fourth in a string of box office duds (Paycheck, Gigli, Jersey Girl, and this) for Affleck. It remains to be seen how long the damage will be.
