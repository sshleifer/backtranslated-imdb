I watch this movie a long time ago (aprox 10 years or so) and love it then. I remember her the other day and decided to look at her again. The second time around was not nice. The acting is 'so, so', the plot is logical, reasonable and predictable. <br /> <br /> The act ... I'm sure it was not a stretch for those actresses to play these characters. The plot ... there is no way to hell these women would have gotten away and the first fewer fewer theft. (side scores: why TT has not realized that even if it came with a charge of money for the court date they would ask where it got it and there would be no logical response! Ding, Ding ... we have a thief!). She horribly stereotypes black women in saying basically that the only way black women can 'beat the system' or get a huge amount stolen and does not use their intelligence or other resources. He plays too much on the liking of b / c all of them dead in the end (low to Jada) but it's not sad (you're thinking 'They were so stupid; they deserve to die). You just do not really care about the characters unless you're a deep person. <br /> I can not believe this movie rate on a 5.
