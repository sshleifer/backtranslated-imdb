The characters of compression-less rip-less. You've seen all the characters in other movies, I promise. The script tries to be edgy and obnoxious but fail misery. It launches in some hinges to meet superbad comedy but jokes are way out of left, completely compelled, and are irregular after cracking. The hot chick is old and has no personality, just shots some thirty elegantly blonde chicks and a few non-underlying donkeys carrying jokes that are less than endearing. The attraction between Molly (the hot chick) and Kirk (dorky love interest) barely communicate. The attraction of nowhere must find it a completely platonic relationship until they are awkward and predictable belt-mishap chairs. This deferment is in full on its relationship to just incredibly lame. The main focus of this film is not the relationship, but an attempt fails to perform a super-bad-raunchy film inaugurated with a semi-appeal scheme. I could compare this to the hangover, in its forced nature. I do not want to go in that. I was able to keep going but it's just tricky. just do not pay this movie.
