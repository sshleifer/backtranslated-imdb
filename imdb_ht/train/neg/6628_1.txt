If the scale goes negative I would be happier. See Sushmita Sen was beautiful, and Nisha Kothari has a brilliant future but the producer and director lost all the fun in this story. The angle of choice, the choice of lighting and everything distracted from trying to remember what is the story. Oh, if the songs and dances did not cause you to rip your ear over your head, first. The film was made twice in 1.25 hours, and was very good, like "Seven Samurai" but the director and writer did not go that direction, though the "townspeople" finally found their backbone and want to help . This film fails on many levels: editing, writing, photography angling, style, lighting, script - name any aspect of this movie - it was BAD - probably the food from the caterer was also bad. I've never been in 6 years of watching American (Bollywood) movies to see something seriously done.
