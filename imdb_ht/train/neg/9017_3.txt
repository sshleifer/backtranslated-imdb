I keep this movie on sci-fi before heading to work. If you have any interest in seeing Dean Cain dive and avoiding being blinded at least once a dozen, this movie is for you. If that's not your interest peak, well, I'm afraid you'll want that you've been one of about to be enveloped in flame, because this movie is very bad. The act, to begin with, is terrible, terrible, terrible. The characters are completely obnoxious, and the dialogue is worse than your typical Z-class, sci-fi movie. Towards the end, the film began to remind me of 'Hollow Mothers' (completed and escaped through elevator shafts), except with a dragon, not a naked person, invisible. Unlike other similar flicks, however, this one was not even awesomely bad ... it was just plain bad.
