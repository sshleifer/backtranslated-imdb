I'm happy about those who love this, but I hate this movie. It had a very good idea for a story line, but that's where it ended. It was wrong to write, seriously acting and seriously did. <br /> There were some interesting draw points, but they just jumped over too fast, the writers need to realize what's keeping in and expanding on those bits, such as lying about why it was kidnapped, and the touch hole. Instead it was "what's going on?", 5 seconds later they tell you. This film had no suspense, and I was bored from beginning to end. I just wanted to finish it. <br /> Go and rent misery, or plan better to set if you want suspense or twists that keep you guessing at the end.
