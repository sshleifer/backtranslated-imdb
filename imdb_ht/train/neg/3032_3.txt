Someone told me this was one of the earliest movies on the date. I have since discredited everything told me by this person after seeing this movie. It's just awful. Without going through long descriptions of the various scenes, take my word for it, the sex scenes are refreshing at best. Jenna in normal street clothes from the beginning was the highlight of the movie (she looked good) but she's all gone out there.
