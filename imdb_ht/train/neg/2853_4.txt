Vic (Richard Dreyfuss) is a mob boss, leaving a mental institution, back to his world of gangsters. How does a director have a cast with Richard Dreyfuss, Ellen Barkin, Jeff Goldblum, Diane Lane (very gorgeous), Gabriel Byrne, Gregory Hines, Kyle MacLachlan, Burt Reynolds, Billy Idol and a garb of time? This film is a comedy that is not funny, having a constellation of the cast. My vote is four. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): 'Prazer em Matar-te!' ('The fun to kill you!') <br /> <br />
