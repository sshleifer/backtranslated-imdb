Yes, this movie is a real thief. He stole some shiny Oscars from Avatar just because politicians wanted another movie war-hero to reinforce the acceptance (support?) For the U.S. war still fighting today. I do not really want to go here in politics, but come on, this is clearer than the summer sky. Hurt locker does not really have anything outstanding, no real draw at all. I really feel myself in the 50's in Hungary when the party told people what they liked and what they did not like. The same propaganda films were produced this time, only with the exceptions that were black and white. Even though we consider this title a reasonable piece of "American wars are cool" genre, you surely have the best movies to choose from.
