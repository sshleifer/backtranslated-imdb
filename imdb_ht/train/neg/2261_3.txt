The RINGMASTER stars Jerry Springer as a television television host called Jerry, but not in the Jerry SPRIER, his guests are trash trailers, but not the trash trailer you get on the Jerry SPRINGER show, they are attacking each other, but not as on ..... What is the point of making a movie on the Jerry Springer show and pretending he`s not SPRINGER at Jeremy? And on top of this is a very boring movie
