I give this five out of 10. All five brands for Hendrix are delivering a very decent series of latest materials. Unfortunately the quality of the camera work and editing is verging on the appalling! We have countless full-face shots in Hendrix where she could almost do anything, get a urine perhaps? We do not see his hand on the guitar that the point! Also, will we give many shots to Hendrix from behind? There are three cameras on Hendrix, but amateur ants operates all of them. The guy in front of Hendrix seems to be keen to wander down his focus on the stage as if Hendrix on the guitar is a mere distraction. While the rear guy is more serious about zeroing on a few chicks in the stalls than actually documenting the incredible guitar work that blew out the amps (the sound recording is good thanks to Wally Heider) Interspersed on the tracks are clips of student paired they protested against Vietnam etc. on tracks like weapons machines, films films of films! If Hendrix lived even another two years Berkeley is one of those things that could never see the light in days as far as an official release ran away. The single gem contained is Johnny B's incredible Good, but all of a very poor visual image of the big man and inferior to both Woodstock and Isle of Wight
