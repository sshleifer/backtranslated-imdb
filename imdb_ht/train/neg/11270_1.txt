I saw bad films but this was taken p ***. There was no sense, and all the characters are swearing every couple of seconds, and I think one has a low sperm count. It is good. A welshman plays a sweat shell. A chic English joke plays an evil unforgettable mouth in a paddy, and some smaller lights play pitch tar. So, some Russian gangsters. Oh yes there is a gun and maybe also garbage high on drugs. <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie as the epidemic.
