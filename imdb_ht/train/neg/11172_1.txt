Popular in the year 2002 "I Love the 80s" is a ridiculous, idiotic, offensive and outright disgusting pop-culture disruption of a show that was the first in a long-line of stringent television programs that finally spelled out at the end of VH1, which was at one time only the real music-oriented channel left on TV! I used to practically live on VH1 through the spring or winter, and I forgot that one at the 2002 when garbage like this started to appear for absolutely no reason. From absolute morbid curiosity (I would guess that's what you would call him) I decided that I would go ahead and give it a look-to-see anyway the first night she came up even if the ads looked like complete crap. At least I can honestly say I was not ashamed of her because my expectations were obviously under-the-ground-level to begin with. The emphasis in this show I found out in the first 5 minutes was less annually in the 1980s and that was and was not significant or popular culture (which is what I was hoping to see), but rather the more an imprompture platform for a totally destroying God-terrible non-non-comedy show that more than likely to think is the comedy skills * rolling eyes * ... more like lacking-if you ask me! It's pretty easy now to see why no one has ever heard of any of these idiots before they appeared on this show because they are all so terribly unfunny and pathetic in the attempts of so-called "humor "that I swore I could feel my bowel Cut up with each and every one-laten rancid fired on one after another! Altogether, I have no problem saying that "I love the 80" was / is the garbage of the lowest denominator, and one of the main reasons why I almost never looked VH1 again.
