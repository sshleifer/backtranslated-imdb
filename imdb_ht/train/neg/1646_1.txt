I love movies about moral corruption, but that was too much. The act was not great, but that was not the real problem. The subject felt my feelings got into the bloodstream in my stomach about 20 minutes in the movie. These characters were hollow. They had almost no depths, and little they had been devoted to their wickedness to appear to each other in the vicinity of friendship. Explore the darkest places in a series of characters can be fascinating, but you must give these characters to their actual personality or they are just disguised boxes. These characters were cardboard and the picture they gave was just ugly.
