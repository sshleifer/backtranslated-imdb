The movie started in strong, LL Cool J (title) as a civil police officer, and Sgt partner. Lazerov (Dylan McDermott from the practice, perhaps miscast as a bad guy?) Comes to robbery and murder. Deaf refused to kill the drug dealer, which sets up the conflict in a dirty cop and a conscience. Other big names (Freeman, Spacey et al) are well disposed of and the movie shows promises. The movie begins to fall short as soon as Justin Timberlake (Pollack) is introduced. Give the opportunity to make a good movie that people will probably see repeatedly, or one that girls will go and see once because of Timberlake, I would choose the former. Even talented actors must work hard at their craft; Timberlake is NOT talented and no hard work can save it. I would think he'd put on a better show, given the fact that he had acted talent for years. All he did in this movie was compelling. <br /> Just because a singer sells millions of records and sells out stadiums, it does not automatically translate that they can successfully act in feature films. Even N'Sync Hardcore fans will not be able to ignore the obvious lack of talent acting. This aside has a few draw holes, such as sudden Pollack's sniper skills and deadly operation of car storage. This movie has plenty of promise. Quite irritating.
