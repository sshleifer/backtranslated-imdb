There are some great philosophical questions. What is the purpose of life? What happens when we die? And why I did this movie BAD ??? The situation is absurd. Thre act is only one dimension. Special effects are overdue. And the movie is one independent fighting weapon among some of Hollywood's most lousyest ever-produced shots. But then, if they were good shots, everyone would die in the first five minutes and there would be no movie. Too bad it did not happen. Tried to come back several times, I stuck with her to see just how bad she might get. Glad I did because (SPOILER?) The last line is the crowning crown of the entire dopey, its involvement scenario. It is not even worthy of the second image presented at a third-rate rate in season. Apart from the terrible overall in the movie, I worried a lot about its impact on teen audiences. The massive Americans come out crap like this and then wonder why events like Columbine happen. This is really banal cinema on a Brobdingnagian scale!
