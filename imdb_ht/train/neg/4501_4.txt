True, the environment in Paris is great. The actors are good. The story is a twisting morality game. Is it supposed to say that if you want someone seriously enough, it's OK to hurt everyone else on the road? In a real romance, you sort of wanting less glowing than the man who became bored with his wife and wants to drop his family, and the woman is OK and encourage him to do that. So what if they are decent looking and if Karen Allen shows off her body? Characters are always self-absorbed and repulsive. Perhaps the moral in the story is "you get what you deserve". I give it a 4, only for the quick scan potential of the "male interest" bits.
