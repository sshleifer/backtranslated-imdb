I'm sorry to report that I've seen this movie several times. When it was bombarded into the box office, it was repeated every night for a month on HBO. And I watch it over and over because the overall TV is so bad - or was at that time. I do not look, so it might be nice now - like Samuel L Jackson says about pigs, "It might taste like sweet potato pie, but I will never know because I would not eat the mafar room." Let's see. Dudley plays Arthur lost in the desert, still a few steps behind Moses. It comes right after life in Bryan, so you can guess where the inspiration for this comes from. Bits are some lightweight comics going on too long road until you just close your eyes and gravel to your teeth. There is a scene where Arthur and Dom Deluise meet in the desert, both of them dragging out and designing, dying of thirst. Then they meet as old friends who did not really know each other very well, promises to make lunch. It could be funny. <br /> But the scene that I remember most is a meeting with the Pharaoh in which Pharaoh is a street kid making up at King Tut meetings. It must have read the lines straightforward at some point before the release, overdubbed its scenes with the Hollywood equivalent of street streets being voiced by a Walker Jimmy Walker (Kid Dyno-wannabe). Or maybe they were Jimmy Walker - who knows? Who cares. They managed to turn an essentially boring scene into a very racist, very unfunny, very long piece of excerpt, one of the legendary things that just will not flush, no matter how many times you try, so you let it be for a others deal with. <br /> Well this is my review. If you rent this movie (DO NOT buy it, no matter when you do!) Prepare yourself with a tequila bottle and a six pack of Corona. <br /> Now that they've remade the Poseid Adventure, this one is probably high on the list for remakes. Perhaps they will hire a comedy writer this time.
