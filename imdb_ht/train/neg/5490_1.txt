When I was a kid we always used to be babysat, and we still used to rent a movie or see a movie in the movie. This is one of the movies we watched. This is one of the stupid films I've ever seen, I think it might even be a Walt Disney Photo Movie! A martian falls into the world, turns into someone, befriends a human, and tries everything he can get back home. But it is distracted by the wonders of the Earth. The only good comment I can give is the choice of actors, Return to Christopher Lloyd the future as the Martian, Uncle Martin, Dumb and Dumber Jeff Daniels as Tim O'Hara, Elizabeth Hurley as Brace Channing and Daryl Hannah as Lizzie. But apart from that it's complicated crap. Poor!
