My breakthrough I leaked out this movie night at other, so we watch it together. The first impression is actually a positive one, because the entire film is shot in this colorful texture, tablet, post-MTV. Quick sequences, cool angles, sweep cameras - for the moment you feel like you are about to watch another snatch, for the moment .... <br /> <br /> When the draw begins to start unfolding, Salt starts to feel as if one amphetamine is over-dosed. Things just do not make sense again. I'd hate to spoil the fun watching it by giving out certain scenes, but then again, the movie is so bad that you are actually better not to watch it. <br /> <br /> First you think it's a story story crime in a conversation between Keira Knightley and Lucy Liu. BETTER. This conversation does not provide any coherent narrative. Rather on the contrary, lesbian lesbian comes on Lucy Liu's character while the second part of the film just launched the audience to more confusing. Then I thought that maybe it's a movie about a girl from affluent but dysfunctional background that has grown to be a hard bounty hunter. In any case, that's the message targeted by the opening scenes. But after that the question of Domino's character is entirely lost in the criminal scheme. So in short, this NON is NOT a movie about Domino's character. <br /> <br /> Then I thought, it's probably a story of one flight. A very nice flight. 10 million were missing, bounty hunters are pursuing suspicious thieves, mafia kids executed, but removed, Domino tries to crack why this time they do not get bounty certificates, etc. But soon this impression is dispelled by another U - Turn off the draw. This time we are confronted with a sad story of an African-American woman, who falsified driver driver at the local MVD and at the age of 28 happens to be a younger grandmother. Lateesha star on Jerry Springer shows, trying to publish some new, fascinating racial theories, and at the same time struggling to get money for his sick daughter. <br /> <br /> What does this have to do with the main draw? URGH, well, nobody knows. Except that the director explained the hearings where bounty hunters put their collectors' fees to 300,000. Then at some point you start thinking: "Oh, it's about our society and how the media are disturbing things." There are real TV teams driving around with the bounty hunter and making some violent feet. The bounty hunters are also stuck with a bunch of Hollywood actors, who just blink all the time about having their broken nose and their heads rattled around many crime scenes. But NO, this is not a movie about media, they just appear some parts of the movie. <br /> <br /> Plus there are many other sub-cemeteries: the Afghani crazy guy Bent on Liberating Afghanistan, the love story between Domino and Chocco, the Mesalene episode, the FBI monitoring operation ... Do all the things mentioned above must be packed in 2 movie hours? Judge for yourself, but my conclusion is clear - it is a fair mess!
