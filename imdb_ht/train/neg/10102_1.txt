If ever there was a movie that deserved a great zero fat rating in this pile of crap. I love zombie films and even bad people usually have something to go for, but not atrocities. I actually started to feel angry watching this movie because it's ensultingly poor, I can not believe the person responsible for it would actually think this was acceptable. <br /> There is no plot and is not drawn to the cuts and scenes of sadism and spanking. People do not react, act or in any way resemble human beings. The entire film is also shot in two scantily decorated rooms vaguely similar to where they are supposed to be. All the stuff is a futile mess, it does not go anywhere and when the zombies finally turn to garbage and do not do much. <br /> I could make a movie better than this, so you can and so could be someone who has never seen a movie before. It's debatable and undoubtedly the worst movie of all time. <br /> <br /> Honestly, the movie is very worst of all time. You will note in the way that only the positive reviews give this a 10/10 and encourage you to buy the DVD. I can not imagine anyone not really thinking this is a good movie, it's terrible. <br /> <br /> 0/10 with this generous.
