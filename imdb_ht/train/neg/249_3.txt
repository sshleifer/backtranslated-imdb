I saw this movie in my English class afternoons and was surprised by how bad this version was. Do not get me wrong, George C. Scott was terrific as Scrooge, but the rest of the cast failed so seriously. Sometimes I could not stop laughing at the stupid act and the repeated line: "Merry Christmas to everyone!" Other times I almost fell asleep. The movie is based on a short story of Dick Dick on a wealthy guy, who does not think Christmas is nothing but humbug. After 30 minutes, the rich guy was visited by three ghosts, who persuaded him to celebrate Christmas after all. <br /> I can not understand how this movie, with a so bad script it must have been written in five minutes, can be so well rated. Instead of this piece of waste, I recommend you, Bill Murray's comedy Scrooged. That at least was funny ...
