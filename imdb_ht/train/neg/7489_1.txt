American film about war and Nazi simply can not be good. They can not avoid becoming idiot and following an agenda. All the Nazis are bad, crazy, too proud, and Americans are so modest yet so sensitive to humanity. Come on, stop this junk. The main character says something like "by this judgment, we must make an aggressive war a crime." Is America a peaceful nation with its world # 1 $ 420 billion "defense" budget (# 2 China and just $ 51b)? Is it simply passed through this without any ... ROI? Why do America show as a peaceful nation when it does not? I deeply film movies with an agenda - they throw art into hell and try to persuade us to believe something. Hollywood should put a cinema label, as the file company has the "parent consultation" label. We should have a "bullshit advisory", "propaganda consultative" or "politically incorrect advisory" etiquette on some movies. This is one of them.
