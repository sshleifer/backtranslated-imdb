When I read MOST in the other comments, I felt being too luminous way for this movie. I found it completely lost the sparks found in the earlier Zatoichi movies and just went on to prove that after a long absence of the screen, it's often best just to let things be. I fully agreed with the Star Trek Analogy from another review that compares the first Star Trek movie to the original series --- millions of excited fans were waiting and waiting and waiting to return to the show and they Forced to look at a bland and sterile approximation of the original. The plot is at times incomprehensible, it is terribly goril (though the latest NEW Zatoichi by Beat Takeshi is very bloodier) and misses the heart of the original. I did not mind the blood of all, but some cases turned off by it (especially the scenes and the nose off and head off). In addition, time was not good at Ichi - it seems a broken and sad man in this movie (much, much more than normal) - and that is something fan of the series can not really want to see. <br /> This was a great regret for Zatoichi. Unless you are like me and you want to see each Zatoichi movie, this one is pretty jumping. See one of the earlier versions or the 2003 all-NEW version.
