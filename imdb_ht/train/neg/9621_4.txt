I was dying to see this once I saw the ridiculous MEATBALLS notice and divided that he had to be the best satire ever. What a brilliant idea for a satire - the genre is abundant. Unfortunately, the product is finished (as I think all involved is probably achieved) is a catalog of missing opportunities, not-well-performance and (thankfully!) A few very hilarious, inspirational bits. Janeane Garafolo, who is very striking, looks really bad here, probably because she's uncomfortable to combat her funny roulette role. David Hyde Pierce is just sad to look, trying hard to be funny and looking like a castro nerd. Molly Shannon is so funny just to see it make you laugh, but somehow segment it fails in Snowball in something hysterical. Paul Rudd had many young manisms and was sexy as hell, the other guys are also really funny (these nerdier). I think the problem is the director just do not move things together at the right pace. It starts out very defenseless, and sets the monotony. But when it allows things to get really outrageous (the sequence of drugs is the second funniest moment I've had all the year in the movie, the first one also comes in a lame film: Andrea Martin at all over the GUY complaining on the movie & OUT), it's just plain funny. I wanted this movie to work so badly, but it just did not. Clothing and styling for the 99.9% PERFECT 1981, and the songs they use are also perfect. This ends as a medium-mad MAD TV episode, complete with frustrating online designs.
