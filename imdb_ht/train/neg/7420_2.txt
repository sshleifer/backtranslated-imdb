a romance without feeling, a drama of problem without point (or drama) .... This movie assumes all this and fails on every and every turn, as if it is not trying. Or as if the director / editor / scriptwriter team is not really trying. The actors can - they need better support. <br /> A component that does not fail is the note of George Delarue. Beautiful and moving. What a shame it's attached to this movie. At a good movie actor and movement and music syncing and improving the impact. This editor recreates music that has no consideration for dialogue and movement. The love scene is particularly grateful in this respect: an insult to the talents of the lead actors. There is another element of the film that works: photography where. Notably at Grand Central Station. I would advance ahead of what will happen; but how it was filmed in this environment was enchanting. <br /> <br /> Some commentators on this chart have pointed out that US assimilation of Nazi criminal scientists has actually happened during the years of MacCarthy's scary. The moment this film seems to start looking seriously in American society, it changes in conventional romance; Before any human sentiment can move us, it's far away on a (predictable) 'thriller' escapade. As the movie insults the talents of the actors, it insults the issues it pretend (and fail) to take. <br /> <br /> You have been warned.
