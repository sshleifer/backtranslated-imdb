Unlike many, I do not find the site or theme in this small offensive show. Her execution, however, is another issue entirely. Like many B-minus movies, all the gaps decent appear to have been spliced ​​in the trailers. For most of the 22-or-so minutes we sit down to anticipation of anticipation of any piece of real humor. Or at least something keeps one from fidgeting with the remote fibers or carpet counts. With a couple of exceptions the act is terrible; Funny submotion and gestures of some cast members might well fit into a late-night infomercial, but not a primetime sitcom (even a single Canadian one.) Although your original cultural angle, I can not help but think this is mainly a misfired shot by the CBC to replicate success in the Fuel Corner. Unfortunately, they received the tone - and the script - completely wrong for the prairie. The final announcement is that they apparently could not even afford to work where they were doing in a small town (why? Are they so hard to get in Saskatchewan?) Do they think the audience would be fooled by exterior Regina below the city? As a proud Canadian I hope this thing goes far soon, and that the rest of the world, primarily by the CBC's public, quickly forgot this mischievous embarrassment in a sitcom.
