Left Behind is an incredible waste of more than 17 million. The act is weak and uninspiring, the story is even weaker. The audience is asked to believe the line is completely implausible and often drawn to ridicule and giving in return for their good faith. Not only is the movie wrongly and scripted it is lacking in all the technical areas of film. The production design does nothing to help the credibility of the action. The effects are utterly flat and flat. Lighting and continuation in general are unbelievably awful; even compared to movies and a tenth of the budget. However none of this will have the problem that millions of families will no doubt embrace the movie for it's full and it is religious religious; and who can blame them. However it is unfortunate that they will be forced to accept 3rd amateurs movies.
