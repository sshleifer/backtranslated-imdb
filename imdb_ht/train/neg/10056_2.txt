So ... we get that seen added footage of Brando ... interesting, but not exactly Oscar deserves stuff. Susannah York was hardly a clumsy. New scene where Lois finds out Clark is Superman is a little incredible in that he does not notice that there are empty spaces out of the gun instead of real bullets. Real bullets were perverted on her clothes and then bounced on her on the floor but forgot that ... let's listen Donner make fun of Lester's version that made the most logical sense. President Zodal's president "challenged" Washington's monument when it was originally Mount Rushmore. Tweaking that scene has made that line absurd. The "press freedom" of the superman blow sounds comical with the "outward step" that has been delivered better and has a close connection to Clark's earlier stage of the truck station. Then it's done with "turning back the world back in time" effect. He returned everything in the whole movie and made you wonder where exactly the rocket is aiming for Hackensack, N.J ever gone since it's not free Zod and company yet.
