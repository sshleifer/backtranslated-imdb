I read somewhere that Hollywood should focus on renaming bad movies and leaving the classics alone. We can only hope. While this notice was not a total waste, I still wish I had six bucks back to the direction of a DVD in the original. Many violence and one of the worst terms I have ever seen. This version does not add anything new. It only reiterates why Hollywood should leave the thing alone.
