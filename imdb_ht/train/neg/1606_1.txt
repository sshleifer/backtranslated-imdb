In this film, Chávez supporters (either Venezuelan and non-Venezuelan) just lie on a dramatic situation in our country. They did not say that the conflict began because of Chavez's announcement of a lot of PDVSA's best workers just for political issues. They did not say anything about more than 96 TV interruptions transmitted by Chavez for 3 days only in "CADENA NACIONAL" (a kind of confiscated private TV signal). Each one with about 20 minutes of duration. They did not tell us anything about the announcement made by General Jefe Lucas Rincon Romero, General Inspector of the Armed Forces, which is a traditional supporter of Chavez. Even now, in spite of his announcement, it is the Ministry of Interior and Justice. After Chávez returned he was charged with the charge of the Ministro del Defensa (equal to the Secretary of Defense of the United States). They did not say anything about Chávez's order to shoot against a concentration of peaceful people who claimed the elections. They did not say anything about these people in the concentrations that were killed by supporters of Chavez (civilian and military officials). <br /> There are some facts in a wrong order, for libel. <br /> <br /> No matter what civil society social Venezuelan people are currently claiming for a election to resolve the crisis and Chavez's actions to avoid elections. <br /> That's why I tell you ... This movie is just a lot of lies or a great lie.
