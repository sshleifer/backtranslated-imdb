What is it? is a mish-mash of rare renewable motifs (snails, shirley temples, swastikas, and musical imbalances racism, among others) unfettered by any sort of narrative or plot or character development. All of this strikes me as self-awareness "freak show," and I do not mean just the strange casting decision. He feels in a bad acid journey, far beyond any level of drug use one might be the attribute Hunter S. Thompson or William S. Burroughs. The only movie that I can compare is Eraserhead (my second-less-favorite movie ever), which was not much more depressing, but I still find out what it is? a total waste of my time. It's one thing to give me a look at the inner workings of someone else's head - even someone else's chemical-minded person - but quite another one just drifts visual bizarre to me purely for the sake of weirdness .
