How cynical are the writers, they hang out. I can be an American citizen, but I do not need to see other Americans beside each other on the back for an hour and a half in order to enjoy a movie. I'm surprised that so some have commented on how genuinely jingoistic, sentimental and trite the dialogue of this movie really is. The historic inability of the film is not as gross and offensive as in "U-571" (which changes British Indian submariner) but you still walk away feeling a little slim. Really, the Germans in this movie do nothing but admire the Americans between battle scenes! How sad, unnecessary! I would just like to tell the writers: it's obvious to many of you that you can not take real people, with real issues, under real pressure, and that you've taken some very well-tested shortcuts. Lucky for you will always have nationalist nutjobs appreciate your sugar-coated swirling.
