I grew up looking at TNG love. I just recently finished watching the entire series of Voy Voyager on DVD, which may have intensified my sense of disgust and this episode, as the difference in style and approach between the two shows could not be more strong. The idea could be good if used as an opportunity for expanding Riker's character, which is how it would probably be treated on VOY. They might have memories that might be "new" to the audience, rather than simply regret clapping old shows. In and out transition between the "memories" and the "present" of this episode begins as clich√© at the beginning, and very quickly becomes intolerable as the tired model put on and off. Bar has no worst episode ever.
