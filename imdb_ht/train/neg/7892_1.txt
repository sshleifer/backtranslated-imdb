It started out with an interesting site. I still love civil war and ancient secrets of war. The more film progressed, the more I realized that this was a B movie at best. In the latter half, it quickly became a C film, then D, then F, then "I wish that this was not a lecture for me to put it in micro ond! " I can not say that acting in all cases was terrible, just pure. Write this, however ... I never read the book. Perhaps the book is well written. Was simply written by a 10 year old. It was ridiculously deep, drab in dialogue and refreshing, the characters are as interesting as a 5 pound bag of fertilizer. I really hated this movie, just like my wife. I am a Christian and I have no problems with movies that promote or support Christianity. This movie made a big mistake in the cause. Angry, terrible, worthless. If you liked it, I recommend superman 4.
