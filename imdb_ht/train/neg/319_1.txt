A friend bought this movie for Â£ 1, and even then it was incredibly overpriced. Although featuring great names such as Adam Sandler, Billy Bob Thornton and Burt Young's extremely talented, this movie was on comic candy such as taking a trim and pasting it straight into your ear. She uses tired, underneath the comic barrel's technique - always breaks the fourth wall as Sandler talks about the audience, and nonsense mounting of 'hot girls'. Adam Sandler plays a man on a cruise ship who wants to do it as a successful comedy in order to become successful with women. When the ship's comedian - called "Dickie" because of his inferior success and the opposite sex - is presumed to lose the sea, Sandler Sandler's character gets his big break. Dickie does not die, it is rather close to the bathroom, presumably sea sick. <br /> <br /> Maybe out of her mouth she just vomited the worst movie of all time.
