This film seemed to have everything to go for it with good camera, sound, movie, sex, music, costume ... but drum-roll, Gary Stretch spoke! I do not know if he was poor acting or simply a bad script, but would say he was both. When considering filing on him in this role, I found it difficult to root for him even at the very end. I wanted him to die in battle or one of the swords / knives of the sword. Then the tinder for the plot to kill the king was because the king did not have dinner and having sex with his queen? Pretty Lame. And go to the extreme to kill her own son? And then push his girlfriend as royal success? I see a thread or two here and there's historic bytes, but this way was all presented cologne. <br /> I do not recognize Gary stretching out of anything else, but it was terrific. I read another user on the armed audio but did not think he was armed ... after all, he spoke English, right? It really was awful. The lines were read right on the crown tablet ... flat-line. It might just be not the voice to bring tone fluctuations. Aside from that, I made it look at the end, so the movie was at least an "interest." It could be more if the script / line and filed gave more work. The scenery with film crew along with very good quality films is what really makes this movie above all else. The cast and the stories were all high. I give film crew at a 10.
