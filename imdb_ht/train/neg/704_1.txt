A slick romanticizing the sexual exploitation of New Orleans black woman by white men in power and privilege. Ooh. Is this your appetite? Well, then, stomach up to a VHS or DVD and passage over this pointless trolling through a shoe segment of history. For good measure, it fits in the book by celebrating Hack Anne Rice. The direction is as cloying and melodramatic as the cheesy dialogue. Most acting is amateur. The sole production producer's note is that he worked practically a dozen black actors, all of whom were recently employed in today's market (Jasmine Guy, Ben Vereen, Pam Grier, Eartha Kitt), including some of the figures was seen throughout (Bianca Lawson, Rachel Cuttrell). She is also, despite herself, a Sterling showcase for Nicole Lyn. The blonde and ponderous James Earl Jones is also in their hands. So, is the delay to Ossie Davis, a minimal talent that must be his success affiliated with legendary Negro Ensemble company. This film should be rated "T" for throwing.
