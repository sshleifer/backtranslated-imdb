This should have a movie about Sam and his wife, Peter Falk's glorious and equally glamorous Olympia Dukakis. That would be a movie worth seeing. Instead she is a Paul Reiser car, and a little Falk cast in. Elizabeth Perkins's wonderful inch is also in this film, but you'd hardly know it. I suppose Reiser is under the impression that it is a giant movie star that needs a proper car. It's not. Even more galling is that Reiser took the issue to hire some of the best female actresses on the screen today and then push them all into his background. Dukakis do not show up to 15 minutes last, but when it does, the screen grows. The story is about Falk and Dukakis really, but we're undergoing a nonsense, comic, preposterous way in which Reiser gets to know how very cute, precious and oh-so-deep and psychological insistence (wrong!) It can be. For example, in a restaurant scene that I imagined Reiser hoping was "Cassavetes-Love" has a mutually fake confrontation between Reiser and Falk who is so ridiculous patent, I was embarrassed for Falk.
