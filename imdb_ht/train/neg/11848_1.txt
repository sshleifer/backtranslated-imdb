What is supposed to be a simple generic mystery scheme involving a dying philanthropist is, in fact, a top-notching storyline about a bunch of characters (the single great actor Ginger Rogers, in a very early role) all trying to find murderer among a small cast of resident of a chic apartment building. These characters range from utterly stupid means outright. As a cheap, low budget production, most of the action revolves around Rogers and his lead man (some guys, I do not care which it is' the cause it really sucks) talking about the various possibilities to resolve the crime , while still being cut off by an absurd detective and himself in his butt. Honestly, I never had a worst time watching an old b-rate movie of this type, and I've seen some real self-slappers. Oh, and the butler did not do it, because there was not a Butler. But pay attention to the guy closest to a Butler. There ya gone. <br /> - PolarisDiB
