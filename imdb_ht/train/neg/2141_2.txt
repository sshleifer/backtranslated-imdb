I had the annoyance of watching this movie with my girlfriend, who, like me, is a fan of the first. This movie goes right sucking! He missed the first magic. You might actually understand all the mouse words being said, the animation is withered, the palace is very different from the first movie, there are new characters that have never been mentioned before and were terrible, luckily the Prince did not have many lines kept him out of stupid roar. Basically its like the Lion King 1 1/2 except its different story all said in mice. The reason I give this a 2 out of 10 is because the songs do not sing songs by the characters were the most enjoyable.
