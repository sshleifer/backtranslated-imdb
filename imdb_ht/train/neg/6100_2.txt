Effective side (This is not a review of good intentions, it's about the final product), this movie is wrong writing, overacted, and wrongly directed. The story obviously was potential, but this story is nowhere to be found in this movie. Clara Barton was a man. It has passion, desire, love, pain, embarrassment, weakness, and self-doubt just like the rest of us. You would never know this from the lead actress film lead. In fact, apply to each character in the movie, but in the case of Barton: Each sentence is a talk. An epic on the top speech as if out of a penalty robot. In fact the only scene that plays well at one of the board meetings, and I realize that because he made a speech! Each idea it has incredible in its context and it comes with the sound mind as to take a lifetime in search of right on the spot. For example, when he sees a wounded man, he will start pontifying on the needs of the battlefield and protecting soldiers and wearing white flags, etc. As played in the movie, there is no way he could come up with these detail well Think out the mind in seconds. <br /> <br /> At the conclusion, this movie depicts Clara Barton in her struggle. He stole it from his humanity, and it's naturally cheapens all he did because the script is written in their scriptures. The writer does not know Clara Barton, and seems to have based his script on an Britannica Encyclopedia article. (yes they got those back then) but hey, nice technicolor! (caring)
