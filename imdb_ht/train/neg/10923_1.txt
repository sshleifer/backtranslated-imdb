TV movie about an ancient cursed curse brought in the US in 20 years during filming in DeMille's first version of the 10 commandments and which is reawakened when DeMille's sleigh is reeling in the desert. The movie I saw in a long time. <br /> The question was the serious filters or kidding when they made this movie? If this is serious it is a bad peasant movie with a big movie to choose for its bad thing. If it's a comedy he's less good, but funny for all the wrong reasons. You'll be laughing long and hard in this movie, probably more than many other Hollywood "comedies".
