Supernatural, vengeful police officer is back for a third installment, this time acts as a guardian angel for an angry judge charged with female. Starch standards and photo cuts, but properly acting and directing, so make it oddly interesting and look, even if the violence is not for the squeamish (especially the director's director who originally issued an "NC-17" rating). > <br /> * 1/2 from ****
