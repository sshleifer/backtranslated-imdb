This film is just plain bad. It's not even worth looking to make fun of it. The digger teacher is just plain annoying. Even suspicion of disbelief to allow for invisibility (which I gladiar makes for good movie movies) and allows for very stupid victims in a horror movie, this film requires even more than that. If you are looking for locker box locker women, and random sexual encounters, find a porn, if you're looking for a good movie-movie, find something else. If you simply want to waste your time on an annoying bad movie, rent this.
