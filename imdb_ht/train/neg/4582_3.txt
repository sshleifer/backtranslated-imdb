If you want to learn the basics of mechanical proportions, spend $ 9 in a book used, by this movie. I'm a little worried that the money I spent was being used to buy Kool-Aid for shipment in Guyana. I do not think the directors really had any point at all, but maybe they tried to do several: 1) science can explain everything we did, that is to say our lives to Determinists; 2) Science can not be used to explain everything we do, meaning we have free will; 3) Science is, like, really cool, fee; 4) We are God; 5) The world exists only in our minds; 6) Sarah Norman is a tough role to follow with 7) here, putting this small paper tile in your mouth and you'll see some really amazing stuff.
