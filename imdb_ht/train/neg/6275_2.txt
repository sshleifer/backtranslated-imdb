Very unimportant films and characters that are acting so unsympathetically that I really did not care that would cost the best (or was the purpose of the movie, to show some listening to cold-hearted city New York?) No Romance here, there is no comedy either. Act very flat with a very predictable plot. What annoyed me the most was this constant jest and quotes from classic movies. Man, can not you see that more you quote, less important movie of your own gets? Try to be original yourself! A small budget has no excuse at all, the first time director. Write, crappy, crappy. No wonder it costs only one buck ...
