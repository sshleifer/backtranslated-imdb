You must kneel down !!!! Let's entertain the possibility that Parker Posey is really an actress, and not just some entry into the "Quirk of the month club" of actors. Indeed, unless this is a satirized language-in-pig on David Mamet - Tied, confusing dialogue released alternately in fast caroteness or monotone (thinker Ben Stein) foliage - or a flat comedy dish; This movie has come to run for a prime tomato prime --- or worse. As if Posey's stiffness and uncomfortable were not enough, we had harder and even more comfortable Jeff Goldblum. There are more wood in this movie than a toothpick factory. <br /> Adding to this already rare casting, are several other roles, all populated by forgettable actors, who look or sound like escaping from America's Top Top Model, Don Pardo, or even the kid pronouncing the word "tea" as "weight", which just cares about the fact that there is so little love on this movie, we are analyzing his accents to guess if it is Canadian or not !! I think I laugh at my heart in places that are supposed to be serious, and it has taken seriously the sections that are meant to be funny. Even the sound sounds like a cartoon in Alarik Jans music for the "House of Games" Mamet. If taken as a parody, the film is almost funnily; if they have taken seriously, just a self-conscious piece of drek.
