This is a simple story but it feels very manipulative. She misses pathos so she does not leave room for imagination or a personal thought or time for reflection. <br /> <br /> The animation is well done but I feel like it's too much presentation. I prefer more images from behind, more space in the background and maybe then this would not feel like my pump. <br /> But for a Hollywood style movie it works OK but it's very derivative of Aardman movie and this is bothering me. Maybe a longer movie will test if this marker can make the voice uncluttered. <br /> I think the voice is too gloomy.
