This third Darkman was definitely better than the second one, but still far worse than the original movie. What made this one better than D2 was the fact that the bad guy was changing and Durant had not brought back again. In addition there were actually some hint of character development when it comes to the bad guy's family and Darkman himself. This was my heart softened and I gave this fixed flick as much as 4/10, is ** / *****.
