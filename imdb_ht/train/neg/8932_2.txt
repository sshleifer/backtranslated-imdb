I was told I was very curious about watching this film, and it was considered a notorious disaster when published by Fox 20th Century in 1970. It has also popped up on several critics of bad movie lists, and this only deepens a interest, as I've just seen what made this movie bad. Upon seeing it, I think I have my answers. Although I'm going to tell it to look curious, the act, the direction, and the script are so bad laughs, that satypical assumption is completely missing. Racquel Welch seems to try to bring the film, but after the opening sequence of the sex-change surgery, the movie goes so far down hill that he can not handle this work alone. John Huston as Uncle Buck Loner is certainly no help, as he reads and buys on the screen, it sometimes looks like it's wonderful itself what he's doing. Rex Reed bounces around as Myron, changing Myra's ego ego, and even having his own masturbation scene celebrated. Bravo for first performance! Farrah Fawcett plays a blonde mute; It certainly seemed compelling in this role. But of course, arguably the most celebrated role was going to Mae to the west. The vision of a 75-year-old woman with a plastic face made innuendos sexual seemed more appropriate for a horror movie. I do not mean to put this down personally; but in this movie, no one is looking for good. The direction seems so cunning and non-existent, that the movie is not only bad but boring as well. Throw in some old movie footage of old stars, and the movie becomes even more disconnected. For each of his own to anyone who liked this, and I was happy to have at least seen it, but Myra Breckenridge seems to be the disaster that he always reputed to be from the beginning.
