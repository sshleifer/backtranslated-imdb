I am so shameful. This movie let me feel I was thrown out of my time and mental energy. Here was the excellent film Woody Allen all over again: Neo-classical Manhattanites debate whether they will cheat on their spouses. Woody, I've seen these characters already, I've seen the scenario from you ten times already. Where did your creativity go ??? You need to open your eyes and look around you. The world has changed dramatically since Annie Hall - and you need to change it with it. There are more interesting and funny scenarios where you can apply your brand of bitterness and neuroticism - why not try them out instead of rehashing the same old slide over and over and over again. <br /> <br /> When I hear that Woody Allen has a new project coming out, it does not do anything to me - because now I've come to expect its old standby: the couple who are grow tired of each other and end up cheating. Depressed and even old, even old. <br /> If Woody wants to win his fans back, then he understood that our sense of humor and intelligence had to be encouraged - not insulting.
