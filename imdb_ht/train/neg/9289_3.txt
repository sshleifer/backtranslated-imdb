For those of you who were desperate to find out what happened to the original movie Twitch, here's your chance, and then return to the real world. <br /> <br /> The guy who hides the gold in the movie first told twitch, so he gets transferred to another prison, where battle hugs hang around looking broody. Twitch plans to leave the prison in a month to get the gold to start a life with her woman. <br /> <br /> Then something happens with someone shot, and the movie gets to die Hard in another jail. But the wrestler's daughter is caught up in it all, so she and contraction go to get her woman and the twitch. <br /> <br /> As you can imagine, the act is below par, it features a lot of (really annoying) music rap, and incorrect battlefield edited. On the plus side, he got that Spanish blocked by it, who stars in every jail / action / thriller ever made, and closed a door in this. <br /> It's not very aware, but at least it's innocent. <br /> If you were a massive fan of the original, it's okay thing. <br /> <br /> If not, you have been warned.
