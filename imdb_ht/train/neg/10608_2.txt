I do not think any movie of Van Damme will ever beat Universal Soldiers but you never know. This movie was good but not as good as 1st. VD returns a Luc & must fight again. It tries to 2 b funny here, but it may be worth a smirk in a search. VD has a kid this time from Ally W., good she showed a pic of them 2. Goldberg was cool and made famous to move-forget the cause of calling it I do not look lit-absorbed. VD & Goldberg had some good battles. It ended like the first but just not that good. VD makes his best move in his career, as KICK's always-hicky mouse. Though the final end should last longer. Anyway, it's worth seeing, but it will never be the original.
