What is ... ... is that? This must, without a doubt, is the largest garbage of film, environment and camera ever. I know you can not set your expectations for a 80 high slasher, but this is too stupid to be true. I donated this movie for $ 0.89 and I still feel encouraged to claim my money back. Can you imagine who hard to read STINKS? <br /> Who is the violent killer in this movie and what motivates him ??? Well actually, you could not possibly have less care. And why should you? The merchants of this piece of waste sure did not care. They did not try to create a little bit of tension. The director (Stephen Carpenter - I guess it's easier to get money with a name like that) also made the Kindred (1986) that was rather enjoyable and recently he made Soul survivors. Complete craps as well, but at least one was Eliza Dushku. This junk has the first of Daphne Zuniga !!! (Who ??) Yeah that's right, Chick at Melrose Place. Her memorable character dies about 15 min. after their opening credits. He is second to die. The first victim dies directly in the first minute, but nobody seems to mention or miss him after that so cares? The rest of the actors ... they do not deserve the theme actors actually, they are completely worthwhile. You're hoping to die a quick and painful death ... and not just the characters <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> My humble opinion = 0/10
