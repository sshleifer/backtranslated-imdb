I saw this film at the Toronto movie festival with fairly solid expectations. The movie has a great cast and was locked at the festival so it must be good, right? how wrong I was. <br /> I knew we were in trouble when before the movie director was talking about how when he was directing an episode of wiseguy he met an unknown actor named kevin spacey (a director / writer of wiseguy to make features Her first / educator at Edison must have some incriminating photographs that kevin spacey kills a homeless person, because I can not see how he (along with other actors in the movie) would ever agree to be in this disaster. /> <br /> This movie is absolutely awesome! It's a mix of all hard cop that boiled clay ever. nothing new with Edison. The act was bad and the direction was even worse. This episode is the aforementioned piece of wiseguy this was the best dropping of the movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> some examples of bad moments in Edison ... morgan freeman dancing around her apartment for any reason for rock and roll music ... justin timberlake receives creative criticism from belle him while his apartment is ure not candles ... llcoolj drive a vintage firebird ... 3 guys fired at the top ... <br /> <br /> This movie is the opposite of good. <br /> <br /> Stay away from EDISON!
