A question for you: A family goes to a new home and is detained by demonic forces. What movie do I talk about? Every horror movie you see? Yes it's true, but that's not the answer I'm looking for. I'll narrow it down when it says there are a lot of teenage angst scenes. Does not help? Well there's a lot of bits where the characters are followed by an animal and you see the characters in the Creator`s Creator. No forward? Well there is a sequence of dreams that involve lots of blood? There could still be any horror movie you say. Oh gawd this could take weeks so i`ll tell the movie i`m talking about the features of loads of so many aussies of which have appeared in NEIGHBORS and HOME and far. Is that the right movie is the FIRST FIRST (aka CUBBYHOUSE) and do you understand what the above exercise is about? It`s about I show how the third CIRCLE is absolutely no different from any horror movie that`s made
