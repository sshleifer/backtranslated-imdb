I must admit, I do not remember much about the characters or the story, though I'm not sure there was one, I was soooo irritated by this movie that I had a bit of a hard time focused on it. How can you call a movie "Keys in Tulsa" and then her movie in Texas? The desert land flat around Arlington (I think that was the place) in any way similar to the green hills rolling around Tulsa, and a celebrity in Tulsa would have been a very nicer block to live in. It is obvious that no one in the movie has ever been to Tulsa or else to realize how nothing at the movie would tell it. Did not anyone at least see Rumblef or the Outsiders? I know this is a serious sound, but I can not help it. I watched this because I love James Spader and I usually find Eric Stotz interesting. But even these intriguing actress could not liven up this mix, and self-telling story involving those who are not in TULSA !! I'm sorry, it can not be the most expensive movie in Oklahoma. What if the "live and die of LA" was shot in Toronto? Does this suck? Well this does.
