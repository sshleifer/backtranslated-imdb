Unfortunately, this is not the 'best British movie in Gore since Hellraiser', though the DVD coverage claims that's what's cheating me to buy it. It is, however, a tribute to many of the great old horrors, films from most of the Amicus stable. <br /> <br /> Crib ... is shooting on mini DVDs, which even though we all know more of a TV feel than a movie, can do much better. Each stage, set and shot looks like it's lit in exactly the same (standard keys, filling, rear configuration), which only improves the cheap look at the finished piece. The Gore content is, quite frankly, mockingly. From the opening vaccine where we see the head obviously the rubber foam torn apart, through the cheap miners proprietors, the animal's effects and the CG is terrible, there was nothing to have that to impress me at all. The act is abominable, from the near-comet detective to the brummie dwarf, through Dani Filth, the least compelling supportive of my bad guy I've ever witnessed. Each of the substories is more formula than the last, and sets them worse and worse than the movie run. Watch out for the 'Mental Asylum' - a Georgian semi detached house with a bad cg sign out, and the most rare (and not in a good way) the padded cell I've seen. <br /> It took me four attempts to reach the end of the movie without losing my attention (NEE, running) to any available opportunity. I actually found myself dusty at one point while the film was running. <br /> It does, however, mark one of the last known findings of Emily Booth's breasts, which I guess is one (um, two) things she went for it. Once it's out of the way though, it's all downhill. <br /> I've heard people say goodbye to Alex Chandon, and I would like to believe them, but on this evidence I'm not likely. If you want a decent tribute to Amicus, avoid this and go for the League of Special Christmas gentlemen instead. <br /> <br /> Now fight it out with Blair Witch 2: Book of Shadows for the title of the worst movie I have ever seen.
