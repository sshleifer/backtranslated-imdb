Good movie movie, but not a true story. <br /> <br /> Rubin "Hurricane" Carter was a notorius liar, a murderer and never found guilty. New Jersey State just did not go for it a third time as 20 years have gone. Carter received an offer in 1976: "passing a test lies and go free". He did not take it. This movie should never have been made, but money talks. A lot of people are unjustly living their lives in jail and undoubtedly more black than white. Why choose a false story? <br /> <br /> Jens
