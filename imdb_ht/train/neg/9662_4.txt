I usually read my review before watching a movie. Guess what I did not do before watching TLB, and I must say I was very surprised to see the average rating of IMDb. I found it has a total lack of history. You just get dropped in it (and, sadly, not in the Private Saving way Ryan falls into the movie), and it also has a sudden end, which was very satisfying for me. <br /> I have admitted, the injured soldiers look my realistic look, especially with the low budget in mind. But prepare yourself to have a laugh ... Some guys were in the air after an explosion as though they were Olympic gymnasts. A mid-air corkscrew or somersault during WW I is a bit too much for me, especially when it does many times during the movie ... But the parties that really got me laughed until I almost called being the scene have close combat. Screams and screaming German voices ... unbelievably funny. It looks like they're talking by one actor / voice actor, because they all sound exactly the same, and it just sounds like a 'typical' German voice. <br /> I would absolutely NOT recommend this movie to anyone, except for those who just want to have some laugh because of the sad and core quality of it.
