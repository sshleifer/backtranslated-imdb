Many like Orson Welles thirty years earlier, Mike Sarne gave the "biggest train set in the world" to play with, but unfortunately lacked the ability to do anything more than watch putting his train to a wavy train that still speaks of and shock and a weird sort of awe. Despite the modern interpretation interpretations that show somehow to view it as a gay or even feminist device, the fact of the problem is that it was a major disaster in 1970 and it remains one today. Now anyone which provided the resources to Mr Sarne's cast had soared up so royally remained a well-guarded secret. Only Michael Cimino ever came close to the political and artistic Armageddon that constituted "Gate of the Sky" .Both films appears to be an ego trip for their respective directors but at least Mr Cimino has made one of the great movies in the 1970s before wasting the studio's largesse, whereas Mr Sarne had only the rather "Joanna" foliage in his locker . In addition, the "Gate of Heaven" was able to boast some memorable and well-kept pieces where, tragically, "Myra Breckinridge's womb" was made. Simply put, it is inexhaustibly the worst example of biting the hand that eats in the history of Hollywood.
