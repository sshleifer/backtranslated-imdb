I am glad that I saw this movie after Mr.Sandler became famous. <br /> It's bad .... bad, bad, bad. There is no draw. It's like watching a painful home movie dull. <br /> I really enjoy her other movie ... but if you're a fan of me .... stay away from this one. It can change your mind about Adam. You can never recover from the horror that is this movie .... I had a better time watching how old folks play scrabble in a home .......
