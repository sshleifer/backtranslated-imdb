Yowza! If anyone loves Laurel and Hardy can watch this movie and feel good about it, you are someone who is better than me! This film, while a great attempt to 'imitate' Laurel and Hardy in appearance, sound and routine, fell very short of honoring, or even being a movie of any substance. I blame Larry Harmon. Dialogue is torn from old L + H cinema and planting in the horrors, the trailing draw and unnecessary characterization of the other co-stars, Pinchot's accent was rare for Stan, and while Sartain did an excellent job and The Ollie's accent, she tried too hard to create the wonderful mix of Mr. Hardy. Where was a (good) music number? Correct is fantastic, acting is stiff, the lines are physical, they are - implausible- (although maybe they were VERY giving it to feel cheap together?), And in general it is something terrible to witness. It's even more painful to watch than ATOLL K, where the legendary Duo has made the latest films in the 1950s and era epochs. Make yourself a favor and watch as many of the Laurel and Hardy movies as you can, and learn how things were. You know what a MAGNATE is, do not you? Stan Laurel did not perpetrately answer and semi-moron hit in every sentence. <br /> <br /> I have mercy on anyone who thinks this was a decent / decent decent of the boys. Where was the classic song theme?!? Why ruin 'Here's another fine chaos'? Why skip 'any wiser'? Why was there a pointless gaggle in the star? WHY DO I GIVE OWN GAMES ???? WHY DO MY HARMON IN IT? POUKISA BOZO! And did the CHANNEL LEARNING help fund the stuff? <br /> I mean, really. Fart jokes, for God's sake. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> FART JOKES.
