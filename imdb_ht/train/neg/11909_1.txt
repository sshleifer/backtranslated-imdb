I think I've found the most misogynistic movie of all time: Darklight. Gist of the movie - Lilith is Adam's first wife and he was considered imperfect and eliminated from Eden because he considered himself Adam equal and refused to submit to him. Look, I took the right words out of the script. Then the movie keeps going on and if it is the heroine of the movie, the only time that it becomes acceptable is when he does what the guys say he does! He finished the movie under the control of faith - a group of boys all! <br /> Other than that the script was predictable and the FX was awful. Apart from the apparent radiance of brides that are usually a lot more subtle in modern films, there was nothing original about darklight.
