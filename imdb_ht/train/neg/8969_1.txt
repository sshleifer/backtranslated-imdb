The scheme does not offer any new excitement, it even starts the same as cube I. This time there is no other improvement for cars in cubes, except for having an extra, non-watch, extraordinary spirit. Characters are also not quite elaborated as in the first episode, they just came to "flat" as in a soap opera. If someone makes it to the normal exit, the person should ask some questions, such as "you believe in God?", It's not really creative or original and especially in my opinion it does not fit into the mystery of the cube and it traps. Really nothing much else says about it.
