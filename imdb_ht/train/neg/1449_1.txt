First, before you read it further, you must understand that I'm not neo-Nazis, I'm just trying to understand correctly Hitler to be sure nobody likes to take power again. <br /> I saw this series and found it awful. I mean, OK, it's interesting to look, but is it real? I searched for answers and found one: absolutely not. First, Hitler did not upset her life, the series showed a mad Hitler, even when she was a child. Secondly, Hitler never wants to abduct his daughter, in fact, it's very likely that Hitler, in fact, was gay and fighting all his life in choking this secret. Third, people will hate me but it's true: Hitler was good. How do you think she managed to get to power if she was so lovely and ugly? Because it was good. This is a common point I found in the interviews of people who live near or far in it (of course, not Jewish). This series was awful because if you think Hitler was just a madman, ugly, and of course, not good at all, you're wrong. If you think that, you will let people like him take power in their country and you do not want that. If you really understand how Hitler managed to get into power, and stop thinking it was just awful, you'll be able to find dangerous politicians like him (of course, remember he was elected) and stop his previous term too late. /> <br /> Life is important to protect, this series is just awful to show us the truth, if we continue to see Hitler like that, another will take place exactly as the first one did.
