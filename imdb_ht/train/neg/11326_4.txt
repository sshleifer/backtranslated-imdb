This is one of the two postapokalyptic fantasy films that Albert Pyun did in 1993 - and it's the one wrong one. Apparently all his energy went into "Nemesis" which was a fun non-stop action movie, and he had a more expensive look. "Knights" is clunky and cheesy, a sci-fi's under-the-barricade that is too often similar to a video game (new opponents pop up all the time and be exterminated as quickly as possible). The only thing that saved this movie from the trash can be Kathy Long; not a particularly attractive woman, but endlessly a efficient fighting machine. As for Kris Kristofferson, considering his age at the time (58), I hope that his cascade double was well paid. (* 1/2)
