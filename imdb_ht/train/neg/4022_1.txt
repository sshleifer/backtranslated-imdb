This movie was awful. I watched him three times, and not all the same. It's just impossible to watch, the story line sucks, it's depressing, and utterly disgusting. I do not write spoiler for anything, so if you want to know why it's so disgusting, see it for yourself. The only good thing about this movie was John Savage, his dialogue at the beginning, and some funny parts of the movie. The little child in this movie is annoying, and the whole situation is bullshit. I saw this movie in the movie store in America, so I supposed it would be a good movie. Jesus Christ, I was wrong !!!! The act is all terrible, and the nudity itself is lame and nasty. Another thing is, Starr Andreef, the other main character, was not in the bad movies of the past, in fact, he was in some pretty pretty. Like John Savage. THIS SUCKS movie!
