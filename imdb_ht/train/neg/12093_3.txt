Isabelle Huppert is a wonderful actor. The director of "La Pianiste" understands this, giving the viewer and time taken to Huppert's face, and these are a pleasure to see. Huppert is not an animated actor - he has recorded emotions and the least awakened in an eyebrows or tremor of a smile. <br /> <br /> Other than the pleasure of watching an experienced actor acting in his profession, there is nothing in this movie that makes me want to recommend it. (Well, if you enjoy self-mutilation, subdomain-masochism, and scarcely behaviors, "La Pianiste" might work for you. One of these attributes, I could not find any outward value in it.) <Br / Bury of all these strange materials has a true duct. People who compete at the highest level - music, athletes, regardless of - start as strangers, and are formed in outsiders in the competitive environment. <br /> <br /> Not worth a trip to a movie theater Relearn the life of this life. <br /> <br />
