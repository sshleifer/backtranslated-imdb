What a mess !! Why this movie was made? This, and other movies in his "caliber" should teach tools on how not to make a movie. Children may like it, but anyone over 10 or may not agree. To make matters worse was the fact that such great talent as Whoopi Goldberg and Armin Mueller Stahl were entirely wasted in a worthy film in any notice.
