A female vampire killed young women and painted their blood. He has an assistant who does not want a vampire, so he did what he ordered or returned to a blood sucker. After killing killing, the assistant gets rid of and falls in love with a homeless girl. <br /> What can I say about this movie? This rhythm is over-slow, that it has some strange sound effects (never a strange sounding bite) and ambiance (new jazz here I come) and that light does not seem to be included on the set. It looks like an "authoritarian" horror movie with all independent independence. The plot is completely stupid and as you can guess, it's the girl's vampire explaining how to kill her even if she does not have to do it; Of course, breed, light, garlic, and stick does not work. <br /> It's not even a funny movie disgusting. Perhaps with some friends and a lot of beers, it can not have its comic sites (to be honest, it's funny for 10 - 15 minutes near the movie end). Do not be fooled by the Troma Thief, it's one of the bad films presented.
