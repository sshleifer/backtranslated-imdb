I think the biggest thing that can be is to be boring. Bad is actually better than boring. This thing has no breath. It has interesting facts in taking place in Cambodia. How many Americans make the 30 movie take place in Cambodia. But the conflict has a little hard to know. Even the troop moves are a little confusing. What dragged into a fallout stand is the love story. Why these two guys are so totally transfixed on the dippy blonde I do not know. I thought he should continue to use his zombie (like them) and forget about it. The movie just plods together. The perfect microcosm is where one of the principles of character follows a Cambodian priest in the water to get to the secret hieroglyphic place (or whatever) explains how to turn people into captured zombies. I thought they had never happened. A guy takes two steps. It stopped. It looks around. The other guy hid behind some columns. It takes two steps. It stopped. It looks around. The other guy hid behind some bushes. This is the movie in a Nutshell. Then there are bad acting and nonsense dialogues. I actually have a lot of patience when it comes to movies B. This one is obnoxious. By the way, a more just title would be the revolt of the Hypnotized.
