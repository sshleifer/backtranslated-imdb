It is difficult to make a fair trial on a movie like this that has such an impact on me as a young age. This is and out of a worst kind of worst of film exploitation. I was unfortunate enough to see this movie for the first time in my youth, and I never forgot it. I thought it was the most terrible movie ever made. Then I saw it again earlier this year and were once again fears. <br /> I'm not a zelot or one to tell what others should and should not see but I've done great offense in the way in which something as terrible as rape faced with in this movie . I like lowbrow cinema but this is just plain embarrassing. Rent some Rus Myer instead.
