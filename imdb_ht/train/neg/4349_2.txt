This movie is terrible. Carlitos Way (1993) is a great movie. Goodgfellas it is not his one hand in the best crime films made. This film should be considered closer to the STING2 Party or perhaps Speed ​​Zone. Remember these gems! The only reason this film was made was to capitalize on the cult of the original. This film was missing all of Palma, Pacino and Penn worked so hard on. There was not a charming character and that is the fault of everyone who is responsible for doing it. I hope RISE TO POWER has every RAZZIE it may be and maybe even invent some new categories that allow it to have a record holder. After I watched this S @ * T movie movie, I sat down and looked original Carlitos way to find th bad taste out of my mouth. After watching what I want Pachanga came and blocked me from my misery.
