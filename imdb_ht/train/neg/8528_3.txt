What is written on the poster is: "At birth he gave 6 years to live ... In 34 he took the journey of a lifetime." Ami is an American born in Israel who has been diagnosed with Disease Disease at the age of one. At the age of 34, after the love of the 22-year-old donor's donation did not go well, he decided to come to the U.S. to deal with the doctor who said he would have only 6 years to live. He wanted to show the doctor that he is still alive, with the weight of 39 pounds. Why? Your desires are as good as me, even I have seen this film .. Obviously it's courageous to live when all it can move is its left index finger, but why it's a lot of anger toward the doctor who diagnoses his illness 34 years ago? Her doctor just told her mother based on the medical history, people with her illness will not live long. What's the point of her showing up at the old doctor's door? Why is this old doctor in the United States following a trip to his life? There are so many things we might be interested in Ami's life: how can he make such animation and the movement of one finger? How can he go to daily life while totally dependent on others? How did he come from living the prediction of the doctor? How does she face emotionally when others look at her like looking at a strange creature? The movie told us not one of that. Instead, the film maker got a van and set up a trip left Ami to show up in his old doctor's door in order to show him that he is still alive. I thought it was a joke.
