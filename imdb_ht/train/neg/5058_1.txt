(When will I ever learn-?) The reviewer at NPR has made me think this turkey was another Kane Citizen. Please allow me to stop my spleen ... <br /> I'll admit: The environment, presumably New York City, was never so outright ugly and unappealing. I remember that the 70 was a bad day for men's fashion and automotive. And all-smoking! If the plan was cheap to the characters, he succeeded. <br /> For a movie at work (at least, in my own estimation), there are at least one sympathetic character. Only Ned Beaty came close, and I could not wait to finish off Nicky. If a shot shot was hit Mikey, well, it could have eliminated a shrug of indifference to the most. <br /> I can not remember when I filmed a movie as strongly. I suppose I'm a rubella who does not dig "art" flicks. Oh well.
