Dialogue: stilted, clichéd; Actress: hammy, clichéd; Plot: predictab, clichéd. Just what Christopher Plummer Nastassia Kinski is doing in this "B" garbage? Plummer was well established last decade ago, Kinski had heads like "Tess" and "Cat Cat" behind him ... You must be desperate. The bad guys all have bad-guy accents - * bad * bad-guy accents! (Plummer especially! Where did he learn to do "German"?) And most of them have malicious guy sneers as well. The innocent innocents all prevent panicking enough to make you laugh. The good guy continues to live, among other things: * a 5 "throwing knife buried in his shoulder - just pull it out and seconds later is using the arm that has no difficulty in all sailboat * - Fire (I think someone is referring to a .50) in the leg that he sort out does not tie a bandage around his leg pants, and then he barely has a bump; * several battle points in which he supports punches multiple of the face as well as running cranium -first of a door frame; * a fall, backward, from what looks like the third floor, over paving, without the slightest sign of a tight ankle or any inconvenience the other trifling.The account has exactly 3 smart lines, the rest of it all is so dull and boring .. <br /> <br /> OK is not all bad.Plummer brings a certain class to his part and It is undoubtedly the best actor in this film flick. Of course not very much, but it can make the villain without mercy without resorting to the hack techniques most of the bandits y o use here we, you still know you are watching Christopher Plummer acting the villain. <br /> <br /> This movie is really a terrible waste of time. Acting, as it is, is the sort of 70 movie cinema films of Wooden's favorite Bruce Lee's very obviously false scene, but it's not even anywhere near as well as a Roger Moore 007 or a Bruce Lee movie. Do not bother.
