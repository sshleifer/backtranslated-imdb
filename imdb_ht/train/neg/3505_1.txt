Comedy Central has a habit of putting on major programs at Chappelle's Times-Show, The Daily Show, Colbert Report, and then there are some people who love or hate-Stella, Dr. Katz. Then there are some shows that have defenders, but they are just plain terrific-Mencia, and now Sarah Silverman. This show based on the reality of Silverman is self-centered, which can be funny (Colbert Report) but can be awful (Mind of Mencia). It should be no trauma that I believe the latter is the case. Pointing to this is a parody of a sitcom and society, an absurd program it loses itself in its absurdity and it simply is not funny. A farting woman has been doing many comedies many times because she's not something that's common. We do not need 25 minutes in it. When a criminal disarmed by a chef, he simply lost his appeal - we saw it in Jay and Silent Bob strikes back, except the women were warmer, and the whole scene was more absurd, making it better. But the best comparison of this show is Stella, except Stella was more subtle, which is what makes the absurd comedy comedy. He had better acting, and I suppose, a bit more of a realistic ghost view. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the fact that some comments are so negative (I'm very skeptical of the critical criticism, but not argumentative reaction) in this show is the amount of advertising on it, very obnoxious ads in many programs far out of advertising for other programs. Many people are wondering why Sarah Silverman has a career, and others are still bothered when the best shows were canceled. This show should never have made it past the pilot stage without. Back in Norm showed far more promises, yet this show made it further. And as far as the critics were incorrect, many things were universally panned to have seen their situation incredibly. Last I check, Britney Spears also reviews well. Take this comparison but you want because someone will no doubt accuse me of being psychotic about IMDb for this simple show.
