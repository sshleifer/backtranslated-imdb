This was snorky, homophobic stuff dating in 1976. It seems particularly mean-dynamic now, full of gay stereotypes, and characters that are meant to be laughing at, rather than with. Redd Foxx does his standard schtick, Michael Warren at least trying to bring humankind to a one-dimensional character, and Pearl-Pearl what did you think? Pearl Bailey deserves far better.
