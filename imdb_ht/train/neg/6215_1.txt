This really was a waste of time ... The movie has a weak scheme, the story is fragmented and ends quite suddenly and very much .... though the animation is top notch. <br /> Once the movie started, I tried to give it the benefit of the doubt by telling myself that it might get interesting to the stage later, but it was never unique. This plot was even played over and over again, but what made it worse is that the biggest draw hole was the whole story about how to kill the wicked ... The writer could do many more and the whole concept, but seemed to have it or he did not have the hearts of it and wanted to close the film as soon as it started. <br /> Overall, too much hype, but can not be saved.
