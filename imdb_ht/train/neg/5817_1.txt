The most difficult thing about this film is to say anything positive about it. The characters were stereotyped "white-garbage", the "draw" movie was broken from the beginning, and the worst feature of this movie was that the stripping was so blatant from dull body it was funny. Regretfully, that was the only funny thing in the movie. Ms. Jenkins would be best served if in the future he would avoid using his life story to "entertain" people. It was simply that bad. One positive aspect of this film (this has nothing to do with the lack-of-the-quality of the movie) is that my brother embraced out the money for this stinker.
