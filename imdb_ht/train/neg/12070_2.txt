I came to buy one of these "Legacy of Horror" 50 movie collection collections and you suppose I'm still looking at them to find a good movie horror in it. Sometimes you find an enjoyable yet one campy such as the Devil's Devil or the Devil Bat, or one of Alfred Hitchcock's big movie (some are not horrors however and only on there because Hitchcock directs some horrors and suspicions) but other times It seems they are putting movies like Monster Island and this over because they can not accept the fact they would easily be forgotten and should be for that matter. So we open up to sort of a game Westing idea. The ruthless yet abusive and abusive dad is played by Carradine (one featuring this feature) died and left her legacy to her children and servants who she still hated. Carradine provided a good performance as always, but it was left mostly in a voice recording and flashback effect to let us sit down to the mediocre / terrible performances. The rest of the cast either shake or down in the scene. Given this was an independent film in the 70's of the lighting and the effects are very limited. It's hard to build a lot of tension when the viewer can not see what's happening in some scenes. Some actors like the Igor and Elga servants give an effort at least and I'm ashamed to admit kind of let me chuckling in the end especially for the absolute sort but still with some very minor happiness by pulling some versions into a twist of a very different Obviously, who-does-it, but not enough to improve the quality of the movie. You do not mean that they like the characters as they are either selfish and cruel or psychotic, but it takes it to a whole new level and does much insurmountable. Death scenes are very bad and the suspense is not really there. It proves that you would probably enjoy the film "Cooling" films such as House on a Haunted Hill, Little Shop in the Horror and Jack Nicholson, and Night of the Living Dead on it. This is best avoided.
