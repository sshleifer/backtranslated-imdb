Before seeing this film, I was hoping a fictional drama based on wounds on the book's idea; instead, read in the book, cut off and dramatic scenes that show different "diseases." That did not bother me much, but it prevented me from enjoying the movie. A story or even two or three long stories and extract from the interspersed book of the movie would be preferable, in my opinion. If you're going to base a movie on a psychology text, you've got to find a more interesting (and preferably accurate) text than this one. The film drags while part of it's little more than a video encyclopedia of 19th century psychology and would be utterly intolerable if it was not sexual in nature (because "gender = interesting" for most of us, even me). Luckily, there are several stories and current character development that pull us in. But injustice, Krafft-Ebing's theory of sexuality was uncomfortable, for the most part. I was hoping he would use the stories to show how the imperatitions of his archaic view of psychology are still held by many of that day. <br /> So, in the end, what do you have? A detailed catalog about a few fetishes and orientations, and some lightweight stories that show the trials and tribulations of a few "sexual favors" before they are healed. For most of the movie, the movie moves with the zoom speed (and mood) in a wake. And, as a movie obviously low budget, the cinematography and acting are not exactly the top level. Although I was * happy with the music, costume and interior design. <br /> I felt this movie was right up my go, and I still feel it is a movie below average. It deserves a 3/10; a 4/10 if I felt very generous. I can not imagine anyone who likes this if they did not already have an interest in sexual fetishism.
