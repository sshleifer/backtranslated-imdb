Anyone who is not aware of British 1973's original British movie The Man Wicker would have left the cinema and the Poor 's' and 'peurile' impression. As a devotee of the original leaves with the Purple Poor's impression. From the grim reality of haggle enbreds toothlessly draws the force of law and order to a website of paganistic barbarism ceremonies on a remote Scottish island, named Summerisle (the original) near the Amazon-ic colony on the Maine coast of land The United States, called Summersisle, the renewal hardly hit the spot. <br /> <br /> This is, quite sadly, a case of what 'could' have been a classic remake of a classic being manipulated and provided for a simple minded public. There is nothing to nothing. <br /> <br /> Mr. (or give the reworked context of the movie) ladies involved ... hang yourself in shame.
