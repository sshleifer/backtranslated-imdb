There is only one essential thing in deepening appreciation of the Indian Runner. Opening your pants. Look inside. Is there evidence of a Y chromosome? Well, you'll do. This movie has all the male requisites: blood, weapons, car chases, women fans, deaths, multiple tattoos, cigarettes, liquor, violence, pyrotechnics - what do I leave out? - Oh, yeah, blow torches. As a woman, I seriously expected Sean Penn to consider this as a `` `when I was a child '' kind of effort. Since he both wrote and directed the thing, he is almost exclusively responsible. An uneven cast (Viggo Mortensen as usual demonstrates brilliantly how the work is supposed to be) trying to save Penn. Too late. Lines and actions are there. Even consecutively, qualified actors can not change these. <br /> I found this movie slender and funny, as well as predictable. The dialogue staggers together - Sandy Dennis has my respect for trying to breathe life into a half maternal monologue without mother authenticity. Then he died. After a bit, so grandmother's grandfather, played by Charles Bronson. Their absence is hardly apparent .. <br /> At intervals, pyrotechnics, etc., noted above looks at things to get up and scare the audience to think of something important to happen. You are male and under 25, you can worship this movie. Plan to return to it at 35. Think you'll still love it? <br /> I do not think so.
