This is a seriously bad, remarkable poor in the classic Bimalda Parineeta. The story is based on Sarat Chandra's book in the same name and it is a distortion of the original. Well someone can appreciate some degree of creativity, but not creatively intimidated. The act is not all affected and the movie is a shame. Shekar's father in the word of abusive Lolita (Balan) sounds cheap and morbid and destroys the spirit of the original story. Once again the scene where Shekhar (Saif) hits Lolita is quite out of place with the flow of the movie and the characters are quite jarring to the senses, and they could easily avoid. As well as the sex scene between Saif and Balan is quite unbelievable to the movie and a cheap budget to attract the audience. When a creative work is not faithful to the original and destroys his mind, the work falls apart. The song "Boom Boom" is OK. Another silver lining of black cloud in this film is the scene where Saif stands for himself and rebels against his father. This is a positive departure from the original and worthy of credit. On this count this movie deserves 3 stars. The song and dance by Rekha smacks in artifice and it is a set on. The song is tuneful but I remember having heard it somewhere before and if Iam does not mistake the melody appears to have been plagiarized. <br /> <br /> Well, agreed once the times have changed since then. But then this movie is not even reflected in modern times. <br /> This is what happens when the modern Bollywood movie makers get increasingly obsessed with impressing NRIs and grabbing the NRI entertainment market. These films end up both in India and in any other part of the world.
