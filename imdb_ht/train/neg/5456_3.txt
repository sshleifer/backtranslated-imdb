This is just one more of these horrible films that you find on TV forever showing the abundant behavior of some lousy women in a sympathetic way. Along with the nasty films such as "The Burning Bed," "Enough," or "Monster," this movie takes a lousy criminals and attempts to show the viewer why it's not like a bad person after all. Give us a break! Here's my question of the filmmakers: If LeTourneau was a man, and Vili was a 12 year old girl, would you make a picture sympathetic and impatient with this person? Answer: Hell no. <br /> Imagine changing the sisters in this movie, and then you will see just why myself and others here consider this a worthless piece of waste. Their sex has changed, there would be no attempt to empathize with the criminal. Instead, we would be very likely to be treated in a portrayal of a monstrous and horrible man preying on a young girl, his lascivious behavior landed in prison, and targeted his steam brain to suffer from Stockholm Syndrome. The only reason LeTourneau does not receive the same treatment in this film is not virtue of her sex. Let's call a spade a spade. LeTourneau is a pediatrician. Plain and simple. Not if ifs, ands or buts. It is a criminal who belongs to jail, and deserves our humiliation and contempt, but certainly not our pity or sympathy.
