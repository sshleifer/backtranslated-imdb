As there was nothing wrong with the act etc. the writing for the episode is way for this Phantom series or no phantom. It was a waste of 42 minutes to see hunter in those Martian people. You must know that in the midst of the 6th series no matter what happens it is not true what will be over and really brings nothing to the story of the series except meeting the hunter man Martian again and in 30 minute trash Do this by far another case of bad writing of the soap opera in smallville. I really love to show mostly from the cast and episodes of 3 or so good every year, but who ever on the writing cast that works or use to work on the soaps need to be in boxes. This was by far one of the worst. And in the first four minutes you know that what is going on is bogus and anything happens is a dream based on Clark's coverage obviously caused by a Phantom area character and when it wakes it will win with blah blah blah so the writers do not have to really create a cruel that will progress the story line anyhow this week. May as well have added another villain to die in the recent episode of hunter's man Martian was in and made him fly away again or come back and tell Clark he forgot his sunglasses to get a closer look as in this episode and call it a day.
