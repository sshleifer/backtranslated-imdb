Unfortunately, I do not remember the book again, but I remember that I was captivated by the stories of Edgar Wallace. This film represents a typical German production of low quality. It does not keep my attention - although the story itself is good, it's just badly adabted. In the center of misery the characters are overly simplified and exaggerated - they have no nuances of performance. Even well known and loved by the German actors Joachim Fuchsberger and Eddy Can not save this poor spectacle. However there is hope ... I said that these films are getting better and better. So, in the conclusion I must say that this movie does not deserve the cinema screen, but may be enough for a lazy afternoon.
