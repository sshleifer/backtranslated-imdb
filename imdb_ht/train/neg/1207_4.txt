Kim Kim Basinger stars as Della, a desperate housewife with a bit abusive husband, who gets into trouble while reading from the local mall to make some last-minute Christmas shopping. After he had completed a scratching note scratching on a piece of paper and sticking hard paper to the car in a car that had taken two parking spaces, he found out the owners of the car are the Rainbow coilition of the bandits comprising a white guy, a Mexican, a Chinese guy & a black. They confront it on the note, a secure security cap, and the chase is over. During the course of the film Della will go for hunting hunters as she unleashes Bronson inside her. <br /> I found this to be a little bit thrilling tension. The act was good enough (except for a few scenes, "why God why" the bit of crite deserved of its bad thing though) came out undone somewhat due to the sheer fact that the bandits Della chases from / after they are self-numbingly stupid. If they did not have the intelligence of any given "Home alone" baddie, perhaps eventually defeat would be something tastes instead of the reaction he remembers. The uncertainty factor I want to neglect as both the director & one of the producers was part of bringing "shoot em up" to the screen (a movie that while throwing credibility out the window was incredibly fun). This film while never reaching the height of this film, was good in her own right. <br /> <br /> My Class: C Anchor Bay DVD Extras: Commentary and Writer / Director Susan Montford and Producer Don Murphy; a 25 and a half minutes 'Make-of'; a trailer & two tv spot for this movie; and Low Learning Trailers
