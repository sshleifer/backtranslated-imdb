By far the most important requirement for any film compressor film is that they must, at least occasionally, be able to pull one on us, as well as dumb-witted marks, cops, mobs and (ideally) one and other. But this movie never pulls this. Every scam can be seen coming a thousand cuts (especially the biggen!) Nor are they very interesting, complicated or sophisticated. Perhaps Mammet was expected to compensate for this and snappy dialogue with complex psychological relationships. If so, it fails. The lines are well, but they are delivered in a style that is stylish, abnormal, stylized way that I thought maybe some clever point has been done on us all acting all the time ... but it was not. As for the psychological complexity, the main character of a bit scolding and doing some ridiculous was forced to sneak froyally about his father thinking he was a whore, but he came over it. I really liked the street scene though. Look just like a Edward Hopper painting.
