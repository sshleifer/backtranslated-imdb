This film has successfully proven what we all already know, which professional basketball player sucks in everything besides playing ball baskets. Especially rapping and acting. I can not even begin to describe how bad this movie is. First of all, is it just me, or is that the ugliest kid you've ever seen? I mean, her teeth can be used as a case-box. Second, why would a genius want to pursue a career in the music industry when, even though it has magic power, it sank horribly in making music? Third, I read the Bible. In no way or shape he said that Jesus did engineering. Fourth, what was the deal with all the terrible scare effects? I assure you that any teenager Nerdy acne-addled and a computer can do better effects than that. Fifth, why did she end up so much sucking? And what hell is a gin? And finally, people who created the nightmare known as Kazaam need to be thrown off in a plane and on the Eiffel Tower, because this movie takes the word "suck" at a totally new level.
