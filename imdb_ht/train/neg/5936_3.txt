This film was a disaster since it began to end. Interspersed and performance from "the next generation of lovely losers" are interviewed with Bono and the Edge as well as the top performers. This leaves little time for the clips of Leonard Cohen himself, who is forced on everyone else in the movie and his captain yet gentle presence, wisdom and humor. The rest are too busy trying to harass her as St. Leonard or as some Old Testament prophets. Many of the performances are forgettable over-interpretation (especially Rufus & Marta Wainright's) or afar under-achievement. Only animals Orton and Anthony have reached the hit distance of Leonard's own version using a little constraint. An annotated little pseudo-avant-garde gesture is poured into films like from superimpositions in red spheres on many of the concerts and interviews, unstable work camera disorder, using digital delays on some of Leonard Cohen's comments hard to hear what they said) and a spooky, pretentious drone low under a lot of the interview segments (an attempt to add gravitas?). For the real thing, look at the songs from the life of documentary produced by the BBC in 1988.
