Thomas Clay was mixed with bad quality. This is the problem with young people these days, they have no respect. Seriously this film should be avoided at all costs. The action of the main body of the film is slow and rather stodgy and endanger the drug ending as if, as its director, it has no better place to go. We present to the main head character that is a bit of an outsider, we see him in school and at home not quite tight in, feeling left in mind as many teenagers do. Robert falls in with bad boys and begins to miss school and take drugs and before knowing it is a psychic violence. The movie is really about Clay's total failure to understand the link between violent and violent acts. Clay seems to think that a generation of crazy teens has done wrong by the scene of war on our television. yet he filmed the most disgusting piece of simulating violence. Is this guy real? <br /> <br /> If Clay did not see YouTube maybe it is naive and ignorant of them going to do with the bigger brutal scene from his movie? Everyone who wants to see is the most horrible scene at the end of the film and I'm sure that will be the stick with people. The rest of the film is pointed out to committing such acts as a Clay film violence not only destroys young people who are actively engaged in preventing war, it also damages itself as committing extremists, government violence for no better reason than his own personal celebrity status. <br /> <br /> Shame on all involved.
