The only value of this film is basically laughing at how bad it really is. and a scheme that makes your average middle school writer look good, and acting that is almost as good, he gets my score underneath me. one of Tom's very early film movie where he obviously did not have the pleasure to be real serious. The best special effects of the film consist of a guy dressed in an incredibly fake humming monster.
