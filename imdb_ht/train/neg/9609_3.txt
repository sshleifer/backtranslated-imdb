I started watching this film awaiting some hilabe barman tolerable Hammer horror movie ... and I was not far off. There is a fair amount of slippery slide, and is thrown into lots of stripping, but the half part of the film presents a few ironic twists. Holy cows, actually put a little thought into the story, and did not completely fall into predictable things one expected at the start. And dare I say, some of the "gratuitous" nuts were not so gratuitous after all, because it fit into with the story and environment. <br /> <br /> Do not get me wrong, it's still in general a bad movie, but as bad movie going, it's a smarter more smart than TRALLY horrific terrible as Mesa's Lost Girl and Monster Robot.
