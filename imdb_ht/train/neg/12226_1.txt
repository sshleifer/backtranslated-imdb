I know, I know, "Plan 9 out of outer space" is the worst movie, or perhaps "Manos, but in fate." But I can not find work on these socks-monkey movies. In * course * are bad. How could anyone be good? But if you're talking about movies and respectable production and bankable talent, the T. rex of all turkeys has to be "Yentl." All phoniness of treacly, all self-absorbed immune, that sticks everything Barbra Streisand has done since 1964, reaching her accumulation of this film. From its solitude summit in terrible, "Yentl" looks back at "A Star-Made" and forward to the "Mirror has two faces." There is nothing else like it. Emotional escort steals Streisand from doing this movie I would rather not speculate, and what audience he played I can not possibly imagine, although I'll bet there being a nine in ten luck or not a member of it. /> <br /> Nobel Prize-winner and saintly guardian of Yiddish literature Isaac Bashevis Singer was so outraged by what Streisand did in his story that he dried up in public for her. It's a tribute to the impenetrable vulgar Stirland that he not only did not commit suicide, but went on making more horrible films.
