I really wanted to like this, but in the end it's a bad movie made and laughs too few. <br /> <br /> The politics will spot him, it will offend the hell from republicans but that's what it's designed to do. That alone gives me reason to chuckle. <br /> <br /> The problem is, it looks like it's done in a real rush (like about a week). And it has a stupid subplot on some boomers singer, which seems to be completely on topic. Turiqistan is obviously Iraq, or Afghanistan, or any other number in the US has f ** ked and since the 50s. The humorous humor is a dark (amputees dancing and prosthetic legs made by Tamerlane society) but it is on the mark, especially with the cashing corporations on the reconstruction ("loyalty democracy!"). However, a lot of satir criticized US There, it looks terribly heavy and work. I guess it runs contrary to many propagating bs so it has bludgeon people on the top to make a point. What knows. I prefer more of a little, wink approach - a bit of finerness. But that's just me. <br /> <br /> Anyway I could watch it again, maybe I missed something. <br /> I hope "W" is more on the mark.
