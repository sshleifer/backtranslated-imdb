This has to be one of the worst movies of all time. The graphics were horrendous, the act was b-movie and the effects were just plain Nintendo 64 skilled. You would think that they would put a little more effort into it. Of course, it's a scifi channel movie so you have to expect it to be low rates, but this one takes the cake. Hell, I'm still laughing. So, as a shake-up of unbelievable films, this one does well. Though it seems some known actors and actresses in this, it's hard for me to believe that they did not realize that the quality of this film was worth their time and effort. <br /> <br /> Graphics might be good at the '60 or even '70's, but come on, this is 2009! I'll give out, out there just to say that if you played "Jurassic Park" on the Nintendo 64 you will be very familiar with what you see in this movie <br /> It is definitely not worth the 2 hours it took they sit in the stuff
