This movie was the most painful. Sitting in the theater for x amount of minutes, I asked when the movie was going to start. All configurations have been in place; Typical love stories, characters have overcome the short-givings, the wicked have emerged, but none of it ever initiated. Since these things happened, I had already been bored and sturdy devices were completely effective. At the scene that urged tremendous tension and support, it felt like the necessary frames were cut. Things the child does not have to do this way. Children's films can be as steady and engaging as adults. The excuse, "hey, it's for kids," is bull. I'll take the "sword of the rock" any day. This was terrible. I'm getting to feel that Disney will be wearing these days. And as for the 10-year-old, I've seen this and will agree ... most waste.
