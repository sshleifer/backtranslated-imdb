I like silent films, but this was a little too moronic. As many as I wish I could say that it was worth the hour I stood up I could not. I do not think any version of the movie even comes close to the book. And do not try it out on kids, they might be wild. And the lady who played Pollyanna, how was she? 38? I know that the work laws have been different then ... but come on people.
