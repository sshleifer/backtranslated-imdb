This unwanted film is non-existent (aesthetically and sexually) establishment that apparently can not withstand romantic fondness. Although some excellent players take part, including Jon Tenney, Timoth√©e Olyphant, and Cynthia Nixon, they are based on a perfect script that depends almost entirely on smart dialogue; that is not. Nixon's role possesses the best line, but often it's home to too fast, a distortion that should be sealed on the director. The grotesque point of view uses every cliche that is available, spends or not, and fittingly finishes the drab attempt in comedy.
