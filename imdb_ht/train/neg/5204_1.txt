"Man trigger" is definitely the most boring and silliest movie I've ever seen in my life. My aunt's day history is more fascinating. The actors seem to be recruited at uglypeople.com. They have no talent to act in a compelling way. <br /> They walk and walk through the jungle. There are more walking-around than all three parts of the "Lord of the Rings" together. After the first hour, I started reading a Porsche brochure while watching "Trigger Man" on the road. Mad. <br /> A total waste of time and money. I would give that movie 0 stars out of 10, since this is not possible, I have to give 1 star.
