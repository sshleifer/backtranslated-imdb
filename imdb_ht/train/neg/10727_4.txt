The movie is worth watching only if you stop it after half an hour. It starts with comical conversation in a bar and makes one expect a good story, funny is coming. Well, I can tell you it will not come. It will deteriorate within minutes of a movie that challenges your patience as well as your feelings of shame for the actors in an extended manner that you will probably not be happy to witness. <br /> In an interview I heard that the director wanted to express in this film the feeling of a loss of identity that, according to him, the majority of the people in this globalized globalization experience. I was surprised to hear that. Am I living in the same world he lives in? OK a lot of people walk around the same clothes as I listen and listen to the music and all, but that does not make me feel like I lose my identity. What do Khrzhanosvky think, that we are no more than the clothes we wear and the movies we watch? Did I see or do it? <br /> <br /> Well my vote: The good start of the movie saved it from getting a 1, a decent 4 is my conclusion.
