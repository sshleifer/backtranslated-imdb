This poor excuse for an amateur showcase show in Sundance is a great example of evil and most filmmakers independent these days. <br /> <br /> First of all, there's such a thing as the art of cinema. Just picking up a 16mm camera and displaying it to anyone who has a line not made for a real movie. <br /> I think we should consider ourselves the director's director did not pick up someone's camcorder ... <br /> <br /> Secondly, independent films are supposed to be real people. There is nothing real in this film. None of the characters come across even being human remotely. <br /> <br /> What they come across as is figment of the imagination of a writer trying to impress her buddies by showing them how "cool and fun" it is. <br /> <br /> What's left is a couple of bad movies that somehow did its way to Sundance. Difficult to believe that this was one of the best films films ... <br /> <br /> In any case, it was my release that resided in my respect for the Sundance brand.
