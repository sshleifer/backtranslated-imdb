I can find very little to say about this movie. I'm sure the idea and script look good on paper but the film and act I'm scared is not the standards I'd expect from some very talented people. I would doubt that this very feature of CV Filmography. Michael Caine appears in wood at times in his role as the doctor, and in no time did I actually believe in his character. The plot was incredibly specifically about the victims' children. Some of the scenes were very reminiscent of other films, which at times I wonder if it was actually a word of parole. The lighting at times darkened and this added to the feeling watching a low budget film and some big stars called, wondering why I was bothered to watch it at all.
