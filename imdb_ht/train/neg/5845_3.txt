Well after watching this I can say that it is not the worst movie ever to make, yes as there is worse than that, some good movie points, you get to watch teens drinkers, They have horrible deaths, and nice looking rats eat some science experiments, and get great grotesquely, Jano to drink, the mad doctor, and yes a girl in thong panties that are absolutely no shame, mute, jocks, i could'nt personally wait for the rat to eat those fools on, I was rooting for the time rats to nurture, having a good quote, the first part of the film, was interesting though with the scientific explanation on the rats, and little back story, but I think it loses when the drunken teenage teens play horny, the rat in my opinion, the one who gets lost, his name is Brenda, they were so much Fake, they were to be a cGi rat, looked like a guy dressed in a beaver suit, this was very schlocky, lame, but not totally horrible,
