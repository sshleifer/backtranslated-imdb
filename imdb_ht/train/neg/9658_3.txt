My God, an incredible movie! Remind me much of the same scenes in the movie Mel Gibson's "We Soldiers" when "The company does not lose, they're just off" And the other scene at Pearl Harbor when the British officer says Ben Affleck "If all Americans like you, then help the nation go to war with America! <br /> Put all 3 cinemas together, and you would have enough BULLSHIT manure all the Sahara Desert. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The story of the off-off battalion can be real enough, but the film might have been done without any geographic propaganda of Indian geography. It had sneaky acoustics in the cinema during the above scene mentioned in Pearl Harbor (no kidding either) The lost battalion however is really in a class of its own. <br /> <br /> "American thinking are unbeatable ?? inspire brave ??. "I'm actually cringed and damn near puked in all swill being spewed out of every disaster of the diarrhea (the movie is) <br /> <br /> The fight scenes were well done (3 stars for that) but if the script is manure, then wrap even in bright colored ribbons, it still manure .The developer, James Carabatsos, also wrote these other screamers .. Hamburger Hill, No Mercy, Ravine Heartbreak. Someone, please shoot him before he writes any more trash. <br /> <br /> The director, Russell Mulcahy is also an Australian.
