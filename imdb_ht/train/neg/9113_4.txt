They had the potential for this film and they completely fell flat. At first, the evil intentions, we left wondering what motivated the lead characters to become the way and acting their way. There is almost NO character development whatsoever in this prequel. It's actually a very sad story but this film was nothing to me. It was as if they had left good writing in place in f-words. And the end makes absolutely no sense and does not explain anything. Writing this was just awful. Another thing that bothered me was being used to lease 3 in the exact same lines that were in the original. Like "down boy", or scenes of kissing, and some others I can not remember. I was not impressed by Robin's act, but Amy did a great job. That's about the only thing that reconciles this movie.
