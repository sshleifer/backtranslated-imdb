Woody Allen lost his ability to write dialogue or character that clearly distinguishes one another. This is the case with "Melinda and Melinda," where all the characters speak with generic pseudo-sophisticated generic and have problems with lifestyles that are not relevant to anyone outside of a four-block block where Allen lives. They also share the same curious condition that they can afford multi-million dollar Manhattan apartments that appear to have been made by professional decorators regardless of financial status or what they do for a living. Character exiting outside of this dull attitude is Will Ferrel as the mandatory Woody Allen surrogate. Although it does not simply come in as simply making an impression of Woody Allen (like Kenneth Branagh of the God-awful "Celebrity"), Ferrel misses the charm or charisma that the real Woody had when he played the part himself her best movie. The end result is another of a top-notch headlong string from a once-great singer who was trading in on his former reputation for years.
