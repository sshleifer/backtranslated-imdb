I am 17, and I still love most of the Scooby Doo movies and the old episodes. I love the 1990 cinema, and recently we were treated to one of the best DVD DVD scooby DVDs in this decade, Scooby Doo and the Goblin King, which I was not expected to be as good as it was. Anyway, go back to get a clue! I watched some episodes, expecting something very good, but in what I saw in it, I was not impressed at all. First of all, I hated the animation. It was flat, deflated and many Saturday-morning-standard, the easiest aspect of the series. Even some shows I really hate there was a little better animation. Even worse, Shaggy and Scooby looked like aliens, and I really missed Fred, Velma and Daphne, as they added a lot of the old episodes, when Scooby Doo was positively good. I also hated the character changes, because it seemed like instead of solving mystery, Shaggy and Scooby were now playing superhero, something they would never have done in the movies or in the Scooby-Doo place are you? show. The theme tune was not very good either, I can not even remember it, and the jokes were lame and flawless. Even though I acknowledge that there is a very talented voice cast, they have better material, and have not said sounds different sounds and their original voice as human beings, which they did, could I add. In conclusion, I personally thought it was awful, and I did not try to discredit it, it's what I personally feel. 1/10 Bethany Cox
