I saw this film a long time ago ... Luckily it was for free. I have to be one of perhaps twenty people who saw this movie in the theater. I do not remember a whole bunch of it, but I remember I was incredibly bored, the plot did not have sense and when I came from the theater the only thing i could say was at least now i know what is worst The movie I've ever seen. I just was incredibly harassed by one thing: if they can make the temperature as they approach the sun low enough for people to survive, why they can not turn it down to a comfortable temperature rather than being all hot and sweaty ? How stupid they think we are?
