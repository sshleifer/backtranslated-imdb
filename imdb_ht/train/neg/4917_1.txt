**** WARNING **** <br /> Absolutely without a doubt, one of the funniest comedy ever created for the screen. Totally impossible to take any of this seriously. It would take a bigger novel to list all the comedy routines in it. During his glorious day's day, Carol Burnett and company, who often took-offs on film, skewered this one in ways that were hard to imagine. Carol played Jenny who suddenly became ill and only a slight cough and immediately the music treacly came and everyone looked around asking where he came in. Harvey Korman has played Oliver and floating locks and almost looked like Ryan O'Neal. The only thing funnier than this bit, is the real movie. <br /> <br /> What a Death Scene to the End. Jenny really looks like she's dead Well ... dead for her make-up artist come in and give her a little color. And of course, we all know how often hospitals encourage someone you love to get in bed with them during the final patient's time. The scene ends with Ryan O'Neal sitting on a bench in the snow to contemplate his future in the movie business is an instant classic. He was very worried about. It has never been recovered.
