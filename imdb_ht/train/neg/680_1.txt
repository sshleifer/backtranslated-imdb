I finally hold up to "Starlight" last night on TV and all I can say is. . . wow! It's hard to know where to start - the extremely special Hokey effects (check out the laser beams to shoot from Willie's eyes!), The acting atrophy, the ponderous dialogue, the use of mismatched in stock stock, or the time of ceremonial ceremony inflict all production. That's truly a one-of-a-kind experience, and we all would be grateful for that. I named Jonathon Kay as the true heir of Ed Wood!
