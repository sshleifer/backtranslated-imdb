He used to be thinking of movies that required plots, or some other means of care at all on the story line or anything going on. This movie showed me that you do not actually have something like that. <br /> I could sum it up simply like that. But IMDb wants me to have more lines. It was kind of beautiful. not compelling in the slightest. The way the characters speak in the movie make you think it should take place on a matter of days, but there is no passage in time and I'm pretty sure it's all happening in an hour. If you are looking to entertain yourself, then buy a gallon of milk and see how fast you can drink it before you send them. It would be a far better time to use your time. Time that you will never get back. Jurassic Park 3 has pulled in better than this movie.
