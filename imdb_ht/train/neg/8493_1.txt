Many days after seeing Ada's concept, I'm still trembling that any group of people would spend a lot of time doing this at a movie. No one should see this film in hopes of learning anything about the consequences of Ada Lovelock, colleagues or products of his or her initiative. <br /> Similarly, no one should see this movie hoping to be entertained. <br /> As a sci-fi movie, this would definitely be a lurid failure. Somehow, the main character managed to bring the past of life and interact with it on his personal computers - with the advice and words encouraged Timothy Leary. I doubt anyone can stop their disbelief enough to keep this from absolute looks absolutely. As a movie drama, this would definitely be a lurid failure. Somehow, the writer / director managed to complete eighty-five minutes and constant, unnecessary, annoying and trivial drama essentially nothing. I doubt anyone can feel that all the drama in the movie serves only as a disappointing distraction. <br /> I find it hard to fully express the degree I despise to consume Ada. The circumstances under which I saw it prevent me from leaving the theater but there is no question that I would have otherwise. I'm still angry that I wasted time that he had taken to see her. Only that I could more effectively criticize this movie, I wish I was more articulate.
