There is a reason why certain films go straight to video and of course the obvious reason is that if it's too naughty for theater theaters then release straight into video. Of course it really should not just be the good films and yet they're released straight into video. This one is not an exception although the film has good actors or at least actors and potentials: Amy Adams (Oscar nominated and talented actress), Robin Dunne who deserves better or at least a better agent, and Sarah Thompson who deserves the role that a departure from teen melodrama. The film is also denied: this movie takes place before evil intentions so that movie is actually a prequel and rather stupid. This was a litter and really it's a movie that's in the same level as soft core porn and pay-per-view movie masturbation. Fortunately for the actors, hopefully they will be able to delete this from the summaries. So, if you are looking to see something naughty, but no courage to buy porn then rent this movie as a starter.
