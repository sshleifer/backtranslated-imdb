There is nothing unique in either the TV series nor the movie. Which is a prequel for the TV show, which does not find anywhere else in life and entertainment. Both before David Lynches disgusting style in history tell, and after. <br /> <br /> From the moment the body of a poorly dummy girl washed up on the beach. And they were introduced to some of the most idea of ​​immortal shadow embryo corruption in the Twin Twins. <br /> <br /> For the Mind to empathize nearly pedophile ways the lousy movie looks romantic to say in the destruction of a human life in some random psychedelic phenomena in the Twin Peak movie: Fire comes up with me. I saw it all just to make sure I was missing anything. I did not. It is simply one obvious obvious sexual fetish on long series insulted by a ridiculous movie pornographic film. Save yourself to the agony of suspicion and look at anything else that at least has the ability to tell a story, rather then seduce you into some kind of mental panties. <br /> I heard many reviews, annuities and rave about how great David Lynch. Because of its ability to define misery and tragedy and to make it to some kind of wonderful. This is not imitate life imitating, as it is some twisted twisted version of art to make its best to inspire whole mindless life. <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor and avoid this waste.
