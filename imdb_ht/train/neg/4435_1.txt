God, I have not watched a movie this horrible for a long time. Perhaps not since the 'New Guy' or various Freddie Prinze Jr. movies. Yes, it is amazing. The empty and wooden miraculous Miravino Miravem miracles must have been inspired by Freddie. The film movie was left (like a game, rather, and the feeling of incubation does not work well on film). The actors had no idea what they were doing, especially Sorvino. Accidentally it was terrible and her non-existent sex appeal here so it was painful to see 'seduce' other characters and 'fall' for it. And what were the occaisional shots at a live audience in lawn chairs? Nonsensical! I had to turn the DVD player, it would be an independent painter for finishing this movie.
