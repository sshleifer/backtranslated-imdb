How Irish critics detached from this film is beyond me. Achieved by the usual band of Irish actors drag out for every Irish movie. Terrible script, and character character forcing (brown brush). Romanticising all evil about Dublin. The attitude of 'ah, it's a dump but sure it's not it all the same'. Many tidbits are purely for American audiences (the supermarket boss and collectors are forced to force it). And the nail in the coffin was Colm Meaney's character. A great actor was forced to play that part of the case that had been written by a five-year-old. Things to Do ... The best thing about this movie is Farrell, and it's a bad when you said that. Well, at least he did not put on his terrific American accent. International audiences must warn: stay at home and watch Snatch and Lock Stock. You will have a better time. Intermediate is a walk-out
