I still find it difficult to understand that a movie like this kind could have occurred in Hollywood. Acting with the story is simply pathetic & the direction is terrible. I do not see any logic behind this garbage except that the director has nothing good to do. I took my ten minutes to realize that I was wasting my precious thirty precious dreams. It filled me with dismay that I went to waste some more time in my life on this crap. I bet was the movie made in less than a day. I do not know which category it falls off. Please avoid this movie at all expenses, just do anything, even bang your head against walls but do not go for this movie.
