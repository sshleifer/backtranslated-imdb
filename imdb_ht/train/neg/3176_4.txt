The Lovely Eva Longoria Parker plays Kate, who died after an ice angel breaks it before the "I do" and Henry Henry (Paul Rudd). After two years Henry has yet to move with his sister Chloe (Lindsay Sloane) very concerned. Chloe arranges Henry to speak with an attracted psychic Ashley (Lake Bell). Ashley is contacting Kate's spirit hoping to help Henry get over with his life. When the psychic starts getting attracted to Henry, Kate's ghost appears in the nip romance of the bud. There are some funny situations; but if you saw the trailer you saw substance in the movie. Also at Throw: Stephen Root, Jason Biggs, William Morgan Sheppard and Wendi McLendon-Covey. I personally thought Bell had stolen the show from Parker. And Biggs as usual a pain in the butt. Always this movie was over-hyped.
