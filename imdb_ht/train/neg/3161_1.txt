Many of his "body dead" are so unfunny that I was actually squirming in my chair out of embarrassment for the actors. Eva Longoria proves that she can not carry a movie in this romantic comedy, and more, that she does not really even have any comedy distribution. It's grateful and annoying as a ghost that returns to the ground to keep a psychic cookie out of his deceased widow's date. The folklore plays by Paul Rudd, drippy and charmless, while the psychic is played by Lake Bell, bringing the film to any energy enrichment. I felt much sorry for Bell, as it seems to have some funny abilities and was working extra in an effort to perform the material. Unfortunately, it is against the insurmountable work of making any movie that features Jason Biggs tolerable, and it is dragged down with the rest of the cast like Leo DiCaprio at the end of "Titanic." <br /> <br /> "On her body" actually most ** ed my cut, because of her laziness and lack of utterance in effort. I started thinking of all the interesting projects that can not be funded because the vast amount of money was funneled in crap crap like this. Seriously, does Hollywood think movies like this is good enough? How stupid are they really thinking of the movie-gone public? <br /> <br /> Grade: F
