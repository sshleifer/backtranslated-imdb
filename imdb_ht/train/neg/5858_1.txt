This was the money allocated to the fans as the "winner" match between the two separate companies (World Wrestling Federation and the Alliance): a former WCW supplement and ECW superstar.Because of the final match The company's duplicate company was a tag-team match, the wrists were imprisoned to send opponents from each side of the ring to another; each writer concluded that in order to debate their opponents and intensify the match, Every wrestler simply pummels an opponent and punch, explains a special move, and tags to a partner. The story has already been truncated by the subterfuge of Vince that a member of the Allance would be fradilane and join the WWF. It was obvious, with the statement that the WWF would have: but very innovative scenarios but poor execution, which is not missed in the wrists because the match format is tag-team. The matches are just rioting: <br /> Edge against T is: potent "big boot" does not test, but this did not show the actual talent in t or two stars <br /> <br /> Al Snow versus Christian: matching good but superflous pay-per-<br /> <br >> Taji against William Regal: The worst match of the night <br /> <br /> Iminite Battle Royal: This was a pretty beautiful match to watch, but because the main stars of both companies participated in the main event, only a wrèstler is characterized by "heat "and it is probably a Lightweight Lightweight WCW (ie Hurricane is merely hired as an attorney) <br /> <br /> Hardy Boyz Versus Dudley Boyz: Best Match at Midnight: Jeff Hardy executes a" Swanton bomb "at the summit in a cage and in a wooden table and Matt was hatched in the cage, which appeared to be very painful. <br /> <br /> Because Cold Stone was champion of WWF, Rob Van Dam was the hardcore champion, and Kurt Angle was a "mol" of the alliance, all the main stars of the main event on the faction of the "Alliance "They were awarded work after the match, except for Booker T., who recently attacked a" raw "wrèstler and will inevitably be given work. Shane McMahon will return to TV somehow, and everyone wants to witness the fall and break into the "Alliance" to see Cold Stone from work. The WFF did better. A match in which all the inclinations were brought to one faction would be better, and what ever became Casket and Iron Man matches?
