This film is about British prisoners of war from World War II escaped from a camp in Germany. <br /> I get "Wooden Horse" disgusting boring. The subject could be thrilling, thrilling and adrenaline fueled, but the "wooden horse" said in a very clear way. It is a collection of eventful and evil events said, with no suspension and thrill. The first half clearly tells how the prisoners of war dug a tunnel, but the events are so plain, and not fortunately enough and shaves close to me on the edge. Half of the film in the movie is even worse, they are just moving from one place to another without any cats and chasing mice. And their character could be a bit less and they have more action in a movie action! I'm disappointed by the "Wooden Horse", it wasted the potential to be a great movie.
