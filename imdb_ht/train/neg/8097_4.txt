It is weakened by unimaginably embarrassing, three-dimensional characters that you would never want to have at the meeting in real life .. <br /> I have no big fans in the novel (I started reading it once, but he was not able to finish it because he was not empathy to me but it's obvious to me that people who made the novel consider this movie to be a complete travesti. <br /> I have never seen many talented actors doing hard work to give a movie below the average few of the quality and weaknesses.
