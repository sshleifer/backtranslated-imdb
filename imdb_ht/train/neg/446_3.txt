This was disappointing. It started quite well, but as it went on losing all the opportunity to soar, it fell flat. Actress Maria Schrader is pressed, never seems to mean what she says, or even knows what she says until she says it. He showed no genuine emotions at all, not for his beloved Goy, or his mother's story. When and Lena seemed to have little more than an academic interest in Lena's story. Never seemed to be a real relationship between Lena and her mother except her mother seemed to be having a good time at the wedding, which is not much. The parallellic assumption between Hannah's "mix" romance and her mother's relationship with her father was as clich√© as they came, and failed miserably anyway. The wedding was completely compelling with a mute finish. The highest point of the protest was uninspiring, and no matter what Lena had or had not influenced the result, it would have shown some complexity of feeling at the moment, a haunting look, an inexplicable ambivalent. In fact, none of the characters in the movie was any depth or spark. It was very difficult to care about any of them, even little Ruth. Everything and Luis were a distraction. (Why was it so ten when the phone came out of the hotel? There was no context or explanation whatsoever.) If each reference was removed, it would not be noticeable. A simple story was confusing by the development of poor characters (which had mothers, yet?) Weak acting, and directing everyone to look like they did. You could almost hear "quiet about the series!" I started thinking this was worth for a 7, but as the movie went on it fell rapidly to a 4, then earned a 3 after silliness at the wedding scene. This was about as cold and sterile a movie as I saw. A terrible waste in a good story.
