I just could not stop laughing! This movie is incredibly funny and stupid! But never mind that, it's very fun! In this movie, you do not have to pay attention to anything! Acting is the same - LAME! Dinosaurs are the same - RUBBER (Oh, I could see the wood that holds T-Rex for a moment.) The raptors are the same thing from the Carnosaur 2, T-Rex is also the same, but ... in some scenes itself looks like stuffy and looks like some kind of project failure in kindergarten. Action is fast, sometimes too fast, actually I talk about quick editing, to modify it so fast, so we can not see the rubber dinosaur, but OOPPS! late, tire! Well, things are interesting here is to see Rick Dean at this end. <br /> <br /> What can I say ... do not rent it ... watch it on TV, and friends, it is more fun!
