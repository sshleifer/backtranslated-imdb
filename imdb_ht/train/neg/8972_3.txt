<br /> <br /> The main question I ask about this movie is, how do you film a cole porter music and only use 3 of her 15 songs! Merman and Lahr have played the lead roles on broadway, here are replaced by the slower red skelton and lucille ball. Draw drawings have a lot of fun and fun. <br /> <br /> SKIP IT.
