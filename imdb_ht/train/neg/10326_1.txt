Again Canadians TV outdoes itself and creates another show that will go prosperously after its premiere episode. <br /> <br /> The last time I remember sitcom was supposed to provoke our reaction to street business business. How funny is it to beat the stereotype of all white people thinking that all Muslims are terrorists? OK maybe one joke just sticking it to the masses. But by 30 minutes. He called to beat a dead horse. Even SNL would know that after a commercial break. <br /> <br /> Also, let's have a little controversy in these scripts. Will he or she will not be able to serve sandwich cucumbers breaking the fast over Ramadan? When does Ramadan begin? Ohhhhh this is Emmy there's something here. <br /> <br /> And the characters! Which character? All cut-out boxes are anything interesting to let us want to follow them out of a situation in the next. This is the point in the comedy situation. We need to have strong, interesting, dynamic characters so that we are constantly drawn to the TV set weekly. We need care about these characters to worry about what problems they will get next week. If I have never seen these characters it will be too early. Fortunately, I can not remember any of the names (CBC score - that's not a good sign). And the action is so bland. It's more of a problem in casting than the actors. None of these people actually embody the characters to play. They just seem to act their parties as if they were working on a movie of the week. Sitcoms asks for actors who live and breathe that character - let's fall in love with them - where they become inseparable from the show character. Look at any American sitcom and you will see how easy to identify characters. Part of the problem is that the actors seem to treat this project as if it could be a major platform and better thing instead of being the one great characters a life for whom they will spend the next 8 years portray. This level of interest in the characters and the project shows. But to be honest, consider the concept of lame and the horrific writing, there's not much for the actors to do but tell the lines and try not to hit any furniture. As another comment mentions, this looks like a movie movie and it's not a sitkon. <br /> When the LED's or the lack of it! What can I say, Canada has a lot of talent, look at what the comedy chain is doing with puppets that kill and hollow. Look at the boys Trailer Park (not the movie causes it bit of the big helium dog). Look at any American show to see our potential talent as this much place in our stars are going to get decent jobs. <br /> <br /> Give CBC's credit, they really know how to build ads for a non-event event. Remember the "One"? No - well do not even try to learn any character names of this show, as it is sure to go through the road in the dodo. <br /> Let's hope for an ACTRA strike full blow so that nothing like this results from the Ceeb for a long time.
