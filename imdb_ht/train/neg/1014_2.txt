Timberlake's performance almost made the screen attack. It was not all bad, I just think the role of reporter was wrong for her. <br /> <br /> LL Cool J played the role of typical recall, hardest, baddest guy around. I do not think that split a smile in the entire movie, not even when proposed to his girlfriend. Morgan Freeman pretty much brought the entire movie. It has some funny scenes that are high in the movie. Kevin Spacey was not good or bad he was just "there". In general it is a dull film. bad draw. a lot of bad actions or bad actions for actors.
