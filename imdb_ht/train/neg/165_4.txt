While it is early to say how the series will evolve, I can say that the pilot was less than I thought it would be. There is still potential for the series, however. Of course when I first saw Voyager I thought it was potential, too - but it was gravely disappointed. My gut tells me Enterprise will not be as bad as Voyager, however. <br /> As for the impressions of the pilot ... <br /> <br /> The pilot had some good ideas and good terms. I like the introduction. Crediting opening shows were interesting, with the progress of exploration and a fitting theme song. Scott Bakula is excellent in the role of captain. <br /> Where it fell short for me was largely that the story was missing the "feeling" of putting out on a grand adventure. The plot of the episode itself was more a "generic" story trek and the themes of "exploration" and "first step towards space" simply subplot and subtext. Have you edited out the references of this to the first deep space mission, the scheme would be difficult to differentiate between the eras of Enterprise, TOS or TNG. The central scheme did not reflect or do justice to the grand theme of the series. <br /> <br /> The plot at the launch of the first mission would be Grand enough without the "action". Instead of isolating references to the newness of exploration, they could have been the story. Get a little more nostalgic and philosophical about it (oh, for a TV show that once again would make us think). Let's feel the excitement of the "wind" and were on the "sea" instead of distracting us with a rescue and a plethora of gunplay. There was too much gunplayable way. <br /> We felt more that people were "freshmen" at an established school. New kids on the block, as opposed to the advantage of a widely unknown universe. Unfortunately, the Klingons landed on our front door rather than found them. This meeting was far more historic and far more sociological. Just how do these two different corporations communicate? Do not just hint about it, show it! <br /> I was thinking of reading more as `wagons and a wired crew with limited technology 'as opposed to the' brave stages of the unknown '. I wanted to see something newer and fresher. The series promises to have a new concept but so far I have not seen this new, great concept. I will conclude and repeat the feeling that the series has potential. There are some interesting characters. Bakula is wonderful. Blalock has potential. The overall theme is the most interesting since we first saw Kirk in a world before Apollo 11. If only the future episodes can do justice to this grand and beautiful theme, we'll have a show that will create new legends. /> You shoot an arrow in the air ... Good luck. Captain. <br /> <br /> For the producers: take more RISK and make US * think *! :-)
