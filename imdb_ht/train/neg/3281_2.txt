I suspected the film was going to be bad. I'm Duke's Duke from way back. Have three years in the TV series on DVD. Well I was fine. Take the family to see it. I really wanted to see jumps in general again and some of the jumping scenes scenes were good. But her sum up, the movie was a dumbed down tear version up in the TV show. Jessica Simpson was pathetic. While I can honestly say that Daisy's original team was just as unmistakable, Jessica Simpson's interpretation of Daisy was simply awful. Sorrel Booke and Denver Pyle must also roll in their graves. <br /> Do not waste your money. If you are an old tried and true fan dukes like me and my three kids you will be very disappointed.
