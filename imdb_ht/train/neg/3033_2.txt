I'm a big fan of Jenna Jameson, but this movie is terrible. At that time Jenna Jameson was married to Brad Armstrong and she was the director of this movie and Jenna was the hottest porn star ever. So, of course, Brad tried to make as much money as he could cut him by making this huge pornographic movie movie. Now I know why they do not make big pornographic porn movies anymore. In a fantasy world, porn stars can act, but this is the real world and can not act. That's why porn star, if a woman as beautiful as Jenna could act, then she'd tried to go to independent movies instead of pornography. Just because nice you do not make a movie star. A wonderful example of this is Traci Lords, when she was a teenager to her 20 she was one of the most beautiful, sexy women on Earth. He made his movie low budget low and could not act. Where is it now? I gave her a 2 instead of a 1 rating just because Jenna is so hot, but there is the best movie she did then "dream quest". Come on Jenna, we do not want to hear you speak, as much as we want to see you have sex. Also, you Jenna, would have a lot more fans and more money in your bank account if you would have made anal on film.
