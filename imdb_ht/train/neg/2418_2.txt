The first mistake you make in the title of a movie is to use "in the living dead" without really having a budget for real FX zombies. Sure, this was a very low zombie flashlight - really low budget. I thought it was a movie school project. Amateur amateur and amateur effect. He really is not too bad to consider above, and it presents an exciting twist of the zombie genre. If you get an "R" for violence, you might as well give us some good shots from the bearded beards. Women were so little used in this film that she could almost be classified as "gay interest." And I stayed in Oakland. There was a heck of a lot of shoots going on and no cops in sight!
