One of these documentaries is Thank-God-I-Do not-Live. This one says in two factions of war in Colombia, guerrillas and paramilitaries, and the people that surround them in Medellin. <br /> <br /> Guns, drugs and death are running rampant. The guys, no more than 22, are not in the midst of fighting a war in jail. The Girls ?? not women, girls ?? always react similarly when one of them dies, with tears and screaming. You scratch yourself; what are they hoping, really? I do not know what's more disturbing: allegedly shoot-outs and civil unrest, or that everyone just seems passive to accept things as they are. Or, seeing that boy drinks what is obviously not his first beer, are all that, 10? If you took any of these young men out of their situation and placed them somewhere where they had the opportunity to do more, more, how much would choose not to stay? This documentary, all, I'm scared.
