Most of the French films I've seen - and enjoy - were more talkative than actions, but that's okay. I found them interesting, well photographic and with intriguing actresses. (However, I made a surprising point if Gerald Depardieu was in French movie ever! It seemed that way.) This movie has the same visuals and has a good opening. But then she came to talk, talk and more talk ... that's fine for a drama, but not for a mystery mystery. After some time, I almost fell asleep. Actually, the movie was more like a play and almost all the scenes were played out of one room. So, if you like to play, you would like this ... but I want a little more bang for a murder story.
