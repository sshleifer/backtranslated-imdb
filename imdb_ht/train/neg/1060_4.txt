OK, so it was written in 1996, before 9/11, so you can give it a little credit for worrying about terrorists and ideas that the CIA director makes a plot blow to this airplane driving air before it carries bankruptcy in the world, is prescient. That's it. That's the good thing. Act ... just. The plot ... funny. The "twist" is necessary. DOOOOOOOOOOM It's not as if anyone has ever thought of what to do when an aircraft gets contaminated. Do you think that bureaucrats have a manual for "calamity" and how are they included? The good execution of such a plan is always a problem, as we saw after Katrina. But they have a plan. It does not send them to Iceland and then to Mauritania. But if the virus is brought in the air, why was the open air door and the "shooters" standing there without protection? In fact, has he ever reached anyone who shot his legs? That would stop it. But not as dramatic I'm a sucker I still watch a movie to see in the end, once I started it. But this was a waste of time, and for the most part, predictable. I saw it using an archive so I did not have to watch all the ads, which was a plus. It's a good example of why I watch TV for little.
