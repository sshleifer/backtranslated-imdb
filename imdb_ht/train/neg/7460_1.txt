Corky Romano has to be one of the most daring and awful players of the "comedy" ever performed. While sometimes entertaining Chris Kattan's pulling on a very funny performance at the hilarious 'Undercover' hilarious character in Corky is so stupid and so unfunny-that's a shame since the quote is a wonderful idea. Bad they ran out of when they reached page 3 on the script.
