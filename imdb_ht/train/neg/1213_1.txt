I can not believe the likes of Guillermo del Toro and Kim Bassinger were involved in this piece of waste! The script is so poorly written and directly weak (both by ones) who are hard to find more one-dimensional character in a movie. Dialogues are so lame this so-called ludicrous laughs from the few fools who entered the theater. The configuration it's tough, inviting you to believe you will watch a chilling thriller and suddenly it turns out to be the most stupid movie of the movie. Bassinger's character is so dumb, that he actually stopped calling for God "Where You Are!" so the people after it can follow, and then take a sink !!!! Then it apparently went into the smallest wood in the world, I mean, it runs all over the place and the killers never drop traces of it, and this happens in the night. It really makes me wonder, is that really those who write best in Hollywood can find that they spend millions of products.
