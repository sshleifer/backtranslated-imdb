A real blow-up of the movie literally. This British movie is buzzing. <br /> What an interesting plot! A terrorist puts bombs on a train. How could the writers and producers of this stinker turn this into this dull story? <br /> <br /> Glenn Ford, as the expert called on broadcasting the bomb, provided terrible writing materials to work with. Of course, as she's called, his wife, Anne Vernon, is about to leave her. No wonder we have never heard about Miss Vernon. And then a movie, it would be enough to finish his career .. That elderly person who liked to train and interfere is our 1953 version of senile dementia. I thought it was very insulting to show the man, even in the end.
