This movie is NOT funny - like a garbage of big stars, which seem to keep that in their own memory. Only bright moments belong to John Cleese as the hotel manager who likes to dress up - you almost dropped out of your chair and laughed discreetly when she danced to "Summer Girl" Donna Summer while wearing high heels, a pure clothes and a beautiful hat. The Rest: IT'S PERFECT!
