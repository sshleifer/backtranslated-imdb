This youthful, swollen border is strictly for adult in old mens body, desperate to revere hormonal years of teens. How? Do not burn gas with a fast, reckless vehicle (or aircraft) machine and freedom. The heavy lending scheme in the Mister Rogers' neighborhood (if he had run me an oil conglomerate) and the Run Logan (if he was sedated heavily and lacked a clear sense of style). <br /> Start Lee Major and Burgess Meredith This movie is set in a post-fuel-crisis world in which an all-powerful government does not want you (* ahem *) to drive your car and burn fuel. Signs of the opposite of Enron-and-Bush today, oil grabbing, SUV-pushing the government. <br /> <br /> This juxtaposition alone makes the movie sad. But wait ... there is more. Although the film puts in the future, we are not showing any signs of future technology, beyond a return of bicycles, golf bikes and horses. You will believe that the future looks like ... exactly like today. Even clothes, even suburban, even green lawns like today and when they made the movie. There are no solar panels, no windmills, no concessions for alternating energy. The act is flat and tasty. Even the scenes that could be frustrating or moving, friends-flick, honor, romance, horror ... all flatter than a paper doll under a briefcase. <br /> <br /> Continuity is missing - the flying jet of Burgess Meredith character has changed color and configuration from time to time as the filmmakers insult our intelligence and stock footage unmatched again and again. The plot is as mortal and only half as interesting as a masterpiece of Hazzard Episode. <br /> Even the dead-hard machine-movie and SF fans should avoid this movie like Roadkill-months old, unless you enjoy winning Exxon executives trying to make a movie as empty as the hero's fuel tank.
