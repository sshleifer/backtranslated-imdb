I'm watching this on the sci-fi channel now. It's so awful I can not stop watching it! I'm a videographer and this movie makes me sad. I feel bad for anyone associated with this movie. Some of the camera works are good. Most are very skeptical. Some decent actors in the fiction. Too bad are surrounded by what belonged to the principal. That's the only way they got to be in a movie! Music was a little better than the act. If you get around to watch this I hope it's because there was absolutely no other option! The end (yes end) will come over now .... I think I'll skip it!
