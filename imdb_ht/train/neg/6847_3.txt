This movie was a movie I wanted to watch always when it came to Promos being grabbed and Govinda in a negative role was a surprise <br /> But the movie is not that good <br /> It has lots of flaws <br /> The beginning is good and until the whole thing goes well but the film falls flat when the romance track begins between Govinda and Karisma and the songs that follow <br /> <br /> then twist What about Govinda and Tabu being in love left more doubt and imperfections and then how Govinda became a wealthy criminal out of a poor village? The last flashback is also extended and the whole conflict between Govinda-Karisma and Tabu N Chandra disappears Music is Ok, Bahot Khoobsurat stands out Govinda trying a negative role and doing so much well in it though it's too much of it Karisma times is good but irritated at times with it weeping Tabu is okay Nirmal Pandey still does not know the difference between loud screaming and acting again
