Once upon a time there was a science fiction author named H. Beam Piper who wrote a classic book called "Little Soft" on which a man discovered a race of adorable little humanoid humor on another planet. Mr. Piper died in 1964, but Hollywood and many of today's authors start looting his grave before his body was cold. This is the book where they received the idea for the Ewoks. <br /> <br /> Skullduggery is like a blatant ripoff of "soft" I can ask why I'm the only one ever remake? <br /> <But do not take my word for it. Here's a link to Guntenberg project where you can download a "soft" copy for free: http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18137
