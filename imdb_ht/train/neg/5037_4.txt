Draw = Melissa is a new girl in town, it's fifteen years old and her birthday will come in a week. Since Melissa is beautiful, all boys in town want to hang up with him, but some of that manage to catch his interest mysteriously dead. To be honest the real reason I wanted to watch this movie is because Dana Kimmel on Friday 13 pt of 3 was at it which is not a good reason why they ran out and saw a movie. When I started watching it I realized that "Sweet Sixteen" is not a very good slasher, it's really dull and boring and just does not go anywhere. After more than an hour, only three murderers were born and the story was not really developed in any way possible. The film is nicely drawn and beautifully generated and well-directed, but as with many other slasher flicks from the 80s, the film suffers from being too dark at times. The act is actually pretty good though with Melissa's character is easy to sympathize with, even if it's a complete supplement. <br /> <br /> The story line is not completely garbage but it's just way too dirty to keep you interested, the only things that keep me interested was Melissa's been stunning with Dana Kimmel that's really sweet and beautiful in this movie. <br /> All of the wireless slasher flashlights that do not go anywhere I would definitely wantn not recommend it to slasher fans.
