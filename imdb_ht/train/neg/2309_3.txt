I have a high tolerance for the weird, but honestly some movies go way, way beyond strangely - so far that they make your brain hurt. This is like a movie. Try to understand it or even explain it impossible and I think the movie is best understood while taking drugs - it's incomprehensible. The movie begins with some very beautiful Japanese animation involving a cat. However, out of the blue, tons of braided and occasionally disturbing things happened - to make me wonder if I lost something in the translation. However, though this is so, why do we need to be treated in images of a magic trick that includes delimiting a lady with a clever, defective, puking, animal lighting on fire, etc. All this really looks random and pretty horrible. Strange, and I do not know why, some see this as a work of genius. I just do not get that.
