First I'd like to apologize my wrong English. <br /> I'm not a HOSTEL-hardcore-fan, but I liked that movie anyway. Live feed, however, great blockbuster time! I never saw a gore-movie and superb act, but hey, who's surprised? Acting in Live Feed was ... well, no! I have seen some commenting this as being a school project or something. Okey, but not by students in the media or in school. This was no class at all! And what about the story? A really sad rip-off on hostels. And what about the Gore? What about the psychopathy torture scenes that suppose your courage and leave you cold-sweat? That was the most disappointing about the movie movie! Short, quick and NO corner. More like a execution rather than a torture. Well, there are buckets where blood, but it did not even look real. The meat and the violence remind more of Braindead than hostels or any of the Saw-Movies. And Braindead was fun! Well, I laughed at Live Feed a couple of times, but that was more out of deception than out of absolute fun! <br /> So, instead of wasting 80 minutes by watching Live Feed, look everything else!
