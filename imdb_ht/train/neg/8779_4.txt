As a Cinema White Fan fan was a complete disappointment, as a movie theater was very good, nicely lit, good camera work, reasonable direction. But as a movie it just seamed as predictable as all other 'so-called' horror movies that the market has recently been flooded with. Although he had a little bit of the 'frost factor' of the whole concept of E.V.O (electronic voice phenomenon) didnot seems credible. This film did not explain the reasons for some events but went ahead with them. The act was far from mind blowing the main character describing no emotions, like many movie cinemas / films recent. <br /> <br /> Definitely not a movie I'll buy on DVD and would not recommend anyone to rush out to see it.
