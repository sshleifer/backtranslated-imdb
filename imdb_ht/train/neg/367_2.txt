A boy comes in a lot of money and promptly starts to live up. Unfortunately, the man with his money really is happening very bad. He wants to rob him back. When he discovers who has the bucks, he begins to try to get it back. It continues to be moved by this little kid who is just lucky enough to hold from falling into the hands of the evil man. Sound familiar, I'll bet. Very predictable, not interesting at all. Come up with something a bit different, ok guy?
