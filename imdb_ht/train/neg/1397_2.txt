Let's see, here is the "turnkey" of the brain machine: 15 established vaccine in a pool and a house; 15 establish vaccines in an independent office building; 5 countdowns by a bold technician; 7 shut-ups of an ominous guard; With a myriad of tutorial the techniques show us this is a high-tech experience. <br /> <br /> Various posters have commented on the difference between the copyright date in 1972 and the release date given on the DVD box in 1977. This is an easy to explain. This dog simply sits on the unreleased shelf for five years, until someone lifts it off, thinks it fit perfectly with the Watergate posture attitudes of distrust of the government. After seeing Brain Machine now, my only wonder is that it ever was released at all!
