This movie really shows its age. The print I've seen was terrible due to age, but it is possible that there are better prints out there. However, that was not the biggest problem with the movie. The problem was that although the film was made in 1933, it was essentially a silent film and only the barest of spreading dialogues (only a few sentences) in the most amateur movie of fashion. Sometimes back characters are turned or they are talking with their hands on the faces - all in a pathetic darkness of their mouths and "cleaverly" (?) Hide the fact that the film was armed. Well, it's true this Czech film would need to be armed in many languages, but to make it that way was really stupid and obvious. It just looks cheap. <br /> Overall, the film looked budgetary and funny. It's really a shame though, because there was a tablet in a good story - a young woman who married an older man who is either gay and / or has no interest in women. But in the 21st century, some would really want to sit in this reactionary mess. BEFORE with some glimpses at all (and a bit bulky) Hedy Lamarr, it's not worth the fuss that accompanies the movie when it debuted. Even by 1933 standards, this film was a sick dude. On the only interesting thing about the movie is to see how different Lamarr looks in 1933 compared to the Hollywood glamorous image created when it comes to America - it looks like 2 completely different people. Incomplete looking and technically inferior film, I do not see how it has reviews of these reviews. For technical problems alone, the movie can not miss a 10 or something close to it.
