This may be based on historic events, and we know that the television makers of this television take liberty to make it more dramatic - I can live with that - but it was just so badly done! I was amazed at the event of a mid-day crisis when everyone was calm, surely someone would have panic, and what a smooth flight, no apparent passionate discomfort - come on! Not sure about the rules, nowadays some of the security stuffs seem like OTT nonsense, but why take your shoes before the emergency landing, common sense tells me this is not a good idea! The massive airliner vaccine that came down on this remote aircraft was compelling and fake. In fact it would be a fabulous eye to see in the nearby soil, in this film it was out of proportion and look like the model probably was. Escaping slides have appeared at the front door and in the middle of the emergency, but nobody has appeared at the front, though the drop was much less. The Captain returned to the plane after the landing - why? that has never been explained. We know the emergency landing was due to being fueled, but even so had to sloshing gas around at the bottom of the tanks, and the risk of explosion was to be a very real danger, but the evacuation was looks almost leisurely, and everyone stands around at the foot of the slides to escape instead of becoming as far as possible, as I am sure I would do. There were just too many inconsistencies, errors and fake actions in this. I would rather have seen a representation of the drama in real time, and the realistic movement of the aircraft described. It has the potential to be quite thrilling, but undoubtedly due to the budget restrictions fails, and made one feel that an aircraft lost all the engine had no big deal really, and you would safely slip down in a bit in a bumpy landing, but there is no real danger! - The fact of course being a bit different!
