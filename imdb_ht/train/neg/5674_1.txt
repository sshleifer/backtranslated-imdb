My God, what's going on? a Boll Uwe movie with positive comments? Wow! <br /> Nice note that most of the positive reviews come from Boll's newbies to work. I, as I stated in the previous Uwe Boll review, just watch her movie in the hope that one day she will actually do a good thing. I mean ... I have to spend a day! <br /> <br /> Alas, Seeds are not that day. I do not quite know where to start with the lame attempt of a horror movie that seeds are. The thing to remember is that all the sick in the world are this way because they watch various acts of illness on video or the net ..... or so Mr Boll believes. I still can not for my life to figure out why footage of real animal abuse and killings was needed in the first 10 minutes of this film. I understand the concept that the crab (killer) is a sick and enjoy watching things ..... but he can not understand why Mr Boll thought to put REAL foot into the movie would work. Maybe our shock? Hmmm ..... well, for one I do not squeeze and can handle anything on the movie. I DO NOT, though, get used to the real bugs of funny animals in the slightest. If you tried to hit me, he did not work. She just reminded me of how messed up the world was because things happened and also because Uwe Boll allowed them to continue filming. This sort of context may have worked for the 70/80's film (Holocaust Cannibalism), but not today's market. <br /> <br /> And from the road, we can move on to the fact that Uwe has managed to give the film a very cheap feel all round like BloodRayne 2. You can just say that was not an amount Big money floating around for production. As usual, Mr Boll does not really care for making a decent story as we treat boring shots at police officers watching videos of War's victims in the first 25 minutes. Each of these videos ends at a speed decomposition up to the victim. It's all pretty boring and tiring. I will not comment on the childhood scene as it is ridiculous and just another cheap 'trauma' factor. <br /> <br /> If you manage to sit in the first 25 mins then you will be treated to police officers walking in a very dark home in order to catch seeds. The illumination here is terrible and Uwe has the old 'I do not use a fixed fiasco' that he did with BloodRayne 2. Look as police officers are dying of all time sensitive to increasing ways until points such as Seed Hold. This scene is soooo stupid you have to see it in believing it. The cop actually tells Seeds he could shoot him. For some reason not-known, the cop does not shoot him. Given that Seed is a disease that kills children as well as adults, you would have thought at this point in the script that essence would dominate. <br /> <br /> From here we are treated in a stupid execution scene, followed by the cops to bury the seeds alive (and they know it is alive..why do not shoot it in the head ??? ?), followed by pills getting out of the ground and then killing some random women with a hammer and then kidnapping the one of the cop's family. <br /> What I'm trying to get through you all here is that it's just plain STUPID! It's not even Hollywood horror stupid .... just plain mute. Uwe Boll can not rule ****. Anyone who has any flavor ounce would agree with this statement. Anyone who watched this movie and found it fun in any form or shape needed to take a serious look at themselves as someone. <br /> <br /> Once again we are treated to a wrong act, directing, lighting, producing, scripted pieces of UB crap.
