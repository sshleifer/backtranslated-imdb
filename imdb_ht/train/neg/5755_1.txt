I saw this movie in New York's New York Film Festival screening as well and I must say that I found it a complete and terrible one. Although it was funny in some places, the only real laugh was that there appeared to be real real plots to talk about and the act in some places was trembling and wooden, especially the "Lovely Lady" and the voice of the narrator ( whom I have never heard of) was a lot to be desired. J.C.Mac was, I felt, the buyer feature of this movie, true actions and gravel and (from the cast) only the real act. I'm sure with another throw and a tightening rule over the LED, this could be a decent half film. Let's just hope that it does not send out on general release, or if you really want a copy, look at the bin bin in Lidl.
