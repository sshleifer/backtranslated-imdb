I've seen 200 movies a year both in theater and at home and I can say with confidence that this film is by far the worst I've seen this year (If not ever, however I have not actually seen "Quest of the Delta Knights" again). This movie is just a joke after bad joke geared in the 13 year old and because I have read annoyances to look at it on a bus trip I can not walk out. <br /> Do yourself a favor and jump this one to the lease. The four dollars could be better spent on any movie by the number produced by Jerry Bruckheimer.
