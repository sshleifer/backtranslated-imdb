Oh, this movie ever bites! If you've never been afraid to see a rehash of the slasher genre, make as cheap as possible and as prudent at the same time (PC-friendly, means no stripping, a classic element of slasher flap) Cut is it . Each cliche is retread without a hint of self-esteem and act. Oh, act to redefine the word horror. I should have known the best Dutch translation of the title would blow me up.
