When children memory tells you this was an awesome movie; it's to touch and go if you should review it. Anyway, I remember a scary scene involving a homeless person and a cool villain played by Jeff Kober. <br /> <br /> The "First Power" is not a very good movie, sad to say. It's full of shock copies and a very poor script and holes a truck can drive in (with many "twists" practices that help the story run together). Heavy Diamond Phillips is the over-trusted cop that bad ass throwing baddie Kober's bloodshed in the gas chamber only to find out he was a minion of Satan himself and now the power of resurrection along with the power possesses each person weak weakness that it comes across. Through the mix a very poorly realized Psychic helps with the case. <br /> Ahhh, this is garbage. But enjoyable as such, especially if you have fond memories of it. She scared me like a kid with this scene and the homeless people are still pretty good. As for any kind of logic here; Remember, just about every scenario is thrown in for good measure and you end up with a cross between a Steven section action flick and a 70-demon cops. And what about the world thought it was a good idea to throw Lou Diamond Phillips into the lead here? Needless to say, it's not convincing at all, but it's trying its best and I've never had the problem with the many guys review here seems to be. As for Tracy Griffith as Psychic, the less said the best. But Kober is very good as the killer; always loves the actor. <br /> <br /> The "First Power" can be just what the doctor ordered after a hard day work with a "brain switch-off" needed. Beer will most likely improve the look experience and I will definitely have loads of it the future I give this movie a turn. All in all; not a good movie but a fun little guilty for nostalgic fans who have been scared as children. "Look around you, boy boyfriend!"
