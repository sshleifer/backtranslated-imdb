'Omen 4: The Awakening' is an end to the TV for the original movie 'The Omen'. Instead of being a child's body, Satan owns a girl who has been adopted by wealthy parents, who is intimidated by the school and end up taking revenge against the wrongdoers. The film seems to struggle with any horror factor, and a lot of events happen to be simply funny rather than scary, and it's hard to believe that this girl is Satan, even with all the events surrounding her. I just did not get this movie very thrilling or scary, particularly when compared to the original.
