A rumor of Alejandro Amenabar to Abre los Ojos, but this time with a living, breathing mask as a lead. For the dubious advantage of an English sound track, we endure Tom Cruise's performance, as usual, with zero depth. Yes, the character is identified with its character, but we usually give some character under which keep our interest. Her empty epicurees negate any erotic energy that could be between her character and Cruz or Diaz. There is a current exercise involving using the free masks actor to enrich his presentation of verbal and body language meanings. Mask cruise is only painfully emphasizing its inability to act as an actor. Do you see the 1997 original Amenabar open your eyes!
