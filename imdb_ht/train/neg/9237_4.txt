Stalker is right! Girl sees guy, girl wants guys, girls convert mundane ways to bump into him, girl will not leave her alone, girl pretends to be a patient, girl can not stop talking about her, Girl pretends to love another guy (or two), she does not pay attention to her because she's annoying, STILL girl will not let her alone. Playing right, Drake's character was good, but it's completely, completely, unrelenting in his pursuit of Cary Grant's character, his girlfriend-in-cahoots is dull, and sadly, Drake's attempt to play, "charmingly screwball" come on like, demagogic disorder. "Grant is himself, as usual, which is fine for Cary but it's as close to a phone performance as I've ever seen from him. The direction is substandard and the dialogue is just plain tide. <Br / > <br /> Comedy Screwball is very difficult to accomplish and when it fails, as in this butcher-out butt in an attempt, it just feels. Worse still, Drake spends the movie all in need of a lot of Valium with a restrictive order. It smashes any humor found in this colder than mummy dust mummy.
