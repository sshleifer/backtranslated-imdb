This film was worth five punches on "my hurter card". I saw this while stationed in Virginia in the middle of the '70. I saw her alone so I did not distract while I watched her. She asks. It was the most ridiculous, total garbage of seluloid I've ever seen. <br /> I know that others who have reviewed this movie thought he was scared. I offer you this: if it was so scary that it was in the box office taken? End of discussion.
