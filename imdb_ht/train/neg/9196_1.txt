This is one of the worst movies I've seen. The only positive thing I can say is that it was so bad that it seemed funny. First, there is no scheme. The actors seem to be reading cops and doing things dumbest. As being chased by dead people yet again want to go out and look for their friends. Also zombies were awful, there is no place near as fun as any of Romero's works, who gets s plug in the movie. And the dumbest part of all kept flash show in the video game in the action sequences. As we do not find the video game is about shooting zombies. Also, all the 20 sometings some know how to use automatic weapons and hit a target without even targeting the weapon. And the way people die so stupid. It's like running from ammo so standing around waiting to be flying over. But when the front edge of the house runs out of ammunition instead of shooting the door open, so dumb. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> and a second chance. Definitely the worst movie I've seen over the years. A b-movie about cinemax is better.
