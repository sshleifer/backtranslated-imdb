I went to a visit to one of my relatives shortly back, and we were pioneered by a theater, so we would think we would go in and give this movie a go. What a mistake! This film is awful in every department. I would never have heard of the movie before, and literally everyone still does not have. No wonder, this is as rank as it gets. It's a comedy, so he says, the only thing funny is the ability, or lack of it, to the director to make such a movie. When you are near Christmas, it should be titled how to cook a turkey in almost one and a half hours - or however time it was, as I walked out. At the end of the movie, you'll come out feeling as if you were eating poisoned on a sick turkey, and sorry to waste your time on these dribble. Who knows why things get done. Some people walked out of the theater before the film was well over, and I blame myself for not walking out a lot earlier. It really annoys me that you pay good money to see something decent, and all you out and see is a poor TV movie that should show at 2 o'clock in the morning, in fact, it's bad, TV time TV should not show it. What else can a say ... probably not enough bad word can do it justice.
