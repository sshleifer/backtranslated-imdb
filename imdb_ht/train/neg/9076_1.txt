This was surely the bra, fraud, the most repulsive film I've seen in some time. I was tempted to close the VCR, but, as in the passion watching a terrible car accident, I literally found it controversial in every way miserable and slugged it from the end. I do not mean a pride that objects in the acting painter of sexual antics on the screen. Animal House, Porky, There's Something About Mary, both American Pie Cinema, and even the notorious Freddy got Fingered I found very enjoyable on their own little bit themes. Mamie Van Doren in bath bath baths is the most terrible appearance by a naked geriatric since the shining. Editedly edited with injection, and incredibly annoying performance from Devon Sawa and Jason Schwartzman, the film ended without the benefit of making me giggle once. The only useful purpose for the movie is such a book example of how to make a gross photo out. Oh, and it would also be nicely used as a lawn fertilizer.
