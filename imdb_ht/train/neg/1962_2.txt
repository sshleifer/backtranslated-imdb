The only thing scary about this movie is to think that anyone doing it would make an end. <br /> At start to finish "Fairy tooth" was just downright horrible. It seemed like a movie that has been acting badly confused, with a wizard of "Wizard of Oz" melting with joy kiddies ending combining with some bad and swearing effects. <br /> <br /> Half of the throw seems completely unnecessary except for a good that they have to get killed in some fashion. The sister of the two brothers, Cherise reader of Aura and Mrs. McDonald has absolutely no point in the movie - they might have included them in the main scheme for some interesting side story, but apparently could not be bothered. People are watching the movie knowing their characters for some hundred deaths, but coming on, at least TRY and having a slight conspiracy. The overall story is weak and irregular behavior from the characters that make you want them all to find food in the witch. <br /> Adding the weak and weak plot to act together (the kids are particularly wild) and film completes a complete failure. If only MST3K may have had a go to this one ...
