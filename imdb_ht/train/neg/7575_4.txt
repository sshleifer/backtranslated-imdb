A diplomat retired, playing nicely by Michael York, going to Russia to get revenge on the Russian criminal who killed the son of the diplomat. The diplomat has met a Russian and exceptionally strong and decent cop that helps him bring the Gangster Russian justice. <br /> I remember the old flicks action in the 1980s that still show the Russians as bad guys out to undermine the U.S. government. It is interesting to see this time the Russian guy as a hero. <br /> Not a big flick, it's really a typical "B" action flick. Michael York borrows some classes in this movie for some reason. Alexander Nevsky, who plays the Russian cop is the kind of "blah" but amazing has some chemistry with Michael York. Facing her, Michael York is such a good actor that he would have chemistry with anyone who is doing a scene with them. Absolute, adorable Paul Adrian was killed in the first 15 minutes of the movie. Now, if Adrian Paul was in this film again, it would have been an average higher than "B" action flick. All I can say about Adrian Paul is that it is real nice to look in for the first 15 minutes of the movie. The villain, played by Richard Tyson, is typical of your bad guy. She is very blond and very wicked in this movie. <br /> <br /> Rent this flicker if there is nothing else on TV to watch. It's okay. It does not suck too bad. Scenes of the decent actions. The act might be best, the plot could have moved much faster, but hey, you get to see what Russia looks like today!
