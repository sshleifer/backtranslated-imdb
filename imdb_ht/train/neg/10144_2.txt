As Steven Segal movies goes one this is down in the barrel. Better it was just fodder for teens bored. One this advice balance, then falls on. Characters are all cartons. The story is double lame. I can not spoil it by telling you the end. You already know how all Steven Segal's movie ends when you saw one. Here's gone. He is a super-dooper government agent who knows too much to turn loose to decide, instead of killing him, to dye his brain until he does not remember squat. He escapes, of course, gets arrested and is sitting in his old age in need of one person in a million dollar experience to get back a stealthy plane that was released on a terrorist gang of Afghanistan by a rogue Air Force pilot , surprise, surprise, Segal trained. All heroes, except Segal's character and his domestic girlfriend, died heroically and Steve-Baby saved the whole world in one swollen drink, or dropped swoop. Whatever. Made with some Air Force surplus and marine flying film. With a lot of boom-boom. Get some Popeye designs instead.
