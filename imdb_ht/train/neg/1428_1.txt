Although this movie was performed before Dogme emerged as the dominant method of film, and previous digital triumph over - strike. You get the point. This 1991 chief clearly anticipates these developments. Corin Nemec is just as outstanding as the ne'er does well to author and narrator. The speed is slow but chic, because the cinematography is so beautiful. Write it the next time on T.V., because I guarantee you will never see a better nostalgia rip-off make-to-t.V. movie. Direct-to-video never feels good!
