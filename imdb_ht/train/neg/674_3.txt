I knew they fell asleep during film, but this is usually due to a combination of things that include, really tired, being warm and comfortable on the plain and having just eating so much. However on this occasion I fell asleep because the movie was garbage. Development scheme was constant. Constantly slow and boring. Things seemed to happen, but with no explanation of what caused them or why. I admit, I might have missed part of the movie, but I watched the majority of it and everything just seemed to come to its own agreement without any real concern for anything else. I can not recommend this movie all.
