Most of the episodes in Season 1 are awful .. There is no comparison in the Twilight Zone or Exterior Exterior, as they actually had decent history lines. Most of the amazing stories are quite dull ... not surprising of the less rent..go or buy the Twilight Zone series ... I've heard Season 2 in this series is better .. also for some reason on the DVD they cut out the Ray Walston parties that further reduced this compilation. One cool thing is to see actors and actresses when they were younger in 1985 ... Most of the story lines are very predictable even though the series could have been best with twists and turns that let you ask ...
