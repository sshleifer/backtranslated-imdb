Major Payne was really not very good at all. Despite being funny here and there, the story was ridiculous and the act was poor. Great Payne's voice and temperament were especially annoying. The idea was ridiculous to the things that the boys did in the movies were even more ridiculous. I would not recommend this movie to anyone.
