A great opportunity for Indy director to make an exciting movie about a rock musician on the brink of stars. He could have been a decent movie if he'd faced with John Livien's traumatic past and how he tortured his psyche. Instead, it is a ridiculous attempt to identify John Livien's life with John Lennon. The first hero of the suicide mother John Livien was John Lennon and wanted to become powerful and prolific as Lennon himself. Instead of focusing on John Lennon 's brilliant music, and his wonderful ability to make himself to others learn something about their own lives, he showed Lennon's legacy to be in a confused, drug addiction, which would must look upon as a god rather than a man. I'm a fan of John Lennon big and this movie reminds me of another "crazy" obsessed with Lennon, Lennon's assassin, Mark David Chapman. Lennon was a man who was brutally murdered by another person who had an identity crisis with Lennon. Do we need to remember that? John Lennon has given so much to the world with his music and honesty and I was repulsed to see another person affected, as the main character of this film obsessed by Lennon, and does not show his beautiful contribution to the world. Yoko Ono's memory of John Lennon's memory memory, by making the memorial in Central Park giving his fans a chance to pay their respect and remember John. Instead the director of this movie was chosen to use this site to have attempted suicide killers. I found this disturbing and disrespectful in Lennon's memory. He was a peacemaker who had been killed by a brutal death, and seeing such violence near this site felt like a review of a terrible injury to any Lennon fan. He lost the movie completely for me. He could be a decent movie, but he left me with a bitter taste in my mouth. Let John Lennon, with his family rest in peace and not be reminded of his vicious murder of this irresponsible film.
