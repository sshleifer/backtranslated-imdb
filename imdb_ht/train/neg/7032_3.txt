When Carol (Vanessa Hidalgo) starts looking into her brother's death, she begins to suspect something more disaster than "natural causes". The closer she gets to the truth, more of a threat she gets her sister-in-law, Fiona (Helga Line), and the rest of localists Satanists. They will do everything necessary to put a stop to its way. <br /> <br /> If you are in sleazy, satanic-themed movies, Black Candles have a lot to offer. The movie is full of lots of stripping and ritualist-soft-core sex. One of the particular scenes involving a young woman and a goat must see to be believing. Unfortunately, all sleaze in the world can not save Black Candles. Most of the movie is a total do. Other than the one scene I have already mentioned, the many sex scenes are not shocking and certainly are not sexy. The act is the best hole. Even the favorite Helga Line genre gives a disappointing performance. The plot really does not matter. Its main function seems to be keeping the string of mature sex scene together. I'm only familiar with another film directed by Jose Ramon Larraz. Compared to her daughter in darkness that masterfully combines erotic and horror, Black Candles come on as amateur. 3/10 is on the best I can do.
