Not one of Keaton's best efforts, this was perhaps a clear attempt to revenge himself on the family he married in - the Talmadges. A Polish Barrier / English and a series of co-sponsors led Buster to a wedding with a great Irish woman, who (along with her father and brother) treated her how to think she could be an heir to a fortune. Identity errors are many here - the gaps are set up, but for the main fail to pay. <br /> <br /> This brief metro has at least two real laughs - The cunning buster turns around its lack of dinner using the calendar on the wall and the basic ignorance of families adopting it literally bringing the meat into plates his. The other is a family photo, and the whole group slowly falls to the floor as the tripod to the camera loses its stability. <br /> <br /> Unleashed in yeast beer can be the catalyst for a massive set of gags built on the gags, but stops short (for the whole rally) in development. <br /> <br /> The printing of the cinema is dry and clear and the score is one for piano players, drums and sound effects. Not one of Buster's best efforts, but worth a few laughs.
