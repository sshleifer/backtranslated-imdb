First I liked this movie. It seemed to me a wonderful comedy and some funny moments. Albert Wolsky's designer costume made his best !!! Like wonderful decorations set Robert R. Benton - the man really had a very good taste !!! But the script writers are ashamed of me. The best finish would be the scene on the ladder, but instead of it, they decided that the father and his daughter would be together. Do not like the finish. The father becomes a companion of his own daughter and ex-wife who knows about it and finds it well. It would be OK, if the scriptwriters would for example say that now there is a different soul in the body, but they did not, they only prevent it from memory. The actors were good, they were really funny. Cybill Shepherd was good, Robert Downey Jr was very funny at the dance scene :))) ... Some of the times spoiled the same impression of good acting. For example, Corinne Jeffries, played by Cybill Shepherd after her husband's death was waiting for her 23 years (it's a long time!), She was true to her, she loved no one but her He met him and was just about making his love, after a scene with his friend Philip Train (Ryan O'Neal), it's very easy to betray the man he's craving for many years !!! It would be a good movie, if not the end and some human psychology missed.
