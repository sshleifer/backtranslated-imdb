Read on and take notes - you could save 88 minutes into your life (it was all!). <br /> <br /> Unremittingly weak, this movie sets out to produce (I guess) a modern small American Christmas fairy in the Capra style. If failed .... completely and absolutely failed. I was trying to think of one good thing about it and can not. Let me mention some of them ... <br /> <br /> People do not die, they are found to spend eternity as immigrant workers at Santa's factory. Angels are actually ancient cowboys sitting in the trees. Santa can bring people back from the dead (if you send him a nice letter). <br /> <br /> And the draw .. I will not spoil it for you, but there are some lights in the film if only in contrast with the darkness but no. Even photography is weak - snow shows at the end of a freeze, wherever cool, wet and miserable. <br /> <br /> As you might guess, the movie has a happy (schmaltzy) finish. What a relief!
