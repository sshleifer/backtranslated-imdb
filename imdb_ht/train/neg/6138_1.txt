This movie was God-terrible, from the conception of execution. The US needs to set up a "Star Wars" site in this remote country? This is their quotes? Access to the US, concludes, is to have an obstacle course like cross-country race, where the winner can ask for anything from the leader. And who is best to win this race known as the "game" than a gym? Of course! A gym would be the perfect choice for this mission. And remember that his father was an operational. Lucky for our heroes, have arrived to gym equipment in lucky spots, like the stone pommel horse in the middle of a square (for no reason) in the heart of crazy city. Do not do. <br /> But above and beyond terrible, horrifying sites, are the left fumblings of the romantic scenes, the Ninjas are obviously very depressed that only works seem to be holding a flag to point out the race, path and pi The worst point ever is. After winning the race, our hero puts the US government's will. And look, all of this effort was worth it, because the US gets its "Star Wars" site! Huzzah! WHAT THE TRIUMPHANT DOES? Wow. <br /> But still, being like a bad movie, it may be great fun to watch. The cover alone, depicting ninjas and machine guns, was enough to get me renting this movie. <br /> But if I ever went to meet Kurt Thomas (gymnast-star) in real life, I would probably kick him in the face after a double somersault with 2 1/2 twists of the layout position.
