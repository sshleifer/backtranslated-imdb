This was a disappointment - none of the nuances of the original. The brits just seem to be able to make a really skeptical movie with any of the over-the-top histrionics of the American version. The original series combines both creepy and intricate history of performance and great attention to lighting and environments. I watched the series many times and I'm still enthralled. <br /> <br /> Just another poor adaptation on the lines of the obnoxious adaptation of "Cracker". Get tuned to BBC America or BBC Canada and look for these fun as Wake the Dead, Spooks, Silent Witness, and Judge John Deed. See the original touching wrong, then look for "Wire in the Blood" for more of the truly understated, elegant performance of Robson Green. Hollywood needs to look at this actor!
