1st view 2/16/2002 - 4 out of 10 (Dir-Arne Glimcher): Mystery ?? / Thriller and too many twists to draw ridiculous. Although cast in many film talent is way too predictable and just downright to underestimate its audience. The public-looking movie is not stupid and I hope will not keep track of certain pockets again and again despite what they are involved with. We think that this movie will do something about Connery's conviction against Captain Capitol in the beginning but it turns out to be nothing but a standard, perfectly for the sake of hearing, running in the factory, not to never get it on with, thriller. We pull in all the funny changes of character, as they show us when needed in the story, and we're ready for this thing to be on the road before it's over. Yes, some good act here, especially in Blair Underwood, Fishburne, and Ed Harris in a psycho-supported role but the story does not work out at the beginning of the long-awaited end.
