Back in the 70's, when I first saw that, I was in high school. It was cool then. Now, as an adult I look after her and I say myself..yah right. What was so funny? He has moments but they are few and away from. It is so dated that the jokes do not stand up. Show this in a smaller crowd and will be totally lost. If you like this type of humor you may want to stick with Kentucky movie movie or Amazon women from the Moon. Vision tunnels as well as Groove tubes are too late to see today.
