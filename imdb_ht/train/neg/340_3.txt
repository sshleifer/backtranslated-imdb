I guess why this movie was doing well in box office is Eddie Murphy's course. I think this was his first movie since "Beverly Hills Cop" so at the time it was hot. Considering that one has done more than two hundred million and has been R and this one has made about 80 million dollars and has said it was not all that popular. I've never been a big fan of Eddie Murphy, so that's probably another reason I did not care for it much at all. This one has Eddie as some sort of Finding Lost Children. It must find children in gold or the world is in terrible danger. The plot is very bad, but as bad as it is it does not compare with the special effects. I saw the best thing to do in the 70's than some of this one offer, Ray Harryhausen did the best thing. Still the main reason you see a movie like this is because of Eddie, unfortunately, it's not very funny at this one at all and she just looks stupidly wearing it in "Raiders of the Kinds of Lost Boxes". I guess they were hoping for a fish out of the water, but I just did not work.
