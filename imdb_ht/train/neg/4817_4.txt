When you make a thriller on magic, I believe you should do everything you can to help the audience stop their disbelief in order for the movie to work. Some photos ("Baby Rosemary", for example) have accomplished this; Others (like "Necromancy") do not have and the potentially scary material comes across as meeting and jumps. This film has some atmospheric moments, but half of the dialogue is difficult to make out (sometimes it's wrong to write, at least just incomprehensible) and Orson Welles, who gets top bills, has a role that is so BENEATH you have to assume that she was desperate for the job. Or maybe she simply has fun ..... (* 1/2)
