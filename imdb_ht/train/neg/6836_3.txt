Please, even if you are in the worst of humor, avoid watching this flick of films. I do not think if anything was good with this movie at all. On the recommendation of a friend I watched this and I literally red 1h and 48 min in my life down the closet. Poor acts, stupid directions, weaknesses and sequential sequence sequences - and when you mix this together you get "Double Impact". Even the least of the expectations were not met. <br /> I think I've learned something - Never look Van Damme action flicks. They are most stored in time!
