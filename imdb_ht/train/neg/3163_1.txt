Well this is the first post ever to comment on IMDb., You get it, this movie brought me to come and warn all the good souls that will stop ever experimenting with movies. <br /> As most of them gave the comments I thought of watching this movie because it seems there are some decent actors (though it's the worst criticism of this movie) I thought of experiencing it It's supposed to be some flick of comedy movie., well it all began well with some ahem., komedi .... then it all started to go pathetic ... people you can believe in yourself, you wud feel like to go and hit yourself every and every woman in callers is the heroine of the movie made discouraged. ..Huh ~~ Well how much someone can dig a sick of all pessimistic witch somewhat ghostly trying to do everything he can to irritate you and stop you from what you are doing. <br /> <br /> What is the worst thing about the movie is, the "ZOMBIE" hero, yes as she looses her fiance he roams around like a goat, with black marks u nder her eyes., and sister "and very stupid the hero .. you wud must be bleeding from head to toe if you try and succeed by completely watching this movie ~!
