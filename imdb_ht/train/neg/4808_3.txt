Ok, I've seen lots of movies related to witches and the occult but this one was just plain weird. This movie starts out like this cult of witches led by a really bad Orson Wells playing the staring role (could not have someone who looked and act more like a Satanist) he just did not belong to the movie that's all. But whatever, the covenant takes a new member and sews a doll that looks like someone and has a miscarriage. The lady who had the miscarriage and her husband went to a place called Lillith on busess and the lady meanwhile sees an image of her sister or who she is calling her and her warning stay away from and never use the power it has or it will die. The couple after finding settlement in the strange town discovered that all the inhabitants are all witches and it becomes nostalgic and scared of all its neighbors and friends. Then strange things start to come as the lady discovers a funeral taking place on a mountain that suddenly disapear (that was to climb) as well as seeing the little boy belonging to Orson Wells in the playgroud that he later Ask the lady to help her bring back to life. The fast lady tries to escape the city, but only to find himself caught by his people and power and finds himself ignoring all the spirit trying to warn him about. This film is ok, it's the moment of suspense but it really could do better than they have the Orson.
