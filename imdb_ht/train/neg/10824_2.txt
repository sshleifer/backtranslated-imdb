This version is very aspid, I'm scared. Jane Eyre is one of my dear books and has been from childhood, but the other, the butcher Ariel William Hurt, is unsuitable in the bold passion of Edward Rochester and the poor Charlotte Gainsbrough looks like a bored, petulant teenager braces hurt at heart! I can not even think of eliminating the Great Edwardian wedding scene from the end of the book, one of the most moving moments in literature. I appreciate being finally used as a young, plain woman to play Jane, a character who is supposed to have an 18th world, but if you want to see a closer version of personality and passion in the novel, please see 70 versions and George C. Scott and Susannah York. York was too old, beautiful and beautiful to play Jane, but no one touched Rochester's character in the way Scott did.
