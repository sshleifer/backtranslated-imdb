Way back in 1967, a certain director had no idea about a galaxy, far or near. He tried to complete a movie with the THX title etc. This short story is a re-fabricated story of a certain George. I'm sorry he has only entity to defend it. This is merely an advertising promo for the director, actor, et. al. It had little intrinsic artistic value. It's a brochure. The George playing lead, very good, as is the Leia character, and the character Darth ersart. Everything else is plain plain plains. What a waste. Still, she got the job to make me guess. The rest of the film is simply treating water to kill my time guessing. a brochure only.
