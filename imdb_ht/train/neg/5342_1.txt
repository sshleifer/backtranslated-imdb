Rachel, Jo, Hannah, Tina, Bradley and John are all in the form here. They deserve Oscar nomination for their performance. I'm a big fan of the TV show aswell. Rock music and they all are so talented! I am also a great exponent of SARCASM !!!!!! <br /> <br /> IF YOU SUBMIT THIS INFORMATION CLUB THIS !!!!!! Their performance is very weak, the dialogue is terrible and jokes are not even executed properly (I feel sorry for the director). The jokes are so unbelievably bad that 8 little, club club fans did not laugh. They thought they could do it better. And they did. They conquer the world. They became S Juniors Club. Paul, the "fat, ugly one who started a lot of mosh" must thank the star of his luck that he left when he did. One of the worst movies ever made. THE FIRST PICTURE! Do not go and see it! YOU DO NOT PAP! You will be criticized! 0/10 RJT
