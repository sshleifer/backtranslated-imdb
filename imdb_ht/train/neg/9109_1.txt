The first cruel, original origin, is my favorite movie of all time. It was an absolute ruler. So, how the earth can do such a downright bad run. Sarah Michelle Gellar was perfect in the first movie. In this one, Amy Adams sucks. It is terrible. And could not have found a chick that actually looked like Sarah Michelle Gellar? At least the same hair color !!! I mean come. Robin Dunn is not as bad as Adams, but it is absolutely awful when compared with Ryan Phillipe. The Sebastian in the first film is devious, trumpet, and much worse than Sebastian's in the prequel. And what's up with the story line. It's basically going like this ... Sebastian has a bad reputation in his first school, so the movie says, although he mentions nothing about him, he's dating, and who as he and girl 2- Sebastian moved to New York, and just suddenly decided he will turn his head around. She "fell in love" with Danielle (might I remind you that in the original, Sarah Michelle Giller says quote "you broke with the first person you loved because I was told- so how could she be in love of prequel There's a lot of nice and good, and all "good people", as it turns down the sex from the father's chick. , and ends up in a threesome at the end of the movie, and then seducing cherry. <br /> I mean, its terrible .. And I loved the first one very much .. I did not even see the third one again. I hope for God is better than this prequel.
