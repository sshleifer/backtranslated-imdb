This movie was awful. The scheme sucked, the act was bad, the correction was inept and this movie made me want to sniff my eyes out. I wish I had time I spent watching this movie back. The balloon scene was stupid, the Mormon jokes really really old, the band sucked, I saw no chemistry between the two drives, it's full of stereotypes, stupid local "celeb" cameo's..most noted Del "I'll drive as fast as I want .." computer hydrate. What worst is that these actors have played themselves on the spiritual side and even aimed. This film helps create a long line of medieval endeavors to Hollywood's mainstream beliefs. I.E. The RM, the church ball, etc. etc. I would abandon watching this movie and instead first rushed into a brick wall. You'll be much more trainer than watching this poor excuse for a show.
