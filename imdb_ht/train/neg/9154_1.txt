THE. BETTER. FILM. EVER. DO. After watching this supposedly gay movie, I suspect someone rounding a brain damaged half-neo-nazi blind and was doing her worst gay movie ever, all in some deluded attempts to attack gay culture. I stopped the movie and called a friend to come up just so I had someone to jump in when I waited for the movie out of shock, disbelief and outrage of these sheer jumps. The script writings and stories act illogical and stupid, just read a wrong movie made. A dog with a menicam tied to that he could churned out better. <br /> <br /> Seriously, after reading some of the positive comments this movie has here, I suspect the writer must have a half a dozen against IMDb. Anyone who tells this movie is even mountable as anything other than a joke, is a liar or have paid heavy to say so.
