Perhaps this is not fair, because I only made it about half of the movie. One of the few movies I actually could not look due to lameness. <br /> <br /> The act is terrible, the camera work is terrible, the plot is ridiculous and the movie all is just unrealistic and cheese. For example - during a coke deal, the coke is just holding loose in a handbag - I have no expert, but I think people generally put it in a bag. <br /> They use the same stupid sound effect every time a punch throws (it's on top of the 'crunching' sound 'and used to play weapons and armed in sound effects. bad movie ever.
