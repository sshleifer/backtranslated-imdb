Not exactly a new story line, but this romantic comedy does the concept work. A young man (John Cusack) with a gay dead gay woman (Kate Beckinsale) holds meetings by chance and asks if they mean for each other. Although both are promised to others ... strangely enough to always feel that soul companions are out of place. A little wind in some places, but the viva likes. Being a romantic I almost obliged to be riveted. My favorite scene is where Cusack is on the ground and snow begins to fall. The final is almost too sweet but most deserving. This is not one of Cusack's deeper roles, but who in Hell could not beat in Beckinsale. Remarkable support is provided by Jeremy Piven and Molly Shannon. John Corbett plays the worst role I've ever seen him in. On the other hand Eugene Levy is original and funny. Watch this with your soul mate.
