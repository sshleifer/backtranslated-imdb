I never understood Garbo's call. He always comes across in his film as stuck up, not all that catchy, and annoying voices that might have drowned out the tuba section. It was also a very limited actress, like Gloria Swanson far better left in the silent era. In her latest movie, her performances are very average and even harassed. She tries hard, but it all comes to anything because the script is even worse than her acting. <br /> A A should be romball visbol that never once credible and never gets to the ground (though Melvyn Douglas managed to get airborne in the skiing scenes, which is really just the fun thing here). <br /> <br /> There was potential, but the script failed in almost every department, wasting every actor in it. Douglas and Garbo had good enough chemistry together but this one is not even a place on Ninotchka, which I also found to be very overrated.
