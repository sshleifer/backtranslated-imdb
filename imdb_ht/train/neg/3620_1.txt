I tried to look at the abomination of the movie when I was five years old; I'm never the same. Fill in the abrasion-driven image that induces the ravings common to your average asylum residents, this "film", despite its colorful appearance, is not for people, especially by children. <br /> It starts out innocently enough and a poor boy that breaks his drive's drum (wait for it) put himself in it; Yes, set himself in it. But do not be afraid, my friends! It is quickly consoled by flipping his chirping, which is oddly enough, I'll give you, but still acceptable. <br /> And then the movie Monsters in a combination of Wizard of Oz and where the wild things, but it loses all the "hot and soft" aspects of one of the two books. So, this seven yellow family tree in Barney, befriends this poor boyfriend and dives him even deeper into despair. <br /> And to add the beautiful array of horrific themes, a Carnivora boat, an old friend of the motley crew of hobbling grandfather and doped-up "dragon" crew, is added to the blend of destruction. <br /> <br /> The most comforting image among this disorder is the cruel, just armed "Witchiepoo" (?). Of course, she has problems in her own: what with a clear plastic mask her facial expressions have to deal with a broomstick that has levels of gas still seemed to be at its lowest in the most inopportune moment. As a result of this, one of his favorite distractions was nose-diving in the body of water that separated the land from Pufnstuf from it to degenerate, dwelling (I do not know where I prefer to live). <BR> <br /> In summary, this movie is terrifying ... <br /> <br /> If you want to watch the movie that has similar effects on its audience as the Exorcist, then This one is for you. Enjoy.
