This film can not even be said to be bad for it is Unfortunately, just great sufferers mediocrity. Lack of any real understanding or imagination, a thin plot is stretched to the absolute limit and the 'jokes' (which are predictable and threadbare) are sharpened from the lengths of those boredom and yawns quickly overlook the viewer. Another token marks the sad decline of John Waters and a reminder that this 'shock' or entertain us 30 years ago does not work quite the same right now. We've seen it all before, and no longer break any tabo because they have long since evaporated. A bigger miss.
