Now I love cartoons sci-fi. However, when "Robotboy" appeared in Canada in late 2006, I watched the premiere and was inevitably appalling. Characters are Generic and Stereotypes (Do They Really Need to Make An American African American Put Tiger Printed Dress And Speaking In A Jamacian Accent? WHAT IS ALL ASIAN CHARACTERS Vibrant Yellow And Curly? Does the Mom Have Big Tights And Chest and always complaining?) to the point where things become unrealistic, predictable, gross and sometimes disturbing. There is similarity to the same, even elbow, at Astro Boy. Allow me to explain (name dub for the youth): Robotboy / Astro, Kamikaze / Tenma, Constantine / Shadow, Gus / Abercrombie, Tommy / Alejo, Lola / Zoran + Kennedy, Moshimo / O'Shay, and so on. Recall the resemblance to "My Life as a Teenage Robot", "Star Wars", "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles", "Kamen Rider", "Sailor Moon" and co. they are walking. Not to mention the abundance of radio / sex. Not even finding I started on the innuendos. I'll just say they're hiding and quite roomy. But seriously. Do not even try to look at this. Especially if you like Astro Boy.
