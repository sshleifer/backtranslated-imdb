Eddie Murphy for Best Actor Supported ??? What an insult Alan Arkin and Djimon Hounsou. Jamie Foxx (who can act) walks in this movie as a zombie. <br /> <br /> Beyonce ??? What has acted ??? <br /> <br /> This movie is pales in comparison to CHICAGO or just about any other recent music. If not for great songs and performances at Jennifer Hudson I would give this a ZERO. And I've never seen the stage play so I do not do the typical Broadway vs Hollywood rap.
