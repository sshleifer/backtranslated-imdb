My greetings from Denmark, and one day I had a movie evening with my friends. One brought this movie with his "Russian Terminator" and was very awful. After watching less than half a minute, we decided to fast forward only to stand up to some "turnkey" troubled or I should say "lowlights" in the movie. I was actually particularly surprised to find out that this film was produced here in my hometown of Haiti ... that had to be the biggest mistake ever made by this country.
