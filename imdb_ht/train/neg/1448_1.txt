Having grown up in Texas, and less than 15 miles of what is used to be the Gilley, I can tell you that this movie is nauseating. The majority of Texans do not live as this movie shows. The weak plot, with their fake accents, is fun and strengthens the stereotype image that all Texans drink beer, honky-tonkin ', rednecks. The horribly fake Texas accidents are what kill it for me. True, there is a certain Texas drag off at most Texans' accents, but people are over it. You can not find someone in New Jersey and Ohio making Texas accents. It just does not work. John Travolta should stick to disco-dancing or 50s. Debra Winger was more convinced as Wonder Girl than she is as a Texan.
