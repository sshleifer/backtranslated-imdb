OK ... I watch a lot of bad movies. I'm proud of that reality. Many times there are some gems in their rated B bombs. But this movie is one of the worst I've watched. I love a good horror movie ... but one with a draw in and sense of movement. The opening scenes seemed pretty good. Dental music and imagery. Then he went down the hill from there. One of the main characters has a disability (tinnitus sounds). Now this will in turn threaten to reveal his secrets. They did so too much of a concentration in the movie. So, what he was ringing in his ear and accidentally left a plug ear somewhere where it would not be. Do not be caught wearing it up. So this guy has an affair with this girl and in a motel it falls and hits himself on the end table. So, instead of letting everyone know of his affair he decided to throw the body. Now her twin sister is trying to find out where she is and what happened to her. Well after seeing his sister over and over again (like a zombie like ghost) and even shows directly where the body he finally finds it. Now the body is recovered and is set out to deal with the sole and only suspect who killed him. Bad things are that he did not have much in a plan. Just pretend to be her twin and met the guy where the body was cast. The fool did not even believe he was killed. So all is revealed there and even though he has a gun .... somehow he managed to get himself hurt. So, the last scenes of the film are in the "demons" of her and her twins are walking out of the water. So you mean tell me in this movie the bad guy win. And not one, but two innocent people die. <br /> <br /> The bad things about the movie: the effects of long musical effects and the misdirection draw in the class to draw a few actors by all actors
