What a movie to squeeze. Do not get me wrong, Gene Hackman and Denzel Washington are good actors, but aside from some interesting set pieces, the movie is mostly taken up with surgeons surging shouting, weeping, sweating and generally freaking out when nothing go wrong. /> <br /> Take that with the simplistic aspect to make sure the audience always understands what's going on (scene where Denzel Washington explains to a radio repairer how to be like Scotty's Star Trek is nothing more than a jokes) and you have a dumbed thriller not worthy to act. <br /> Let's just hope that the real Navy US Navy is not at hand as a script!
