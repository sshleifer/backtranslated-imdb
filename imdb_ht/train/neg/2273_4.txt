This was not the great disaster that I expected, but that's about as positive as I can in my description of the movie. I'm not sure what was meant to be funny about this movie, but I suppose it's all a matter of taste. Personally, I do not find it funny to look moron living their absolute life or fooling themselves on TV, but then again, I'm not a fan of Jerry Springer's talk show daylight talk. I did not get too bored look at this, but I definitely did not enjoy it, either. If you are in the mood to see a bad movie, but one is not too painful to sit down, this is a good choice.
