Annie's Peri does not look good. It is not nice and pretty enough to play Annie. Annie sticks out of the movie, as her team looks like Halloween costumes. terrible act and terrible cemetery. This movie is like a change in version of 1982. I think a younger and younger girl should have had the lead role. Ashley Johnson shows a very boyish Annie. Not appealing to all. At least the casting director got it right with Daddy Warbucks. Ms. Hannigan was also wrong. Camilla Belle played Molly alright. This "warning" movie might insult your IQ so you can just want to show it to very small children. 8 and younger. Some of the plot are too fictional and can hardly take place in the real world.
