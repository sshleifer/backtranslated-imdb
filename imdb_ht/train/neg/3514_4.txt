Philip. K. Dickian movie. And one decent for that matter. Better than Paycheck (Woo) and abortion called Minority Report (Spielberg). But let's face it, wrapping up with cheese was a bit too much for me. Halfway through the movie I already started to fear about these types of finishes, and I was reusable right. But this does not mean that the film is not worth its time. No, not at all. The first half (as many already here have commented) is awesome. Some parts you start to doubt whether the director intends to convey the message that showmanship is very important in the future (we will do these kinds of sf rich things because we can) or is it simply about to combine. But the paranoid has and feels "from joints" too. A good one.
