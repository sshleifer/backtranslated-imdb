There are many who are wrong with this movie, but sum it up: Terrible acting - so bad it must have been on purpose. poor script - they might have had some good idea but this was not the best way to present the story. ridiculously wrong end - in some cases end up managed to save the movie-not in this case. If you manage to sit in the movie all you will want to kick yourself to the end because the finish is not even worth waiting for. This is the worst movie I've seen in a long time. She has completed torture sitting in this movie, I would appreciate someone warning me in advance. So make yourself a favor. Watch this movie only if you have absolutely nothing better to do. Even then you will be sorry to have set yourself in the unspeakable torture.
