I had the misfortune to sit in all the 102 minutes of what, in my opinion, this film is shocking bad. It fails on pretty much all levels; The cast is terrible, acting - at the best and the scheme lacks any depth, let me feel indifferent violence as the result of any of the intricate story lines. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Plan B has none of the genre charm that has the scope, and I find myself physically cringing at the various points where the script performs regular misjudged irrigation anywhere towards the region in comedy. <br /> <br /> A sacred bomb turret shielded into a movie.
