Unfortunately he was misguided. This stunk movie begins to end. It was hard to look up because I used to watch Clarissa Explain It All Everyday on Nickelodeon. I love it. Then the next thing I found she made a spread of Maxim and she was gorgeous! I have not really heard anything about it until I watch this movie about crashing. I could not believe it would even leave something like this can be seen with its name all over it. Everything about it was wrong but it still looked like someone somewhere in the team was trying really really hard to save a ships ship. Too .. I hope he continues to act and I would like to see him with a real cast in a real movie.
