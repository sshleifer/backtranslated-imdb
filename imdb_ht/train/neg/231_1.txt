That's the start of bad, what and the three women act like junior high school junior sit around giggling with the gin, endless cigarettes and a chocolate chocolate treat for one of those who tell the best 'man' story, and then , it gets worse - - Ability to spoiler = - = This Andie's character falls for the young organs player who used to be his student when he was 14 (she's the head of an English school, believing it or not ), only her was destroyed thanks to her bitch -from-hell 'girlfriend'. .. Then from there, it's basically Clawless unwatchable: she forgives her friends and has kids love the organ player and 3 women to finish as they started, drink more gin and smoke more cigar blah blah blah . Andie's characters launch the caramel chocolate from the street, in a tangible attempt to symbolize growth. Have mercy.
