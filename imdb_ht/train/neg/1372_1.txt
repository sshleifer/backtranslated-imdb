See this on TV. I'm glad I did not go to the movie to see this or spend the money on rental. The film is totally predictable - from the owner of corruption and planners, to the electric snaking sliders. The plot is really weak and incredible - the avalanche expert guy struck by a 20-foot wave of breeze breaking lava (using actual footage) and all he did is up and shaking his head down. Lavalas of thunder descended to one million kilometers an hour and stopped dead on the roadside. Some of the real avalanche material is impressive and shows its devastating power. But the deal between the real avalanche and this scene scene makes this movie look even flimsier. <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor, do not bother with this one not even on T.V.
