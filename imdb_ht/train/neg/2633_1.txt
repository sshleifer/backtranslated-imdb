I saw the trailer in the film several times in the theater and I'm excited. It looked like a comic funny comics like those that were made in the 1990s. She reminded me also fugitive movies, a cat and mouse chasing between Douglas and Sutherland. However, the Sentinel is throwing the toughest actions of all time. As I see, many people say that this is like a movie movie. Not exactly. First of all, there are many better TV films in this genre. Secondly, TV movies might be very fun sometimes, but this movie is the exact opposite of having a good time. It's not stylish at all visually and most importantly, the tone of the movie is unappealing. This is not an action movie, two action scenes consist of a chase and a clash. Also, they do not perform great action, but the worst is that the action scenes are very tasty as the whole movie. Love affairs between Douglas and Bassinger were highly needed. In addition, the plot of assassination of the president is the story that most censured in this genre either, but they insist on that. And this is not a cat and mouse movie as it is supposed to be. Although, Douglas is very old now, it has always been potential for acting in a thriller action. In the movie, Michael Douglas can not be like Tommy Lee Jones, for example. Sutherland is a bad choice either, because you feel like looking at Jack Bauer and somehow, her character is one of the reasons why the film as a TV movie, Eva Longoria Parker is a strange choice, of course it is too passive or straight in this movie, because it is a soap opera acta. The movie did not even please my second one, so I could not get over for a while.
