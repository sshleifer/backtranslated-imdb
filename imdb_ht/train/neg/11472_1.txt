Everything about this movie was terrible. To begin with this film had a very good cast and I found it impossible to make such a big cast of the biggest disaster in the gangster movie genre all the time. The sound track was like one of a very stick stick bat stick. He had this music in the whole movie and he began to get quite disappointing. <br /> <br /> PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE DO NOT ENFILE YOU AND THIS DISASTER You WILL ONLY HURT
