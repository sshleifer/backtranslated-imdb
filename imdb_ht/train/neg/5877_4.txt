Williamson's acceptance is difficult to walk around. It speaks extremely quickly, as it is in a hurry to get in the lines. During the soliloquies he acts as if talking to someone, when he was supposed to talk to himself. All that with baldness is just annoying me. It was just too old for this role. In other accounts of Williamson, maybe he got this role because he was upset with the director to decide to do a bit of life-imitating art or forcing acting methods. When the actors declare crazy amulets you believe it! Marianne faithful is a stunning beauty and can push the role of Ophelia and still find a pass. The set is dark and foreboding but it looks as if injections in a real castle especially the scenes of the tunnels / corridors where the king dies shine as a great light in the sky.
