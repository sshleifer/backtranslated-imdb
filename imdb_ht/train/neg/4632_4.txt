Maria Bello does not seem to care for those who think of her choice of film role. Again, she chooses a very difficult film and is not popular in star inches. Maybe she needs these movies, found in the coated cycle (aka "Hollywood") people she does here and then (coyote ugly and of course mummy 3). / / <br /> While I think fails to realize what he sets out to do (I'm not going to spoil that), Maria Bello is as well as in other movies she's independent / she's the star of It's her performance the movie. This combined with the unusual subject almost made the trick for me. But in the end (and even though I try to overlook some flaws, such as rhythm and dramaturgy), the movie is still too long
