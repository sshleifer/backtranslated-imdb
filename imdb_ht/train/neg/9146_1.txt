Sam Mraovich should not be allowed to earn a camera again. If it does it should be arrested on the spot ... at least so little for little. Anyone who pays even a cents leases any of his lumps should file a claim and be rewarded. This was my innocence first look at her "work" ... and it will be my last. Ed Wood seems awfully good now. <br /> When I return this piece of crap to the video store, I'll personally ask that it must take off the shelf. An active supporter of gay movies, I'm upset and upset by this wardrobe, many people who did not infiltrate people are allowed to distribute and pack something like this, and a nice colton boy on the cover (Jamie Brett Gabel , who, thankfully, has no other credit act of IMDb) with an interesting summary on the back used as bait, and then market it as a "movie" rental. Trust me, this has no place to be on any shelf anywhere; It is simply not a movie in any sense the word. The offensive, irresponsible damages as this can only be harmful to the efforts made to promote and support gay movies (hell, gay rights in general!) For those who tempt this lease from the cover, you will be disappointed. Gabel is not as complimentary to watch on film as it is on the cover, and it appears once or twice without a shirt - that's it. Instead, the family Mroavich influenced our own, lousy-naked nude-boy. <br /> <br /> This "thing" it "assembled" is an inverse vanity project for Mraovich. Both he and his friends Michael Habousch (which, I understand, put out as waste garbage) are awful in this. Mraovich is deliberately posing as a complete no-talent (in all fields), desperate to grab on any "loser" attention he can for himself. It is to be compassionate.
