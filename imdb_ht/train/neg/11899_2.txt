Robert Forster, usually a very strong character, lost in the ocean here cast as a New York family member seeking revenge on the thugs murdering his son and attacked his wife in a home invasion. Scary subjects are exploited for cheapjack emotions in the vein of "vein death". It's not hard to excuse the following disorders: the dialogue is full of courts, the crime statistics are definitely dated, and the characters are supposed to be ridiculous on-writing (particularly a jerking judge who allows a defendant to go out of court in the courtroom). Low-yield production is self-righteous, especially as the violence in our city has increased. * from ****
