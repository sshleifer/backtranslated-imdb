I can not believe that in the previous 34 comments, nobody mentioned that this movie is a blatant rip-off at Yesterday's feast. A man hired to carry a blonde officially mumbing up the conditions of a gangster. Employees of guns and blonde fell in love and live happily ever after. Gangster is left in the lurch. But yesterday Yesterday was a clever treatment whereas this is just too much holes. Teknikolor transfer to DVD is deplorable. Natalie Kalmus should roll over to her grave. Check out the paper. Recognize her? But it's historically interesting to see the roots of Rock 'n Roll. Also interesting is Ewell's introduction to CinemaScope, a new format at the moment.
