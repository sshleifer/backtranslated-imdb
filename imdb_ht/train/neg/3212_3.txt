I'm a big fan of the comic book series, but this movie falls below my expectations. I'm expecting a heavy metal 2000 type of feeling ..... slow moving, bad dialogue, many o'clock ..... but that was worse than anything I could imagine. <br /> <br /> The line draws is almost the same as the comic, but the very good points are standing there. Characters do not have the energy or spirits that drew my attention to the comic series. The movie only covers a small portion of the comic, and the used portion is much slower and boring than later. The focus of the movie is on the insignificant events instead of the more interesting overall draw in the comic book. With the right person working on this project, it could be amazing. Unfortunately, it was not so, so now there is another horrible movie that some will see and even less will love. Copy me will surely collect dust for years until I finally throw it out.
