Growing, Joe Strummer was a hero of mine, but even I left cold in this movie. For the better and worse, the Future is writing is not a simple "behind the music" style documentary. Instead it is an art biographical film, full of interviews, performance footage, home theater, and especially free animation excerpt rises from "Animal Farm." The film is coherent but covered by about half an hour. The campfire's form, while touching in thinking, is actually very annoying to execution. The first, without title, difficult to even know which half of these interviews are. Second, who really needs to hear people like Bono, Johnny Depp, and John mouth mouth licking hosannas of the man? They did not matter to Strummer's life and their opinions add nothing to her story. <br /> <br /> This picture is in its best when Strummer, in interviewing featuring and conversation, touching on aspects of his life most people did not know about: suicide at his older brother, coming in terms and death of his parents, the joy of paternity. For me, these were most moved because it showed Joe Strummer not as the punk icon we all knew with love, but as a regular person had to deal with the joys and sorrows in our lives all must face. <br /> <There was better, more simple documentary on Strummer and the Clash. (Westway, VH1 legends, and MTV doctors tell Kurt Loder from the early 90's to come in mind.) Joe Strummer: The Future is Writing is for only dayhards.
