I've seen a lot of movies in my life, but not as bad as this. It's a movie that makes fun of fat people, there is no real story, there are bad actors, not funny and more. Is it a movie that you would like to see? I guess that! <br /> I think the musicians in the movie were trying original and creative, but it seems to have been born by a 12 year old child and absolutely no cinematic skills at all. The so-called partial party is as funny as strikes most in the faces of people, or windbreaks. In course if this is the kind of humor that you like, then this is the movie for you! <br /> <br /> Do not waste your money on this movie!
