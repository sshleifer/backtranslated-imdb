WOW! I did not know that someone would make this movie! its terrible! I've written 5 things that can tell why you do not want to see this movie. <br /> <br /> Number 1: "Its Biggest Forever Ever" Where Is What's Riding? I could see only a few people from time to time .. <br /> 2. When they are on the river, they can only be seen widespread, no one, two tents old and one step. and what to do! to drink! <br /> <br /> 3. The worst actors I've ever seen! the commander and his crew .. terrible! <br /> <br /> 4. When one of the people will shoot an ordinary gun, it has been shot almost 30 times without breakage! <br /> <br /> 5. I did not know that everyone in the world could fight like a pro! must be something new .. <br /> I wonder what the producer thought! "This will have a big hit, it will be a classic" .. sure u u mute s ** t anyway do not see this movie, a kid in time. My eyes are still clogged!
