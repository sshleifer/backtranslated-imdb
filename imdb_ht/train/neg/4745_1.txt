No more I can say that saying this film was awful. The whole Chinese has risen to you because of the ancestors was a hard sold. But tell the audience that every Chinese knows Chinese history without even studying it just mockingly. That's how it tells all Americans to know American history without studying or every Filipino, etc., etc. It's just not credible. <br /> The story is flat out horrible. He talked about Shin being from a monastery in China - later identified in Bejing. However, the early sequences of the movie show the focus on Mongolia. I know the current Chinese regime wants to claim areas like Mongolia for its own, granted. But it's a distinct nation with it even "Mongolia" label on the map. Does Disney Studios fail 5th grade geography? <br /> <br /> The relationship between Wendy and Shin is the best superfighter, and yet it somehow feels connected to it. Her training is just cheesy as well. And, allow off the chase: everything about this movie is bad. It's bad enough to laugh and cry over. Taekwondo the action was over and unrealistic in many cases. <br /> <br /> The wrong things that were cheese. However, let's finish finishing would be the only descent thing about it. They should let the wrong eyes end in it. But rather somehow wrong is defeated. Yey! <br /> <br /> Overall, not worth the time of the dog in the movie. Brenda Song should get on with another studio.
