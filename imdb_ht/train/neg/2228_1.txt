This film is weak, the cover box says the gang is the toughest East East and it's really Santa Ana, James Cahill acts like a closet queen taking down all the hard guys in the Chlo Hard Gang. It is fake, boring, horrendous and off, I tried to get my money back from the movie video store so bad. It was also on the homo-erotic tip away from what the video-box proclaimed. James Cahill would act in Gay Porno .James is in every scene, he can not act to save his life. The feature film Eva Longoria is hot but James can not even score with it !!!!!!!!! I felt at times I looked at Gay Porn and turned - off by the entire movie. James clearly wants to be with men but rather submits to gay desire to beat gang members over and over and over again. Its martial arts skills are minimal at best, some real gang members would take it with its weak skills and rip it a new one.
