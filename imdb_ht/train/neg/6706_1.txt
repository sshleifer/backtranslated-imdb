I saw this move several years ago at the Central Florida Film Festival if I remember. I love it, it has shown great potential. I guess most people here are explosive this movie because the movie seemed hobbled together (not the own movie admission on the official site - the short was exposed as a "rough-cut"). However, it was an easy-to-go comedy. I think many people try to get too far in a comedy. All they are supposed to do is make you laugh - that's all. I did just that in his show, so he succeeded in that level. Just my 2 cents anyway.
