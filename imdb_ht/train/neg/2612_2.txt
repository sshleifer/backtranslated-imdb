Only the reason I saw 101 Dalmatians was nominated for the original singing and costume design for the Oscars. I must admit that I was less impressed with this film. By the end, Cruella DeVil (by the way Glen Close pulls this role very well) is released from the hospital due to its good behavior. He loves every kind of animal and locks all his fingers. From this point, we only wait until it begins to have a crisis. Soon enough, she does and tries to make the best dress in fashion world, of course for herself and to quite fur Dalmatian. Apart from Glen Closed, I found all quite funny thrill but in a funny eye. That's just enough as the target market is, I suppose, kids under 12. It's a good fit for kids and their families, but did not do much to me. * from *****
