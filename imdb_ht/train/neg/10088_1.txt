I am an actor, producer, director and what I am telling about is reality. This project was the worst movie movie in history. From producer directors and edit this movie called this is a joke and I mean a BK joke. Why would Blockbuster release these cracks? I take my job very seriously and this movie is a reproach to my profession. Was the director trying to make a bad movie? I do not think so. I saw movie cannon zombies, but this took the coffie cake and everything on the damn table. This SOS PHOTO! I really hate bad talk about other filmmakers because I am one myself, but please consider taking a different profession. I respect the fact that you file a movie, but I must ask you "if you smoked CRACK", I mean the makeup on your girl, the scary zombies, what you thought. For the whole nation, if I could have voted Zero I would have. FILM FORM IN MOVIE BEFORE ONE !!!
