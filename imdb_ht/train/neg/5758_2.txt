You can say that the actors will make a movie, but that's clearly proving that wrong statements. Most of the characters in this movie lack anything to hold on. They play the part of cardboard cartons that have been moving in on predictable and refreshing ways. The story is very simple. It could be summed up in a few words, but I'll keep back in case anyone reading wants to see this movie. <br /> I've been forward to parties where Jack has shown us how to be an unpleasant food. I should say that 70% of this film revolves around cooking, eating, or getting ready to eat. Quite frankly, I'd rather not spend time watching Jack wet with a mouth open. Personally, I could do without the shoe references and jokes that first half pepper in the movie too. <br /> Outside my personal diurnal, the movie really lacks worth it's time. There were countless scenes and camera shots that felt like he was dragging. When something happens, the reactions of the characters are vague and dry. <br /> <br /> Better not to look this one up.
