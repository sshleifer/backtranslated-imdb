I found this nasty movie to watch. I felt like it cut off the storyline down my throat as if I could not pick up the subtleties I needed a voice on the spell they all out for me constantly. <br /> Having a dad who is still an Alcohol, I did not really feel it was a movie about alcohol as such. Alcohol, true alcohol are very naturally people inside, in my opinion of course. They find it hard to communicate, something that the main character had no problem and really, except having a problem saying I love you at one point - that was a bit of a weak effort to establish her cold character them. He was constantly surrounded by people too! I felt cheated with no point we were really alone and the character really got a sense of its interior loneliness and turmoil. I could not connect with the character and felt no ties in all regarding my dad. I felt nothing at all when it ended, just relieved it was over. Kevin McKidd is a hockey actor but is not a tough guys guy guy! The mechanical thing was as subtle as a brick. McKidd was too old for teenagers, they should have three different characters or avoid teenage steps and focus more on McKidd's adult. <br /> <br /> On a good note, I felt the little boy actor was really good at the start of the movie !!
