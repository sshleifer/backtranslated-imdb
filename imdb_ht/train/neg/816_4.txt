Back in the 1970s, WPIX ran the "Superman Adventures" every afternoon every day for quite a few years. Each time in a while, we would get a treat when they would preempt the neighboring show when "Superman and the Mole Men." I always look forward to these days. Looking at it recently, I was amazed at just how bad it was really. <br /> It was not bad because of special effects, or lacking there. True, Superman George Reeves's costumes were very bad, the edges of foam padding used to make him look more imposing were clearly visible. And true, Men's costumes were even worse. What was supposed to be a furry coverage would not have deceived a ten-year-old, since the zippers, hems handles and reliable pilling fabrics seriously tailored to suit baggy were all painfully evident. But these were imperfection forgiveness. <br /> No, what made it bad was the trace devices to convert. Time and again, Superman failed to do anything to keep the situation in deterioration. A lynch mob seeks the animals? Rather than rounding the hysterical mob or search for the animals itself, it stands around explaining the dangers of the Lois situation and the PR man. The Corners Corner Again, he stands around watching and speaking but he does not save them until they are shot. Luke Benson, rabble-rouser town, shoots at him? Attempts to kill people at any reasonable person, but Superman releases the man over and causes more problems. Superman had some opportunities to nip the problem of bud, but never once took advantage of them. <br /> <br /> That said, both George Reeves and Phyllis Coates played their characters well, seemingly immediately comfortable in their role. If only they were given a better script to work with.
