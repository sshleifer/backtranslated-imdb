Honestly, my expectations for Little Bush were given. I was expecting a series of little cartoon and lots of fun (but rehashed and transferred) Bush jokes. Apparently I should lower my expectations even more. The report was absolutely pathetic. Aside from the Cheney-Chicken-Food Dogs, and some giggly-little sequins, it's really boring and unfunny. The animation was as sophisticated as a thirteen-year flash project. It's a shame that Macromedia's products have been used for this because it can be much more. <br /> I do not like Bush so much, and I enjoy a Bush-joke as much as the next guy, but this was just a half hour slipping off the President with several unmanageable moments. Trey Parker and Matt Stone did so much more with this Bush I. <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor, jump "Lil 'Bush" and go buy a copy of the short live comedy "This Bush I". You will thank me.
