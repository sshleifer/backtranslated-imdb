Let me start from saying that I used really like Betty Grable, particularly in "Down Argentina Way", but by the time he got around this disaster, he also got "round" and frankly the entire movie was a troublesome. Costarred and Douglas Fairbanks JNr (who had to be fairly desperate) the story was bad, the good colors, and the movie far too long. It has some of the old standbys in it like Harry Davenport and Reginald Gardiner to try and promote interest but have no success. The music note was worried, and I was told by one melody was memorable in any way ... as I was like a fan of Miss Grable, I still wish I never saw this one!
