I probably one of those who actually read the book Stephen King, one of the movie was based on. After having worked this excellent, I could not wait to see the movie version of it. After watching the movie, I was totally disappointed. The only thing that this movie has in common and the book is the title and the names of the characters. In the book, Schwarzenegger's character is placed on a game show. The main object is to survive. But it's not in an arena. He was loose in the city and had escaped the show game (I guess you would call them) villians, who brought absolutely no resemblance to the movie characters. The first one was building tension and suspension and ended up with the highest score. The film was absolute waste. There was no cinematic quality in it. I totally respect Arnold Schwarzenegger as an actor, but he messed up with this one.
