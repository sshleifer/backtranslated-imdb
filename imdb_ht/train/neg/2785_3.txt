I know that some films (I mean: European films), which are very bad movie, were regarded as big movies by certain "critics", only because they are not non-American. I saw 8.1 IMDB score for this movie and noticed the fact that this was chosen for certain big festivals. Do not let your fools! Unless you are one of those self-numbing films like this, and call it great art afterwards, skip it! The movie has one hilarious scene after another (a similar, Italian, movie popped by myself, the terrible PREFERISCO IL RUMORE DEL MARE (I prefer the sound of the sea)). The problem with these films is that they're not just boring, as some other strange films praise, but that they almost play like camp. I mean, let's face it, the act is awful (I mean: soap opera level), the story does not have one surprise (this has done endless times before, connecting several storyline: NO, MAGNOLIA, play not only a very real character), not one realistic character of it (some true-freak-seen along the way, remarking the zombie-like hilarious island), and so on and so on. As if this Not enough, the film is 135 min. (count it!) long, and at the end the director opens his case to sentimentality. After a movie and dialogue these bad malady and scenes that made the public in the dream screening preview of so much incompetence, well ... This is a movie theater, and only receives high ratings because it happens in language "another", in this case Spanish. Our strange world lives in ... 3/10
