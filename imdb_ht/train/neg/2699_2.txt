I do not read one IMDb commentary for this movie which mentions how the Jewish character of this movie jumped up and down like a little baby as a gun pointed to his face by a racist head while leading The black character movie looked at the sluggish down the barrel of a gun. <br /> I do not know how someone could see this as a balanced account in university life. I admit the universities are not tolerant bastions as they suppose and the title would be fitting if Singleton did not make his characters like big caricatures. On the surface he tries to show the ice cubic character as a bad guy, provoking Remy to become a racist head scarlet. But who graduated to the end to removing the film? It looks like Singleton points in white as either can empathize (I did not say sympathized!) And his fellow student black or only able to take the path to a racial scrinchot. Many people have been intimidated by people in another race by turning into extreme prejudice. Neither women who have been raped immediately come back to lesbianism, which is described as a cult as a lifetime. Well, exactly what was the point?
