The animation looks like it did in 30 seconds, and looks more like caricatures rather than characters. I was a fan of Scooby Doo ever since the premiered series in 1969. I did not think much of the animated scooby scams, (I'm talking about the TV series, not the full length films.), But some of them was very cool, and I love most people found Scrappy Doo to be an irritated, but this series is the best quality of garbage. As soon as I saw the animation, and heard the characters, (and I used this term injuries) to speak, I cringed. Also, Mystery Inc, was a team, and without the crew all complimenting each other, it just seems like opening a chocolate box to find someone who has already eaten better, and the only thing left is the ones that do not want . What's New Scooby Doo was better than this. If you're going to have a TV set of scooby doo, include the elements that have made the series endured long. All cast in character, and quality animation. They need to put this one back down the rock from where it comes.
