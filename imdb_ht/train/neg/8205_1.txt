Very bad act, with a very deep story. Not even a decent B-movie <br /> Events that were supposed to be shocking as those who got on board an alien boat were boring and many lame. <br /> This is one of the worst sci-fi I've ever seen. I saw the stars 5.0 and decided to watch it since I love the genre, but it sucks so badly. Now there's really a few nice movies about ALIEN topics, I think because most of them are low budgeting <br /> I give it 3/10
