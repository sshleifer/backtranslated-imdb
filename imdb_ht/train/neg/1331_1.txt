Collisional collisions are even worse than the typical "white capitalist male capitalist" capital of the week. This movie is less beautiful than a toothache. Jay Leno can act. He is good at his first film, Silverbears, in which he provides a composite performance with the demands of his character. This film is Leno's bad character, a buffoon witness, is less annoying than Morita's character, a trumpet fool.
