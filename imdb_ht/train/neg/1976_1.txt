How it feels like a bad movie can be done. Bad act. Bad script. Just a troublesome all around. This is just one bad cliche after another. <br /> <br /> This movie actually has some great names in it. Unfortunately they are musicians and not actors. This movie made hardly any money for a good reason. The appeal of black cowboy movies just is not there. It's a shame they did not have a good story they say. <br /> <br /> This movie actually has some great names in it. Unfortunately they are musicians and not actors.
