As a great fan of horror movie, especially J-terror and also gore I thought Nekeddo Bur√¢ddo sounded pretty good. I researched the draw, read reviews, and even looked at some photos to make sure it seemed like a good manure and scary movie to watch before downloading it. So excited she ended up and ready to be scared and recoiling into the horror of the amazing gore I was hoping I was terribly disappointed. The plot was ridiculous and did not even make sense and left too much unexplained, the gor was hilarious rather then terrible, and what was with the style cartoon style effects? The act was probably the only mildly scary thing about it. I did not understand the cactus idea and how the mother's mother disappeared in the middle of the sea after a flashing light, leaving both very unexplained, or maybe I missed it as my mind could not understand what I was actually see. I appreciate the way it was supposed to be; Shocking and a few scenes (the strange cannibal and my mom kissing?) certainly were, I just think to go a little far and not even in a worrying manner, made it compelling that made it more credible to be a comedy rather than a horror in my opinion. However it is a very entertaining movie and got a lot of laughter from me and a couple of friends, but sadly we were expecting horror by comedy for it's worth a look for the value of entertainment, but not waiting for a black, deeply scary and worried film; you will just be disappointed. If this was a comedy support / story I would probably rate it about a nine, the climax was the strange scene when the husband got up in his wife's stomach and closed his wounds, but as a sad horror gave it one.
