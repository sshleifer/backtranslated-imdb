The IMMORTALIZER was, uh, interesting. He certainly did not kill me during his hours with a half duration, but he did not impress me much either. A group of children are kidnapped by a musclehead mutant (in a scene featuring the smallest movie theater combining sound effects) and taking in a fancy home in the suburbs. Here, Dr. Divine and his team will do brain transplantation for its rich old age so they can have young bodies again. Hey, this was quietly remade with a huge budget a few years later as FREEJACK! Who knew that when you transplanted an old brain into a different body that new voices will sound exactly like their old voice? With all the pinnacle talks and the use of a glowing green glow, you can almost see the vision from BEYOND and RE-ANIMATOR to the top of the producers. But the production literally does not have the courage to pull it off. I never understood why, when someone is doing a low budget support film, that they do not pack it to the edge of the frame with Gore. The act is just as awful, and only good performance from Clarke Lindsley as assistant Dr. a. She has a nice laugh laugh. Only the other thing to note about the IMMORTALIZER is that it features many of those old ones performing their own stunts. Seriously, most of the throw takes some serious downturns as old.
