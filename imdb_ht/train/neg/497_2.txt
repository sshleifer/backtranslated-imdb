This is a really dumb movie. It might be fun with the cool fresh aliens and the country's environment, but it's just not. <br /> <br /> Some aliens hear broadcast in the World War when a small radio station plays it on Halloween. They came to the earth to kill, but instead of killing them, they slaved and slammed. The front cover movie shows these aliens surf surfing in space ... not really what they do. These are not foreign parties, they are stupid cartoonish idiots and annoying large loud modulation camps. The alien and the most tolerable voice also happens to be Jack Nicholson's rip-off aliens who still wear his sunglasses. Other than the aliens, the act is terrible. This is a mute film, that kids only appreciate, maybe. <br /> Rating: 1/2 from ****. 100 mn. PG for moderate language.
