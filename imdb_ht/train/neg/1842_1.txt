This is my first movie review on IMDb. I was forced to register after watching this movie. I can not be in good conscience allowed this movie to be unreviewed by me. People must be warned! <br /> I like Jack Black, Ben Stiller, Rachel Weis, and Christopher Walken, and yet I hate this movie. There is a plot, but that cares when there is no script. The dialogue is really real and boring, the situations are getting out, the event flow is slow and somewhat arbitrary, the characters are impertinent and refreshing, and the story, although based on a good quote, is stupid. This movie is a piece of poo. <br /> Never mind wasting money on this movie, it's not even worth the time you spend watching it. Please do not see it ... I ask you!
