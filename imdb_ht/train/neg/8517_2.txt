The biggest mystery of Veronica Mars is not one that has been attacked on screen. Instead, the mystery is why this decent evaluation assessment is always on the air. This week marks a nadir for Veronica Mars: it ranked 146 out of the 146 great show 6 (soon to be Big 5). Yes, you read right. Veronica Mars beats each show of the now-defaced WB with each UPN show. He was beaten by all the shows on Fox and of course not all the shows on ABC, CBS and NBC. <br /> Now the hip hyperswers will be saying: but this was a re-run. But everything on TV this week was pretty much a re-run! It boggles the idea why CW would choose this evaluation assessment to prove as one of the few shows it saved from UPN. <br /> <br /> Clearly something that will be behind the scenes. Favor was exchanged and peddled influence. <br /> <br /> Sorry to be so cynical, but what else does the explanation have? "The Veronica Mars has potential" clear clear lines now that it has been two years to establish itself and failed to do so. <br /> <br /> Maybe it's Joel Silver's influence and strokes, but honestly, I am at a loss why anyone would choose to spend the strokes on a bad show that no audience is watching. <br /> A great mystery with a very untouchable first for CW.
