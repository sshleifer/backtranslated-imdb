Definitely one of Eddie Murphy's comic films is this nonsense about a mysterious children kidnapped, three hundred years old dragon and a "Chosen One". Murphy is "choosing the one" in question, and as the song suggests suggests, he is "the best man in the world". Someone who loses lost children, missing, is approached by a mysterious female woman (Charlotte Lewis) who says she is the "Chosen One", and that she is destined to find and deliver the "Golden Child" . Because if the child dies, compassion would die with him, as he is bringing in compassion. <br /> <br /> If all this pocus mosquito has not been ruined it for you now, it surely will once start movie. Sure says the plot is abominable and destroys the entire movie. Let another car for Murphy's selfishness in humor (the comedy is not so great yourself), the movie fails on many levels. Even Charles Dans as the Sardo Numspa's evil can not do much for the procedures. Very funny and irritating. <br /> Sunday, December 12, 1993 - T.V.
