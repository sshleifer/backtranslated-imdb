Like some of the other folks who have reviewed this movie, I've also broadened nostalgic about it ... before I had the misery actually looked at it again. Alas, my childhood memories of this movie were completely untrustworthy, and the dangers of Pauline are now revealed to be a nasty exercise in trite, racism, and boring movie making. Even the presence of old Edward Everett Horton and Terry-Thomas benefits can not overcome a rancid scan, a horrible song, and some 'effects' special effects. In addition, the stereotypical diagrams of African and Arab characters make for painful look, especially considering this product in the immediate awakening of the Civil Rights Movement. Michael Orlando original psychotonic Michael Weldon reported that the dangers of Pauline were originally produced for television, but inexplicably ended up getting a theater release. Judging from the results, that is a completely credible storyline (and baffling).
