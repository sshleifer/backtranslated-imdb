At first glance, this film has everything a psycho wants: a vampire story with a "no less than 18" restriction, filled with drug violence, drugs, gore, sex (including lesbian sex), some fanatics zero and even a gay nekropiliac! But then, this movie is a succession of bad (so thin), bad acting - with a ridiculous English accent that makes you believe you are watching a bad Monty Python - bad music (hard rock 80s) , the video is terrible, the end is a real shame ... Plus the scenes of sex are ridiculous, the gore is not very impressive. And vampires are reflected in a mirror, and not even scared of daylight! You get to be very disappointed, unless you see it as a "Space Mutin" or "Trol 2". I hope Bloodlust will one day reach 100 below, because that's its real. <br /> I would say it can always be fun to look, if you have friends and beer enough. <br /> <br> 3/10
