Anyone notice that Tommy has only 3 facial expressions. <br /> 1. The angry eyes look at all enemies. 2. Keep from face, agape mouth and scary eyes. 3. Tommy Turnbull's smile. <br /> I must say that I'm pretty much hated this show, I do not look it but it's like Code Lyoko, we've all looked at least one, I must say that this show is borderline racism, refreshing and gratuitous. <br /> <br /> every episode ends with robotboy win, except for an exception when Robotboy basically leaves this freekazoid flying geeky away on a jetpack. <br /> <jokes are very rude also, I think it is especially those who say the word "suck" or farting, I think the bullies in the show are quite shocking too. <br /> <br /> Does not one hide a bowling ball under his hate, and the other uses a chain, for God's sake, what kind of school it will be. Not to mention his older brother, who is biologically biological and has no other type of character. <br /> <br /> The whole show I feel is off of Megas XLR and encouraging. As you might tell the trio of Coop, Jamie and Kiva, as well as Robotboy were just like Megas where he beat everyone no matter what their odds and free gay despite being a robot. There is no appeal to this show, I'm surprised that it's still running.
