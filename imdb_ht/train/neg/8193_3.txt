Well, during this past thanks, all the family together decided to go to a movie, and since Fred Clause voted for the majority, that's what we were going to say. <br /> <br /> To start in the movie was much plot hole it was pathetic. Simple explanation of why a certain event is being canceled. example; who the heck is trying to 'close' Santa Clauses? Is it some sort of society? A little explanation was wonderful. <br /> <br /> <br /> Second: The movie above you delicate characters that conjure no sympathy from you on the feelings or actions. Example: The little elf was named Willie and the girl only high in the village elf. to see each other twice and then they are a couple and I was able to take care less because this movie did not care for me. Third: I suppose this was supposed to be a family movie? Its rating was low in just PG. For a family movie there were several articles in suggesting conversations. She did not bother me, but if I was a parent I could see a problem. <br /> <br /> Through the film all Paul Giamatti looked pretty bored with his role, but honestly he was the only one worth watching in the movie. Vaughn had a few funny moments but played the same character he had for the last two cinemas. frat boy flies. (nothing against Vaughn, it was good at other movies) <br /> So this movie gets a 3 out of 10 stars from me, just because someone has put in this effort to produce, film and releasing this flicker. <br /> In my opinion I would definitely pass on this flicker movie, or if you have to see it saves it for a rainy day rental.
