Have you searched for this high and low movie, I actually get it when I'm younger, playing on the Sundance Channel very early in the morning one day. Why I sought endlessly for a worthless project Little Chuck Barris who has made during the last few years to reduce the TV show, I have no signs. The film is simply set up horrible. The scripted part deals with a week that is. Of course the highlight of the film is seeing the real performers who were "too hot for TV" or rejected for some reason or another. This part is always loaded, but the bad thing is enjoyable in its own way. And now, behold, I have beheld what I long for, and how long shall I look upon it? NO CONDITION !! Make yourself a favor and just look at the best "Confessions of a Harmful Mind" or find old copies of the current show. Acting in girls where there are just popsicles nest provocative was fun, but having to endure seeing Jay P. Morgon flash audience has at all luck made me sterile. In retrospect, I'm so thrilled that this massive flop was, for if it was a massive hit, could have been a "$ 1.98 Movie of Beauty Show" and what my friends would surely have brought on the Apocalypse. > <br /> My class: D
