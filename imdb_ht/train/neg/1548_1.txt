Lorne Michaels once again proved to be absolutely no movie product business. <br /> You would think that after flicks such as "Superstar", "Night of the Roxbury", and "Coneheads", it would begin to get the notion that maybe it does not know what it does when it comes to movies (and many would argue that he does not know what he did when he came to TV, as well). Trying to make films feature from skit who brought out the third-party welcome they made on SNL makes no sense. I personally love Tim Meadows, and think it should be great in the movie right. It's a shame to see a talent guy wasting in a movie that features unfunny after situations without function, and his entire cap with a dreadfully bad song and dance scene. Any laugh here will be because the movie is so bad, not because it's funny. <br /> Well, at least we can be grateful that there are many other SNL characters tired that will never have films on them. It's just too bad that this one made it to the big screen.
