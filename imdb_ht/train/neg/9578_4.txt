Do A-Pix ever, ever, ever doing anything right? This film was meant to be seen on television in a mailbox format. Since A-Pix does not even believe in pan and scan, we see the whole scene where a shoulder on the left side of the screen is on the shoulder to the right. Of course, not that you are missing a lot. This movie is incredibly bad. It is very difficult to enjoy a movie where the characters scream at the heads of the lungs during 80% of the movie for no reason.
