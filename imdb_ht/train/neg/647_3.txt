The act was lurid as well as the scenario. It was wrong to put together and to make you almost want to laugh at several scenes many people made scene scenes. The finish was even worse. Everyone died dead, but somehow finished doing it looks like everything was OK OK! They did not provide enough story about the teacher's mania, etc. The film needed more time maybe develop a better storyline. The only reason I give this 3/10 is that I kind of feel bad for the young actors. They needed better coaching. They could really make this an OK movie, but the scenario and act fails miserably.
