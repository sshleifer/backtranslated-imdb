In fact, these young people were so sweet that I can not wait for all 'em to kill, including Clarissa (Joanna Canton) since I consider it the most annoying of the bunch. But I knew it was going to be a mess out of the opening minutes when a Christine teen opened fire on the priest and the nuns and the music Leslie Gore is playing in the background. He had nowhere to go down. Even prosthetists were looking at the false and the "blood" looked suspicious like Punch Hawaiian, although later on it took on the red-summer-to-go day to match the comic makeup makeup they were all wearing. I'm sure all the GOTH sailors will appreciate this bullsh-t since it will appeal to this bunch. It certainly did not appeal to me. Blah ... <br /> And not even my favorite horror babe Adrienne Barbeau can save this stupid teen movie easily from her head. It always looks hot, though. I am happy to take care of myself since we have not seen too much of her nowadays. However, it's a step up from the Dorrelor Dante Tomaselli's horror (2002) in that it has a somewhat coherent plot, so I'll give it a lot. This little Boston terrier called Boozer also brought it up to a tooth. I like that Boozer does Clarissa at the end. It was only the good scene of a otherwise funny film. <br /> <br /> The movie Lions Gate is sure to be desperate when they chose this one up. <br /> <br /> 2 out of 10
