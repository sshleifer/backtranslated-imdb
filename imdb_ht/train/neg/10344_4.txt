See this movie running in the wee hours on TCM. Several issues with the movie were apparent from what I saw. First, adults did not age when their children were 10 years old. Several parts of the film had permanent problems & for some reason the actor played the youngest boy look like the oldest when the 10 years passed. <br /> The copy I've seen has been missing about 20 minutes or so, at least a large space and black screen appears. It is too bad, though the script leaves something to be desired, Bergman & Russell both made fine in the movie in their role. It's a great shame of the missing piece, but here is the look. <br /> I just want it was all intact. The script makes little sense in what Bergman's character throws away when the kids are small, but then return to their care by adults? Some of the time lines do not make sense either. There is a stock market crash similar to 1929 but children grow up to fight in the First World War. All the act by the folks are the support of this movie is fine. Just asked what was in the 20 space in my movie was not able to see how it was missing.
