Unfortunately, the realism is boring. This movie, I thought it would never end, would be best if all the characters would be nuked in the first five minutes. Where Blade When You Need It? While as a stroke involvement as COMBAT shock, a DREAM and as a nightmare as BOISE MOI, MUSIC KID is not as fun as any of the aforementioned cinemas. While the freeware cannibalism might make wannabe Jeffery Dalmers heart race a little faster, it was not nearly as interesting as ravenous. Really, I found it as exciting as late-night infomercials, and as exciting as a journey to the dentist. If you have strong masochistic qualities, you might be able to keep this, otherwise, for no one. I was really surprised that this one was not made by the people of brain damage as to what was the quality of Dead Creatures.
