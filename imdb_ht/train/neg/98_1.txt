I got this movie as a gift, I knew in the DVD cover, this movie will be bad. Not to look it for over a year I finally watch it. what a movie is tackling .. <br /> I almost did not end up watching this bad movie, but it will be unfair to me to write a review without looking at the full movie. Believe me when I say "This film absorbs" I'm truly shocked that some bad moviemakers got even financed to make this film tacky, but it could not cost more than $ 20,000 to produce this movie. all you need is a cheap camcorder or cell phone camera .On 15 people have no acting skills, a bag is written by a couple of people who drink. <br /> <br /> At this point the ultimate evil move of a reporter (Tara Woodley) runs a supposed to be drunk man on his way to report a hunting town. It is completely injured. They went to a supposed to be abandoned home, but luckily it was almost furnished furnished with a bottle of liquor on the doorstep that happens to be there. just be supposed to be drinking but all is not it looks. <br /> Then suppose the drunk man starts telling zara ghost story / zombie story. <br /> <br /> The point in her stupid story blame to be the worst in history. <br /> Its story <br /> <br /> Sergeant. Ben Draper left one of his soldiers dying in full fatigue (I think this is what happens) after leaving the poor Wilson private soldier sitting site and leaving him digging a grave and then falling into soldiers , Ben Draper <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Fix it into a deep grave. But Sergeant. Ben Draper's for great surprise. Fascinating wife / girl she knows about this and she and her lover killed Sgt. Ben Draper takes revenge on private Wilson. (The next to the tomb of the soldier it sort of murder) The soldier wakes up from his grave in the form of zombies and kill them to take revenge on his name. /> The twist ends they were so lame. Even if you like movies, do not watch this movie
