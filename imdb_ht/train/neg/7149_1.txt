Anyone who wrote "Redline" as a great movie movie must be paid by Daniel Sadek to encourage this ultra-fancy flame, steaming batteries in amateur crap. Easy worst movie movie or any movie ever made. This showgirls look like Citizen Kane. Take every cheesy cliche from a series of action series 80s, put into some really spitting effect with lame characters who have no relevance and you have living proof that Daniel Sadek should not write screenplays and movies but they should stay in the business real estate. This is like a lame film and plot like a lame and the most controversial action sequences ever. What offends me is not that the musicians in this movie are idiots but that they consider the movie to go public to be idiots enough to fall for this crap.
