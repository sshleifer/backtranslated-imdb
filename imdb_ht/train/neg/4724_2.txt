This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I saw it in the premiere of SXSW and was very disappointed. The director knew little about John Lennon and even said as much of the premiere. This is a drama, but people have laughed at all in how the movie was filmed. This is never a good sign. The only savory seeds were Dominic Monaghan and Jason Leonard as the Livien Collar / Bondmates. It was funny during the rest of the movie took her head to seriously. The rubbed cast of Beatles lyrics was just absurd. The soundtrack was excellent, however, and was probably the best part of the movie. Unless you are one of the crazy fans, fans of Dominic Monaghan fans, do not bother with this one.
