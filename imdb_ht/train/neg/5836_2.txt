From the pen of Richard Condon (Candidate to 1962 mandate) this story is muddled in political intrigue and murder. The story, said in books almost comical book is difficult to swallow. All-star cast in mind, this poor effort is not entirely blamed at the cast and crew: the novel was replete with the same short-comings. It seems as if at times the story is actually mocking the more sincere effort set out in "prosperous prospects." A deception over all counties.
