This may or may not have the worst movie that Steve Martin has ever done, but it certainly has been far from her best. Obviously, he did this crap for the paycheck. Trick like this certainly has nothing to improve his reputation as a funny man. What it does not seem to is is that when people go to see a Steve Martin film, they expect to be entertained, not bored with tears. It's sad that he steals Dan Aykroyd and Phil Hartman down with him. I do not understand why talented people can not find a grip on the fact that there are people who hate them in disgusting movies. If you're going to call a movie a comedy, then it should be funny. This was not. Shame on the American military to allow himself to be associated with this pabulum, too. Full Jacket Metal was more lazy than this miserable excuse for a "comedy service." True, Phil Silvers is rolling over in his grave.
