This is a very odd movie ... I have not really assured that what was on them, some N London lowlifes find a mute kid in the woods that they all believe are some kind of oracle and somehow make them all , in their own way, change something about their lives that usually end up in disasters. The movie ended after about 90 minutes leaving me feeling quite satisfied, almost annoyed by the powerlessness of it all. I did not care about any of the characters - none of them found a chance to put themselves in the viewer. <br /> <br /> What was the message? Did I Fear? It was just too odd. What happens to runners? Why does Emilio shoot the kid? ... that made absolutely no sense, freeware. Can someone help me understand this chaos in a movie?
