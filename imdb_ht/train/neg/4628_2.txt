Ayers Misty had a smoking body, and that's all this movie was over. Most exploiting flick of films. I started playing a game with myself, counting the number of times looped the music orchestra music. And of course the music is completely related to the scenes. At the point: relaxed walking in a room and says "Greetings" was scored and chased music out of a religious season. I would like to know why this movie is sitting on the shelf for 11 years before being released. What I Learned From This Movie: That Low-Rises Women's Panties existed in 1954. I speak Sigourney Weaver in original film foreign panties. At least 20 in the first 30 minutes is Misty leisurely taking off and wearing clothes (except for bra and panties, unfortunately). Also includes lurid duplication, leading to a "Look Out! Godzirra!" effect.
