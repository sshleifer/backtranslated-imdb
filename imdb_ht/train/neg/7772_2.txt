This is one movie lowly. It does not have any real plot. We have never been privy to motivation, other than wealth. Characters are some of the worst actors ever to put on film. The threat seems to be supernatural, but then it was controlled by the three older people. Why do they do what they are doing; in order to hit the other members of the group? I do not know. Some water drops from a fog machine that rolls around in the hallways and everyone seems scared of it. Does it do something? I do not know. There are some nodding for its own sake. I'm still surprised to see this in this old movie. Things have actually stayed in this regard these days. Anyway, people are running around like chickens, ready for the ax. They have no plans; no resources; There is nothing. There are approximately five comic points in the movie. Who are these and "is" a ghost or evil spirits. What happened to other people? I challenge anyone who tells me that with any confidence. What a mess.
