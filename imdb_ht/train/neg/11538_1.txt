A really horrible movie that let me feel sullied does not have to look at forty minutes or so I could stand. Do not blame the actors, but writers / directors, producers, financiers, etc., need a very strenuous talking to. Maybe he thinks it's deep. It's not. This rape and ultra-violence, unlike those central mechanisms of Orange, have nothing to say about or add to the sum of human understanding. It's not dog straw, either, where I saw it compared. Instead it feels like something Burke Walker might turn his hand in, but even in saying that I probably was a bit unjust about Pete Walker. <br /> <br /> Revenge is a powerful desire for people, but the room window has more to say about it and boys emasculation than this pitiful effort. <br /> I do not think it's particularly misogynistic, merely too gleeful in its illustrations of certain details - the blood run down GA's rape, by example. It does not matter neither confrontation, though I'm sure the movie makers consider themselves very 'daring', just a deeply unpleasant. <br /> <br /> Do this as a high we can target? Is this why people involved wanted to make movies? (I wrote in here the Latin phrase that translated as the Oh Times! Oh the customs! But the new spell-check on IMDb would not leave my post until I removed it .. Similarly I had to remove parenthesis .Remember IMDb.) <br /> Where is the High Aspiration? The noble impulse? When you look at British films - the happy comedies of Ealing or the Boulting Brothers; Carol Reed works with Graham Greene on Fallen Idol, Our Man in Havana or the Sublime Third Man (a movie that has more to say about evil than a thousand Straightheads); work Powell & Pressburger; or if you want to talk about gender, violence and men 's emaciation look at the "Offense" or Sidney Lumet, from an original game by John Hopkins; Check out "Tunes of Glory" for something worth making, which has something to say. <br /> <br /> Unlike the above, Straightheads is, alas, a waste of cellulose odor.
