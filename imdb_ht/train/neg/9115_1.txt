If you ask me the first one was really the best one. Look at Sara M. G., it is real, mean, cruel girl, look at Amy Adams it's just little fools hanging around. It's nothing! People do not worship it! Second, Sebastian was beautiful and warm in film first, now she is "baby face". History is not that good, and I do not understand. Why did not first make this first, it is the beginning. Loose actor, nothing and history. This is not cruel, this is playing. First one has the best actor, best storytelling, and its means. I think the music is the best of intrusive intelligence 1 and the music is best of cruel intentions 3. It is not the worst movie I've seen, but in its first companion great, great, great there is nothing.
