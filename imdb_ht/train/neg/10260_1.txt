This movie was awful! I rent it does not know what to expect. I watched the first 5 minutes and the movie and knew it was a bomb. The action was bad and there was no draw.The sound is soooooo fo.It growls with its Mouth does not move. Also why would a doctor play a Xylophone to kill the monster.Just plainly does not even waste your time. (1 out of 10)
