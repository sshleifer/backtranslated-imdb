... and it's this movie. I imagine that whether there is a negative drug, the soul souls are tied to a rather comfortable sofa and forced to watch this movie on a continuous village for all eternity. Okay, maybe it's not that bad, but it's probably the worst movie I've ever seen next to "Manos, but in fate" ... and I've seen a lot of bad movies, believe you me. <br /> This is just a movie B movie, bad movie-making of its finest (or is it worst?) The thing I really did not like about this movie is the moron duo to throw in for comedy relief. Now a little comedy relief is a good thing, but most of the movie is focused on the adventures of these two moraines, rather than on the "heroes" of this movie, which are actually in it for less time than them! <br /> <br /> To be fair, Crown International really destroys the movie by adding bad music and making a poor job editing. But honestly, this was probably a bad movie to start with, so Crown really could not have made that much of her hurt. <br /> <br /> This really needs to be in the list below 100. I would not want this one on my worst enemy. <br /> <br /> Actually, it's my kind of Canadian movie B. It's bad, but I still love it, despite my single star rating.
