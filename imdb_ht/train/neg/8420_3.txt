Despite the excellent cast, this is an unremarkable movie, especially from the aviation perspective. It may be a bit better than saving "from Richthofen and Brown", but not much. "Blue Max" remains the best of a walk over the last 35 years while "Darling Lilli" is fun if not taken seriously. It's interesting to speculate what ILM could do with Zeppelins and Gotha in a new, high-quality WW I Aero movie.
