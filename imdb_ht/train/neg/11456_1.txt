This is one of those movies that makes you think: would the Hutan "real American" Hogan do the same thing? Frankly I do not think so and it would be right. I'm Italian, I can not be proud of my country for many reasons, but I would not have been rowed for another team (the French, for example), simply because I'm in love with Juliette Binoche. Besides the protagonist does not fall in love with a British girl at the end of the movie but with a fellow parishioner, so why rowing against Yale. As far as acting concerned, well, all players act very badly. Then, you know, I hated that "dead poet society" atmosphere. In fact, another movie I hate.
