The five starters start as five young girls are driving home in time for the curfew, they stop at a store & accidentally hit another car & decide just to drive through & leave it. Shortly after the other machine is suspended and a crazy woman with a shotgun gets out & joins them, let's take the clothes off & make them peep on them & then randomly drives. Shaking & shocking girls think after they're over but the crazy woman comes back for seconds as it seems intent on killing the frightening and losing girls on gas ... <br /> Greg Swinson & Ryan Theissen Swinson writes the thing & Theissen responsible for the cinematography & corrections I must say that five through the eyes is easy one of the worst movies I've ever seen if not the worst I mean I'm struggling to think of a The movie I saw was worse. Now let me start by saying that I'm sure a lot of the movie-taking decision taken here was deliberate to try and provoke atmosphere, tension, realism & suspense but there is not one aspect of the Five Kill The Eyes That I did not hate it to be honest it looks like a bad home video that was put on YouTube & even then it's still a bit embarrassing & a frankly empty trash in 90 odd minutes of my time that I could do something more fun & fun like pulling my nails out with pliers. The reviews on the Internet seem quite positive, but on the IMDb (the amount of 1 Star Comments is unveiled & they can not be anything wrong, right?) & Its message board that I think is the most of an indicator in what average people think it is absolutely trashed by just about everyone & phrase 'the worst movie I've ever seen' used a few times & to be just most of these negative comments mentioning the same thing & i must agree with them. The story is terrible, Well I suspect it meant to be minimalist but that's minimal? There is no reason or explanation for the events that occur & it just feels totally random. It goes on for ages, the amount of plot here would struggle to complete a thirty minute made for telely program leaving a full length feature. The dialogue is terrible with these annoying girls who do not seem to have a brain cell between them taking on random things & screaming. Oh God Screaming, there are seemingly endless scenes of those screaming or crying or shimmery girls who not only irritate & annoy & prevent any sensible viewer feeling any sort of sympathy for them also doing what they are trying to say almost impossible hear well. Then there's real killer, the movie is all set & shot at the limit of a mini van, seriously the camera never leaves that car & as you can imagine it gets really boring, adds that the low body count In just one person killed on screen & five through the eyes is a movie that I hated with a passion. <br /> At a technical level again I can see that the movie style here was a deliberate choice but I must be honest yet & said Five Through the Eyes is the worst movie I've ever seen. As a fan of my movie I like my movie to look like proper movie as it's a visual medium & I definitely do not want to look worse than the YouTube YouTube video or my home movie shot on a camcorder while I was drinking. It really looks like that amateur & bad, it's a complete horror & I was hated each moment in every second of it. Just think Witch Project in Blair (1999) only ten times worse & sounding & you'll be almost there. There are times when the Five Kill eyes when you literally can not tell what happens or happens because of the camera-work and the level of almost black & black contrast. Violence is also tame with a small wave of blood and a stab at the end. Low rates do not even begin to describe the Five Ahead, and a budget estimated at $ 4,000 is unlikely to be one of the lowest budget films that ever gave a wide release. The two trucks in the movie were owned by members of the production & this basically pretty much the budget really has, their place. The act is very bad by the main cast, I just hate all the fake set on crying & screaming that was not convinced at all but was irritated incredibly. <br /> Five of the eyes will go down like one of the worst films I've ever seen & I've seen a few films, anyone now wondering what the worst movie I've ever seen Five Both eyes will definitely get a mention. I hated it, every single aspect and miserable moments of it.
