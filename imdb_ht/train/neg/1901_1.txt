This review may contain some deflators. <br /> The Renewal of the classic 1974 movie machine runs away in 60 seconds to start well. Actually it is well to act and the plot moves very well. But even a great Hollywood budget does not change the fact that the original plot was more credible. For those who do not know, the original plot stole them as inspectors. Who would suspect them. But even with a change in almost every aspect of H.B. Halicki's original, the remake is a very good movie, until we reach the final chase scene, part of the 74 version that made it great. One of these versions is rolling down, only 10 minutes, and ends in a special monster effect that takes all credibility from the chase. Where the pursuit of the original was very credible, the star was a suppressed driver who made all his own stunt, the renewal fell flat in the past 15 minutes. My advice, if you want to watch a classic classic car movie, the original fine of the bar negotiates in your local rental joints and remains clear of the new renewal.
