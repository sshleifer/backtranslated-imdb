I saw this movie once a long time ago, and I have no idea ever to see it again. This movie is about Preston Waters, a hard-lucked borrower, who seems to be neglected by his family and who always seems to be short on cash. All this changed when a bank robber ran on Preston's bike and passed him a blank check as compensation. Preston uses the check to remove $ 1 million from the bank (ironically, the money that must steal the bank that gave him the paycheck). Preston then bought a mansion and said he was working as an assistant in a mystery and rich backer called Mr. Macintosh (named after his computer). And she just goes crazy with the money. On paper, this sounds like a great idea. However, on screen, it is one of the emptiest movies I've ever seen. For one thing, it's too incredible. I know some parts of the film are meant to be incredible, but I draw the line of a twelve-year-old boy who is going out with a thirty-year-old woman, and was put in charge of someone's fortune imaginative. Also, this was a deep and weak film acting, a predictable trail line and characters less memorable. The characters were either cheesy, on the head, annoying, or underdeveloped. But "Juice" was a funny character. <br /> If you are looking for a good movie to watch with your family, skip this one.
