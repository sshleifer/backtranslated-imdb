"John Hughes' son wrote a high school drama! Wow!" I thought as I checked the flick info here on IMDb, late on a Saturday night, I found myself watching the open credit on BBC2. <br /> I just finished watching it, and sadly it came down to be over. Fascination you can not spoil a movie this poor, but I'll let the spoilers come from this review ... <br /> There is a very awful thing in style on very small substance: unfortunately the style does not have to date too well at eight years since its release. As the substance, the film tries to pose an exciting look at the nature of control of the society of the microcosm of life-life; but under the guise of lightning, a remarkably remotely removable or importantly overlooked material. The characters painted in small children, fell into the kind of father's genealogical stereotypes sought in the question of Club Breakfast. Director Kyle Cooper has done a decent job to keep the speed (possibly relying too much on information gathering, which soon becomes a tedious device, but at least pushes the story together), but its effort is not enough to detect from the poor script with rare casting (as anyone is supposed to side with 'Maddox', when Blake Shields gurts and glows its way to the part, I just can not understand), not to mention the gaping lot of draw hole (I'm all for creative licenses, but when the "bad guys" know the identities of the "good guys" make their lives a misery, but fail to act in any way to stop them, you really need to wonder why this script did not undergo another few re- Drafts before production - did Daddy even read it?). <br /> I'm sure a younger audience might find some fun in this movie (with all the power), but they're really better sticking to Hughes Sr. high school productions. , and if the idea of ​​rebellion-time is what appeals, 1968 classic "If ..." is a much more satisfying examination of the subject.
