This romantic comedy is not too bad. There are some funny things to happen here and there, and some characters are memorable in it. The act, however, is amateur (with the exception of the banker). While some scenes are great fun, others are simply embarrassing. In particular, I found "romantic" part of the poor history. <br /> <br /> All in all, I guess it's worth seeing if you like football and romantic comedy. It's not really a bad movie, and the finish was pretty good. Just do not expect anything out of the ordinary. Fair enough if you have an hour and a quarter to kill.
