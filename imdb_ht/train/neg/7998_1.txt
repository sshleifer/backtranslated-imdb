Not only has she always been annoying to listen, but she has no jokes. I swear, some Asian guy Fobi say they have Momma jokes they've been funnier than Leary's crap. (Well, maybe funny for a couple minutes but at least I'll be able to laugh at least once!) Leary stated he stopped taking drugs while one of her "jokes" ... apparently she was still high on something; it was just some krackhead imprecating to merge mostly related drugs. One of her jokes was something like, 'I would not use crack, especially to have the same name as between my ass' - oh man, how did she come up with one? I swear the only guy who needs to close the f ** k up is Denis Leary. Thank God I did not have to see him live. This guy totally sucks. <br /> <br /> If you're easily amused by swearing, and "joke" where you can come up with yourself, then waste your time with this junk.
