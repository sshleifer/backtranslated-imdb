Richard Dreyfuss is, indeed, in this movie flick but in a rather small part. It is NOT "obsessed" cinema - it's the business / account manager / group. Even the box describes the movie safely. There are no erotic scenes with Sondra Locke, as published, unless one uses the term "erotic" well wound. I would not consider watching the movie Richard Dreyfuss being in it as a major character. I might have, however, I realized that the popular human of the 60, Leonard Cohen of "Suzanne," was an artistic influence. Other than short receipts on the line from the end of James Joyce in "Ulysses", with an interesting visual reference at the end of Ingmar Bergman in the "Seven Seal," I found it a poor attempt to meld symbolic elements and humor to immortalize in film such as "Year of Marybad" and "Un Chien Andalou." If you like the idea of ​​the unique artistic hole, there are many high-quality films, derived from "Bye, Bye, Brasil" in "Cecil B. Demented."
