That's not far from one of the worst movie I've ever seen in my life. I ordered her to watch her after an hour and regret that very hour. The act is horrible and there is almost no scheme. I guess that someone came up with an unusual shape of a creature and started to make a story around it. Borrow some ideas from movies like Resident Evil and Aliens are not the result of a movie like them. if this is going to be a Korean film, I would rather not bother to see even a Korean film trailer ... <br /> <br /> By the way, this movie is a good reason to believe that Not necessarily a high rating means the movie is promising. I think every Korean who has Internet for online banking rated this film on the 8, though there is no sign of what it is about.
