This film does not have a lot of terrible facts with his predecessor "Robot Jox". This must also be the reason why its most common name is "Robot Wars" and not the alternate name "Robot Jox 2: Robot Wars". <br /> <br /> "Robot Jox" was basically a fun movie to watch because it had a good quote of giant robots fighting each other in the near future. This concept was abandoned for this film and instead it presented a totally dull story that is not very original or cunning written. A shame he tried to be so different from his predecessor really, for the other thing might have been a more fun movie to watch. Like "Jox robots" this is a b-movie, but with a great difference that it's just not a very good one. Perhaps this also had and the fact that "robots Jox" did during the '80, when B-Cinema still had a certain bit of charm and grade on it, even though the movie was released in 1990. This really can not be said about this movie. It's just lame, seriously done, poor looking and not interesting enough. It also has a finish that lets you think 'This is it? That's all? '<br /> The movie in its history is lacking is clearly clear mainline-line really. Maybe a good mechanic would have a good idea and some things as a real point in the story, some action, or main character containers. Seriously they thought when choosing the actors for this movie. All of them are simply not likable in their role and especially Don Michael Paul is annoying as the main character, behaving as if it is the gift of women and perfect men who can compete with anyone. Are not they simply able to get the actors from the first movie? <br /> For such a futuristic film, with a concept of having great fighting droids in it, this film surely misses with its actions. Had to put some more and larger actions in the movie, the movie would at least have been a much more fun to watch. Rather now we have a movie that fails to impress in basically all manner of imaginable. <br /> You can better watch a "Power Rangers Mighty Power" episode, for some action and more eyebrows. <br /> <br> 3/10
