If you ever hear these three words say you ... "Joe Don Baker", is afraid ... <br /> <br /> Final Justice is the low budget film based on a sheriff in the Texas town Geronimo (pronounced Heronimo). It is an ugly, slim character, rude about the hunt for a criminal in Malta who killed her partner in Texas. His partner actually slipped down twice in the movie. Very bad correction. Joe Don Baker (Geronimo) ends up in jail like 4 or 5 times in this movie, making the plot go nowhere fast. Plus, it shoots everyone as it is in the wild west. I guess nobody said it was the 20th century. A woman cop is assigned to Malta (similar to Elaine from Seinfeld) and is the only one that can be set up with the redneck. It must be crazy! <br /> <br /> Debris in the bar is the most fun characters in this movie. The dance shows in the movie and I began to bail with the sanding women. Well, at least it was better than watching Geronimo trying to mute his way out of something. The finish is flawed and somewhat predictable, and I was happy it was finally over. You never forget that the last line Joe Don Baker from the movie. <br /> It's so hard to imagine how it was in Bond Three cinema ... very strange! Anyway, if you're up for a laugh, then see this one on MST3K sometime. Also, I heard other bad films (among many), "Mitchell" MST3K versions were released on DVD by Rhino. I can not wait to see that!
