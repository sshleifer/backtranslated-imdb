... I watched it in my teenage years. This movie was mildly fun. What I liked about Soul Survivors was the Gothic atmosphere during the party scene, with the constant bends between 'dreams' and' reality. <br /> <br /> There were no movies like '6th Sense' and 'Don' Look Now 'I'd be amazed by the finish.
