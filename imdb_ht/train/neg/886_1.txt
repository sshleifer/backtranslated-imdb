A few years back to the same people who created Paris, J'TAIME., Which was imperfect but very enjoyable (my rating was a 7), which created this piece of trash on New York City. , I love you (J'taime) created a sentiment for Paris & it did in many parts of beautiful Paris. <br /> In this current movie I did not recognize New York City, I did not feel that I was in town at my birth. New York has 5 boroughs, I saw no scenes in Bronx, or Queens, There's a scene in Brooklyn, (Brighton Beach), I saw no scenes at Times Square or Greenwich Village / No Scenes of the Hotels beautiful or theater. It has a great cast, most of the performers were not even stereotypes, were caricatures of the lowest sort. The little funny moments are all in a sexual nature or quite insult to many good New Yorkers that we all know and love .. A few of the movie premiered 'razzie' They were far better. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> In my opinion I think the title would be <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> < > NEW YORK, I told you.
