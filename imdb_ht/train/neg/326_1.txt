This film Adam Sandler film can be compared to his life as a comedy during the same period of 1989. His constant characteristic skills in his comic hidden genius and frustration regarding comic materials seems to come more out of Sandler than the script. The movie has nothing compared to his blockbuster feature blockade, such as Big Daddy or the same Cowboy Billy Maddison. Unfortunately, Sandler had not yet found a way to express himself in a consistent, successful and humorous way then film made, much like his character. The majority of the "joke" film from Sandler has conversation with herself, usually about her comedy recognizing her talent and beating herself because she is too ugly and can not find women. The film is hard to look too, because it does not treat itself as a real movie. Sandler speaks to the camera and viewers of the movie, often referring to the movie's budget or skeptic content. The movie is finally awkward and embarrassing to watch. I immediately wanted to forget I even saw this movie after it was over, so fear that if more to get out on it, it would ruin Sandler's career. Spending this one up in the video store, I rent it for free and it's always a waste of time.
