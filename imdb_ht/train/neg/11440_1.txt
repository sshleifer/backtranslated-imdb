Otherwise it is one of the worst movies I have ever seen - and I mean ever. My wife and I were both bored from our mind in 10 minutes. Not to mention being boring, it is entirely incredible. Women (not lesbian) do not bathe together - nor are they "accidentally" kissed. Brothers and sisters do not live well in the 30s and run around swing dance and engage in footraces in central parks. Men do not find their romantic siblings kissing the night before the wedding and then never discuss it with wife saying. Absolutely ridiculous. <br /> Heather Graham is possibly the worst actress in today's film. She smiles when she should cry and vice versa. The only movie she had ever been good at is Boogie Nights - and that's because she did not act. <br /> I can not stress enough how bad this movie was.
