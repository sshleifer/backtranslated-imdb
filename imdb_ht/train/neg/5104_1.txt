Now, what's wrong with the actors who participated in that crap? Michael Dorn should stick to Star Treck's merchandise. Jan Diehl, does anyone remind him of Visa Miami? Loved her there ... Well, whichever - what can one expect in a movie and one of the lifeguards from Baywatch in the lead? There is nothing, and that's what we get. None of the characters are even possible, the special effects are hilarious (but not funny). The story is a (very bad) joke. There is no logic for what is happening. I got to feel that the movie makers were trying some kind of "Attack of the Killer Tomatoes" kind of stuff. Especially in the scene where all the important people discussed national security in some kind of closet ... <br /> <br /> If you happen to see it on TV, your TV - channel channels will be ever grateful.
