The first of this movie was decent enough, but with sub parity act, it was just bland and dull. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> So it was a murder he did not like the guy laid out to do it. Also in some flashbacks there is a secret that reveals that sort of events are just as fair to a degree. There is no emotion in this film. The first 20 minutes or so is just this woman called her sister and heard her message. It was dull and boring. <br /> With some polishing, and best acting it could be very good.
