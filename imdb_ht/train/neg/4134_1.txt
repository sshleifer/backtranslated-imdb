I honestly said that I could not stop watching this movie from the second that he started. Just for how bad he was !!! It's like like watching dry paint only a lot more confusing. I mean you sit there and just wait for something to happen, anything in fact, preferably something that makes the movie all make sense! At the end of the movie I actually sat there asking if there was any chance of all I could miss the first hour explaining everything or if I could inadvertently pass out during the movie and missed the parties that stuck the plot (if have in fact one) together! The main thing that really confuses me about this movie is almost the end of the main girl (if there was indeed a main girl) was in some sort of alternating reality, I mean that the hell was going to the this point? All of a sudden she got up, she was in a mental institution, chains in a bed being drugged by a doctor or something, then faster than she would take me to wipe my wrist, it flipped back and she was Get food from some random vampire! it makes no sense sodding! I tempted the musicians and demanded my time back, I mean I wasted 2 hours of my life to watch this garbage! I am interested knowing that the filmmakers themselves actually knew what it was all about! just seemed somebody has edited out all the bits that might have made it meaningful if I think the movie should have had 4hrs time to do that! I am completely neutral with others who wrote the other review, I was duped royally with this film by its title, and that alone. I'm just so grateful I did not actually buy the movie, no matter how many times iv it's in the local book store. You would have thought that would have given me a sign that the movie was a complete pile of waste dump movie, but to be honest I think that Â£ 1 was way too much money to spend on this movie !!!! What a great sodding waste time with a good razor blade, I mean I wish OD'ed, its less painful than watching this movie !!!!
