This film should be number one on 100 below. The act is so awful that when my son and I look it we almost got physical. And the story gets worse. I could go on and off on how bad it is but all I really wanted to have added a frankbob review warning as I see any other person going to the problem to do that again. Do not waste your time, money, energy or anything else on this movie. Thanks to the goodness we've seen on TV so we did not spend anything on it. Had you, I would be forced to write those responsible for this abomination and be obliged to balance an extortion in the general direction. In conclusion, I would like to say that I still enjoy watching Carrie Fisher acting. But I'm sad to say that it's not worth looking at this particular film. Do not spoil your opinion at Carrie by watching it.
