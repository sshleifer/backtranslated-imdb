Ooof! This one was a stinker. It does not fall 'somewhere between Star Wars and Suspense', sure for sure. In fact, it falls somewhere between the cracks of a Wham! videos and Captain EO, only and not as great in a budget, and a lot more UPS close to ugly cries. Simon Le Bon pretends to front and center, while the rest of the band gamely trying to hide the fact that they stole their entire career from the last 3 albums Roxy Music. Short clips from Barbarella add nothing. Avoid all costs. (However, I liked the party when they played 'Hungry Like the Wolf', but why had a tiger cache at the hearing change in a painted woman and tiger band? I mean they do not sing 'the eye The Tiger 'or' Hunger Like The Tiger 'It's a Wolf! Whatever.) A DVD in Duran Duran's video 80s is probably worth a look for the Nostalgia Buggy
