Nicolas Roeg? She has led the classic supernatural comedy DON`T watch now didn't read? The weird film aforementioned broadcast on BBC television on the weekend that screened tonight in the cold air by the grace of all time. <br /> You see it's impossible to compare the SKU and DON`T Sky look now since they both have the same director and the same structure and for the third third in the COURS I thought they had Also even drawn except a dead husband was replaced instead of a dying child, in fact the idea I put on this movie revolve around a widow torn widow seeing her late husband running around Venice wearing a red annor. This does not happen, but about one third of the way in the run run has a massive plot twist and despite being an intricate plot twist it does not explain at any great depth. In fact, very little explains in the COULD sky that breaks the movie <br /> <br /> The people mentioned the output value rather poor in the sky and it's impossible to not notice them. If I did not differ I would think that this was a TVM since he `s got a made for TV feeling in it right down to white capital letters in the title sequence. Roeg also tries to inject artistic pretensions through thinking thought thought but yet this does not help the movie all. Someone can help feel that Roeg would have put all his efforts into the torsion draws that is totally flat on the screen <br /> Good value production, direct interest and a really rare site and scenario for a bad movie
