This pile of sh! T is tied to my book as the worst thing ever has to do. I can not believe that someone actually tainted this CRAP, let alone asserminately did it. HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE. Not even worth mentioning the damn story or any details about it. That's how bad it is actually. Avoid it like SARS!
