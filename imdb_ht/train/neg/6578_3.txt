Dontre, uninvolving hybrid to "bad intent" and "wild things", but it's not nearly as good as either of these min-classic garbage. She's on the acting sheriff, Artie (Hacked Diggs) has been called to investigate a near-fatal drug overdose in a super-class chic uniform, but keep it on the low bottom. As she digs deeper she thinks she's more than her first look seems to be. We follow Alicia, the girl who overlooks the flashlights as well. At about 90 minutes, if this movie was welcomed to begin, it would tear it out. This movie brings absolutely nothing new to the table. But it is the only so far film that has Miss Swain topless so the class is higher just for that. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < Another girl is topless <br /> <br /> Anti-eye candy: more donkey than girls heading
