Creep - "Your trip ends here." There are some very graphic scenes and ... well, yes, it's all about this movie. <br /> No real scheme, no scenario. No pathetic character, well, 'character' is incorrect to consider you do not have a sign that anyone really does. I mean, being chased by some strange things to do 'stuff' in the sewers (which is this thing? Why is it there?), That's quite scary I guess, but I really care? No, I do not. Why not? Because I do not have a sign of these people and I do not know if I should want them to live or die. It's one dimension and depends on gore effects and sounds scary, which it rarely does. This movie lacks any meaning, any reason. It feels like I'm falling asleep and failing out the 45 mins to build. It jumps right into the action. Basically, some women and friends get close to the London Underground, get chased by a strange creature, then they eventually escaped from it. <br /> <br /> Creep has its moments that make you jump, the art is good, the place is excellent and the sounds are OK, but this is not a horrific movie horror, so unfortunately all of that which goes to waste. <br /> <br /> It's nothing new. Another 'predictable' horror, where Kate (the lead character) still makes the stupid "Hey, I know you're very sitting at home thinking I should do this sensible thing in this situation, but no oooh! I'm going to make the total opposite because I'm a dumb blonde "thing. I wish that they would not do that, it did many times, it's boring and becoming predictable. In fact, I'm very annoyed by the comic woman did not get stabbing, her, gray-looking alien. <br /> <br /> "Your trip ending here" is the movie tag line. Well, Creeps tour ends only briefly in the movie. If you had a few beers, got a couple of peers back to you, then be sure, look it's not all to say. But if you want something original and smart, avoid.
