It was Jon Pertwee who said "It's very hard to be funny, but very easy to be funny." Well if this FAST PASTY can be "very easy". David Baker (As Director / Screenwriter) and his cast seems to be under the impression that comedy involves stealing scenes and styles from superior Britcoms like LOCK STOCK .. and TRAINSPOTTING, using a completely underdeveloped script and jumping up Go down in a very loud voice very loud. Alan McCaffrey especially suffers from OTT's performance but is not enough to break the movie because he does not have enough of a movie of ruin. <br /> <br /> PASTY FACES is awesome on all screens especially scriptwise. I could not understand why he finished the way he did, he just seemed to stop in a very abrupt way and unusual way. Oh and other blatant mistakes that you need a visa to visit the USA with a green card in order to work - This movie would have you believe you can get on an airline and start a new life in America without any authorization - that you still get paid to America in America - Those I know in America, and who say I have paid for donations have been suspended several years ago - and that you can buy any kind of weapon from a gun shop. As far as I know gunshot in America differs from the state state but there is no gun shop selling anti tank tanks on the counter. So we've got a very erroneous view of America from a very real and oh so unfunny movie. Perhaps this revenge for BRAVEHEART is a very Hollywood look at the Scots? Maybe, but that does not stop PASTY FACES from being a crap comedy
