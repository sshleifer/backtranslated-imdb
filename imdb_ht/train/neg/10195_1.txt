The film / director of this film obviously does not know anything about film. I think the DP on this project was tied and replaced with a monkey, because each saw was either too dark or had hot hot spots than the sun. <br /> <br /> The story was terrible, the characters were very one dimension. For someone who said that this film was made for poker fans and not movie fans, that someone is kidding their own (it was probably the writer / director). No poker fan in this world likes this movie. Even the money you hate this project. Go to a casino and play a few hands by giving you the experience of writing about poker. Keep your day work. But if it is playing poker, then you must hurt'n.
