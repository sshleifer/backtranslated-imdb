When I first saw this movie, it was called TERROR on a train and the half was back to a double feature. Glenn Ford, a gun expert called on broadcasting a hidden bomb on a busy train with high explosives. The tension is slow and steady; and this black & white film runs only about an hour and twelve minutes. All these years later on television; Tension and drama have lost most of its impact. This is still a good movie as far as early 50's standard goes. <br /> Together with Ford are Anne Vernon and Maurice Denham. The villain / saboteur played by Victor Maddern.
