During the Civil War, there were many loyalty cases; Obviously, many occurred "in the frontier states", where North met South did not reach geography. From the border, young Owen Moore goes to join the Union Army. Temporary Confederate Henry B. Walthall, separated from his regime, wanders over the enemy's property, desperate for water; she finds a spare time where Union Unionis Gladys Egan is sitting. When the Yankee soldiers followed him down, Innocent Little Gladys helped the hidden comfort. And when he returned to kill his father, the girl's kindness was remembered. A sweet little story of director D.W. Griffith. Where feet and humankind are revealed with love. <br /> <br /> **** in the border states (6/13/10) D.W. Griffith ~ Henry B. Walthall, Owen Moore, Gladys Egan
