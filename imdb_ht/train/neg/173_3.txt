A decent end, but do not pack the punch in the original. A senarist (Judd Nelson) kills individuals who identify their new identity in order to direct his own CABIN by the LAKE. Still innocently killing, but the film looks very much in a tongue-in-cheek. Any humor is not the kind of comic. Total projects seem to have the quality of a quickie and at times Nelson is way over the top. This movie is about a script written before you go to the screen ... this should happen to this script.
