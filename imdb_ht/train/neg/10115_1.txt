I made it my personal mission to go after the person responsible for this movie. I even had the rental company to return my money because I argued that they committed false advertising. <br /> It's not enough that the movie itself is a p.os.s., but the art covered is what sells me. I did better make-up effects on my kids in Halloween than what the movie actually shows against the cover art. Can you say "raccoon eyes?" <br /> I will not waste more in my time by going to the full details, but coming over, the main character movie is a LA cop who was born and raised in Alabama - but it has a German accent! It's beyond insult.
