When I read back to the DVD case, I thought it sounded really interesting ... so ... I had my mom dropping it in piles of movies in the section "4 for 20 dollars" in Blockbuster . When we got home and popped in the movie ... twenty minutes into it, we find ourselves turning to each other "this sucks. Let's put in something else." I'll admit, a few of the lines from the friends of the coffee made us smile a little. But come on, at least get some decent actors! Every once at a time in a movie, if the act is bad and the movie will not be at a slow pace slowly and actually looks interesting, I can bow it out and get a few laughs of how they're on (or bottom) to make the lines. But I can only take a lot. Crying scenes looked like the actors had hysterical passage of laughter, there was no delivery for the lines ... amateur did not even come close to acting in this movie. <br /> Anyone who came here she said that this movie was good about some good drug items while watching the movie. It's the most pointless thing I've ever been to scorn in watching. DO NOT observe or buy this photo !!!!!
