I was duped in seeing this movie after reading a positive review from another web site and I was p.o'd !!! it took me at least 15 minutes to pick it up in the b / c shelf I did not want anyone to see me. Then another 10 minutes build the courage to take it to the counter and actually use real money to rent it. I thought that all stress I would pay by the time I got home and watching the movie b / c the review I said the movie was a nice surprise; what a joke! if you can do it in the first hour of the movie then you're lucky! b / c it does not until then turn the movie into a horror. Do not bother and as such one, better you watch "dankness falls"
