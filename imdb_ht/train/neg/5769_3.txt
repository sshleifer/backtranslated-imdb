Elephants Dream has assumed the boat project in the open source community. And while it was a very interesting idea of ​​concept, in fact it had failed miserably. The movie is very well rendered, which is probably the only factor redeeming. A great problem with them, however, is the vast overruse of light bloom. It's awful, although I guess it helps give the movie a dream quality. <br /> One thing to remember is the terrible voice acting. While the proye's voice actor is at least semi-competent, Emo's voice actor is horrific. I guess when you have a budget that basically amount to zero, you can not afford to hire real voice actors. For me it seems like they were hired one of the audience to make his voice. As a whole, the movie does not really go anywhere. For me it looks like it's more of a "look what we can do" kind of movie instead of a real movie. The plot goes nowhere and fails to really show any interesting point. The whole movie feels like it did as an excuse to make interesting places looking. <br /> Overall, it can be a quick download at the official site, but does not expect anything except beautiful graphics.
