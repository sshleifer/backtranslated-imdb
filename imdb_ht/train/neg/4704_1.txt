A very bad attempt at a spinal cord. At least the music of spinal tapes was good. <br /> This is really a very sad case of Hollywood nepotism in its worst. A bunch of Hollywood exams, bad makers and producers create some "poopie" shows that kids can be in the spotlight. Oh please !!! The bathroom humor was even bad. I hate this when the kids are really incredibly talented (musicians, actors and artists) from the butcher's bustin are successful and this crap comes along. <br /> <br /> Help u all !!!! Why was not Gene Simmons in it ??? The Ameriac Taste of Entertainment will descend the toilet.
