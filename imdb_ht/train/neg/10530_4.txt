Dissected music version of "Anna and the King of Siam" Margaret Landon, himself filmed in 1946 with Irene Dunne and Rex Harrison, Deborah Kerr was cast as a widow's disbelief and mothers traveling from England to Siam in 1862 to accept work as many King's tutors - and maybe teach Royal One something or two in the process! Stagy pictures begin well, but quickly lose energy and focus. Yul Brynner, repeating his stage triumphs as the king, is a commander, but used - for each story to concoct - as a buffalo. Kerr maintains its fresh dignity and fares, although there are lip-fifths in the Marni Nixon. Maybe already played that part of death, Brynner seems to have had nothing left for the screen translation except bombs. The second half, with Anna and the Moppets riding a music version of the "Tom's Uncle's Cabin" is quite ridiculous, and the songs Rodgers and Hammerstein are mostly lumbering. Brynner won an Oscar best actor, but it is Kerr celebrity who holds this bauble above water. Overlong, heavy, and 'old-fashioned' in the worst sense of the theme. ** from ****
