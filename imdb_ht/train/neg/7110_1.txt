Well, one gave the credit director for how gutsy it was. Gutsy would be the right term. Not only did he use a total cast of five people (no spending at all), but he also decided to use sub-par special effects and a confusing and boring scheme, he too, and I'm not joking, wearing a warning at the beginning of the movie that you might die in affairs !!! However, they promise a FREE COOOFFFFFFFIIIIINNNNNN. For you to have a climb creepy climb is always a good move. Yaaa-unique-aaawwwwnnn .... <br /> <br /> If you look at Mystery Science Theater 3000, you might have seen this. They like to show horrible movies, just let you know. <br /> A good gift for someone you hate.
