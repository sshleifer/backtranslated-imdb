One of the worst movies ever. Not funny, poor TV style movies, bad acting. Sad to see many famous actors old barely able to walk, let alone act. Take girls Nancy Young can not act. Terrible direction. Sub-par with bad TV movies. Occasional weak jokes fell flat. Even the basic quotes of the film make no sense. Somehow they are supposed to stop a marriage from passing but there's no logic behind their actions. Slow rhythm made my wife stop watching but I suffered from it. The old guys are supposed to act like they are young and horny, but it comes as pathetic instead of comic. How did they get the money to do this?
