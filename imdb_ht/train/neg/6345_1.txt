This film is just an excuse for the writer to make a movie out of 2 failed scripts. <br /> <br /> Its character is just a assembly of characters and tragic clickers or funny attributes of the sum of which is neurotic dialogue as only Woody Allen could write. Woman loves this because she likes to look into the mirror for enjoying this film probably <br /> this cinema was not enjoyed by me however because there was no chase machine and also the movie did not have any battle. There was also no chief drugs or gang banged. Not to mention a lack of snakes. This movie had no snakes. Not my cup of tea and maybe your ether so think about what I said before you find yourself watching this movie. Unless your neck looks like a woman has problems posing problems people enjoy having sex with the city and mcbeal allies then this is significant for you.
