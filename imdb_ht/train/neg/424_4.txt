Yesterday was Earth Day (April 22, 2009) in the United States and other countries, and I went to see the full-featured movie-version of "Earth" by DisneyNature. I guess, like the auto manufacturers, Disney is trying to convince us that they care about the planet. Maybe they really care about the planet, I do not know, but I do not think it guarantees a special unit with the word "nature" of it. I know that my younger daughter loves Mickey Mouse, and who am I to say one year old personal feelings about Disney? Aside from incredible cinematography, it was a typical Disney deception for me. First of a dozen Disney trailer trailers, luxurious and Disney cliche ("circle of life", "fall and style"), sub-dramatic music, reclining footage (Disney claims "40% new foot"). I even started thinking of James Earl Jones narration getting a bit boring. I love James Earl Jones, but his work for Disney and Morgan Freeman makes each Warard's Narrative Brother begin to wear thin. I really think Disney bought some BBC nature photography that was so spectacularly done, they felt it would sell itself if they slapped some orchestral music and recognized sound-bite on it. <br /> And what is Disney's mania and showing predatory chase and killing baby animals? There were a half dozen scenes, filled with brilliant youth on the way to getting throat to tear out. I think Disney needs to recognize that the animals have a rich and exciting life outside of life and struggle struggles that appeal to action-film oriented adolescents who have dragged this film by their parents. I also knew how Disney stopped sharply from the man who had nothing to do with climate change. Are they so scared for the small minority of the last ones that they think it's still a controversial topic? <br /> I recommend skipping this one and renting the Blue Planet DVDs on Netflix. Nature films seem to be best done by the British at this time.
