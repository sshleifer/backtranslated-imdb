No word to explain how bad NIGHTMARE WEEKEND is. It simply defies description. Something about a computer that can change personal objects into silver balls that enters the victim's mouths, which kill them or turn them into zombies. Everything is so wonky that it's stunning. There is also a girl with personal computers in her room and the computer talks through a hand puppet !!!!!!!! I do not do this up. The computer also controls things like machines, though there is nothing that connects the computer to the vehicle. <br /> <br /> The "movie" is total waste. Use Garbage Trash. Spectacular, one-of-a-kind bad litter. There are a lot of sex scenes thrown here and there, not very hot or erotic. There's even a scene where a woman shamelessly makes love or wants to kiss a tarantula, which made me roll on the floor. <br /> <br /> Definitely one of the worst films ever made. Reaching with video boards with no sad, but BOYING II (both NIGHTMARE WEEKEND and BOOKING II have a scene with a toothbrush!). At least it's fun to watch it and try to make sense of whatever happens.
