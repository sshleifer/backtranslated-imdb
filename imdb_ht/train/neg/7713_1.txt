I knew this movie was supposed to be so bad it was funny, so I went to him and that waited. I just found it to be so bad it was boring. The whiny theme song is funny for about 10 seconds, until you realize nothing intelligent about it except its intentional irritating quality. Seeing things get splattered with tomatoes getting old in about 30 seconds. There is just nothing intelligent or funny about the movie except for the quote. He could sustain a comedy 3-4-minute comedy, but this is just not a feature film by any stretch of imagination.
