This movie was very well publicized. I'm an avid movie star and saw the movie previews for months. While I was somewhat skeptical of how funny this movie would actually, my friends thought she was going to be big with hyped me about it. Then I went and saw it, and I was leaning in my chair almost asleep until I remembered that I was paying for that movie. I made myself laugh at most of the stuff in the movie just so I would not feel bad and destroy the good mood I was in, plus I wanted to get my money out of the movie! I'm always going to a movie with an open mind, not trying to go through too much expectations, but this movie was not funny. Now it was not the worst movie I've ever seen, but it's definitely worth waiting for HBO. If you havent see a lot of forecasts for the movie or your dear romance and coral comedy you can enjoy it, but for true comedian comedian fans. Perhaps even check out the Comedy Kings again. Something told me to see meeting parents instead !!!
