I saw this movie primarily to see Brooke Burke (as Jill), whom I met shortly in LA in a fashion show show, in her first feature film. I was hoping to see more of it, but thought he did very well his role. Since it is such a beautiful TV host and positioning, and models, it was not surprising. I left wondering why he died, and what happened as a result. Perhaps I just miss it. <br /> I was not really sure about the genre of this movie, and although I liked the actors I felt like she was for a college hearing. I tried to keep an open mind considered horror was not my favorite genre, but felt like I had invaded the gags. It seemed to steer out in some places, leaving you guessing in some places on what the evil teacher might have and, as a lot of other films had a satisfactory end. <br /> <br /> Having written a couple of scripts, I know a lot of this is difficult and can go down in personal opinion, how many films you've seen & studied, and those you are dealing with in a point in time. <br /> In a nutshell, I find it interesting, but not a plot to meet and end up for me. If Jill (Brooke Burke) would have returned to the portal to the end and kick all donkeys that would be a satisfying end and would earn a higher rating.
