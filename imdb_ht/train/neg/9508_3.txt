This movie looked like it was going to be really funny. I was very excited to see her but she was very disappointed. It was very unrealistic. The plot was also very weak. I was expecting it to be really funny but the jokes were not the same ones. I was also really disappointed with the finish. I would not recommend this movie to anyone.
