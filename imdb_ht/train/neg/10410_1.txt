This is a confusing and incoherent mess in incoherent scenes of boring dialogue and monologue. This is not exaggeration: you have to make a great effort even trying to get involved with it. <br /> <br /> I sincerely thought Fassbinder would do something interesting in order to tell why Erwin / Elvira suicide at the end, but instead, in every stage someone tries to explain: "when he was this young man, this happened ... "and" he just returned from Casablanca and ordered to cut everything down ... ", etc. <br >> <br /> Soon in the movie, Erwin / Elvira is in a house killing talking to a whore friend (certainly a killing house is the best place for a little cute cat), and while telling him the story of Elvira's life, Fassbinder shows killing one cows after the other. It is difficult to choose between the disturbing images or what the transvestite is saying. Of course we come to the symbolism very strongly and coarsely in "I have suffered so much in my life, and I'm about to die". In one of the sparse moments where actually happened something, Erwin / Elvira meets a former lover, that only after a very gay choreographer and two other men (as if going for the necessary level of homosexuality) is that he recognizes Elvira . Some interesting and intense vaccine, I must admit (as the tile tells the story of Erwin's youth), but everything about the film is wasted due to Fassbinder's self-indulgence.
