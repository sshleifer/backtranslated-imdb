This film tells the story of Extroversiate Frannie suddenly returning to Sil Hope going to friends and relatives, but unaware of her mother's death. His sister ran home to the family, but the idea was to sell it and move with her new husband. Frannie strongly objects to the idea, and promised to keep the family legacy as it was, not finding a job and keeping responsibility. <br /> In coming beautiful Ruben and the two will fall in love (as you do), and it comes from this point that I sort of losing interest .... There are more of Farrah Fawcett than just the blonde hair and looks , he can show a very compelling character when he puts himself in it - and is certainly proven here as well as some of his previous efforts as extreme and small sacrifices - a great performance from the legendary angel of the legendary. Whether Hope is the kind of movie that never represents away from its cheap and cheerful TV images, and you know there was a limit to the budget, but it's not the worst movie ever made. Positive aspects are there; you just have to find them.
