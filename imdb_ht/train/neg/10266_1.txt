1st view 11/07/2004 - 1 out of 10 (Dir-Jon Keeyes): Over-the-top rehash of 70 supposed horror cops as Friday 13th (version 1 to all?). I can not think of many redeeming here except (or can I think of anything?)? The story revolves around a bunch of stupid people listening to a radio program a year after some kids were killed in the woods as a 'homage', supposedly. But now, one of the stupid people has connection to the current event because his sister was one of the murdered people (again, how stupid this would even be part of this). Guess what? The assassin is in it again and we're tipped off from the very beginning that it is (so have to go any mystery too). And besides all this, where the 'cops' and why not someone called them. I can not believe that this movie was funded by someone and made. You would think that by now American people might be judging a little higher, at least in their movie-gone experiment, but not so this moviecast.
