Generally I do not like films directed by Sydney Pollack (the "Firm" were a bit of an exception) and I've never been a Robert Redford fan either. Still, I thought "Three Days in the Conductor" should be good because of the number of praised comments he received. Although the panoramic sinus is quite fun for the eye and Max von Sydow doing a great job as a professional disaster assassin, I have found the whole affair very disappointing. The film definitely spreads parasite atmosphere, but everything is lost to both the lure scheme that does not seem to make any sense. The movie also has one of the most satisfactory terms I've ever seen which really let the viewer hang in the air. And what can one say about absurd romance between Redford and Dunaway? I would rather rather watch any of Hitchcock's films five times in succession than to sit in this piece of waste once more.
