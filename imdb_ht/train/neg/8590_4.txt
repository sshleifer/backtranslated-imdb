Ludicrous. Angelik 9-year-old Annakin turns into 19-year-old Anakin blat, who somehow seems to appeal to his 5-year-old Amidala. Now, 22-year-old Jedi mighty war hero Annakin has a couple of bad dreams, and so take to kill his children, his friends, and the whole foundation of his existence because an old man craves to convince him a) wife costly it might really die, and b) only it can prevent it. Ludicrosity squared. <br /> I think those who love this movie do not pay attention. The story is ridiculous. The incredible characters (literally, not the essence of perverted in "fantastic", "wonderful", etc.). Obi-Wan Kenobi was the wise and kind in the whole series, but in the climax, he hack off Annakin's leg, allowing him to burn in the larva and let him suffer. No one thinks it's a little out of character? Not to mention it was very stupid to take a chance on it living, as it turns out. <br /> I was expecting at least one story that showed characters consistent with possible motivation. None of that here. The story could be written by a 10-year-old. <br /> <br /> Oh yeah, the CGI is pretty cool.
