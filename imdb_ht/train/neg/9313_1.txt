This is by far the worst movie my lower budget horror ever seen. I'm an open minded guy and I still love a good horror movie. In fact, when I rent movies I specifically look for some good movie movies. They are always good for a laugh, believe I know, I've seen so much. But this movie was just so terrible it was not worth a chuckle. I was thinking of turning it around in the first five minutes ... which I probably should have. There is nothing good about it, first and foremost, the camera crew suck3d A $$. The intro was stupid just like the finish. Acting with special effects was terrible. Please, I ask you, do not watch this movie, you will absolutely hate it.
