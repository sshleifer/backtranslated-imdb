If this movie was worse, it would be headed by Uwe Boll. This nonsensical mess made Ed Wood look like Hitchcock. It had been a while since I saw this steamer steam, but I remember that I wanted to hurt the bodily ill of those involved. How can anyone give this movie any more than 1 star amazes me in the mercy of those who saw this thrill. I give it one star because there is not a lower rating. All copies of this film should burn the sown soil and salt and reserve as a dump for the most toxic waste. No, they should keep a copy of ultra hi security and show only movie musicians as an example of how to do it.
