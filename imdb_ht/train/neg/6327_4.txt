I thought this movie would be a lot better then it was. He sounded as a proof off of the spy generator, and the start of it reminded me of Pleasantville, but this movie came short. <br /> <br /> The plot is just ridiculous. The KGB and the Soviet Union in Russia started up a spy school to teach their spyware 'how to act like the Americans but the town they set up for training is a bit date, so they grab YAN out in the US spice stuff up. I do not know, but this looks just out there. It becomes really odd when the next none of this entire Russian city speaks in an accession to Russia. Someone is aiming at the casting work. <br /> Also, for a comedy this is painfully dry. There are only two funny spots, and they have nothing to sing and dance on. The movie at the end likely to put you to sleep. <br /> And, as a tight punch in the face, this movie is so pro the US it makes me sick. The movie keeps saying and again, the US is God and Russia is the devil. This is the kind of test campaign that has made against the Japanese in World War II. It's a movie like those that make everyone think that the US is all over. <br /> This gets a 4 out of 10, and I'm kind of. It should really get one, but the dance scene was funny, but then again it dragged away long to be really funny.
