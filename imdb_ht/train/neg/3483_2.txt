Surviving Christmas (2004) Ben Affleck, James Gandolfini, Christina Applegate, Catherine O 'Hara, Josh Zuckerman, Bill Macy, Jennifer Morrison, Udo Kier, D: Mike Mitchell. Dumped by his girlfriend, a hotshot yuppie does not want to be alone on Christmas to decide to return to his boyhood home, imposing the dysfunctional family that now lives and bribes poses as his family. An obnoxious performance with one dimension by Affleck, who mostly acts with a flashy smile, makes his character come off as a mentally unbalanced creep, but Gandolfini and O 'Hara breathe some life into this mess. Even for masonry, its sultiness lumbering, does not make much sense of scene scenes, and sentimental messages are as silly as Grimes Affleck. 91 min, rated PG-13. * Â½
