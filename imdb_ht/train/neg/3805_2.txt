Err ... this movie sucks. A lot. <br /> I've read some of the other comments. Apparently there are a lot of people who think anything Woody Allen writes or the star is automatically good ... <br /> I watched several of his films, in the prospect hopeful that I miss something. But no, they just suck. Wrong file writes. The characters are all very stereotyped (not to mention rather stupid). The plot is ... I think it's supposed to be mysterious. Not sure about that. Character Mr. Allen is ... Woody Allen, on any other movie you've seen in it. <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of Woody Allen, go see this movie. If you are under 50, do not bother. (If you are a fan of Woody Allen AK or under 50 ... well, you're atypical. I do not know what to say.)
