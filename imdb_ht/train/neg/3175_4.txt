"So there is this bride, you see, and it gets broken into the death of this image that falls on it on the day of her marriage. Then find this, a year later, her former fianc√© falls into love with a nice psychic ?? and then that cute psychic gets haunted by the ghost of the bride who died mistakes who want to keep him from stealing his boyfriend ... she read it will be hilarious! " chuckling. This I like to consider, is how Jeff Lowell, the man who dreams up "on his body," presents his concept of the studio exams on the New Cinema line. The great mystery is how these same corporate bigwigs might then turn right and light the green project, allowing Lowell to direct the movie as well as write the scenario. <br /> If you think that no movie can ever be as bad as this original sound award, then clearly you have another thought coming. The only way in which it might be to work is whether the writer simply went crazy with it and returned to a no-hold satirical masking mask. Instead, wanting to ensure that he delivers a soft, harmless and romantic comedy healer, Lowell engages in boring half steps every step of the way, tamping down the absurdity in favor of conventional drab. Indeed, "on his dead body" so well inept and unfunny that it's hard to know where exactly Lowell thought she was going with her. Virtually every set-up, jokes and gags in the film is flat-footed and poorly executed, and even the actors themselves seem to be aware of their situation. How else to explain the performances of the murders of Paul Rudd, Eva Langoria Parker, Lake Bell and Jason Biggs in their various roles? I do not choose to blame the actors, some of whom have proven their talent in the best of the past (this is particularly the case with Rudd). But Lowell and those bulk studios have some 'splash' done.
