This movie was late at night when I saw it. It was interesting at the beginning but it did not convince me as a whole. I do not have Tyson fans. In fact I do not like boxing at all. It's barbaric, obscene and double faced (by corporation) that some get the money to beat each other up. But I felt the start of the movie was OK. Actors are well, especially George C. Scott (as Cus D'Amato). I do not know how serious the flick is. I have not read books and books on Boxing or Tyson. I do not know anything about the man, but it was quite fun. <br /> <br /> As the movie goes on I felt it lost a little of his charm and I also lost interest. I managed to stay awake though but the last hour was just not good enough.
