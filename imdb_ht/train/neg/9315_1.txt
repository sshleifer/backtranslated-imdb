This movie was so bad! It was awful! It was awful! I can not stress it enough! Acting, directing, history, character and everything about it was bad! It was so corny and clever. Do not be fooled by the cover, or the tagline "Texas Massacre" has nothing to laugh at. " Are you frogging 'kidding me! It was ridiculous. <br /> <br /> The first 2 minutes of the movie is good until it gets Brendan's main character, OK now turn it off. What I got in the movie was, A bunch of ugly people, harassed and immaturized people went to a cabin in the middle of the woods and a clown that sang kindergarten kills killed in inhomogeneous and fake ways. This movie was a waste of time and money, and it would be a waste of your money and time too! I fast forward to most of the movie because it was so awful, I just wanted to see how every bad actor was dead, and still not worth it! Just look at the lid is a waste of time. This is the worst movie ever! Rating: Do not deserve one.
