I love a lot of actors / actresses involved in this project being insulted by the movie felt even worse than using an unknowns .The main issue was this movie was clearly just a concept that was created to appeal to baby boomers .In 20 or 30 years Nbc will probably make a movie just like this about the early 90s. I can see it now a black family where children are involved in the riot and the white family have rebels and listen to rock music .Root will feature strips like Nirvana, NWA, enemy enemies, Soundgarden etc .. Movie as this will be just as cheese as the 60 and i gurantee you NBC will do it .See the biggest problem with piece period when making network purchases is that when you live in a certain period of time you do not think i live in 60 or decades is retro trend at the time .Next time someone does something like this should put more weight into the project
