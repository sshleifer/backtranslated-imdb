Janeane Garofalo was extremely public in his disbelief on this film, calling it, among other things, anti-feminist. She also said on her radio show she was hating her "romantic comedy" because she did not believe in them. I wholeheartedly agree with Janeane here. This movie is a wasted at best. He does his best, but in general, he's just another boring, incredible "romantic comedy" that has no base in the real world. Whereas some people will say "stop your disbelief", one grows tired of having to stop it almost every time you get a romantic movie from Hollywood. Janeane's character, for some reason, usually is filmed in shadow and darkness, making it look unattractive, while Uma's character was filmed in lighter tones (which probably displeased Janeane and is probably one of the reasons why she filmed this movie a). That really hurt me the movie if you are to buy the house that Janeane should assume the best of it. As many have said here and other comments, Janeane is not ugly, but in fact, quite nice. I did not read one review that someone said Uma was the best looking. Having said that though, I believe that Character Ben Chaplin would be more likely to stay with Uma, not Janeane. Many men do not like really intelligent women (and many women do not like really smart people), and sadly, Ben would probably stay with Uma. And despite the attempts by the director to make Janeane unattractive, he does not work. Her natural beauty comes in any way. <br /> I think a lot of Janeane's male fans are obsessed with her like this movie because they like to think of themselves in the character of Chaplin Ben, and actually scoring with Janeane. Janeane is a lot more complicated than the character he plays here (real life is still much more complex than Hollywood can imagine), so take a cool cold shower. This is the Janeane role that is best known for, and that is a shame, as this really is not good in a movie.
