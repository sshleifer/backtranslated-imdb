Well, finally came to notice last night in London, hilarious involvement, sex and devoid of any real humor. I do not really know where to begin, also I was entertained by this strange homage, he did not really move me. The act is screamingly hammy, no original music, the costumes far too 'Disney' have a ridiculous 'six months later' insert after burning in Nic Cage (which did not come soon enough for my liking) bit and cages at the Bear Costume had the grueling audience as did the comedy punching out of the various 'baddies' on the island. It is such an unusual remake that I cant believe I saw it, and reminded me of something that the comic strips would feature in the eighties, a bit like the Hollywood interpretation of the Miner's Strike, very strange!
