One wonder why anyone would try to rehash successful film cemetery that has already been seen, as it's in the case with this movie. The "Wedding Date" is one of the best examples of why not even try to notice, under the guise of a new story, something that should have been left alone. If a project like this goes ahead with the honchos' great studio approval, then go all out with great stars and brilliant production values, in this way people will come to the stars. <br /> <br /> Alas, this is not happening in this attempt at comedy. The problem seems to be the way the screen writers transplanted the story in London, when basically, this seems to have a typical American situation that does not even the environment will be able to fix. Then there is the problem with the stars. Debra Brass and Dermot Mulrooney? They have as many chemistry as oil and vinegar! <br /> Since the card and Nick have no controversy from the start, the viewer does not pull in the movie as the creators thought they should. It is clear that Kat will fall for Nick, and vice-versa in this predictable story. Amy Adams, who was the best advantage of "Junebug", comes across as a deep girl who wants to keep his lie going on and does not come clean by the man who loves her, she will marry her. <br /> <For anyone interested, credit to the end of the movie runs for nearly seven minutes!
