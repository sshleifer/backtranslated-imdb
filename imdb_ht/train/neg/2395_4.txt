Will that be by the director as not Look Now or Time? Poor <br /> act, clown edited. You only have to compare the various crash scenes in this and the similar way by looking Now See how Roeg has lost it <br /> touch. <br /> The same is generally true of Teresa Russell (looking a bit rough these days, I'm afraid reports) can not save this one. The plot is the best pseudo-religious hokum, the act is tantamount to the Roeg in his trademark usage at the time of deplorable. <br /> <br /> Avoid this one as the epidemic.
