I think everyone was quite disappointed with this sci-fi arrow. For one thing, it was directed by Tim Burton. Another thing, it's a remake of what's supposed to be a classic. I found it boring, gross, and ridiculous. If you've seen it, you know what I mean. Just about everyone in Imdb say it's crap and boy, they're right! If not, avoid it. It's a snorer. 1 out of 10.
