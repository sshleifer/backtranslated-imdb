First up this film, according to the Slick said she won "Best Movie" at the "Worldfest" Film Festival in Houston, Texas. Hmmm had a quiet year. <br /> <br /> Would not call this the worst movie ever, but it certainly sucks, it's pretty much as terrible as other classic Aussie B "melted body", but at least that movie did not look as he shot on HI 8 video. <br /> <br /> I guess are the movie makers, watch a lot of Troma movie, and really bad B movie Gore movie, thinking that they too might crack in the movie releasing this movie. <br /> <br /> Do not get me wrong, I like real movie films, Just the fact that some of the characters put on false American accents, almost as if doing so would give them more chance to sell it to their states or something. Really disappointing to finish as well, the confrontation could be way more interesting, and some good battle scenes. You can fully see that the movie makers are trying to copy "Bad tastes" with all the car blast, rocket launchers, and endless amount of people being inflated down, but the final lacking any on the top humor, or style "bad taste". <br /> If you like watching movie really bad movie, or interested in film no-budget is done, look it, otherwise stay away.
