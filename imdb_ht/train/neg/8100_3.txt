Mouth of Vanities are a soaked film in sweat flop. I can remember that no film has been tried so hard to be so unrelentingly outrageous, provocative and vital, but that's so far across the board. It's such a funny comedy that is not getting laughed, but it can not leave the scene. The harder movie tries, most of every attempt at a laughing result in a retounding thud. The desperation of the films shows so blatant it almost rouses mercy for all those involved. The film realizes street-out-forced status only twice. Once in the eye of Geraldo Rivera is playing an obnoxious, arrogant and amoral television television journalist - which is funny only because he apparently does not realize he's playing himself. The other scene that deserves to be laughing is the final movie "great moments," where the judge played by Morgan Freeman delivers the testimony testimony about what morality is ("it's what your mother teaches!"). The pomposity at this time is insulting to the point of being absurd. But one must admit it is a noble effort. He has a good, if wrong cast, band of actors, who try to make characters out of thin caricatures cartridges. The film looks like professionally made with Cinematic's little flourish that director Brian DePalma just loves to notice, if not particularly effective. But the movie, which apparently wants to make a comment on modern and ethical morals, never reaches the highest level of cartoon. Satire requires style. Farce requires energy. Even sitcom requires distribution. But the best bonfires can be surprised is despair. In the end, you do not want to laugh, you just want to turn away.
