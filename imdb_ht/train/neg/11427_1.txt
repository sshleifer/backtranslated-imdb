I do not know what Sue Kramer, this film director is, but I have a strong suspicion that A) she's a lesbian and B) she somehow shame everyone who participates in this project to participate in proving by omofob. <br /> I can imagine thinking of everyone, "my God, this is horrible .. Not funny .. Pedestrians but keeping their mouths shut for fear they will be labeled anti-gay or they" do not get " (This is probably why Kramer does NOT throw gay men to play gay men too.) Anyway, it's not even worth reviewing. All actors are directed to play each stage completely on the head so there is no sincerity or credibility It's all done and nothing about this movie is the little bit fun - much less funny. <br /> I hated it and I'm not afraid to say that. The inflation that gave Kramer the money to make this bomb was not as fair in the judgments.
