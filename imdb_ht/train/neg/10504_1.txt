I could not look more than 14 minutes into it. It's a GREAT combination of really bad acting and really bad directing. The vaccines used are disgusting, breaking 180 degrees angle all the time. My head hurt to try to load the "you know what". Dust on the "Mystery Machine" window will let you see light from the lighting on the windows ... annoying. What else ... it's so badly framed all the time it just makes you want to cry in that lady lady has. I only direct short films, but I'm pretty sure I'd have way better than that of a movie feature .... The story is incredible, just the French scene kissing at the start telling you it will have very terrible. So pretty much, try to avoid this really bad movie at all cost, it will save you 5 bucks or for the rental, and that 1h30 hours in your life you will never get back.
