When I saw this trailer on TV I was surprised. In May 2008 I was at Six Flags in New Jersey and this was shown in a 4-D attraction (you know, the attraction that place to move). I took her version that I saw was a shorter version (15 min.) And also was re-created to add effects. It was a beautiful movie ... but that was it. It was educated and told about the first mission, but at the end of a space spat CGI seemed a bit ... well ... trite. I was not a big fan of the movie but I would recommend this movie to any parent wanting to inform the kids in a fun way about the first moonwalk. I'll say, the characters actors were well selected and the characters themselves were beautiful. So, all-in-all, I would say, if you want to bring the kids younger ... go for it. But if you want to take your older children, take them to another movie ... they will thank you.
