I saw this movie in 1979, I was 17 or 18, when he was released. The theater was perhaps 1/4 full when the movie started. Ten minutes from the movie me and the friend who went with me to see the movie were only two people in the theater. The movie was really weird and there was no plot or reason in its script and those who asked their money back. We have decided to stay for the movie to undergo .... Why collectors like torture ... ... That's why. We wanted them to be true movie critics ... they have a standard at all other movies about it is hard to justify saying you've seen the best movie (one 10) they always come up with something better. But it's easy to be able to base all other movies off of the worst movie ever made (and this is it ... a 1 at best). There may be other movies that are truly qualified as a 1, but I have yet to see them. I now base all of the movies I see on a scale based on this worst .... I'm a trusted creditor ... read it.
