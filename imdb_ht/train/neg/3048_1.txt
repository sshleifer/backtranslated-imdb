This is perhaps the creepiest exhibit of Santa Claus ever engaged in any medium, if it has a book, a picture, or a movie. Santa looks like a pervy looking down on the kids and the twisted story of bringing Merlin to help him defeat one of Satan's devil, kitch, does not do anything any better. It's mockingly said at least, with bad effects, even for 1959 standards. If a kid was watching this movie, it would have nightmares and never want Santa to attend. They should be scarred for life. Imagine the kid in "A Christmas story" when they start screaming after putting them on Santa's lap. That's how this would turn out if the kid saw this movie.
