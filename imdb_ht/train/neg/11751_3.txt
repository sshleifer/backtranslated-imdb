When HEY ARNOLD! First came on the air in 1996, I watched it. It was one of my favorite shows. Then the same episodes began to receive shows over and over again so I got tired of waiting for new episodes and stopped watching it. I was sort of surprised when I heard about HEY ARNOLD! The movie since it does not seem to be almost as popular as some of the other Nickelodeon cartoons like SPONGEBOB SQUAREPANTS. But there is nothing better to do, I went to see the movie anyway. Going to the theater, I did not expect much. I just waited her to be a mute movie version of a kids' draw like the movie RECESS was. I guess I got what I expected. It was a kiddie movie dumb and nothing more. There were some good parts here and there, but for the most part, the movie was a stinker. Simply for kids.
