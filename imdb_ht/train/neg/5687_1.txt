While not as bad as his game-to-movie adaptation, this couple of crud was not the best. Boll seems to have a pathological inability to accept that it does not make good movies. One of these days he will run out of money and stop hurting the world with his bomb. The act was sub-par, the dialogue sounded like being TelePrompTers and Boll's special little 'touches' being seen in the whole thing. <br /> Like all Uwe Boll movies, this one just should not exist. <br /> <br /> Plain and simple. <br /> Just like Uwe Boll himself would not exist. > _>
