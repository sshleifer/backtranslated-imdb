The Golden Era of Disney cartoons was killed in the time of the late 90s. This Quack package show should not even be considered a DuckTales spin because the show barely had nothing to do with DuckTales. It's about a teenage old Huey, Dewey and Louie as they make trouble with Donald Uncle and talk to hip-hop lingo and are completely dressed unlike DuckTales. I prefer the little neve adventures from DuckTales. There are people in Duckburg and ducks are the only animals living in Duckburg. There is no reference to Scrooge McDuck. The stories are repetitive, the plot is boring but the animation is good. If you want very slapstick humor, I recommend this to you. If you want a better Disney show look "Darkwing Duck" or "DuckTales".
