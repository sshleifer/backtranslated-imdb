I gave 'a bit of note' not because it was a bad movie, but because he did nothing worth praising. <br /> I have not seen any of Hsiao-hsien Hou's work before, but for those who have nothing (including my) 'koji jik√¥' is released as a tribute to Yasujiro Ozu. (A Japanese director whose last film was the way, the way in 1962) The movie is a very sparse job ... with very little dialogue, history, music or emotion. <br /> <br /> They Hitoto play 'Yoko' worker, wandering character who spends his time at his local coffee shop or wounds investigating a Taiwanese composer he loves. Tadanobu Asano plays his friend, who works in a Cd shop and occasionally indulges his otaku interest to train. And it's all about it. <br /> We look as Yoko drinks coffee alone ... walking around ... waiting for a train ... catching a train ... fell asleep on the train. Types of realities Thursday all in Japan can be seen on a daily basis. Hou captures the ordinary moments in the life characters, but without any significance of these stickers in a totally free movie making or watching.
