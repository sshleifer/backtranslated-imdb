Richard Dix is ​​a great industrialist, not very beautiful, who has almost worked his head to death. If it is vacated his doctor suggests, can he get happily for the last months of his life? Well, it will likely be better if it disregards the voice of the WHISTLER. <br /> <br /> This Castle Castle directs entry has some great moments (the introduction and describes Richard Dix's life in a Kane citizen's newsreel), with some intriguing draw in the final coils. Dix performance is generally very good. But unfortunately, just does not work well because one does not finish buying that the characters would behave the way that they do. Also, the film fiberglass comes from a dark (and fascinating start) film to a nearly 30s happy movie like midnight (full of beautiful urban ethnic cities that do not mind that they are not rich) and back again into a complex noir plot for the last 15 minutes or so. This is a decent movie - worth seeing - but it needs a little more time to run a couple of characters and a female lead that can meet the demands of his role.
