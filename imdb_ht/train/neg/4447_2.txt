Yes there are worst movies out there. Most are made for fun, on a string string budget, or as a t.v. film of the week, but even though this was the 'movie of the week' it would be no more than two stars. It is a poor movie about a serious topic featuring a woman abused that runs the king of the silt people in the protective arms of the king of the wet people. (If this is an attempt to show that he does not need anyone to protect him than wuss people is superfluous to the film and should not be in it at all). It has no suspension, no character development, and a heroine that might outsmarted by an onion Rotton. (I think he flushes his wedding ring on a boat with a clean tank rather than just throwing it up into the ocean (where his body should be anyway) and after the husband finds it, demonstrating that he's a Moron, he always makes assumptions about the kid's leading almost to kill him.) I'm always surprised when I see the sort of rating generally a movie like this and it makes me realize that Dr. Seuss still has a great untapped market of people which should be challenged by his work. After I find praise in humanity I cry.
