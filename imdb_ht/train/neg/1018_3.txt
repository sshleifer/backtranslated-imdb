There is an excellent reason Edison has gone straight to video: he would have landed in theater with a crumbling attempt. The film lasted quite a long time and was very boring. Just a notch higher than lowbrow (thanks to Freeman and Spacey, who obviously had a two week supply before the next movie), the bad guys were mocking with nearby non-existent actions as acting Justin Timberlake a. I hate hitting the guy, but earlier he realizes that pop is his strong, the better. The movie is not all bad ... just mostly. I love the fact that LL Cool J has given what appears to be a shot of being leading people. It deserves it. And, unlike his fellow musicians and co-stars, he can act. Kevin Spacey is almost always enjoyable as well (you can see it gulp several times as it grows the landscape), and Freeman has the ability to expand this flick of three stars (out of ten ... it's not that good) . /> <br /> When all is said and done, the ultimate mistake and movie is that it is a mundane and tedious piece of pseudo-action poppycock that fails to keep anyone awake. He also failed to give anyone a good crap on any of the characters. All in all, it's just plain boring. What they say, rent this when you are suffering from insomnia.
