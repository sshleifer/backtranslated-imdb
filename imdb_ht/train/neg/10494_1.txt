On Steve Irwin's show, it's hillarious. He does not even try to be funny and it's just that his movie was not even what I would call a movie-I mean when guys on his car trying to kill him just say 'Oh, this is one nasty stroke! 'and looking straight into the camera. He put his face in the camera too much! Then when the guy falls on the car would not you expect him to die? And Terri had the worst act I've ever seen! Like the crocodile almost eating Steve it just says 'Steve'. He did not sound scared or anything, he was just 'Steve'. I mean I hate sound mean but that was not worth seeing. I love Steve Irwin but his movie was just too stupid.
