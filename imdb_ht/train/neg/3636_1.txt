I am very open to foreign films and love thinking that I understand what they are trying to accomplish although some things are lost in translation. But the simplicity and "intelligence" of this film were boring. I have often thought how exciting it would be to make a movie that just shows a day or typical period that really had no point. Now that I've seen a movie like that I will no longer think about these lines. There are tones of society, racism, and some desires ... but South Park has that. But when I watch South Park it actually moves me to feel an emotion. The nearest thing I felt in an emotion during this film was given to my experienced after the first five minutes. I miss the typical film a seven or above because I love most films. I gave this movie one.
