Dragon Fighter is the first Sci-Fi Channel (although I guess it's now called Syfy?) Original movie I've ever seen. But I've seen one or two others since, and I can tell you that they are stupid, but this one really scratches the bottom of the barrel. The CGI hurt, the act is bad, the ridiculous script, and what happens to the very end is unexpected and out of place (if you've seen Dragon Fighter, you probably know what I mean; want to put a spoiler in my review). Plus, there was one music that was used in beautifully every single harmful sequence. That was really stupid; they just played it over and over. And it's definitely not original; I know I've heard that somewhere before (I just can not remember where). This is one to avoid.
