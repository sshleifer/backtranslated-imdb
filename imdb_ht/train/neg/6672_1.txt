I'm 47 years old and I spent as much of my life as I can remember, a fan of horror movies and sci-fi. Make them silent, black and white, there is no budget or big budget, there are so many that I can not find anything they like about. That said, I'm going to give this movie credit for good gore and animal effects but that's all. This is a case of history. Truth is we are living in a time where there are very few leftovers that have not been seen in a horror movie. Because of a movie of any kind to really enjoy it must have a good, original story. A good story can overcome the poor and evil effects but a bad story with good acting effect is always a bad movie. This film does not even have good action, only good effect. So, unless you can only on the gor, pass this one up.
