Some of the worst, the least natural current performance I've ever seen. Which is perhaps not surprising to the clunky, the lame dialogue gives the characters one note. Add to that value of cheap production and you've got a movie that does not seem to be the same on TV. One does not expect much of a movie life, especially this one old one, but this is almost unwatchably bad. <br /> <br /> Draw-wise, it's a terrible, classy romance of an even type Harlequin would consider under them. It is possible to guess how the rest of the film will go by simply watching the opening stage of the stage. Surprise, only female character that gets any focus on the mysterious stranger ends in love.
