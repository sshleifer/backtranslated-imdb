Angry Red Planet (Quickie Review) <br /> Like the "Man of Planet X," this is a rare science fiction story off from an era where fantasy and science fiction have always been damaging near the same. That is, we have some very mockingly special effects and rampant pseudo-science masquerade as science fiction. And yes, it's another "classic" release of a high quality transfer and a dry and sharp photo - not Midnite Movies. So, the main reasons to watch this movie? Oh, it's definitely the whole time our space crew is on Mars. (What, do you think "Angry Red Planet" referred to Neptune?) Before that some poor quality teams are riding a space ship, inside of which they smoked and sent around sexist chauvinistic plenary aimed at members the "piny girl" of the crew. It would be somewhat offensive by today's standards if it was not so humorous. But Mars is the real reason we are watching this thing. The film is generally black and white, but Mars, well Mars is screaming red blood. He filmed in this rare red plasticy red bay the Mad Madness quite an interesting look at red overexposed. It's really quite an eye ?? as they (ha ha) viewers are witnessing. The best were the "ratbatspidercrab." Do you think it's a joke? This is what's called it in the movie! It is a monstrous chimera (small puppet) in something combined rat, stick, spider, and crab features. He traces the sleeve's sleeve and sh * from "our heroic crew." There are other strange, and wrongly imagined, aliens must see, but one takes the cake. Eventually, after the harassment on Mars, the sexual crews framed "pirate" and returning to planet he came out. Science fiction film film and curiosity curiosity, and some general film general. Fans of mystery science theater 3000 will have a garden day with this one (if they've never got to it on the show). 2/10 Modern Scores, 6/10 Nostalgia Scores, 4/10 Overall. <br /> (www.ResidentHazard.com)
