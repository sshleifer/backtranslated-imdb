Ok, first of all, I'm a big fan of zombie movie. I liked all of Romero's cops and well-liked to re-make at Dawn of the Dead. So, when I heard every single criticism of this film railing I was always optimistic. I mean, critics hate Resident Evil, and while it may not be a particularly big movie, I enjoyed it if not for the fact that it was just a fun zombie shot-em up with a half decent draw. This is, however, is crap. Thousands of dialogues, half-steel drawings, and video game videos enter the movie. Who's right idea they thought was a good idea. The only thing about this movie (I used the term wounds) that I enjoyed was Jurgen Prochnow as Captain Kirk (Ugh). While his name launches originality out the window, you can see in his performance that he knows it's a terrible movie movie and he might as well make the best of it. Everyone else acts as if doing Shakespeare. And very seriously I might add. Basically the only reason anyone should see this monstrosity is if you are.) It's a big zombie driver and must see every zombie flick made or b.) Like playing MST3K, the home game. Watch her with friends and be prepared for tons of unwitting street. <br /> <br />
