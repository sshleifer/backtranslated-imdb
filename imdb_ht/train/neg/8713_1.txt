Everything in this movie is bad, the story, act, the effects, but funny funny, funny, funny !!! Scott Valentine and the Army uniforms that are over ten too large is so bad and the permanent attempt at an arrow on his face as the leader of a group of special Ops hilarious! The "Terrorists" are as frightening and realistic as the 'raptors', this is so bee and bad in everything it tries you to laugh .The party where the giant T-REX is somehow snuck on a board boats and then somehow got bottom is blown up and you see the metal pole sticking where itself was the perfect end .If you are in bad movie, this is the golden pot, the moon muna in bb-move !!!
