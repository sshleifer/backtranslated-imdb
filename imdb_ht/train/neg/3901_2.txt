The script is nice. Even though the casting is absolutely non-watchable.No style. The costumes do not look like some of High High Society. Comparing Gwyneth Paltrow and Kate Beckinsale I can only say that Ms. Beckinsale speaks English better than Ms. Paltrow, though in Mrs. Paltrow's actions lies many natures in Emma Woodhouse. Mr. Northam undoubtedly is Mr. Knightley's best in all versions, it is romantic and not at all sharp-looking and unfeeling like Mr. Knightley in the TV version. P.S.The spectator can not be seen throughout Mr. Elton-Ms. Smith's development relationship as he was in the motion picture, so one can not understand where all Emma was trying to make a Elton-Smith match (besides the portrait).
