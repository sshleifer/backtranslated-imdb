This was a nice movie until the finish. The ending was merely one more despicable effort to prevent men and women from spending. The girl refused to listen to reason and logic and used her passive / aggressive nature to control and impose her on the guy who ultimately yielded her power and control over the relationship with her. It's not likely that he was sitting behind the wheel of the driver in the car as they drove away to the end after he had begged and pleaded with him to take him back. This film is a victory for every woman who thinks they should be in charge of everyone and in control of their relationships with them. It was a jerk movie for this reason.
