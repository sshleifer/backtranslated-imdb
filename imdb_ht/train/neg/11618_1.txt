Acting in the movie is really well done honestly, but the movie is so slow and so boring, as soon as it gets everything interesting to slow down at a bigger stand. I'm glad to see Sam Rockwell in this, he did a great job, so did other actors as I mentioned but people ... this is one of the worst dragged out of the movie I've ever seen. Now maybe in a short film form this movie would be good, but other than that, avoid it. This movie has a lot of filler and makes a twinkie cake jealous. I never, ever, walked out on film, but watching this one in the house and family, I walked out. Yeah, it's boring. Apparently comments I do not have enough lines to post, so here's some more filler. I guess I was inspired by the movie I just looked.
