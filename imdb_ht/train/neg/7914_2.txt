This movie was sought to be a blockbuster movie, and it really is. This is the kind of movie that made them popcorn to watch the flashy graphics. With that in mind, the movie delivers, maybe not as well as ultra flashy at Iron Man, but quite enough. Outside of the munching popcorn action with special effects, the movie goes down to the cliff faster than Wile E. Coyote. Many viewers, including myself, are complaining about how most of the characters have been seriously changed, but only make the film a poor adaptation, not a poor movie. This movie is satisfactory for other reasons. The musicians focus more on making it appealing to the eye than they did in the mind. The long-awaited and encouraging characters are reduced to 4-stage cameos. The main characters of Wolverine, Victor Belief (never called Sabertooth in the movie) and Colonel Stryker are well developed. I was surprised by Liev Schriber's performance. The rest of the characters are above the path of all important eye-candy. The Wolverine's character is fully developed after 30 minutes, as Sabertooth, though Victor pulls some late surprises in the movie. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />! The movieers obviously felt that all they really needed to have created a bad ass character who could do anything they wanted and slapped on the name of a popular character. <br /> <br /> Very irritating ...
