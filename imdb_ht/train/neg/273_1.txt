Signing in a classic movie is that it's like a fine red wine. This film has no Cabarnet and certainly no Casablanca. I agree with the other revisions that the children in the film are an unfortunate mutation that now our plagues us either in the sitting-coms and the dialogue is stilted and preachy. But let's look at the outdated theme of the movie. With the passage of sixty more years of history comes wisdom. Since looking at the Rhine, author Lillian Hellman has been exposed as a Bidenesque plagiarist and its so-called real life story "Julia" in his book "Pentimento". As one of the most hottest in a multitude of Western-based USSR apologists, it is obvious his theme in the film and film was stirred America in action to save Stalin's bloodthirsty Soviet and international communists from the fascists who which just demonstrated military superiority in Spain. As one review correctly noted, this is not a pro-American and film game, as Lillian went to his grave an American-Wadin communist. These films that are commonly jumped jumping into the intellectual elites that made up the Left Americans then as the Moon's full moon at Kos every day and Michael Moore bought in the conspiracy theories and once again providing help and comfort to those who would destroy America.
