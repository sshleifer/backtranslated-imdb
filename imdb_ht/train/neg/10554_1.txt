An Avent-Guardian Nightmare, very low-budget "movie" has the ultimate alicee. Hard to sit in. I get messages of abuse about children. Wow great revelation. I had no signs of being wrong before watching this. Yes this is sarcastic. Do not watch this "movie" if you are offended by either male or female. Do not watch it if you are the least squeamish bit. Do not watch it if you care about acting. On second thought just does not look at it's period .. <br /> My Class: D- <br /> <br /> DVD Extras: make the film, the premiere, and Kristie Bowersock, delusional scene, Book Directors, 2 versions of Collier Trailer, Music Video by The Azoic, & a Classroom Video Experience
