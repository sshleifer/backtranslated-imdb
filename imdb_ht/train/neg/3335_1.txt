This Movie Movie Cannon is the worst of the many, and is positive evidence that a five minute fate does not make a full-length film. Poor South Caesar as the prosperous emperor, is to look so stupid, it's hard to look at her. As the sly tailor, Robert Morse does not have an ounce of charm. Nor does the ninth hunter (Jason Carter) "The Songs" is horrible and only slow down what's in the draw down. The direction is practically nonexistent, and the characters support greatly added. Lysette Anthony is beautiful as the emperor's daughter, but her voice was obviously armed for some reason, a fate shared by many of the minor players. And the movie pulls into a stairs. Hans Christian Andersen must have turned somersaults into his grave then appeared. He can honestly say, at least in this film story, it's no surprise that he went straight to the video hub.
