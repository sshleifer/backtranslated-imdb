CQ was the worst movie I've seen this year. Almost every movie I choose to see in the theater is at least fun or has something to say. This film seemed like she was led by a movie student for his intro. in filming. Her father makes big movie. His sister did a good job. But the Roman brother? NON! A criticism was odious to compare this movie by Godard's Lepros (Contempt). While Coppola, Jr. took the same idea, a film about film, she tried too hard to make himself look like European, artsy, and witty, when it's all really just kitsch. The lead actor brings the same expression into the entire movie, as it is either in awe or trauma in this movie being made around him. Schwartzman somehow managed to pull his role as a flamboyant director. Depardieu is okay. The single scene with any real movie humor movie is all amazing, not the B-movie scene, but rather one that took place in Italy; a mounting of shots of various various characters inside a very small car, driven around picking up and dropping into random people. This was the only thing that reminded me of the movie I guess he was trying to parody. Or rip off. Or both. The documentary and the lead talking in the camera with filming various objects played out, ended up tagged on the forefront of a "twist" or artistic value ... I suppose the funniest thing about this movie was The movie itself, and not the way it intends. No wonder this movie was sent back after a festival screening to be re-modified or re-shot or whatever, making me curious as just how bad it was before. I can not believe he could get worse than that. If you want to see a good imitation of films check out the films Austin Power. Any of them. The third opening is more fun and more genius than the whole movie. Lil Romy, for the sake of movies, PLEASE return to direct your cousin's music video. Leave the Godfathers father.
