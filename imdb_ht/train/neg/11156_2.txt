Black Wolf (Quick Review) Let's Get It Right: This is a repugnant piece of Roadkill rot and cow * t on it. It's just a horrible movie. It's a werewolf movie movie with some of the worst acting imaginings and a weak story like any gangli nerd from a high school 80 drama film. What's worse is that poor Kane Hodder was scrutinized in the gigantic evil linguistic play. Kane f * cking turkey. Someone is trying to ensure that playing Jason Voorhees is the height of his movie career ... So, anyway, former Playmate Jaime Bergman is also in the movie and he eventually becomes a werewolf, too. It's kind of a cop cop scam and worst in the world looking werewolves in it. But it has moments of near-rampant nudity. But that's about everyone. Want to know more? Well, the Werewolf is generally an ugly-looking black zip pocket around the screen. But when we are privileged enough to actually see a transformation sequence, we're presenting and something similar to a full-motion video from a video game made during the early stages of the Playstation. Playstation first. CG's animation is really primitive. It's only good for film movie fans who want to see the moments of nudity surrounded by visual breaks slowing down. 2/10 <br /> <br /> www.ResidentHazard.com
