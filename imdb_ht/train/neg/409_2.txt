<br /> <br /> Paul Verhoeven finally bombed out on this one. He became a joke on his head. Once again we have a movie that includes sex and violence, immorality, leering in women and many atitiude talk between the characters and dollying pan. <br /> It's all for nothing. Because they have no action throughout this movie. It fudges all its set pieces. All actors perform quality performances form a Verhoeven movie. In other words rampant about acting on almost every level. Trumpet vessels went with it because it was like a world of masonry characters to stay. These scientists are acting similarly. Paul's forgiveness, but Soldiers and scientists are not really made in the same mindset. <br /> <br /> One major mistake of the plot was that after escaping for that one night doing evil thing Kevin Bacons character then returning back to the laboratory science where we have already spent more then enough time watching these animated manicures (Elizabeth Shue except) walking and talking. Why not show the extent to what the character can do in the outside world. How could they possibly follow him if he could anywhere in all ??? Think about all the different things that can be done with this concept, both in terms of history and characterization. Then look at what this movie and you really how badly done and concieved the whole project really was. <br /> <br /> More insult is the Doco on the DVD where everyone claims that Verhoeven is a kind of MA genius. Well one out of two is not that bad. <br /> This movie has nothing to score in it. Just like the title says. <br /> <br /> Hollow !!!
