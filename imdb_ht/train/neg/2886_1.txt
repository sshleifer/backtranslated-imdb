Terrible, Terrible, Terrible Do not waste your money from renting this movie. It's like a low budget made for Canadian TV movie. Absolutely the worst movie I've ever seen and there were so many others out there. This film is not worth the time it takes to put it into DVD players or VCRs. : ~ (Is it possible to write ten lines? The act was awful .. It had absolutely no sink .. I saw made for TV movie about the BTK killer and it was better (in comparison to one this) ensures that they have gone to producing this movie, but if they have educated us or telling a story about BTK killers they miss a mile. It appears more in a infomercial for animal rights.
