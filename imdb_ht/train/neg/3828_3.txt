By the 1976 West had a genuine genre and musicians in this film clearly knew it. Still, instead of taping the project and saving us from having to look it, they went ahead and did it anyway. Apparently in need of an interesting thread to get their audience come and see the movie they decided to do it as blatantly violent and unpleasant as possible. Hell, it worked for the wildlife so why should not it work here? Of course, the wild bunch has the benefit of a superb script but the script of the latest hard men is plain old-fashioned garbage. <br /> It's hard to figure out what attracts Charlton Heston and James Coburn to their respective roles. Heston plays a retired law that goes after a bunch of prisoners escaped by a violent violent (Coburn). The hunt becomes even more personal when Heston's daughter (Barbara Hershey) is kidnapped by prisoners and undergone sexual degradation. This is a true killer movie in which every time someone dies he looks at the top-detail. It's really disappointing really, because the star Peñón sounds like a mouth-watering prospect. There is no sense of pace or urgency in the movie either. It takes an eternity to get it, but when the action finally arrives, it is not emphasis on misfortune. All in all, this could be the worst film that Heston ever made. I'm sure it's one of the productions he is ill to include on his illustrative CV.
