I admire Rob Marshall for Chicago, but the Geisha Memory turns out to be another failure in Western and Asian art. In general, the scene is beautiful, but after restless childhood on exotic-oriented scenes some can just find themselves fed up with them. The cherry blossom was, frankly, late. It's probably the cultural difference of perception here: the ultimate beauty is not the kind of bursting, as really lovely geisha should not be on the pumpkin pumpkin in the movie. <br /> <br /> There are other comments that have mentioned the major flaws. As a Taiwanese, I have no doubt the actress is great. An actor / actress can play any kind of role when he / she can look like it. Gong It is great, but the power of emotions that he shows in this movie has not been translated into Japanese style. All I saw was a bittersweet and jealous Chinese woman. Michl Yeoh, one of my favourtie actress, did not even look like Japanese. Some comments mention delicate specimens, feminine features of Japanese women, with which I can not agree more. These are so delicate that I suppose not even all the modern Japanese actresses qualify for the role of Geisha, let alone the Chinese and a Malaysian actress who grew up in different cultures and probably did not know Japanese culture very much. <br /> <br /> Geisha is a good shot to excite the curiosity of American audiences. But it would be a reproach for the movie itself and for art even though the movie wins the Oscar for better suits, best directors or best photos.
