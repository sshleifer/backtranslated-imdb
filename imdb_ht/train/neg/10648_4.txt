The final of the Weissmuller tarzan films is one rather weak. There are some things that derail this movie. First, Tarzan spends much of the film that brings sandals. In my opinion, any shoe on tarzan, whether it be sandals or boots as sometimes described, takes away the character, which is supposed to be anti-civilization and pro-forestry. <br /> <br /> Second, the character of Benji, as mentioned in a previous post, totally derailed the movie as the funny foil. For me, her character is unnecessary to draw the movie. <br /> <br /> Also, while Weissmuller still cut a commander's face as Tarzan, it's apparent that he was not in his best form. Although in his later Jim Jim movies, his physics has improved a bit of this movie. <br /> <br /> Battle of octopus is a terrific idea, but I think it should be made in an earlier Weissmuller movie when it was in its physical peak. Similarly, the battle, which took only 30 seconds to head, would be more thrilling if it was drawn from 90 seconds to 2 minutes as the classic giant crocodile battle of Tarzan and his Mate. Brenda Joyce as Jane and Linda Christian as Mara has lots of fun in the eye, it does not manage to save this latest Weissmuller movie - a disappointing end to a great character running.
