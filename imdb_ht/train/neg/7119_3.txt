* SPOILERS * <br /> I'm sure back then was released in 1958 it was most suitable for its time. Back then the films were slowly rhythmically allowing audiences to track and analyze the story. Here a man moved into a home owned by his last wife who died mysteriously with his new wife. The Mickey Field (played by Alex Nicol, who also directed film) really is a underappreciated character. She gets a skull indirectly cautioned Jenni that she is in trouble, since she knew that there was bad game in the first wife's death. She can not tell Jenni directly what happened, so she tries to make it off with the skull. Jenni, we also found out, saw her parents die, thus causing a life of mental distress leading to institutionalization. Like many today's hearings, I found the rhythm to be a bit too slow for my taste. But if you like slow down slow-paced without a lot of gurus, this movie is for you. <br /> <br />
