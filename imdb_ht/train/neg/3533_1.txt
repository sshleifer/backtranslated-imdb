Let this movie serve as the sword of the "big twist" films made from the 1990s. Known in some circles as Kyser Soze Syndrome, this little cinema from now made to death by M. Night Shayamalan and even Ron Howard used a variation of a wonderful prejudice. However, in REVOLVER, director Guy Ritchie (known in some circles as "Mrs. Madonna"), uses the motif Soze in a much more obsequious way. Jason Statham (with a head hair hair follower) as Jack Green (known to all as "Mr. Green.") It may or may not be criminal to master Mr. Gold. Or, perhaps Mr. Gold is an irritable spirit who can own the hell. I'm not sure, but I certainly do not care. REVOLVER is one of the most overwrought examples of beyond Cinemas I had the disgrace to endure in quite a long time. Witness structures in fractured times, the painful pain cuts, the interior-monologues change, and painfully lamenting the sequence. This "everything and the kitchen shed" direct style to review Quentin Tarantino look sedate. Smoke cinemas and mirrors just led me to believe that Ritchie was as bored to tell this sad story as I watched it. The movie is full of moments of revelations that are supposedly shocking but only come as news to Mr. Green. I wanted to love Green as I always enjoy Stratham as a character that is two steps ahead of everyone else. Here, though, it fought together as a reminder reader at a University English Literature class. His lack of understanding is only matched by the lack of constraints shown in his nemesis, Macha (Ray Liotta). Feast on scenery as a starving star in a smorgasbord, Liotta spit, cry, and smoke in the movie at a nasty display of overacting and leopard print speed. <br /> <br /> There are no types of redevening REVOLVER. It is yet another fairy movie fault from Ritchie and might even outnumber her miserable reminiscent of SWEPT away as her worst film again.
