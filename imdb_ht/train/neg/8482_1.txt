Some of my old friends suggest me watch this movie but I got lucky just recently. I had high hopes of seeing something interesting from Kamal Hans, which I saw was the bunch of trash camera angles at high speed. I could not understand what was the message except independent endowment. I also love many religions but I've been feeling Kamal Hasan is a man who gave the characters orchestrated this kind of thinking. He could make a horror movie than this crap. He tried to add Hollywood genre of virus and God to prevent it did not convert that guy into a mutant and finally went on to go for world domination. This is a very filmed movie for a regular movie public movie school. Shame on him to keep up his talent. Starting in the story tried to disrupt ideas borrowed from Butterfly effect, then in between little religious harmony at the price of insulting Hinduism (Again I insulted Hinduism more, but this movie has no equal and insult me, is even for the general religion that could make this film intellectual.)
