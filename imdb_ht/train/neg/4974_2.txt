Let the Saints preserve us, because this movie will not help. A person with access needs to send an email to Mel Gibson and tells him we need a faithful production at Beowulf. Something that actually has something in common with the epic poem is the foundation for all Western modern literature. <br /> <br /> The recent (since 2000) version of Beowulf makes us wonder of things. First, why have so much interest in the story. Secondly, why are these filmmakers shedding mountains into cash on this crap. <br /> <br /> The only reason that this got a two is that the version with Lambert in it (Beowulf 2000) was getting worse and needed 1. <br /> <br /> What is the same Worse, some people will watch this and get the wrong idea about the poem. How an industry where Peter Jackson gets a literary conversion to the movie can get it so bad. I mean really, the Roman Forum as a model for Heorot is too much. <br /> AND PLEASE HANDS ON HUSHES? Get ready. This is insulting. <br /> / hjm
