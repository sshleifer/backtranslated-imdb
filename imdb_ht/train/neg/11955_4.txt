"Visitors Q" is a failed attempt in black comedy that focuses on what could be the most functional family of the world including physical abuse from beating to promote sodomy necrophilia into a nurse mother with her husband and daughter adult, film etc. is so outrageous to win some critical criticism and to establish a small follow-up culture. However, with quality home video and a slapdash production, "Visitor Q" just does not hold just as a curiosity. The bladder genitals come out with clearly visible hygiene devices, make-up is terrible, and everything else is the best amateur. A waste of time. (C-)
