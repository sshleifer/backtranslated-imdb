If it was not for some gullible idiots I know to insist that I watch this "documentary" I could never see this comedy! This movie is filled with bad scripting and awful moments. One particular is where the Afghan police / soldier arrested Don Larson for filming the streets while allowing the cameraman to carry on his arrest filming and then driving away, always filming, presumably at his Plush hotel them. Then there's the scene where a car crashes into another car that turned upside down and packed nicely along the road without any evidence of it being in an accident or explosion. <br /> I wonder this actually got the rating it has (5.8 / 10). I thought IMDb users had more sense.
