Channels Navigation and Keeping This on LOGO. It was one of those "I have to watch this because it's so horriblely bad" moments, like the Roadhouse without the joy. Writing this is atrocity; Completely insane and the act is throw-up-in-your-mouth bad. <br /> There is low budget and then there is the deep that is where this season should be overlooked and never seen out again.

I'm sorry but looking at 6 guys staring at every 10'x10 'boring room with a futon in it and gushing is lame. I guess they did not learn anything from the Bad News Bears at Breaking Training (see hotel room check stages) ... wow a toilet !!! yaayyyyy !!!! I do not buy it all on the head so anything goes routine. If it smells like ... and it looks like ... well, you know the rest. <br /> Avoid such an epidemic. believe that since I licked this movie, I'm a "avoid avoiding" that I can only assume my fobic mean, which of course is not true. I decided to make this stuff wacky, crazy and the movie judge based on the current content of the movie and not its only presence (meaning it's worthwhile to see ...) <br /> <br /> Sure, it can be refreshing to see but that does not equate to a big movie, just giving them some better materials to work and tightening direction. In fact, I applaud the effort. Frankly, I'd rather go out to listen to my kitchens in distribution catalog than watch this again.
