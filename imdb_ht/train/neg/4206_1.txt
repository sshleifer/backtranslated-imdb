I was at the movie premiere at Film Festival Film Toronto in 1997. After the screening, when the writer / director and some cast members were offered to answer questions, no one could even be bothered to ask any. Rarely had a movie so badly directed (why earth was random frames cut out of some scenes?), Unpleasant acting (David Arquette, in paraphrase Dorothy Parker, does not run the emotional gamut from A at B. It's park A and bring a lunch) and completely free. Characters behave completely from character for no reason except forcing the plot to move in certain directions. In the last time, the film comes to a completely random ending that is supposed to "really make you think." Unfortunately, what it makes you think is, "Well, there are 90 minutes in my life I will never come back."
