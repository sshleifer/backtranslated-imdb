An expedition led by Hunky Captain Stunts (Mark Dana) travels to the Kings Valley in Cairo to find out what happened in an earlier expedition. They meet the beautiful mysterious Simira (Ziva Rodann) who meet them. They soon find themselves faced with a bloody mummy ... and only Simira seems to know what's going on. <br /> <br /> A real snoozer. I keep this on night TV late when I was over 10. She put me to sleep! Watch it again all these years later I can see why. It's slow-moving, the mummy does not even show up to 40 minutes (and this is only 66 minutes long!), The chains act in bad (Dana) in REAL bad (George N. Neise) and no violence or blood to be found. This movie focuses more on dramatic second-rate (involving a comic love triangle) than horror. <br /> This three-star rate because it actually looks pretty good, everyone plays it right, some good acting from Diane Brewster, it's short and the mummy scene scenes (all three of them) are not bad. They're not scared just mildly crap. Still, this movie is very bad. A sure fire healing for insomnia.
