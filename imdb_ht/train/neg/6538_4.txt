Reading my review in the home of SCREAMED, many can assume that I'm a 14 year old who thinks SCREAM is considered a "classic" horror. This is not the case, as I'm 30 years old and have watched horror movies for most of my life. But admittedly, I'm a child of the 80 who grew up on slasher / zombie / ghost / cannibal, etc. ... kind of movie horror - so I do typically prefer horror movies that are more graphic and faster-rhythm. Just like someone who can appreciate different music, painting, or in this case, film - but not necessarily like them - I can appreciate why some people can enjoy this kind of movie ... I just do not. The <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The heavy mistress of the School Board with a hand (or whip in some cases ...) keeps the girls in line. She has a young son who boasts and peeps over the girls while showering (in the nightgowns are no less (?!?) ...), and meanwhile, the girls disappear from the school as they are victims a murderer in cache on the campus ... <br /> I can see why the house that SCREAMED is often compared to SUSPIRIA (which is a masterpiece of a movie in my opinion ...), in terms of the atmosphere of the school itself and the interactions between the girls and the guardians - but this movie is so dull and revolver that I could barely stay awake. I'm all for the "tension" and "suspense" of the movie horror - but this film was born for me. Luckily, I did not expect a whole lot to go into this one, so I can not say I was really disappointed - the SCREAMED house just boosted the fact that I personally do not usually enjoy most horror movie movies with more than from 70 years old. This is not a hard and fast rule, but those that I enjoyed definitely seem to be more of the exception. Probably a "must-see" for horror fans who enjoy more horror movies and suggestions - but as I do not really know many fans of that sort of material, I can not really recommend this one ... 4/10
