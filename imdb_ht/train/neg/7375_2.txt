This film was heavily marred by the presence of Steven Seagal. Or how should I tell Steven so-dull! As before Seagal is either too good or too stupid to re-dub his own line, let someone imitate his voice for the shots where the sound needs to be looped. A few films before he did this too, but I do not think of this limit! To be honest the film looks very good, the script could use some work but parts of this movie looked like a real movie! Of course, all said, this movie is very bad. <br /> <br /> It would be better if Seagal has become a cartoon in itself. Do not bother. Anything about a buck for this one is too much! I honestly think this is the last time for me and a Seagal movie. What has taken me long to achieve this?
