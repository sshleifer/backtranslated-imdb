I can sum this movie up to 20 words or less. Way too predictable in a story line and potential to be funny, but rather fell flat on its face. Look, 19 words, however, I did not completely flick this flick with just one star but instead decided to hit it up to two stars due to the fact that Julie Bowen is smoking hot and giving just enough eyes candy to keep me from ripping DVD Right from the car and blowing it up with a M80. My advice, taking $ 4.00 rental fees would pay you to see this movie and just send it my rights as a thank you for saving you the time and frustration that have to sit in this train wreck, or you may want to send M '$ 50.00 replacement fees would have been loaded into taking out your doubling gates to use this piece of waste as skeet to practice practices.
