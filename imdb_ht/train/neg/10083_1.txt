They changed the title of atrocity in an unexpected love. The only thing worse is the movie itself. The script has dialogues that should laugh from a third-year play rhythm. At one point when the wife leaves the husband, a bad cover of all by myself playing on the soundtrack! No kidding. The actors try, but they beat by inept, the unbelievable terrible script. Direction is staggeringly bad. No wonder everlasting life has such a bad reputation. How things like this get made. I turn on the TV before it's over!
