Allow it to be in this way. I actually get this movie. I find that the writer / directer was trying to do. I understand that the dialogue was meant to dry and emotions. I understand that the plot was supposed to be non-climatic and stale. This was the writer / director went for. A very pretty circle / comedy mood. With all that understanding, I still think the movie sucks. It seemed like the writer / director was trying to recreate Napolean Dynamite and this movie. It has all the same features. Even the main character behaviors similar to Napolean. But Napolean Dynamite was actually funny. Script it worked. This movie is not. It does not have any reason. Well, let me rephrase that. Its only purpose is to rip off Napolean dynamite and try to take that look and feel. Too bad it did not work.
