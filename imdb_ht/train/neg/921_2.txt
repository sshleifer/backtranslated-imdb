I rent this one to see Vanesa Talor once again. He can act, but he does not get a chance at this clunker. The opening sequence is an elaborate technical shot of mountain landscapes. You must come from an action archive, because it's the direct shot movie video. The production values ​​make _Blair Witch_ look professional. There's really an animated cheesy image, but there is no other effect worthless. This movie is bad, but not so amusingly so. Players would do well not to mention it on the summaries.
