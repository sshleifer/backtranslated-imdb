I watch lots of awesome movies (or at least try to be) and this has to be the worst if not 2 worst movies I've ever made myself try to sit down. I never knew the depths of mazasism until I rented this piece of mold cheese covered in a latex contraceptive used. I'm a fan of Julian Sans, but this is worse than I'd expect for him. <br /> <br /> On the other hand the story promised and I was intrigued ... for the first minute and a half while the credit was rolling and I still see that the pain was like first hand. Maybe there are some viewers out there who liked this and can show me in the right direction, but then again I know from those viewers who understand if they do not commemorate me, especially when we turned the video off , and that simply is not done and looked at us (we made one exception obviously). <br /> If it was up for a rumor, I would give it a chance as long as they had at most 1% of the original incorporated into it. It's all.
