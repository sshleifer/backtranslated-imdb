Mmm, not a big stack of good sound pancakes? Maple syrup and fruit preserved on top. Take a bite. Mmmmmmm. Take another bite. Another. Another. EAT. Eat it, you !!! Keep your trap down your throat until your face turns green and nauseutically. You've just had the Ally McBeal experience. <br /> I was stumbled on this show in the winter of '98 and were immediately tuned. Like piles of pancakes, I gorged myself on it. But the fun soon put in, because the character Ally McBeal (who we see to be beautiful & attractive at first sight) will soon become even annoying, insecure, white complaining you ever encountered. (Call me a feminist, but I prefer driving my girl has a spine.) The gags & gimmicks in the show also gets hacked, the music of Vonda Shepherd (which is really pushing into your face) gets grate, and character The Perpetrative Change & Rewrites performs in a damn soap opera. My <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />! I did it in 2.5 seasons before my pleasure was totally soured. It was good while it lasted, but as a crazy, her exotic heretical neurotic just turned ugly after she was overstayed to her welcome. <br /> <br /> And next time you go to IHOP, skip the pancakes. Order something healthy as the fruit cake. It will sit with you better.
