I found this movie to be a utter disipoint. Talent is available to the director - Stanley Tucci, Chris Walken, Hank Azaria and Alan Arkin (without even mentioning the main driving cards) - were completely wasted on an unprecedented story, with no one conclusion 'Can really care about once presented in the lasting features, stereo-typed features. Julia Roberts is weak, Zeta-Jones is just plain annoying (looks indignant to her role in high loyalty, less humor), Crystal just plays its old ultra-active, neurotic, bitter change-month and Cusack simply walks in His part, apparently bored with the whole project. <br /> For what's supposed to be a 'romantic comedy', there is absolutely no romance between central characters, let alone chemistry, and as the comedy - (possibly spoilers) well, the only moments of mild humor came on the back of Cusack's role in Grosse Pointe and his relationship with Alan Arkin - the scriptwriter obviously can show any originality too. (Spoilers) Azaria was reasonably entertaining as the Mexican lover and Walken have done quite a fun turn as a parody of an art-maverick-Dogme-type director-but these parts constitute very little screen time and our Spoilers have been treated In Billy Crystal she had to rinse her fed by a dog. Greater engineering. <br /> For a great fan of John Cusack's work majority, not to mention the rest of the fantastic cast, I've completely let down in a movie with lots of good ideas, and at the same time completely wanting to explore or devise on any of them, rather resorting to the same genre clique clicks and even lowering itself into the depths of almost 'bully-out, teen-movie humor' at times. A poor 4/10.
