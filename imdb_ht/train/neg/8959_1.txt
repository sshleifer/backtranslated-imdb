Some people can consider this movie a piece of artwork - to be able to express your imagination on the movie in order to create a movie filled with aggression and death pain .. I personally think that this film is a disgust, which should never have been released. This film is repulsive, logical and meaningless. Not only is it a complete waste of time, but it makes you sick for the next few days. The appalling images shown in the film not only make you grasp but when laid in your head and takes away the forgotten days. Such a shame that people wasted their imagination on these brutal sorrows. "Kill Bill" would be another example but at least "Kill Bill" has its goals, ie, climax and resolution.
