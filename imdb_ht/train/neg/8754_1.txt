This film is really awful. After seeing the advertisement for her, I thought she could have her charms ... but she didn't.The girls can not act, and they can not sing either. The soundtrack of this film is full of the songs, and it's not a beautiful, terrible story line story, incredible plot, its one of Disney's worst movies is not far! Ally is not a bad actress on "Phil of the Future", so I do not know what happened to "Cow Cow". With her sister, AJ, seems to be just coaching a ride on her sister's "fame", and she shows no talent that forever. At the end of the movie girls finally learn some moral clich√©s, but this is late in relief this wreck trail movie
