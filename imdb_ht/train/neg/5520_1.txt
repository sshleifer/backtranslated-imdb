This film was described by the trailer as a comedy. It is an extreme tragedy. He left me sick in my stomach. I hated it. I think if they want to make a movie like this one should be enough people to reflect the true intentions of the movie in the trailer. I would not see this movie if I knew. I think the trailer should reflect the theme with the intention of a movie. I'm tired of it. I really wanted to have a fun comedy and I'm very disappointed. She has several days now and I still have a bad taste in my mouth in this movie. I have never been more humiliated in a movie, nor have I ever written a comment on a bad movie. I really think that deception was true of this trailer because if they showed true intentions of the movie, no one could see it.
