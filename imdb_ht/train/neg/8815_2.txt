Yes, I just will tell you about this one so it does not read if you want surprises. I got this one with the wrong Christmas title. There was also another Christmas horror on DVD called Silent Night, Bloody Night. Whereas Silent Night, Bloody Night (not to be confused with night silence, mortal night) had a lot of potential and was very close to being good, this one was not quite as good. It started out interesting enough to watch the villain (if you can call it that) watching kids in the neighborhoods and writing about who is naughty and beautiful, but after a while you are looking for some action and this movie does not save. You need character development, but this goes further and you are still never sure why the guy guys. About an hour of it killed three to four people while a whole crowd is looking at horrors, and the guys killed them by the same goal they just made fun of it. This is one of many attempts made unsuccessfully by the hit killer in the naughty. He then continues to try and kill this guy other, and he tries to break into his home by squeezing himself into the fireplace. He promptly clings to barely managed to get out. She then went into the basement and then tried to kill the guy by smothering her in her room. It can not seem to kill the guy in this way so it grabs a star of the tree and slits the throat guys. What's the heck was a tree even doing in the room in the first place? Oh yeah, the killer before this killing stopped at a party and had some fun too. Well that's about it except for the city people chasing him with torches and the unresolved part with his brother and tune it wants to play. What was even about? She continued to talk about something that never really explained. How it ends you ask, well since I have spoilers I'll tell you. He runs on the road to his van and gets in, well allowed just to say he was lame !!!!!!!!!!!!
