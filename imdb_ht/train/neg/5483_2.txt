I just blow four dollars rent this movie! Why Atlantis Alliance would encourage such a poor excuse for a movie is beyond me. But even more surprisingly revised they are reasonably good that a couple of critics of the Canadian newspaper gave this film. I'm tired of our media justifying a movie simply because it's Canadian budget and low budget. It's like they expect the Canadian movie to be lousy, so they give it a good review anyway. <br /> Now, on the movie: The act was below average (the exception of male character's lead, who was actually pretty good). Quality movie was poor, which I guess might expect in the budget very low. The script was absolutely horrendous. An example is the story that revolves around one of the lead characters, a drug dealer who flirt with one of his clients so that he can recruit him in rows and steal bikes for his gang, whose only goal is randomly destroyed the SUV. Supposedly many of her gang bicycle members are destroying these activities (I do not know how it can not afford to just buy new, because it would be supposed to be this huge drug connection great from Vancouver to Toronto). /> <br /> Anyway, the point in the story (which does not reveal up to half of the movie) is that the drug dealer plans firefighters in Toronto area to try to make more affordable housing - as one will want to live in the area. <br /> - Need to say more. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> A movie should not get special treatment just because it's Canadian !!!!
