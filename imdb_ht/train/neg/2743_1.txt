I must admit I did not finish this film because it was so amazingly stupid and not worth watching. I watched her with a room full of children, who also did not laugh at the stupid and bitterness humor. The director, Bob Dolman, seems to be so obsessed with sphincters and genitalia that he overrides the real story that I grew up with. This is not a good movie for kids! In addition to the fact that the content is so bit, the movie is just stupid there is bad flow and no intelligence behind it. What a waste of a perfectly good story. If you read the book when you were younger and loved it, then do not waste your time watching a movie so bad botches that it makes you angry. Buy your kids the book instead.
