This TV-made thriller is all talk, little action. It works hard to set up its scheme conspiracy, but the writing is so blocking the display always the best disorder. In the end, I knew no more about those characters than I did in the beginning. He had a box of "Ten Little Indian" scenarios, but he broke the mid-way in favor of Sally Field's meaning and discovered it in an assassin. Gardening acting here with a gracelessness I rarely seen from her. The early introductions are good, but the writing quickly loses off course and eventually goes over the top. Many hysteria, and constant thunderstorms and lightning effects (which add nothing). A curious failure from producer Aaron Spelling & Leonard Goldberg. With all this talent, could not give us something more than a full script of red herring and Sally Field hidden in a closet?
