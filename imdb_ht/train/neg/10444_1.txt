The only great thing about the movie is its title. In this case, "Snake on an Airplane" is example by judging the book by its cover, the title says nothing about the movie. When I went to the theater, I did not expect Kane's citizens, I expected Independence Day, a film of popcorn fun, but instead, I got the movie Roy Liotta called "turbulence" Yes, this is how bad SOAP. The only thing that makes SOAP better is its title. And it's not the same titled apporiate for the movie, was not even a glimpse of "snake" or "plane" 40 minutes in the movie! What a false advert! If it was not for its title, SOAP would be just another unforgettable B-class summer film. And the R rating? It has the most inevitable movie R rated at all times! The musicians in the movie only add a few words F to make this a R, All of the violence are holding PG-13 levels. Do you know what's really rated? R rated the Superstar Edge! Watch it in Summerslam instead of looting your money on a snake!
