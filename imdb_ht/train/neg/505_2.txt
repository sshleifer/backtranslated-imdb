Wow-this one sucks. I'll sum it up as soon as possible. <br /> A county invites 4 naive slots back to its castle. A bunch of nothing happens for a long time. Some scenes of blaming and un-erotic soft-core scenes happen. Some girls find themselves off (off-screen) -in the end. Only things will be for this one are the device looking decent and costume, some bad dubbing that leads to some unintentionally funny dialogues, and some short nudie short. And believe me-things are not enough to buy this 90-minute teddy that movie. In fact-the best part is the tackle at the beginning of the distributor that features some slut goth slutt covered in blood and shows the tits-and yet-this is definitely not worth the cost of admission for this garbage. As everyone else noted- the title of the movie is completely nonsensical-as there's absolutely bloodless or dancing in any sort of movie at all. It may as well be called the 'Goat-Raper' linking the Circle-Jerk '- and at least then it would have had a better title that is also concerned with nothing in the movie. An accurate title was '90 minutes of torture'-another attractive title that would have been at least true ... for the viewer. The Honestly-trailer that's on the disc shows all the best parts (and I use the term 'best' very wounds ...) so I highly suggest watching that instead of being curious. I can not imagine anyone who loves this wreck in a movie-please take my advice and leave this one on the shelf. 2/10
