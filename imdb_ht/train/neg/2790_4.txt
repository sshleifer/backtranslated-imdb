Julia (Kristina Copeland) travels to her husband Steven Harris (Steven Man) and their baby Alex's children to spend a couple of days with her family at Savage Island, an island of their own. The couple hopes to solve their problems on the weekend of the remote island. While waiting for the ship, Julia and Steven meet two strange men at the port, and when his brother Peter (Brendan Beiser) arrives, he explains that a family of squatters hillbilly lives on the island. Refreshing the smoke smoke while driving the truck in the night and turning the lights ahead for the show; However, he accidentally ran over the young son of Savage's family, but in the dark he believed he had hit an animal. And the Savage family claimed Alex as a compensation for lost sons. The Young Family does not accept the trade, and they start a deadly war between families. <br /> <br /> "Savage Island" is a very low-budget film, and a mere stupid, cinema movie but good acting secrets. The defective story is totally absurd, and there are plenty of incredible situations. For example, how can two people leave the woman and the baby alone in the road during the night and the threat of the disruptive family? The logical procedure would immediately be on the continent and bring police force to rescue Peter. Then the young family disappears; Julia and Steven leave their cars on the continent with their homes and friends, and nobody chases them? Peter called his sister Julia when he came up with the boat in the beginning. There are so many flaws in this movie that I could spend a lot of lines on this topic. I believe that this movie was filmed with a home video camera so horrible images. The good cast deserves a better material at work. My vote is four. Brazil (Brazil): "Island of Blood"
