I love Morgan Freeman. Pegas Vega is an attractive, appealing and talented attractive. I'm sure this would have a good movie that had nothing to do with it. There is nothing to do. Short (less than 90 minutes). It was 75 minutes too long. After an hour of frustration, I checked in the remaining 20-odd minutes. Drugs. Freeman plays an actor - who has not worked in a short time - researching a party that he might play, as a cashier clerk in a supermarket. He visits the supermarket where he works. Nothing happens. He decided to give him a ride home and go to an Arby, a target, a car wash. Nothing happens. They are converted to life. Nothing happens. Ever since. <br /> I do not get it. But I also do not get Bill Murray Cops "The Lost In Translation" and "Flower Flowers". If you love those movies, maybe you'll love this. Many people get movies like this fantasy, good, or - for the sake of my escape - finding the fascinating dialogue. A common feature of this ilk cinema is to have a LONG take in silence / silence after an actor delivers a line that's supposed to be meaningful. We know it's important because it was followed by two minutes of anything on the screen. Sorry, I must be a filist. I did not find it. For me, these types of movies are not funny, or good, or thought-provoking. They're just boring. Why? Because there is no comedy. No drama. No tension. No laugh. No suspension. No action. There is nothing to look up. In short, none of these things I go to the movies for. I can be bored for free. I see oddball / quirky characters in real life. I go to Target, with fast-food restaurants, and car-washing. These elements do not make a movie, even if the stars are doing this. I pay to be entertained. <br /> If you are crazy about Morgan Freeman and just love to hear him ramble over on nothing, have fun. If you want to breathe on Pegas Vega, you can watch and listen to it. But nothing happens, I promise. A total snoozefest.
