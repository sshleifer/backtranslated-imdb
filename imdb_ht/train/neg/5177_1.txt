This is so bad, so very pretty bad. The act is the biggest joke in history. Do not even bother to see it, I made her ff after 20 min and it was just as disappointing to the end as at the start ... I really do not understand people tastes, I'm a horror movie fan and I'm not quick, but I make a limit! Perhaps it was a quarter of a better star then at the beginning of the Hoast, but that's it. So I recommend you do not waste the 15 minutes you'll be able to watch. I mean acting better by monkeys. And the big fee and parent's role is just awful. Do not pay characters in C movies? My name must say it is not the first time I think a horror movie is bad but it's absolutely one of my ten movies and it will load places and the portrait of a vampire, Cabin by the lake, the Seal!
