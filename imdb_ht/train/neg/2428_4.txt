Visitors to things they will remember most are the bad headache caused by the overly flashy, unstable, camera-work and fast, confusing. I'm not against those types of stylistic devices if they do right like Oliver Stone and Steven Soderbergh evidence and most of the movies, but in this case there were too many ways. It looks like the jump-offs and light flashes that accompany every flight over Mexico and all the important scenes there are distracting you from realizing that the story is quite thin and the whole thing was very predictable. The biggest development lies in the fact that you can easily know how everything will end. For a movie that pretends to be violent, unkind and morally corrupt it is inexcusable that the story has been said many times with a lot more depth and character development. This is another disappointing aspect of the film. If I want to look at the action flick, I do not need any justification, but this movie tried to justify the murder of Denzel Washington's character and fails to deliver any credible performance. The first half hour or so there is nothing much happening except that dummy archetypes and stereos are outlined and when the action machine starts to roll it so quickly off that you do not know what's really happening. So the movie does not work either on the level of a drama drama / believer, or as a pure action movie. Of course the movie is not as bad as some often the blokbusters are totally messed up in recent years, but I absolutely can not understand why many people claim this movie to be something cool and cool. For a video clip it is way too long and for a movie it has too little substance.
