At first glance at the slogan sketch I figured it could be a decent movie. Could I ever have more harm? The beginning of the movie makes it seem a bunch of phenomena got together and decided to make a budget low budget. For the first 10 minutes you do not notice cheesy to act, terrible sounds and God-terrible special effects, but then it gets worse. Just about 20 minutes in her I asked myself, "What was the plot again?" I could only ask this question when I was not busted out laughing from the absolute lameness of this movie. The main actor has one environment for emotion and sticks it to the entire movie, even though it's supposed to go in love with hatred and everything in between. The flashback scene almost made me vomit because it made me re-live an extra minute of footage from earlier in the movie. Now we hit among the movie where they obviously tries to rip into Morpheus from the "Matrix," although it's doing just a horrible job. The actor is talking about "Star Wars" and almost unbearable fortune cookies phrase. Now, at the end of the movie you do not realize that it's the end of the movie because you actually think the plot is finally developing. The "Morpheus" character dies, the only good thing about the movie. He uses a couple words and credits to roll. What is it? No scheme, bad act, everything cheesy, he could not get any worse. Please, if you appreciate human descent, do not look at this picture!
