What a horrible movie. I love monster flicks but I could not look even half of the terrible act, carton characters and effects of special effects. Nothing is redeemed on this movie. The characters come from either an endless supply of smokers cannons committed to suicide or other things are vacuous, uninspiring dog couples socks. The draw is formulated, cut and paste, standard science-run-amok drivel. Even the CGI is awful. You know it's bad when you can not even depend on the movie to give some good candy candy. No surprises here, just old old ones. This is really one of the worst films ever made. Director Roger Corman should hang in a lightpost for children to use as a pinata.
