CRIM BOSS is led by Alberto De Martino; an Italian crime drama has been partially filmed in Hamburg, Germany. An easy to forget movie. Even in spite of a good sequel chase machine, this flicker looks like wood on almost haphazard. A new don take on a powerful Mafia family and finds himself fighting for his own life. Lawscribable and ethical laws of the Mafia code make it difficult to trust anyone except when millions of dollars are at stake. Brutality and violence cross the same in return. This can not be placed on a rack with the real gangster epics. Just look at the movie bringing back the American-drive memory to fare. Even the popular American actor Telly Savalas can not reinforce the caliber of this crime drama. Antonio Sabato also starred with: Paola Tedesco, Guido Lollobrigida, Serio Tramonti and Piero Morgia.
