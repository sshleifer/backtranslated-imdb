Blonde and Blonder were unfunny.Basically, it was a rip-off girl version of Dumb and Dumber, but less funny, and used too much background noise and music. VERY FREE OF NOISES AND MUSIC IF YOU ASK MY !!!! It starts out incredibly boring, and TOTALLY inane. It does not pick up any pace soon, and I felt more frustrated as this nonsense was carried on. Perhaps, the only thing that saved me from giving this movie a 1 was the last 30 minutes. I found it a bit entertaining and interesting as it near the end, but that was the only part. Also, I could not help but like Pamela Anderson and Denise Richard's character little. Even if this film did not get any laugh at me, he kept my attention. I would not say completely to avoid this movie, but there are thousands of best films for you to spend your time with money over blonde and blonde.
