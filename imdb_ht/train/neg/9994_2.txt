Hmmm, a sports team is in an aircraft crash, gets trapped on a snowy mountain, and it faced the hard decision to eat the meat of dead mates in order to survive. Does everyone know? I look at "alive" in 1993. The only big difference here, of course, is that a big, white, weeping sore crow in a yeti show up a few times drag on the deceased. I guess people are better than yaks. <br /> <br /> Stupid: The man in the first stage does not have a serious firearm when hunting the Yeti, or having a backup. The plane plane is completely bogus. It would either explode in the air, exploded when it hit the ground, or gets erased. People would not survive, but hey, it's sci-fi. <br /> <br /> Stupid: They survived and are cold. It might be a good idea in whole some of the burning debris nearby so they do not freeze to death. Fire was hot as it is ... <br /> <br /> WTF: The jellyfish pilot forms all over her face while she was alive and talk, but oddly enough, no one else does . <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />. <br /> <br /> Stupid: They get dresses and hoodies, and yet have in the cold in the Himalayas, they fail to use the huts! <br /> <br /> Stupid: They're staring at a pile of air sticks, I repeat, there are pieces of the aircraft burning all the time. <br /> <br /> Stupid: The Himalayas are notorious for its storms. It would be good for them to collect debris so they can strengthen their structures rather than sitting out. There are a lot of trees pine around, branches that make excellent insulation. <br /> WTF: And doubt, using a dead person's arm as a headset. <br /> WTF: If the guy one knows so much about the habitual habitation of squirrels, bears, and leopards in the Himalayas, then why does he not know enough to make shelters and set traps right from the start? <br /> <br /> WTF: Do you know how difficult it should be to cut off a jelly? How difficult would it be to cut off a jelly? corpse with a shard of glass? <br /> <br /> WTF: The group was ready and armed to fight the Yeti while the other two stood up the defense. The yeti worn out the guy's heart and stomped the girl's head, and the gang did nothing. There's love. <br /> So, the Yetis with a practical avalanche bury the evidence forever .... or think. Mwuhahahaa! The story continues to be more idiocy, but the most recent action in the past 15 minutes, usually. Nice to think of the spear and the chain, although this is some intelligence (and the magically-appearing chain) that they missed the beginning of the movie when they could not even fire in the fact that it was all around where they are. As is typical of the original sci-fi, kissing couple love at the end like nothing horrible just happen to them (not to mention being eaten by human bodies and not rubbing their teeth in several day). <br /> <br /> The very end, however, is lame quote.
