The Tarzan Man Ape is a remake of the 1932 film at the same time, and like that earlier film, he has little resemblance to Burroughs' literary characters. But while Tarzan 1932 reduced the Tarzan-Jane speech, Tarzan, played by Miles O'Keeffe, did not speak or even grunt. He makes the Tarzan call a couple of times, which sounds like it was sampled in the movie earlier. No, Tarzan plays second-hand Bo Derek as Jane. Or rather, like the third banana of Bo Derek's left breast and her right breasts. This movie has no point but to show Derek Naked. The scene of action in the movie is presented in slow motion, and they are really bad. More proof that no one cares. <br /> <br /> Bizarman enough, Tarzan has an orangutan kick in this movie. Maybe it car pool of Sumatra and American elephants are also on display.
