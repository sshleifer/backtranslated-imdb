A really scary movie. Feel as though he did in the early '90s by a straightforward person who wanted to show that the gays are good, normal, mainstream-aspiring people. Retrograde to the point of being offensive, LTR suggests that monogamy and marriage are the preferred way to salvation for sad, lonely, sex-crazy gays. Wow! Who knew? The supported characters are caricatures of gay stereotypes (the sophisticated buffalo, the bitter, solitary queen, hag fault, etc.) and the main characters are milquetoast, middle class, middlebrow clubs, of little interest. / As far as the romantic and ideological struggles of the main couples concerned, there is not much to say: we've seen it all before, and do better.
