This has to be one of the worst movies I've ever seen. The DVD gave me free and an order I put online for related DVD articles. <br /> Do not be surprised to give away, surely no one could have part with money for this drivel. <br /> <How / How Evaluators can say that they have found it hilarious candlelight beliefs, including people in the worst five films ever had it's place on. How the world of a talented actor like Philip Seymour Hoffman could participate in this garbage is incredible. Mainly humor toilets and seriously do in this. <br /> <br /> Anyone who wants to be entertained should avoid this at all costs.
