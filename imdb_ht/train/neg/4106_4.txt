It was almost unfathomable to me that this film would be a bust but I was all really disappointed. Having a cinema in Pekinpah movies for years, I found this DVD, drastically reduced, for selling and thinking it was worth a shot. Opening some credits, iconic for Pekinpah fans, has interrupted people and animals, but here we have no ambient diegetic noise in children playing in a school while a bomb is being planted. Fantastic suspense. Then, when the peasants, Caan and Duval, traveled to the next missions, Duval drops the bomb on Cann that date last night had an STD, found only by snooping in her purse while Cann was intimate with it. The lingering street is fantastic, and it is clearly paid homage to Brian Depalma's dresses killed, at the short-lived expense of Ang Dickenson. The problem with the killer elite is that after the opening credits, the film falls flat. Even my head Alfredo Garcia has the highest production value, a bold call for anyone who knows what I'm talking about. I use Pekinpah's credit as an extra conference material, but once it's finished, turn the Killer Elite.
