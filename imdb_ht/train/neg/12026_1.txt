I really want that when making a comedy, the people actually tried to make it funny. This is a movie that you can sit in, but there is nothing special about it. After watching it, you will say it was OK. It was not boring to watch, but he gave the audience no jokes to laugh at. Entertainment should mean that you actually get something more than one o.k. story. This movie wanted "Tootsie", but instead it failed. <br /> I gave it a 1 out of 10.
