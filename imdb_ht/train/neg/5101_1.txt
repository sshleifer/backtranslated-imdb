The one thing that happened to me after watching this drivel, I would never find the time I used to watch this, back again. If you want to see Stacey Keach and Michael Dorn try and earn what was to be then the payments down on a holiday home then stay tuned. Wooden act, poor special effects, only the comedy critique was also our alien hero was in the form of female and this is about as soon as he made it mandatory b-movie sex to naked sex in 30 mins of the movie. The opportunity made that a decent movie could disappear from the moment Nicole Eggbert's alien clock at a bar in 30 seconds, also the Police, Military and Public Joe does not wear cotton on the women drinking coffee, using the cup to drop and place four jumper at once. It must obviously be from another planet. Just where I wish I was when this movie was over.
