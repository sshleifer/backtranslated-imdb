This movie was so terrible it was almost good ... almost. We love music, but not this one. Even with the sound of terrible sound, poor cinematography, and many actors who can not sing or dance, Anthony Rapp actually managed to give a good performance (especially toward the end). Marjorie of character, a drinking lady, was enjoyable to watch, too. <br /> <br /> The plot is very unexpected and could be funny without terrible songs and cheesy piano music. Admittedly, some of the (fantabulous) songs are very catchy (but not in a good way). <br /> <br /> Open House is a funny movie to look simply because it is awful! We think it might be a good stage music (with excellent actors).
