five minutes after watching this I'm logged in on IMDb warns all of you out there by hurting this movie ... genre: horror? he had moments of mild suspicion and in the movie all I thought myself "somethings forced to arrive soon" he was not ... when the movie ended I felt so embarrassed for the writer / director Ever been the biggest fan of patrick this guy's just did not know how to make movies and after watching this excuse of a horror film I went to was not the biggest fan of not going to look at another it .. I took in the plot summary please do not make the same mistake. <br /> I gave this movie a 2 for the actors .. they were not bad and did not have the fault they had as bad guys ...
