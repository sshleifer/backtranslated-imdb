OK - The first account: Mandatory '70 of allegators (all right, correction - kimann) and members of the vegetables have done the worst for miniature underwater shots (and the full length of comparative reptiles and the size of the boat) They have been swirled around the game ship in largely lit water - even for night shots! Unlike most primitive-kill-exploitation-Western films, the superstitious native will be **** and begin to massacre the vacationers seem to be unfounded this time. No victims of native abuses - exploited, yes, but far away from abusive treatment. After all, he was one of the natives (kanudling with a spoiled supermodel during a full moon taboo) that brought the curse of the River Demon, right? <br /> <br /> The vacationers are easy annoying (with the remarkable exception of the old-soul sign / mildly speaking on-the-small-girl-who-take-a-shine-to-hero that you often see at the Euroflicks 70), but far from worthy of violent deaths - unless they were your next door neighbors, yourself. A couple actually get killed were heroic - remarkable that none of them fulfilled the role of sidekick. There are only two bandits straight into the entire movie, so they feel they are more arbitrary than cathartic. The sequence where the crimson giant crunches down and scarves thirty tourists in under five minutes will probably hit you as hilarious involuntary. <br /> The point of the natives decided not to wipe survivors to survive and practically saying "Hey, you're not so bad after all, sorry about that fake than last night" - because they blow up the monster lizard - Do you shake your head as the corny music kicks in. You know, the local military dictatorship will wipe out the village for the **** ing and the tourist trade after the roll book ... <br /> </> To them: Barbara Bach. Barbara Bach. Barbara Bach. Barbara Bach. YOU ALL KNOW why you are interested in this movie in the first place, right? I thought that. If you are a Bach writer, get the DVD reviewed by NoShame earlier this year (numerically remastered with no real spending to speak in, aside from the director bemoaning the current state of international film distribution). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />! <br /> <br /> Worth a look, but get it cheaply!
