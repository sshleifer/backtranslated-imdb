This is one of those movies you think that the musicians would refuse to drop it because it's so awful. Obviously they thought that the kids are stupid and are excellent for absorbing endless ads and thinking they are fun because it's funny slapstick. What is it with the machine talking to Wendy's, McDonald, M & M's and Skittles? There was no mention of the car in the cartoon. (Dr) Claw is supposed to be bad, not nice and good. Why is Rupert Everet Strike Anyway? Are the writers on drugs when they wrote these scenes? It seems to be (seriously) lampooning robot cop, and turning a man into a fake crime stuff Android. I tried to get my money back but there was a policy where if I watched more than 30 minutes in a movie, you did not get a refund. I'm sorry to look more than 30 minutes in that pile of crap. After I told the no-refinance policy, I decided to look at the rest of the hideous garbage called Gadget Inspector.
