It's like a strange movie, you can call it awful or if you sit with friends it can give you a laugh-athon killer. Strange comes to mind again and again. Injectically, injections, acting even worse with their direction, maybe none. The special effects are funny but the accompanied by a flying demon baby will surely be the biggest hit. Watch it if you have time to kill. But do not, do not even try to take it seriously. Suppose to be a tribute to 'Holocaust Porno'. Since I did not see it, from paying the tax I can assume it to be as bad. They should give it 1/10, but it made me a good laugh or two, so it became a 3. Overwhelming, the only thing someone was working on. Stay away if you squeamish, more gore than laughing. Ask if the singers had a laugh to do it?
