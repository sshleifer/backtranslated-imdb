I find it hard to believe anyone would put this movie in the same context as the Exorcist. Where the exorcist was subtle and creepy, Stigmata was weakened, clumsy, and also formulated. <br /> This is one of the most visually beautiful films I've seen in a while, but the imagery does not make up for the downward spiral of the patronizing display that makes it unbearable. <br /> <br /> I was interested in this movie when it was compared to the exorcist, and my visit to the official website has increased interest. The website has many stories of stigmata "current" throughout history. However, scenes by scenes, the film is so obsessed by its quest for "authenticity" that it becomes funny first, then outright hard to look at the end. I began to get suspicious when the priest was charged with investigating potential marks in the beauty salon where we should heroine cut hair and, obviously, flirting with priests. The draw: A woman without faith begins to receive the wounds of Christ (the Stigmata) and she is baffled and angry about the ordeal. A priest sent straight from the Vatican investigating the case. Is Frankie owned by Satan, or a vessel for Jesus Christ? <br /> <br /> The only miracle of this film is that it finally ends.
