Well, I'm absolutely LOVE Ben Stiller, although I'm warm on Jennifer Aniston. I do not think this girl can act in the least. Every movie or sitcom I've seen it's very hard to get past her fake act. It sounds like it just stands there right on the script. This movie only has a good thing about it, and that's what Ben Stiller was in it. This draw is so used and abused it in ridiculous. How many movies have this same type of draw ?? Can We Say "The Strength of Nature?" Not only is the plot so old, but the result is so predictable, it's boring. I knew everything that was going to happen before it was done. It was a make, but watching Stiller is always a fun !!!
