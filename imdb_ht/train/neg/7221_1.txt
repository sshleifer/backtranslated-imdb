.... WHAT IT IS IT! What kind of movie do you want to go with movie maker and say "WHY?" Graphic camera work ... counting the camera times is trying to stay fixed on one person and can not. The dialogue is ridiculous. The act is funny. It seems that they took over a ghost town in the west to see if they could make a movie about the least amount of money possible. I would bet $ 10 using home video cameras to do this. Either, or most of the cameras have been drinking. Truly the trailers are more fun than the movie. If you ever want to organize a "movie movie", bring this one. Want more entertainment ... set in a wall.
