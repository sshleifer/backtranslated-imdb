As seems to be the general in the comments, the movie has some stunning animation (I watch it on blu-ray) but it really falls short of any real depth. <br /> <br /> Firstly, all the lovely characters. I got a hint of a kind of Laputa situation between Agito, Toola and Shunack in main antagonist. However maybe my mind wanderd and this was wishful thinking (Laputa being my favorite anime, original Engilsh dub). Characters are not really adorable either and as mentioned in another post they fall in love exceptionally quickly, leaving poor old Minka jealous and rejected (she likes Agito, who looks submissive to this). However he promptly seems to forgive Toola at the end that has no explanation for the change of heart other than it does end up a bit more "happy". <br /> There is also a serious lack of explanation. Like who are the Druids really? Are they people? and are the strange women / girls who seem to hang out with them and run the jungle? There is nothing that explains why they are and how they can provide great human power. Plants coming from the moon are still not filled in the empty spaces on this. It is almost like a strange version of the Day of the Triffids. <br /> <br /> And who is called Toola? why to harness with this if it will explain? <br /> I really wanted to like this movie but I found the plot no where near to the bottom as a movie like the Ghost in the Shell or have any real characters like those of Miyazaki. I do not hate looking at him but I'm sort of wanting I did not buy it. My advice? Give it a go if you have a couple of hours of spare, but borrow it, or buy it cheap! Perhaps if you are new to animated film and not have much to go by you will enjoy it. It certainly is visually fun.
