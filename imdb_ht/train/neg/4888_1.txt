Nick Millard aka Nick Phillips should be left alone enough by doing "crazy criminals" 10 years before they release this god-terrible waste in time and effort. The fact that the original "Crazy Criminals" was less than an hour in length should include it in the fact that it was probably the latter storyline for all it was going to get out of it ... but instead it opts to use TONS of footage from the original to this one as well, even at the point of recycling the original opening sequence credits! Unfortunately, they brought back Prisma Alden rapidly aging did not save this one. What little of original footage was in this movie flicker seems that if it was filmed with a rented camera but kept! If this film cost more than $ 100 I would be very surprised and I should be surprised if he did anything close to that amount! Avoid this one and look the original instead!
