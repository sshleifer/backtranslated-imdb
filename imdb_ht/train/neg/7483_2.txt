One would think (as I did), that with Steve Martin, Goldie Hawn, and John Cleese, a movie should be, at least in many, decent. These stars (especially Martin and Cleese) have produced some of the funniest works of comedy at all times. <br /> Well, apparently I've grossly mistaken - this is single-handedly one of the worst movies I've ever seen. It boggles my mind how a joke after the other can be so profoundly unfunny. She scratched me to watch these talented actors executing one of the most positively blaming scripts I had had to happen at all. Based only on the great names, I remain hopeful for a long time in the duration of the movie, but it still fails to give no entertainment too. Normally, both with movies and in life, I try to stay away from the partial and generalized comments. But with this movie, it's hard to keep loose. I can count on one hand, maybe even two or three fingers, great Hollywood production that leaves me more bitter than that. This is unlikely one of the worst comedy ever to do. <br /> I tried to enjoy this --- I really did. But Out-of-Towners finally fail miserably. If you really want to have time-efficient entertainment, just take your money and watch it whirlpool as you stick it down the toilet. Just please do not watch this movie.
