Sure, I love cartoons short, but I did not like like this one. Of course, children would like it. But then again, I'm no longer a kid (although I still consider myself young). <br /> I will not tell you anything about the story, for the simple reason there is no history. How is it possible to drag this dragon to a cartoon nominated for an Oscar? Well ... I guess it's because people in the 30 were more happy with not much now. In our present life, everything must happen fast. Look at the movies nowadays, and you will come to the same conclusion: we live in a society that does not allow people to be slow. That's really a shame. I wish I lived in the 30's because it looks so peaceful. But whenever there was its ups and downs, I guess ... <br /> <br /> To conclude: if you like music (with frogs), you'll have to view this drawing. Otherwise, do not spread your time on it.
