I like Jamie Foxx. <br /> And I love 99% of all movies I see. <br /> And I walked out of this one. <br /> <br /> Now, I admit, it may have been something to do with the two middle-aged women aged at the back of theater that laughs at every little thing ("Oh, Jamie's hit harder a door! HEE HEE! "), but .. This was just so incredibly annoying. There might be no injected cameras, and no shot camera at a conventional angle ... everything has to be in-your-face, loud, and annoying. The bad guy tried to smooth and Malkovich-like, but at that point, it's just old and tired. It does not bring anything new or interesting. From all the characters, too many lines you've seen come, too many you've heard before, and too many "hard guy" lines ... and I do not mind that sort of thing, really, as long as there's a bit as of its originality. In fact, pretty much all dropping support just sucked. <br /> I love Jamie Foxx, and I think it is really funny, and I thought it was funny in this movie ... but it's not nearly funny enough to support everything else. <br /> This movie needs less shoot-em-up, less annoying camera shots, more emotions, more feelings, and more Jamie Foxx. I gave her a 2.
