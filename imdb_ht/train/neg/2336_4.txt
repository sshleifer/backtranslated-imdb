I read some gushing comments here on IMDb and think I would give this movie a look. Incompetent. On the plus side boys' guides are good, with some interesting photography, but as a whole movie neglected to persuade. Seems to be full of its own individual importance in trying to say something significant but falling short and all in all the picture is a compelling mess. <br /> It is one of those films classified as a Noir movie that can be defined as follows: <br /> "A noir movie marked by an attitude of pessimism, fatalism, threats and cynical characters." <br /> Well, this is the story here: 3 losing people who fall on each other with collective issues including mental illness, alcohol, laziness, debt etc. and together they conspire to kidnap a child and interfere with each other. <br /> <br /> Was being a better movie if the story was more captive in the kidnapping instead of the character weakness of the kidnappers. I thought the female lead was way out of its depth and came across as an amateur actress. <br /> <br /> Also, some good times, I conclude that I've wasted my time. 4/10.
