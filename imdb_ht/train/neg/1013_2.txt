If you watch this movie you know why I said "Jesus, Jesus, Jesus". Hehehe !!! Each time they said "Jesus, Jesus, Jesus" ... I laughed "Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, why I rented this movie"? I can not believe how Oscar winners like Freeman and Spacey appear here in the background while Timberlake and LL Cool J grabbed the screen. WTF are Timberlake? Dreaful aji! I think someone like Joshua Jackson could do a better job! This work was perfect for Joshua Jackson and believed to me that I was not a big fan of him ... but I really prefer an actor, not this Android called Timberlake. And his girlfriend was deep, hollow and annoying as hell. I was happy when they both had popped on the street. <br /> <br /> The story was OK and I think Dylan Mc Dermott has done her bad guys very well. The movie was fun but I think Timberlake lost everything. It would be very enjoyable without him. <br /> <br /> By the way, the music was OK, but suddenly every time the music appeared to film in an MTV video clip with flashes, low movements and things like that. Something moving to this movie my cops thought. Perhaps they wanted to make a MTV video clip for Timberlake.
