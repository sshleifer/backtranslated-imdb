I'm not really sure you even begin to describe how bad this film is. I love bad movies, as they are often the most fun. I love bad effects, bad acting, bad music, and inept direction. With the exception of the music (which was better than I expected), this film had all of these types. <br /> <br /> The special effects were amazingly bad. The worst I've seen since my Nintendo 64. Some scenes look to include the Thunderchild, the woman was broken by the mechanical footage, the Big Ben scene, the wrecked train ... Wow, there are many bad effects! On the plus side, though, some scenes from foreign markets are well done. <br /> <br /> The act was as bad as it could have possibly been, based directly on H. H. Wells' book. For having these materials good sources, it's almost as if the actors were trying to be so over-the-top as to make it funny. Then there's the mustache ... one most distracted piece of facial hair I've seen in a long time. Of course, only half the movie has acted. The rest is character walking around haphazardly and poorly rendering effects of vaccine. <br /> <br /> To say that Timothy Hines is a stupid director would be an injustice to the stupid directors. With the use of different colored filters for any particular reason, utilization of disease rendered for the same scene inside, the green screening test, it's amazing how the man has ever received approval to direct a movie. I would not imagine it would be possible to turn a brilliant book into this movie a bit. Bravo, Mr. Hines. Bravo. <br /> <br /> My advice for anyone planning to see this movie is to do what I did: some friends who enjoy bad movies, drink, play poker while watching it, keep drinking, and maybe you'll do it all the way through. It makes for an excellent movie movie, so have fun and laugh yourself funny with this disaster.
