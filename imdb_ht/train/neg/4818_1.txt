I was about 7 when this MONSTROSITY was released in a movie. In the UK he published on the television in the summer of 1977 for weeks, as if he had some incredible asshole films. It was actually the first movie I've ever seen in a movie, and I've been gone for years to come. This week I was invited to go and see the new movie "Star Wars" and I refused. At that day I have never seen him, in the protest there to watch Sasquatch! Seriously, even at the age of 7 I could say that I was watching garbage. It's just so bad, it's almost incredible. Rambling nonsense that should ever make it to a movie theater. But I was happy to read all these years later that the director never ruled again, just as well as I'm concerned. AVOID IN ALL MONEY !!!
