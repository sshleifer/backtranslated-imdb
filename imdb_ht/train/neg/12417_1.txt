Any movie that starts with a cowhand shagging a little girl can not promise much. As for stereotypes in the kibbutz as it was 50 years ago, well I was there and it just was not like that. Ok each kibbutz was just a bit of something that shows in the movie (like the youth invaded the kitchen at night), but you can not show the whole kibbutz as it was full of all those - we'll say - naughty features . Each kibbutz had its own problem, but hardly any kibbutz had all of them. The views of Israel were great. I always remember my youth in Eden's field called Emek (Deep). Yes, and the act was good too, so you see it was not all black - just a wrong painting - probably on purpose too.
