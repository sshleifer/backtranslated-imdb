From a plot with motion picture, this film was awful. I found myself looking at the clock in the theater hoping he would end up with relief after 80 minutes long as he thanks. Basically, five characters appear in the movie, a son and dad, girl's friend, and two male characters in the son's age that appear and then disappear without context or explanation. The film and scenes seemed to suggest homo-erotic, but nothing ever actually happened to reveal this way to another or another. There was a couple of bright scenes. At the beginning of the movie, girl friend girl shows up in a window outside her room and is engaged in an odd conversation. The picture and lent to linger an incredible seduction in the interaction between the two, ending with it admitting to have someone else who was "older". End of this story.
