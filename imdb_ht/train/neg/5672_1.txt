I'm ashamed to have this movie in my collection. The most ridiculous factor as the DVD player is the short movie of the bonus features. My vote for this film is a big fat zero. Do not despise, I'm a horror girl. but I want some meat behind the story, not to mention I prefer evil to people, they should not be deceived in view, which seemed like forever, clips of animal snuff. Acts of brutality interrupt an achingly long silence and poor act. If I was forced to make a comparison of another movie, the only one that comes to mind is Cannibal Holocaust. Bad, boring, freewill and a total look uncomfortable.
