He was not the most pointless animation movie ever, but he certainly can not admire as much as it tries to be good. Combining Dreamworks Animation and Computer Graphics, this is the story of a Mustang, later called the Spirit (Matt Damon, the first person in narration), and his journey across the borders of the Old West. Basically he is born free of all the other horses in the beautiful country, then he was kidnapped to be used as a horse horse, he managed to throw everyone who tries to ride him. However, when she saves her cage, along with Little Creek (Daniel Studi), two of them form a friendship, oh, and she obviously has something for Little Creek girls. In the end, after a few more saved, being pursued by the Colonel (James Cromwell) and his men, and making a final big leap across a passage, Little Creek lets spirit go, and it also liberates her girl horses, and run home to their country and fellow horses. Also begins Cyber ​​Bernet as Sgt. Adams, Jeff LeBeau as commander Murphy / Railroad, John Rubano as soldier, Richard McGonagle as Bill and Matthew Levin as Joe. I was hoping to see the horses talking in this movie, but it turned out to be more like something dump at all, and the songs by Bryan Adams are not the most engaging, but it is not a terrible movie. She has nominated Oscar for Best Animated Feature, and has nominated the Golden Globe for Best Songs for Bryan Adams' "I Am". Agree!
