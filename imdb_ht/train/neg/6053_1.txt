absolutely garbage. I loved Halloween and then on the johnny was in a bottom spiral. this is about the holes. we get it john. The pro-lifers are awesome! you do not have to make a shitty film that lowered the hell out of my to 'tell' me. <br /> <br /> The rally is the way here. It feels like John did not have much to work with here. In his credit it seems he did not write this junk. There are countless times where the camera is just sitting and waiting for the actors to look dumb or say something dumb. I love the long cut. Too bad carpenter does not know how to hire it. He needs to bunk up with Herzog and Fassbinder 30 years ago. Please, John, stop making fools of yourself and boring me to death!
