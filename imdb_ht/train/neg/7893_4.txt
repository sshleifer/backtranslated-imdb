At the beginning we get to see the start of a secret board of some kind. It all looks very promising from the go away. With some supernatural elements thrown into, the mystery becomes more interesting by the minute. The main character seems to be a good trap to enter into trouble because of his claim for the money it has the right (temptation) and other factors. You really empathize with the guy and want to know what exactly is going on. Normally someone in his situation would have several options. Somehow it does not have these options. In this movie only seems to be a solution even when it's clear it's not his fault. From the blue it meets the church-speaking characters, pray with God. And then the answer to his problem is given. It should be obvious to a point in the movie what this solution. Now let me say that there is nothing wrong with this message. Since it is still useful. But it was really necessary to disguise this message. This religious element actually lost experience experience for me. While the message is good, its simplicity can not escape the fact that in real life more needs to be resolved issues presented in this movie. The mystery presented in us never come to settle. In place you are forced to deal with another topic that essentially has nothing to do with the plot. Do not get fooled because of Malcolm Mcdowell. A brilliant actor is adequate, but if you look good, you'll see that it's not serious at all. It really must be desperate for money. Otherwise it would have been an actor in its caliber acting in a movie like this.
