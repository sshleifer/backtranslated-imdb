Not even worth watching this small miner crush everything on 'Annie'. The characters seem almost cheapened by the wrong storyline written and they feel good in the output. It was very clear for TV, yet if I found it on my TV, I would flick it right over. Children in the movie do a job aware, but the adults acting is incredible and thus the movie does not really draw you in. This movie missed the music / dance songs thats made the original brilliant and really captured the brilliance of our Annie all love. Johnson, as Annie is at annoying times and acting .. you can not convince yourself that she really is Annie. The differences in character's appearance continue to irritate me while in the movie. Sad to say this was a total flop.
