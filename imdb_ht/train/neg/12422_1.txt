I rent this movie to see what could be a movie movie, which does not stop movie action and got this sentimental and super cheap budget action drama-making Kickboxer look like Hard Hard. Lou and Reb are in Vietnam and as Lou saves Reb from the throat, it gets injected at the top of what is unlikely to one of the worst effects ever. Vietnamese scenes are shot in someones yards, I swear! Heavy is now damaged brain and Reb and he lives with his own bar. Super homoerotic. Lou is convinced to fight in a cage for money, and Reb goes on a killing act to make it back. There is no good fighting scene at all, the punches are two inches away from someone. Personality characters change into subjects in seconds. A guy is a bad and at the next stage he's fine. The act is surprising and the music is some overwhelming sentimental Frank Stallone sounding that would make you sick. I hated this movie.
