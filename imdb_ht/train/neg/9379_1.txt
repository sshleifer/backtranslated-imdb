This movie. . . I do not know. Why would they take such an indelible character as Pippi Longstocking and cast the tami Erin's genuinely worthless, I will never know. Why spend money on art direction and some special effects by all-the-bad, then do not bother to edit it well, I will never know. Why do the sets and costumes are sometimes in periods, and sometimes bizarre by, why they are commissioned SUCH bad songs, why the script does not make any sense too (not even about an unusual, movie movie). . . . what they thought? Nothing about this movie is quite as it should be. Every single armed part (and always wrong, each sound effect is slightly wrong, each edit is in the wrong place, all performance is bad in some ways. He managed to create an appropriate atmosphere, despite all the problems, but it is NEVER capturing the magic that is Astrid Lindgren's creation.
