I bought Unhinged because I got sacked by the gory picture on the cover. If you want to see all the good parts of the movie just look on the back of the box. All the killings are shown and I can honestly tell you that they look better at the boards they still have in the movie. <br /> <br /> Having said that, let's look at the draw. A group of college girls driven into a rock concert (by way of deep, dark backgrounds in one of the longest driving sequences ever captured on seluloid) slipping off the road. There is no visible damage done on the machine but apparently it was enough to put one of the characters in a state of comatose for the rest of the movie (or perhaps read the script and it was already in a coma before filming was start). <Br /> <br /> Two remaining girls wake up in a large, isolated house. The home, by the way, is fabulous and manages more drama only by its presence than any of the actors in the movie. For some reason, though, this house has no route to it. The only way to get to the main road is to hike five miles into the woods. The girls spent the rest of Unhinged sitting around listening to strange conversations between an old rich bitch (similar to George Washington's drag) and he equally family, sexual reprimanded daughter. The girls apparently were in no hurry to get back from that concert anyway being charged more clothes than cast at Gilligan Island for this three-hour trip. <br /> <br /> By the time we, the viewers, get the scenes to kill, we no longer care. We hope that someone would kill us just to the end of our suffering. Unhinged finally ends with a shocking sequel that deserves to be in a better movie. It's almost as if the end, the only good idea of ​​the movie, was first written and then the writers tried to make a movie leading up to it. <br /> <br /> Unhinged is finally a boring and miserable movie, direct inept, and a plot that has more holes than a disease in a porn movie (sorry .. I'm not sure where it came from). You will find an idea of ​​how bad this film is during the opening hours of credit, for some reason never explained, the screen goes black for about two minutes while the characters talk about nothing worth remembering. Do not waste your time. You will just feel unhinged and want your time and money back.
