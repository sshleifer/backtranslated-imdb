The creativity of this film has been lost since the beginning when the writers and directors leave a good story line, only to replace and specially affect the affected. This movie seemed to be focused on fun kids but could not even accomplish that. Many low budget films have the potential to become big cinema, but this movie has no place near this. Fortunately this will be another movie easy to do, and easy to forget. This film was probably a chance for the actors to make a little money on the side until their chance came together for a real role in a good movie. Anyone who has a little bit of respect for film, should avoid viewing this movie at all costs.
