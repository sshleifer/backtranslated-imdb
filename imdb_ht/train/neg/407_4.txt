I love the special effects and witnesses of new technologies that make science fiction look like real. Special effects in this movie are very good. I've seen most of this film, since it was oning on HBO for the past couple of months. I must admit, I can miss a few scenes, but I usually draw in movies, and have seen some scenes more than once. But every time I see some of "Hollow's Mom," I feel depressed, almost like a "noir film." I do not know why; Maybe it's that I do not want to Kevin Bacon to be wrong, and there's the disappointment. But I think it's witnessing just how bad it gets. Regardless, I can recommend this movie for excitement (although some parts slowly move), but I do not recommend young people under age 14 (maybe 12, if they are mature).
