This film was a rather odd odd experience. The movie is obviously based on a play. Now I'm sure everything in this movie works out just fine in a game, but for a movie it just does not feel terribly interesting enough to watch. The movie is way too 'stagey' and did not even bother to change some of the dialogue to make it more tight for a movie. Instead presently present is almost literally re-tal filmed in a stage-game, with over-the-top characters and scenes dialogue. Because of all this the storyline really does not work out and the movie becomes a nearly complete exercise exercise - and outdated. <br /> It takes a while before you know that this is a comedy you're watching. At first you think it's a drama you're watching, and characters of the origin of it, but as the film progresses you'll notice that the movie is more a trajikomedy, which leans really more toward the comedy genre, rather that's the genre drama. The characters and dialogs are really the things that make this movie an original and over-the-top movie that really gets incurabble. Sure, the actors are great; Peter O'Toole and Susannah York, among others, but are not really riding the movie to a level of 'look enough'. <br /> The story feels totally disoriented. Basicaly's story is about nothing and just mostly focuses on the siblings characters played by Peter O'Toole and Susannah York. But what exactly is the story about? The movie feels like a useless and outdated one with very little to offer. As I said before; I'm sure the story is good and fun to watch on stage but as a movie it really is not tight and simply does not work out. The correction is simply obnoxious and liver and gets even malicious in certain sequences. <br /> <br /> More was expected of director J. Lee Thompson, who was obviously doing far better movies than this instead failed, step-game translated screen, project. <br /> <br /> Really not worth your time. <br /> <br /> 4/10
