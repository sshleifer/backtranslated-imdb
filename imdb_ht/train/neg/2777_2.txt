Unfortunately, this has been featured on Star Movies here in Thailand for the last week or so. It completes garbage acting. As another member said, this movie is a good example of 'how to act.' I did not see a movie so badly acted in a long time. The actors (you can call them 'actors'?) They are completely flat and deliver the lines and the passion of a dead dog. I would say that in order to truly understand how bad the act is, you should see the movie ... but that would be the analogue of torture. <br /> I cringe as the leading lady delivers her line, and the rest of the cast and accents (fake or conquered) is equally amazing. Another actress with the false false accent was very, yes, but good masters have accentuated her awful. Mix that with it (lack of) act and you have a disaster. It should just be said nothing and I could accept it as the beautiful girl. Oh, we just got to the scene where the leading lady lover said "Really me?" After a crying scene forced out of it. Praise. No, really, I'm just laughing loudly. <br /> <br /> and the art directors offer some favors saving the movie. Some of the colorful sets and some of the scenes are rather nice (fewer actors). <br /> <br /> Old magic portion of the lady? What ?! Another member mentioned the 'modern' song of the movie. Totally appropriate for a piece of period placed some 500 years ago. <br /> I understand the movie was considered 'Big Budget' in Thailand at the time of its production. I would be seriously angry if I was the producer of this movie. Just go to show that money does not necessarily make a good movie (or even mediocre). <br /> I would give the king maker a 1 out of 10, but the costumes and sets to save the movie from such a rating. 2 out of 10.
