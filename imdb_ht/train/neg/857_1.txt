Many fans hate this because they left the book, but film is a different way and the books should change when they jump. However, the movie fails completely, but it fails entirely on film themes. I would like to smack the people who tell me the horrible film ever made. I always follow up with the question "Really ... exactly what scary scene you?" Every fan I asked, go silently. Occasionally a person, at a loss for decent pairs (No ...), names the "grape-juice-shoot-out-of-the-shafts" shtick. If you are afraid of that, I do not know what to tell you, except perhaps that you're easily scared. I just roll my eyes watching these island's z-class plays in this movie, incoherent movie. One place to divert the book and really is insipid is the tedious movie to get Mr Halloran up to the outlook only to kill him; and the dumbest member of the audience knows that Jack is waiting behind one of the columns in the corridor that he takes Halloran FOREVER to walk down. Really one of the stupid sequences ever put on film. <br /> <br /> Oh, and the nice choice for Stanley Halloran's artwork! Black light Afro-Nymphomaniacs really add to the mood and character development of a horror movie. Is there ever a much more "cut," out-of-place shot of any movie ever made? <br /> I think it's a miracle that I've eventually been able to bypass this turd, and I agree that Kubricks 2001 is a really important movie, given the 'bad will be immense' produced by both this stupid, stupid film, and cult of fawning, but inarticulate Kubrick fan-boy, who could not describe an idea to work in it with each movie resource of the Library Library ahead. <br /> Launch of the overacting crack in Jack Nicholson, the introduction of mute one-material at the time of tension, and Razzie nomination performance at Shelly Duvall and you have a very discouraging movie.
