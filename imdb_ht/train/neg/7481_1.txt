One should say Goldie Hawn that his career as a teenage gown aged thirty years ago. <br /> <br /> This is one of the worst films that are published in years, an unequivocal disaster in which the two drivers give themselves over to a frenetic display of trademark ticks in an effort to make up for a Wrong bad and bad guides. This thing should have suffered from birth. <br /> I hope John Cleese has paid a lot to have his name attached to this disaster. It is the only scene that came to this chaos more or less unscrupulous, his only fault was a failure to realize that the rest of the cast would shed the picture.
