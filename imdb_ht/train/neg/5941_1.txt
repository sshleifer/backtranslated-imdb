As a fan of Notorious B.I.G., I was looking forward to this movie. I'm unfortunate to see it is a terrible movie. Jamal Woodward is not compelling or realistic enough to show notorious B.I.G. A lot of this is the real son of the Notorious B.I.G son, Christopher Jordan Wallace as Notorious B.I.G. as a kid. Sadly, he does not convince enough to pay his father's money. Derek Luke is just as compelling as Sean "puppies" Combs. In a nutshell, no one is convinced enough to play their role here. The big problem with these is that they are real people are playing. He was bored, and did not provide any information about Notorious B.I.G. That fans and non-fans seem to have not already known. I was especially disappointed with Angela Bassett, a very good actress wasting here as Voletta Wallace. Phase of bullets and bullets on thinking of Notorious B.I.G. Fans will spend tons of money on it. I'm sorry to say that what happened. It's nowhere close to a good movie. I was very much out of it, but unfortunately I did not find anything I wanted out of this. I think you should definitely skip this one.
