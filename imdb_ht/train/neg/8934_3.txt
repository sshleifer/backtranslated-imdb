I bought this DVD without any pre-references but the names of John Huston, Raquel Welch, Mae West and Farrah Fawcett on his cover. I found the Brazilian title very strange, but I decided to look forward to seeing a comic comedy perhaps like "Changing". However the non-sense story is terrible and difficult to describe. Myron Breckinridge (Rex Reed) is submitting to a changed sex operation in Copenhagen and returning to Hollywood says it is to be Myra Breckinridge (Raquel Welch) and claim half the property of his uncle Buck loner (John Huston). Together the days, myra and mi-eyem Myron have corrupted a young couple in his uncle's acne and kinky sex. At a certain moment, the room screenplay is so confused that I believe the whole story was just an idea trip to Myron induced by the crash. Unfortunately the beauties of Raquel Welch and Farrah Fawcett are not enough to hold this flicker. My vote is three. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): Homem & Mulher At√© Certo Ponto
