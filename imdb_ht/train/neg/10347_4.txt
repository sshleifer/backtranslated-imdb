I just saw Adam had four sons for the first time and the thing that struck me was that I believed that the model was used by Theodore Roosevelt and his four sons. They were about the same age as the four boys in this movie. Warner Baxter at his portrait of Adam Stoddard spoke about the same values ​​and family traditions that you would hear in our 26th president without some of the most important aspects of the character TR. <br /> <br /> Like TR Stoddard's grandchildren used in the First World War, in this case even if the youngest only loses an eye rather than being killed. <br /> But what if a female Minx gets into this all at home and bother things? This is Susan Hayward's work here. In one of her most important roles, Hayward is a flirtatious amorous girl who marries one son, has an affair with another, and begins making a play for the third. It is an early presence of kind of part that later brings it to an Oscar I want to live. <br /> I think and as powerful a pattern of decorating as Theodore Roosevelt and Warner Baxter show, everyone is afraid to tell Daddy what's happening. Their sons and Governors are Ingrid Bergman as well. Here's where the plot becomes a little funny. Bergman is presenting us as a Governor hired by Baxter and Fay Wray's wife for the kids. Wray dies and Baxter suffered some financial reversals in business. Bergman must let go. She goes back to France and years later comes back to the family when the kids grow up. <br /> I'm sorry, but I can not believe the kids need a governor right now. Hayward is right when he meets him that he was not the kids who brought him back. In this normal course of things, Bergman would have come up with his life. <br /> <br /> One of the previous reviews said that a third of the movie I was edited out. It is possible for this reason that the drawings are very large. <br /> It's too bad that Ingrid and Susan could not have made another movie together at their fifty when Hayward was at its height and Bergman made just a comeback. Susan Hayward is the main reason for seeing Adam had four sons. And I want to believe that a good deal of Ingrid stayed on the chairs room off.
