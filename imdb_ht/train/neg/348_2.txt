This film is a car and scam Sean Connery machine. Performances are generally prevented by Capshaw, Fishburne, and usually Ed Harris's solid. Connery seems miscast as a Harvard academic. The movie absolutely gets worse as it goes along. It's a third rate mystery that gets very flawless by the time it fails. The movie squanders an excellent cast of support. George Plimpton also turned into a minor role to add some Gravitas to Connery as they debated the death penalty. The violence and the atmosphere pepper a third mystery rate quotient which is manipulation of the highest degree. The scripting and the very poor directions. The charisma canyon and the presence of screens are just virtual movie. Manipulative, violent, and ridiculous. 2/10 Avoid It.
