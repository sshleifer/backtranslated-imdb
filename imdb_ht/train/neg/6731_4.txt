Unlike another review, I think this is well written, especially the more fictional it is, because larger imagination should ask; and well-acting, because there was no other character with whom to share the focus of these dozen-minutes-plus, well-done monologues. But I'm just not entertained by solemn, monastic monks. Everyone has a story to say and some are more interesting than others. Everyone has problems and some are more intense than others. These are just ten, not-very-atypical stories and troubles, showing how anyone's life (or part of it) is film films. Then again, I think wrong in reality shows the TV, too. So, if that's your bag, you can love this. It's kind of thing that would do for good 'phone and / or gossip internet; but absolutely no other-than-verbal action. And, although each of the speakers is female, I'll leave this outta sex.
