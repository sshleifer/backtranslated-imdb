I do not know why Spike Lee did this dragging wreck in a movie and conned poor Stevie Wonder to eternally complement his beautiful music and disruption to this theater. I also lie about how it uses profanity as part of the normal proza ​​of Black Professionals. The abuse of keeping it on the ethnic film visitors is a shame. Scenes that seem to be shouting out blue and have nothing to do with the theme or sub theme, play as if some college kid wrote this. I mainly destroy the comic scene where the two drivers play sparring for no reason at all and the cops come up with rough up Snipes. Often in driving they make one feel as if Spike has no respect for his viewers or he has no sign of what a movie is all about. The final scene appears to be to justify the use of a sledge hammer to make a point. This film supports myths that all F-Words use in cultures in casual conversation. I hope he will realize that the rest of his movies at the same pool as one where he will not grow as a movie brand. I think his union with Scorcesee in Clockers was a wise move. It should be stick to making documentaries like the little tiny little girls. Shock film does not make an Oscar do.
