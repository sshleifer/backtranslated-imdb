I had a lot of problems with this film. <br /> It has some basic basic information regarding mechanical proportions, which is fine. Although physical proportions have been around for more than 50 years, the film presents this information in an enchanting way saying: "Do not just blow it by this!" Well, not really. These are not the earth of revelation breaking again. At any rate, I was already familiar with the theory of proportions, and the fact that the particles must be described by wave equation, etc. is not new. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />! I have no serious and mysterious problems with spiritism, but mechanical proportions do not really have anything to do with things, and it should keep separate. People have interviewed to start this movie with the ideas of proportion theory and then make the growth say simply do not think about something you can change the issue around you, hence we should think positively so as there is a positive impact on the world and making our lives better. The reasoning is completely ridiculous, and conclusions are not logical to follow in proportion theory. For each so-called "expert" that they interviewed for this movie, there are scores of theoretical physicists who would completely agree. They would point out, quite rightly, that the unpredictability of the subatomic world does not lend support to mystical notions about our spiritual awareness. It interrupts me that people will see this movie and completely eat it up because it leaves them with a nice positive feel. The main collision of the film is based on a mention of interpretation of proportion theory, and it is as bad in its reasoning as any attempt to justify organized religion and pseudo-scientific argument similar. <br /> <br /> Oh yeah. At one point, one of the "experts" says that since all history most of the assumptions people have made about the world have turned out to be false, therefore the assumptions we now hold on the world are also likely to be fake. Huh? That totally does not follow. And even if he did, I do not see how to help his argument. I mean, if his ideas have ever become common assumptions then I guess we should assume that they are fake too, based on his own reasoning.
