This film is about an extra group of male male male men who exterminate women on Earth, in order to create a gay universe. <br /> I looked at her with the intention to see how bad she was. Still, I was shocked by how bad she was. She looks more like a movie made 50 years ago. Acting, if any, is ultra-bad. Their composition and support are so ridiculous false, that any college movie looks mega budgets. And the special effects are ridiculous simple, indeed jaw cast as others have commented, but nasty nasty jaws. One has to be seriously intoxicated, or in a changed state of consciousness in order to appreciate this movie. If I came from Denmark, I would be seriously embarrassed and outraged that my countrymen produced such a bad movie bad fears.
