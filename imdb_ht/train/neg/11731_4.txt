As far as I am concerned this silent version of the Merry Widow is the worst version ever made. No tenderness or love or spirituality on this version, it is all grim, Germanic, idle idiocy. He reminds me of Nazi falling in love; Who cares? <br /> This silent version by von Stroheim is not a faithful adaptation of the original story. In this one we have John Gilbert leering and its relative gross prince lusting after this funny American actress, played by Mae Murray, possessing a modern induced hairstyle and feminist fashionable dress that drives me off again and again . I love my romance light and beautiful, and wand build ups; not harsh and sadic like this one. And come on, these bee stung mouth, get rid of them, girls! <br /> Go see a live performance at the show if you would like to get a real idea of ​​the sweetness of the original opera by Franz Lehar. Since then, waiting until TCM shows Jeanette MacDonald - Maurice Chevalier sounds the version. It is best.
