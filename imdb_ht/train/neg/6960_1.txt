After looking at the first 20mn of Blanche (sorry I could not take more of it), I have now confirmed it does not. <br /> <br /> Basically, this "film" is a real insult to the French actors participating in the junk thread. It begins with a concept successfully used in French comedies ("The Hours of the Dead", "The Folie of the Greatness", ...): a historical film and analogous tone / dialogue. This can provide brilliant results if supported by brilliant actors and a "delicacy" in order to avoid stigma in "heavy comedy". <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Horsey-facing Lou Doillon breaks everything with Blanche, instead of a comedy, just go back to a horror movie. Hunters in cinephiles who want to be believed and shock are watching fine actors like Decaune, Zem or Rochefort difficulties in this massage burlyque kitchy-prissy massage.
