This is what happens when you live in China and the local video store is running thin on English-language titles ?? you are blessed with this work of what appears, yes, Romanian movies. But I think it has real-world comedy. <br /> <br /> Even if I do not think it would in fact spoil anyone looking at fun wondering why a movie set in a casino has a scene of beach archery, even in flashbacks. That mystery, and many other concerns, remain to be exploited by desperate comedies, perhaps when they are stuck in Bucharest. <br /> <br /> Let me also wonder why perfectly good-looking people who allow themselves to abuse themselves on movies like this. It's sad.
