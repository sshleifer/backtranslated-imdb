Incredibly 'sketch' of satanic rituals or some mumbo-jumbo given the hokey excerpt of luxurious wireless films in sex scenes together. Straighty vanilla sex, masturbation, lesbianism, S & M, bestiality, incest, and some other sexual spreads all find their time in the spotlight here. The problem is the storyline so dull that the rampant sexuality becomes very tiring after a while. Who knew that a movie with an intimate goat / girl meeting could be so damn boring? Well now I do. <br /> <br /> Candy eyes: Venessa Hidalgo shows all; Helga Line provides T & A (both on display frequently); women visitors take the occasional penis. <br /> <br /> Region 1 DVD Extras: trailer to "pick up", "legend of samure", "do not answer the phone", "first wrong", & "Sister Street Fighter" (also the DVD even holding a movie feature second "evil eye")
