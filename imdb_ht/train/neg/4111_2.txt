Think of a no-budget version of China syndrome being directed by a movie student who idolizes Jan Woo and you will find 'Power Play.' The idea was good, but the execution, act, and dialogue absolutely killed it, not to mention the ridiculous amounts of violence and disasters that were used to compensate for the lack of substance and development of the most interesting parts of the film. > <br /> This is the story of a reporter investigating the disappearance of three members of a group of guerrilla activists who mysteriously disappeared after breaking into the offices of a power plant suspected to be causing a frenzy in earthquake. The reporter rather than rider, will arise against what should have been a bunch of pity at exile company, is chasing around town (with whom he speaks) in order to "own" whatever concludes evidence can remain in the blight of the plant. <br /> Unfortunately, there is no real sense of urgency because the characters communicate with great reluctance, coupled with dysty dialogue and a lot of terrible acts. Not to mention the viewer, who can only attract the movie to appeal to his genre, forcing them to keep an innate body count with the ridiculous amount of violent shooting em ups plus disaster earthquake scenes. All of the focus was placed in the wrong place of apology to compensate for the lack of direction and sequences more interesting in events that should have launched the story. It might have been the best filters to focus more on a thriller, and pay greater attention to developing the corruption aspects of this story. Climb creepy, a naive reporter, and everyone who tries to alert the reporter to doing wrong is walking. It is formulaic, but at least it would have been fun.
