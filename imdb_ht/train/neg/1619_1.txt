At the beginning of the movie, the beautiful photography and scenes of the fox were amazing. However, the story was so slowly and boring. Then the little girl starts the domestic fox, which leads to tragic events. We live in the jungle, and often see fox. One thing that people should know is that you let wild beasts be wild, and enjoy them from afar. This movie sets a terrible example to the kids who will watch it, trying to make a wolf in a pet. I do not know which point in the story was supposed to be. Even after the terrible events with the main fox, the little girl always wanted to play with the kits. Has he never learned his lesson? And there are other scenes featuring fox predatory prey, which only adds to the impact inflicted on children watching this movie. What a disappointment this movie was. And what a terrible story he says. The final storyline was so stupid, not that time my wife and I were screaming in the TV! I absolutely hated this movie, and it never recommended it to anyone!
