Robert Taylor definitely showed himself to be a dramatic dramatic actor in his role as a gun-gun buffalo hunter in this western 1956. It was one of the few times that Taylor would play a bit in a movie. However, this photograph was far from great as shortly after, Taylor ran to television with their successful detective series. <br /> <br /> Stuart Granger hides his British accent and turns into a formidable performance as Taylor's partner. Taylor Lee is a bigot here and hates him for the Indians really show up. Another very good performance here was by veteran actor Lloyd Nolan as an old, old-timer drink who joined the hunt for Buffalo as well. In his early scene, Nolan really did an excellent take-off of Walter Huston in his Oscar-winning role in the treasure of Sierre Madre in 1948. Noting the appearance of Russ Tamblyn in the movie. This year Tamblyn and Nolan would join the Peyton phenomenon. Writing in the movie is the best stiffness. By the end of the movie, it's the elements of nature that made Taylor in. How about the element of the writing here?
