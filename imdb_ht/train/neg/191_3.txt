... do not stay in Montana and especially not to live in the late 19th century. <br /> <br /> "A river runs through it" certainly is a well-made film from a Cineastic point stand. Large landscapes, Redford acts. Unfortunately, the story is bad (if there's a whole story). <br /> I felt sorry for the narrator / author, who is as dry, narrow-minded a character as his father, a preacher. Being driven, does not drive his own life, it is left to watch his brother, who is also pacified in the small town environment, losing his life. The author never came near his brother's motivation motivation, but at least realized, that he is missing the slightest amount of homework / pleasure. All there is fly-fishing, where it follows just as an old man the style of his father. <br /> <br /> The end is not surprising, it is forseeable from the very beginning. <br /> </ Definitely NOT a must-see (3/10) <br />
