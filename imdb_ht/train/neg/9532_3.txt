So this guy named George sits home alone on his birthday when two women show up. George's wife is in a hospital taking care of the boys so when the wife is away from George gets into the bubble bath and makes love both of the girls. It is not that great in a scene because it really does not show anything. After that the birthday boy wakes up in the morning and the girls are still in his house. They make it a nice breakfast but George is not hungry. George is unhappy and tries to dig her but when she comes home to the girls still in her home. The girls had enough and George old and did not want to cook for them. They both turn out to major psychopaths and use George to the little crazy toys. I liked that the girls just did what they wanted and messed up George's house. George was not really that great of his guests. When George said he was a married man, he really did not seem to mean it. George looked like Tom Tucker on Family Guy. I was for the two girls the whole time.
