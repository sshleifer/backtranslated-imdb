Man, this was hilarious. It should be under COMEDY. Or STUPID. It would have been able to accomplish what a pile of stank was easier. Seriously? I want anyone associated with this movie aimed, effective immediately. For those who think of watching this "movie", let's go on a few draw points. Oh, wait. There is no. There are literally no plans. I think Casper Van Dien was bored, and he decided to film something with some random ones, and miraculously, he somehow got on video. This film is literally the worst film of all time. Do not believe me? Go ahead. Make it, people. I dare you. But be prepared to fight your eyes. If you can sit in this blood blowing a cow, you are very strong and courageous.
