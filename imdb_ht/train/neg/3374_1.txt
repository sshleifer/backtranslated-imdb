This movie is considered by some as a classic - I have no idea why. It is terrible to the point of being mockingly. Only the saving grace and movie is the delivery of cheesy lines that are so curlingly nasty toes that you have no choice but to laugh at them. There are a couple of good songs and good choreography in this movie, but so! There is no draw, it is set in a theater that has no change in landscape, and Michael Douglas is like depressing as ever. Brothers once forced me to watch this movie, because he said I would not believe how bad a movie can get! It was good. <br /> Normally with a movie insuportable I would recommend that people should not look it, but in this case I think people should, as it will put all the other bad films you have seen in perspective.
