I saw this movie yesterday. I must admit, it was not my cup of tea. Although it's supposed to be a horror movie of its kind. But as I watched this, I thought. 'This movie does not make any sense at all.' Where on earth did this guy in the dark dress came from? Where did the two men go when they left the girls behind? Where did the earth make a shark from? <br /> All these elements in this movie somehow did not add them. I felt as if these filmmakers had spent so much time with money on a movie that was so tied to be so crap. <br /> I've seen many good horror movies in my time, but this is one of the worst horror cops I've seen. At the end of the movie, I told myself that I would not look it again .. So many pappy shows in this movie, I decided to give it the thumbs down! Count me out of this one! 0 out of 10!
