There are a number of issues with this movie, but the bottom line is that it has tried too much and too little. The base story is quite good, but the money just did not make justice in history. The non-existent budget really kills this movie. Stuart Gordon (the writer / director) wrote credit about 'Honey, I shrunk the Kids', which was a box office break. However, that movie has some cash earn from Disney. Honestly, this is a good example of not making a movie. He waited a few more years, technology would have made it cheaper to do many of the effects. (not to mention he could get a company with money.)
