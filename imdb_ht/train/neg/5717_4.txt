Whoa nelly! I've heard a ton of mixed reviews for this ... but the one I go to gravitational horror horror really finds it to be disappointing. Man was right on the nose! This movie has been acting by best amateurs. They took one take, perhaps two on each scene, the movie seemed soooo run. The script was also poor ... they had unique lines but failed. Miserab. "Get meathooks off of me!" Oh, I hate it when movies try to do that. This happens all the time and comedy ... but, with a horror movie and with lower average actors ... the results are incredibly pathetic. The lines and scenarios were all very predictable. But what made me feel so negative towards this movie was, again, damn to act. It was terrible. In addition to the Asian guy who worked the booth. I thought it was great. The movie is about 5 stupid dumbsh! T Tourism in a vacation in Asia. They end up in the wrong place and fall into the hands of a mafia running / slaughtering. Sounds like a cool story. But watching someone with a bad diarrhea can probably be more fun and intense to watch. The only reason this is considered horror is because of the killing. There was no trace of suspicion. My dear other horror fans have died to get without little little in the middle of this. But unfortunately with a huge U capital, the movie was incredibly disappointing. I enjoyed the ankle breaks and their blood effect. The flush chicks were also so. <br /> All about this movie Amateur movie. This is Ryan Nicholson's first feature, and for the most part it fails. There is no denying it has a sickness sense of humor and taste for horror. I pray his next movie by playing out like another movie horror B ... unless he tells us what he will be. Even after this disappointment I want to give Ryan another shot. From what I saw in him, it is a true, dedicated person in the genre. Good luck next time, because this was bad news.
