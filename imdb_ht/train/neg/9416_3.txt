Steve McQueen has certainly a lot of loyal fans out there. It certainly was a charismatic fellow, one of the most charismatic big screen ever known. But even McQueen can not save this turkey in a movie, shoot and look like a brownie camera at the current premises in St. Louis. <br /> <br /> McQueen of a new kid who has no criminal records brought to the planning of an exit bank by one of the other gangs. There's more than one age hint that there is a gay relationship going on between Steve Steve and David Clarke. He does not like all by the other heist members, especially because of his lack of criminal summary. Steve also had a girlfriend of Molly McCarthy and he suspected something affects, especially when he started hanging around with Crahan Denton and James Dukas as well as Clarke, all the very rough characters. That would certainly get my suspicions excited. The big St. Louis Bank Theft has two directors Charles Guggenheim and John Stix. Guggenheim made mostly documentary and Stix did not do much of anything. One of these two joker decided Steve's performance was best served by making a bad mockery to Marlon Brando. This movie can come down as the worst ever made by Steve McQueen. I want to bet that Dick Powell and Star Star Productions have already signed up for dead or alive dead because I can not believe they would have seen it. <br /> Or they would see something public would be neglected except for the dress for this turkey.
