I went to see the Omega Code and a group of other Christian totaling about 15 people. We all hope a good piece of Christian film-making. What we got was a painful excruciatingly, drawn-out, and very boring attempt in a movie. It has good value production but it also has poor acting, a weak script and disgusting dialogue, and there is no real sense in the direction. From the first 15 minutes we all knew it would be a long night. We all hated it, and some of our group put this movie as reeking in more cheese than "Anaconda." None of us would believe that the film lasted less than 2 hours. Effects of flash and circle cinematography can not save this bad, bad movie. I would give it a 3 out of 10, and the rating is only high because I rent the abominable "movie" werewolf (1996) the night before I saw this movie.
