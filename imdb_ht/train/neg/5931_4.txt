This movie should only be 10 minutes. I mean there is really only 10 minutes worth of watchable content in this stuff (I'm reluctant to call it a movie). The open credit of the movie was somehow promising. As the movie begins by short comment of the man himself, you really rub your hand and stay in for more of Cohen's life. Well, Nick Cave does a reasonable job covering one of Cohen's famous songs. Cave's length of performance makes you even more eager to see more of Cohen whose understanding and well-talk was already your fancy fascination. But as it turns out Cave's performance is just the start of super long language performance by literally a bunch of people who do not even have a minimal attraction to keep you on your seat. I mean what the movie really thinks? Five-minute pre-up shots of wanna be musicians at a fake concert in Australia! What the movie really thinks to insult the audience by adding "fake applause" to these endless performance. The film is a perfect turtle that shows you very little of what you've come to see. There is no single foot in the past Cohen. In fact, except for some photos of her early days as a singer / poet there is absolutely nothing! If you add all the minutes that Cohen talks can not even happen in 10 minutes. But these 10 minutes are tortuously presented bit by bit in between camera-work disasters that capture some of the most unpleasant screams of Cohen's lyrics. If you ever decide to wasting your money on this movie, PA! Just throw it into the trash and at least save your time.
