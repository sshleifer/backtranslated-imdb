The statistics in this film were well done. There is no doubt about it! Al Gore certainly presents her case very well and it is not surprising that this film was praised as she received. Al Gore is certainly quite an actor. It sounds of concern. But actions speak louder than words! Throughout this film, there are political tidbits and references to his political career to pour in the movie. Jimmy Carter, unlike Al Gore, is a man of integrity not only speaking the speech, but walking in the market as well. When Carter thought we needed to retain energy, he turned the territory into the White House and was warmed by wearing a sweater. <br /> <br /> Al Gore tells us that we must retain energy and claim that we are creating global warming while traveling to our own private aircraft. How much energy does it use to jet and how many pollution creates aircraft? How much energy does it take to heat the gore pool behind its castle? It would be good if we could save electricity using smaller devices and make it a point to close anything that is not used. But if we did, the company would react to a 50% reduction in energy by calling it a "50% loss of income" and overcoming the losses by increasing tariffs by 50%. So, "just turn it around" should not be a very good idea. <br /> <br /> This movie is a clear appeal to allow Big Goivernment to take control of everything, in the name of saving earth planet, that is.
