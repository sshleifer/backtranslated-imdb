The first half hour or so of this movie I liked. The obvious budding romance between Ingrid Bergman and Mel Ferrer was beautiful to look and I wanted to see the inevitable reach between them. However, once the action changed to the home of Ingrid's fianc√©, it all completely fell apart. Instead of romance and charm, we see some parallel dopey characteristics featuring the movie ruin. The daughter's daughter's son and the military attack on attracting the maid looked stupid - sort of like a snowboard from an old pirate love episode. How the charm and elegance of the first portion of the movie can give way to dopiness is beyond me. This film is an obvious attempt by Renoir to recapture the success of having the rules of the game, as the film is very similar once the action has changed in the country real estate (similar to the other movie) . I was not a big fan of the rules of the game, but ELENA and people he made me appreciate the artistic and nuances of the original movie.
