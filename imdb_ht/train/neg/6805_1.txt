I've seen the film 10 minutes ago ..WiW I still can not believe what I watched. <br /> <br /> This is absolutely the worst movie ever. If I would list all the flaws in the movie, this review would take me a lot of sentences. (Very funny flaws, because they are bad though) <br /> You got to be amazed and skilled in the commandos assigned to rescue the aircraft. they do not even know how to move. <br /> <br /> Ice-t is bad actor ... and the thing I do not understand is how the production wanted him to be like a hero, but it's a zero .. <br /> <br /> Of course the major flaws will be the landing of a 747, which needs only 3 or 4 tips from a guy in transmission of the land plane ... amazing .. as well as the dead bodys There is almost no blood at all .. But I recommend watching this movie, as it's very interesting to see how bad something can be found
