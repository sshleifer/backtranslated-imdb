I just returned from "El Otro" playing here in Buenos Aires and I must say I was very disappointed. The movie is very slow moving (do not get me wrong, I love moving slow moving movie!), Slow down to the point of driving you crazy. Everything you hear is Julio Chavez breathe heavily throughout the film. This is a bad movie made, but most importantly, it is a movie without a niche of inspiration, I felt nothing for the story or its characters. <br /> <br /> "El Otro" made only for the sake of making a movie ... to make it forget. I would advise you to pass on this one, if you want to see the good films of Argentina, watch for the film by Sorin.
