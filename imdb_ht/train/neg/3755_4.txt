I loved this movie, I'll admit it. This has to be the best (right?) Movie movie I've seen. Well ... I and my friends decide just for shits and giggles that we would rent this movie. We knew what we expected and received exactly what we expected, plus more. And this red course becomes cluttered against the tree by the Sasquatch, we literally watch this part about three to four times, it was amazing (hysterical, of course). And why? Oh why the main character has to roll that much? Like honestly, we know that you are in danger, rolling that much will not help all this much. But really, if this movie is in your local video store RENT IT. It is worth the money and it's not even bad, as it's bad, but not incredibly bad. In general, the complete amazing will be in store for you if you rent this movie.
