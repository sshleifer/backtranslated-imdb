... and even then, even they can live without it. To be honest, this movie (if one denies it's called it) is of real interest only to freaks franchise. Bettie's page fans will learn absolutely nothing new (and I mean * nothing *), nor will they enjoy the hot fuzzies of experienced, unfamiliar, or cherished experiences. <br /> Nevermind's screenplay is abysmal, the wild, less-than-community-theater act, the utterance of the utterance, the illusory lighting, or any of the rest of the negative values ​​of basement production. This is definitely "Hey, kids, let's make a movie!" film-made in the order below. I suppose someone would be grateful that at least they knew how to run the camera. No, I'm sorry to say that none of that is germane why this thing is so outright * wrong *. <br /> <br /> It's wrong because the young lady plays Bettie Page, a girl zaftig girl who has only resemble the rivers of curbs is black hair and the trademark bangs, utterly neglecting bringing anything to the most far beyond a willingness to be tied and gagged. This is apparently a good thing for his movie career before and since this is miserable, but not for the miserable excess, consisting mainly of a romantic number of re-adopted B & D set pieces of sandwich between sorrendous horrible movie -bio detailed scenes Ms. Page falls out of favor (for speaking). There is actually probably more information, each time, on the life page of the opening credits and closing the rest of the movie. <br /> <br /> Do not be fooled. This is not a worthy companion movie of the "Notorious Bettie Page." This is not a movie worthy of all. This is a fetish piece that exchanges on the attractiveness of one of the biggest pin-ups of all time, and does it without class, without style, and without any real sense of understanding the character of Bettie Page . There is no true fan of Bettie going to get it to be anything but a disappointment, I guarantee that. <br /> <br /> Avoid all costs. If free, remember that time is money, too. You can not be worth much, but I'm betting it's worth enough that you'll be sorry to waste time with this one. This, I did, you warned.
