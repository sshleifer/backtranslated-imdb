Boring. Minim trace. No character development. I went to this movie with high expectations in the book. It could be an awesome movie. It could probably become a cult classic. No, it was a giant left-down. It was wrong to throw and had special terrible effects. Was it difficult to determine who was the bad guys: the rebels or the military or the church or all of them? I'm always surprised by some mini-plot from the film. I left dumbfounded as in some aspects of so-called "prophecy", which never really fully explains. I felt I was watching a meeting episode of a mini-series on the sci-fi channel. It looked like a movie-made-for-television movie. Do not go this movie. It's a waste of time and money.
