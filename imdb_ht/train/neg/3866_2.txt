I thought this film was absolutely no moral. I mean, how would you feel if your fianc√© leaves you on your wedding day for your cousin ??? I would like to break! It's classified as a comedy but I did not find it funny at all. I thought he just mostly found cheap laughs and took them. I normally love movies Julie Stiles, but this is an exception. Jason Lee star in another lousy show, which once again proves that class and decent moral are not important in today's society. She has a complete lack of taste and I despise film like this. I understand that this movie is advocating and it is moral because it is 'Just a movie', but I'm still standing in my brand that this bad behavior should not be allowed on screen. I'm not trying to say that if you enjoyed this movie, you're a bad person, as everyone has the right to their own opinion, and the part of this movie was enjoyable, I just said that in real life, people which acts as the characters in this film made is shameful.
