Judging by the hype, and other comments on this site, I was ready for a awesome movie focused on junkies. What I got was full of crap focus on djenki. I wonder if there is another movie called "cokette" that people are reviewing? There are only 3 main characters, and none of them have hit me as well-written or well-acting. Basically the entire movie I just had to shake my head with the horrendous of the sort of these drug drugs. <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor. Do not rent this movie. Rent "Fever Cabinets" or some other decent horror films. Hell, rent "Mary Poppins"! The animated penguins are scary and more convincing than anything you will find in "Cookers."
