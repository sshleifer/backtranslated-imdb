I saw this at the Edinburgh Film Festival. It was awful! Every lively, violent, rich boy fantasy was on display, you just knew how it went to the end especially with all the shots of the chef's wife and the rape of the first girl. <br /> <br /> The worst part Q & A and the director / writer and writer / producer have tried to come to all intellectuals but you might say they are the types of offsetting violence. I bet they often are broth and drugs. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time. I kept my boyfriend from walking out of it.
