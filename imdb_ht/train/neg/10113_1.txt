I discovered that this film is rented based on the packaging. The zombie on the DVD front looks cool and scary. Then you get the movie with it in women and raccoon masks on. zero effects ... and even the battle scene you can see are missing punches by 2 feet. The funny thing is that Lommel acts in the movie shortly and worse than the rest of the crap actors in the movie. The only thing I can think is that Lommel is just trying to make such a bad movie that people dub read a "classic kil" ... however, I can not possibly imagine anyone who thinks this is anything but one of the movies Worst ever did. The real horror of this film is how bad it is. I'm embarrassed to rent it and watch never see another Lommel movie again!
