!!!!! You may think of a story that includes Archie Gray Owl - An Englishman poses as a red American - would have a massive amount of humor involved. In fact, I say that the only way to treat a movie like this is a remarkable man consuming the gullible public is to treat it as a comedy. However Richard Attenborough committed something analogous to a crime by making GRAY OWL a serious drama. Worse, she made a movie too late too. Pierce Brosnan lacks the charisma needed for the title role and romantic subplot between owl and correcting hair (played by the same Gaupeau Annie) missing any kind of screen sketch. But they must just throw them by helping with the script that fails to show Archie as the cheeky chappy she is in defending everyone's belief that she is a native American. The producers and seniors made the biggest mistake of having the movie center around the twist plot of Archie being an Englishman - that's why I wrote "Possible spoiler" it does not actually reveal the late late film in which the character The title is English, but it's obvious that everyone who saw this film knew that in advance, there is absolutely no surprise involved. <br /> <br /> Yes I agree with everyone that the scenery is beautiful and that it has a deep eco message that is not actually a new concept. Theodore Roosevelt was the first important environment in the 20th century if truths were said. And it should also be remembered that with the exception of SOYLENT GREEN (and perhaps the TWO TOWERS if you want to class it as it has a green message) that there has not actually been a great ecological film. In fact, the most environmentally friendly films and including GRAY OWL, a film that lacked a serious problem in finding a distributor
