'Chances are' a big mistake to see. You might know that director Emile Ardolino from 'dancing room' and 'Sisters Law' and should expect something entertaining from him. But I guess I have your disillusionment. He did a really, really movie movie. <br /> According to the story Christopher McDonald's story reburned like a baby. The baby grew up Robert Downey Jr., and Jr. returns home to his former home where he meets his ex-daughter, Mary Stuart Masterson (complicated, huh?). They fall in love with each other. Then Jr. former wife, Cybill Shepherd, and Jr. fell in love with her too. I think I do not even have to mention that he likes Ryan O'Neil. In one of the first Robert Downey Jr's roles on his worst. It's a copy of Michael J Fox. After the Shepherd 'Moonlighting' proves that it is not suitable for acting in movies. Anyway, there is one thing that unfunny comedy can use: as insomnia antidote.
