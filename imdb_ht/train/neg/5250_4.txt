I absolutely adore books written by Robin Klein, so I was very excited when I heard that a movie based on the book was in the making. <br /> But I was seriously disappointed with the film when I saw it because it did not take what I love about the book - Erica's absolutely ridiculous comic and interesting ways in which she sees the world. From the start of the film, I realized that these things weren I even imagined in the book. So I just went along for the ride. It was not all that bad, I guess. Miss Belmont was totally different with what I imagined it to be! I did not think it should be one smoke and drink - Jean Kittson, who plays it, is hilarious! <br /> On his own, I thought the movie and his actor / he did a good job, but alas, I'm like a fan of the book (one of my favorite books) that I'm not can help but feel ashamed = P
