This film is blocked, predictable, firefighter, and hollow in its core. The settings are faithful to the era, but self-conscious in the microscope are not extended exposure. The lingering off of the action stops and closes almost as much as the dialogue is empty. Tom Hanks seems to be sleepwalking as Bruce Willis did in the Hart war. Tom, you can not give the depth of a character simply by facing you empty! The content was not guaranteed to act histrionic by Paul Newman. This is a dump wrapped in an atomic bomb box.
