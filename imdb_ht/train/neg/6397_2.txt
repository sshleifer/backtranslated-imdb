This is a problem I have with movies that come on TV, when there is nothing else to watch. I somehow get sucked into really bad movies. <br /> But this one was fair looking. The concept of being the only one left on Earth after a comet, then get out the zombies around to make me laugh. And that's why I gave this movie a 2, instead of 1. The story was stupid ... but that way that makes you laugh (too stupid> funny). <br /> I think I only watch it because the guy from Star Trek was the lead. I was amazed to see him as a guy less ... and was the only funny character anyway.
