If I could say that it was better than Gymkata, I at least felt my money was not totally wasted. Then I saw Steven Segal on the mortal dead. a resurrection though about 3st MST. If Santa Claus Conquers the Martyrs could do Tom Tom's head exploded, one miracle that may be the destruction of this movie. <br /> There is a very good reason why Kurt Thomas has never had a movie career. <br /> <This tack writers must be forced to put everyday placards in their lives that say "Bitch soothing me! I was a writer on Gymkata."
