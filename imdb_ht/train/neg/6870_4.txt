An intriguing film about Sonja Horowitz (Ren√©e Zellweger), wife of Mendel (Glenn Fitzgerald) talented talent. who is deeply happy. Mendel's brother Mender (Christopher Eccleston) saw this and his staff to work in the field in which he was already an expert in jewelry. She also starts dealing with her, and then when she spends time with a Puerto Rican artist, she stays up and treats her in the family, who closes her out. There's a subplot of that death, Sonja's brother talked to her, and apparently took the form of a woman women magic, but why is not clear. Many are not clear, unfortunately, including what happens to Sonja, why does he say that Rebbe has a fire inside it and maybe it does not come from God, and what that means, and what the woman of magic beggar says wants tell it. In a way the story touches on the struggle of women in the ultra-Orthodox community, and yet Sonja is not exactly released. Nor is the notion of being redeemed by loving a man in another very well-thought-out race. The title comes from the biblical definition of the worth of a good woman ?? and yet it's the sender's rocket quoted in Sonja. Zellweger struggles with the party; he was supposed to be a Jew from the west and sometimes his accent was flat, and at other times he took on the characteristics of Brooklyn. It's best when it's tough and taking charge, but finally the movie is a mess.
