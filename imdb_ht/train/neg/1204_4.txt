I remember devil dog playing on TBS nearly 20 years ago, and my older sister and her friends watched her and laughed all day long. It's not that bad for a movie-made horror movie, but it's derivative (especially in the exorcist) and businesslike, for lack of a better word. It will not blow you away with sculptured or big acting movies, but it's not a waste of time, either. It's your movie type to kill a couple of hours when you're not in the mood thinking too hard. However, if you go to the movie looking for some laugh, you will not be disappointed. The early scenes, and the Lucky Dog Devil as a cute little puppy and the hilariously hungered kids are life-threatening, and the climate-blue-screen effects of a giant black dog (and horns!) Are very side-divide. And keep an eye out for the cloaked Satanist in all Maverick colors in the beginning. <br /> Not a great horror movie by any stretch of imagination, but I want to always do things like this for TV.
