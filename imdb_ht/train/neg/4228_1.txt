I can not believe how bad this rubbish piece is! I want my $ 3.99 back! Words challenged the description of this sore piece of crap! The lining is in no way shape or shape aligns with the actor's mouth. The film looks like it was filmed with the 1970's former camcorder. I shot my best camera and camera cell phone. The throat is mockingly due to the incredible incredible plot. The act is what someone would expect if you called all your friends on a Saturday afternoon and proceed to get completely torn, then tried to put them on a play in your garage. Do not get me wrong ... I have not waited O'Neil and I love cinema movies, but the output values ​​are so low in this movie as to make it unwatchable. Avoid!
