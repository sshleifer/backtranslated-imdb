There is nothing positive to say. Ignoring nonsense, huffing and dining with a "message". The new Russian film (post-Soviet) can be very good (Cuckoo comes in mind), yet there are plenty of cardboard bouquet and the taste of asbestos (Nochnoi Dozor would be a good example). This is a "pilot" type of blank. Acting would be awful if not for the grace of saving in the direction of full regret and incompetent correction that sometimes is so terrible that it distracts from the impotence of the actors. Special premiums to the cameraman to make sure every shot is worried (would anyone please realize that Blair Witch had 15 seconds of fame fame?) And taken to adapt to pre- teenagers who are lowering on CounterStrike and Masturbation. Lead females and try to look seductive too often, antihero men need a brainer (although genetics are not bad: rather expressive eyes.) One (medium) finger for this irrelevant pet in non-art. Anyone who reviews this positively better is a (far) cousin of the "authors".
