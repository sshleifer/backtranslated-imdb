This is a movie of tired, yet weirdly childish, clich√©. Has a Nazi witch master experienced sf-related experience in the basement? Oh please! <br /> <br /> Aim for a senseless twist and fear, the overall impression of the film is that in a very imminent conception of fright. There is no advance expectation, I leave with: an old Xander from Buffy and a heroine whose faces are like-who does not seem to know how to act. Said Adrienne Barbeau I had just met before the most enjoyable "Canibal Women in Adventure of Death to Death". <br /> <br /> Camera and editing added to the general impression of lame.
