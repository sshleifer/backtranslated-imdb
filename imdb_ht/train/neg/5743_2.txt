Yes, I know I'm one of the few people longing to see in this movie in the dirt of oblivion.So let me tell you why I feel this way. In truth, did he register as a zombie movie or love, I might have enjoyed it.But now I'm totally speechless <br /> <br /> * SPOILER ... Even though I'm not sure what to spoil * Let's start with the first big flaw. If I did not know that the film called "Dark - the VAMPIRE version" and I did not see some sequences where some people seemed to be sucking blood, I would not see the connection with vampires. I mean, FANGLESS ???? Give me a break !!! <br /> Second wrong point: what with the metal? It appears that all young people, but especially those called "vampires", are of various types, judging mostly by their shirts! Not finding me wrong, I was in the most extreme forms of music for almost 15 years, but nobody will scare me by showing me some ridiculous teens at Iron Maiden (in all strips!) T-shirt running around, pretending be vampire! "Pathetic" is the only word that I could use here. <br /> <br /> Third weakness: the actors. Wait a minute. WHAT Actor ?! You mean the wooden friend the director! The words would be a waste here. Yes, Well, the movie is very gory, but what's the difference? It would be a strong point and something to enjoy if the "brilliant" director was not chosen to create a ARTIFICIAL Vampire topic in this movie. I wanted to see vampires, but they were treated to some stupid kids I would like to use my baseball bat. The movie makers should simply advertise the film that says "cheap B-class horror that has no conspiracy, but a lot of gurus" !!! <br /> <br /> This movie is blasphemy against the entire concept of Vampirism. And it makes me sick.
