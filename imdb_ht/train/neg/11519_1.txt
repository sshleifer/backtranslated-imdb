This is absolutely the dumbest movie I've ever seen. What a waste of a splendid cast. That's James Cromwell as the deputy plays Ignoramus. I was able to go over and over, but I would obviously have to spend more time on this review than anyone ever made on the script. The only thing this movie is about is our account and how they revel in layman slapstick that overlooks all human reasonableness. This is one of 10 worst movies I've ever seen - and I love James Garner.
