Slow and riddled with infidelity. Over-its-flaws this is still an exciting account of the famed and heroic siege of the Alamo during the Texas Battle for Independence in Mexico. James Arness as Jim Bowie. Brian Keith as Davy Crockett. Alec Baldwin as Col. Travis. Raul Julia as General Santa Anna. This make-up-TV project is also the star of David Ogden Stiers, Kathleen York and Jim Metzler. Very good original music by Peter Bernstein.
