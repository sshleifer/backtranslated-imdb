He said that a girl named Susan Montford both wrote and directed this "movie." No wonder he has no other credit name for writing or directing. He made a serious professional error in choosing this as his career. This is one of the worst human creations of millennia. <br /> <br /> The thing that is fundamentally and this movie other than its ridiculous story of a woman runs from weak to four, is the blatant and complete lack of LOGIC .. After leaving the mall, he approached by four thugs as they surrounded him. Tell me, who would be aggressive woman SHOVE a potential attacker while surround, and verbal insults? I do not mean after an attack has already begun, because then of course it's completely normal for someone to fight. But he pushes that guy and pretty much to raise it to the next level. No woman would do so unless it 1) had a weapon, 2) have the confidence that backup is very close, and so is relatively safe from harm, or 3) the attackers are so young, and It is weak that it is very sure it can take them. None of that apply to this situation, so he just acts as a person in getting asked to get raped or mugged. And by the way, when the security guard approached, as SOON as he came in sight of Kim Basinger's look, why did not he immediately either go towards him for help, or shout ?? <br /> <br /> ** When driving after the security guard gets shot in the head, he drives into a deserted city, town and accident. He had a good three minutes lead on the rear, instead of simply running on a diagonal direction behind the house with climbing fence and continuing, he came out of his Red Tool and began messing around under his hood. I understand that he was trying to fix his car, but he should have run. <br /> <br /> (I did not even mean this to be a chronological resume of the movie, because I destroyed people doing this in the reviews, but it just happened that every main sequence in this movie I have something so blatantly stupid that I have to comment on it). <br /> <br /> ** Why would it bring a loud, Red Toolbox as it's trying to sneak away in the dark? When it gets caught, one of the jokers requires it to open the tools box. First it resist, then eventually open it. And take a key. This scene here is so rich in subtle obstonies in the full failure of dramatic effects I have to break it down, it's one of the dumbest scenes of the whole movie. Asked to open the box, he first resisted as if his plans had somehow found one of the thugs to open it out of anger after it did not open it, in the same way that a People in some action films might have some devices that an enemy asked this person to touch / push / open / manipulate, and once the hero refuses to open it, the enemy tramper of this device only has this device automatically dispensing a product chemical / shoot it in the face / acquire it unconscious, which has been planing the hero altogether. It feels like that's what they tried to do with Kim Basinger here, as it opened the toolkit dramatically and quickly took out a WRENCH and sent one of the thugs and somehow get away with it and three other thugs them. <br /> <In the rest of the movie, basically what you see is this suburban home wife, sneaking around the woods as she brings her red tool, taking out various tools used as weapons to kill her ATTACKERS. <br /> ** When it was run, how did it end up moving back to where the thugs were? I think it was the scene where they had that radio play loudly in tribute to the dead dude. It somehow crept up on them when I thought he was moving away from them. <br /> <br /> ** Finally, this whole quote is so weak because the whole reason it was chasing in the first place is because of the 'Persecutional Thugs, it was a witness to a killings against officers The security sooner, and so they felt they had to kill him. How ridiculous. As one of the same thugs said, they could have left the city and had returned to any city they had driven out, no one but had seen them anyway, and it probably did not get plate. Though these possibilities would not work in their favor, how to raise hell and hunt down someone to kill them to improve your chance to get away with the original murder?
