The reviews I read for this movie were very decent so I decided to check it out. BAD IDEA! This is another movie about an outside ghost for revenge against a group of friends. The story is stupid, mixing Ringu party with a prom night party, sending me know what you did last summer, and adding a small grip to Single White Women - now mixing up completely nonsense. There is nothing new in this draw, and reviewing the Candles I grew up so fond of not even fun this time. This movie jumps to and from the past too much, and once I made sense of it all I realized it still did not make much sense. Character goes to Lisi's bloodthirsty killer in the blink of an eye. Speaking of the characters, they all love your stereotypes - the greedy greedy attorney, egoscientist of the actress, there was the baseball star, the video showcase, the bitter girl, the spooky chick quiet, 'nicer-lovely-beautiful' beautiful The girl, a black freakin 'cats ... and I did not care about any of them. Perhaps a best writer could do the movie work, there were some decent scenes in it, but overall this movie was a mess. I should also mention a certain 'video tapes' that might be IMPORTABLE to shoot. <br /> <br /> This movie is not the worst Asian horror offered by far, but it's still pretty bad. If you just want to see some creepy images in the dark, or just want to laugh at some of the above actors, or just want to call "you're stupid!" in a movie screen, or just want to have another Asian horror flush your handle when someone asks you how much you have seen - this movie is for you. <br /> <br /> Those who seek a decent plot look elsewhere.
