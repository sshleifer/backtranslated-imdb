It is very sad that Lucian Pintilie does not stop making movies. They get worse every time. Niki and Flo (2003) are a sting depression of the camera. It's unfortunate that many movies are being done annually in Romania, the worst of them is to be sent abroad (such as Chicago International Film Festival). This movie without a plot, act or script is a waste of time and money. Note: 0.02 out of 10.
