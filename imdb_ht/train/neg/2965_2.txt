This movie was kind of interesting ... I had to look it for a college class on India, but the sinopsis said that this film is about one thing when it does not really have a lot of cold, tough information about these details. It's not really true in the Summary until the end of many places to sloppily try to tackle all the components together. The Gore factor is superb, however. Even right in the very beginning, you want to look away because the gor is very intense. Just watch this movie if you want to see some fresh gorges, because the plot is thin and will make you sad that you waste time listening to it. I've seen rumors about other websites about this movie being based on true events, however you can not find any information about it online ... So basically this movie was a waste of time to watch.
