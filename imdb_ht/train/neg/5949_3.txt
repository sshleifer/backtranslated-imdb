It's not uncommon to see US re-make in foreign cinema that falls flat on the faces, but here's the flip side !!! This is a terrible re-make of the U.S. Wide Awake film by the British! <br /> <br /> Wide Wake is strange, but funny and funny! "Liam" on the other hand is just strange. I must give credit to "Liam" for one thing and make it clear that I made the right choice to change my religion!
