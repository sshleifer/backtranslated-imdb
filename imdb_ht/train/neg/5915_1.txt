I've seen so many films in China - and Hong Kong. This is the worst. No, the worst one was 'Unknown fun'. I watched 'evening platform' tonight yesterday and thought that Jia Zhang Ke's other movie would be best. This evening I was disappointed again. I will not watch 'Xiao Wu' tomorrow evening because I just put all three films in the bin! Anyone who gave this film, ten platforms' ten out of ten, needed to watch more movies! The photography was very poor: it was very difficult to contrast between some of the characters because of the lack of pre-employment tasks. The scenario was so disoriented that I soon-sent it towards the end of frustration. I would not recommend this movie to anyone. Give me Zhang Yimou or Doggy Kage any day. These are true masters of Chinese cinema, not pretendered!
