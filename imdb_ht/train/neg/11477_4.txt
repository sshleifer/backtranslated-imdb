Sorry my fellow neighbor Nevada neighbors, but this one is bad. <br /> <br /> Brian must have had too many botox because she has very little facial expression in the movie all over. <br /> Alice looked like she had a board attached to her. He was stubborn in the movie. <br /> I looked up Alice and Brian and I was surprised to see the extensive bio of work. I would guess being the first year of the students. <br /> <br /> Ed Asner and Peter Jason brought the movie frankly with their plenary and ease with all the lines. Ed certainly did not lose his charisma. I wish I would take the time to meet him while he was here. <br /> I love the Snow Scene and the store scene with the church because I was there. I did Nevada City home and was worried waiting for the premiere. I was sadly disappointed. <br /> <br /> Sorry.
