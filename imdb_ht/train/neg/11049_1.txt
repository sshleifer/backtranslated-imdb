If Mr Cranky has rated this, I should be tempting to just copy his review and paste it here. But as it does not, I'll have to give it a go myself. The only thing to give this movie a 1 instead of a 0 is that Malcolm McDowall's act is excellent. However not even he can save this movie from disaster. The director must have been really distracted when he worked on this one because he is just a conglomerate in the scene that has been thrown along with very little continuity - reminiscent of the bad 70 movies. Even worse, both actors and directors appear to be doing as they went along that probably showed how bad the original script was. <br /> It's not even worth discussing the story line although it revolves around a futuristic society called the Proxate Corporation which puts together a crew of dispensable people carrying a dangerous cargo on an old ship / slave ship in Nigeria. This computer boat is a baby that is kept in a glass jar and tuned to one of the crew via USB 12 or something. The company should call Corporation Prostate as the entertainment value of this film is on a par with a test of the same name. <br /> I honestly can not find one scene that I could say was well done and made any real sense in the context of the movie. I was just watching it in the end as I had a touch of bird flu and this movie reminded me that there were people outside that were actually worse than me - Malcolm McDowall in particular. I will not hold this account as it is a great actor and all big actors have the right to one bad movie in their careers and this one is a doosie. So unless this is the only movie you store employees out or you are male and you're doctors do not test prostate this week and you somehow feel this is a bad thing then give one to a really real berth unless of course if you're really a minded community, buy a copy to support Malcolm and then use it as a drink coaster.
