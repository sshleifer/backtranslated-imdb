I rent this movie today thinking it might be a good football movie, since I'm a big football fan. Boy, I was wrong. This movie is too religious and preaching way and is really unrealistic. This movie is pretty much saying that if a Christian can find anything you want in life easily, like becoming a great football player! You do not become a great football player by becoming Christian and asking God, you do it in practice and hard work. All you have to do is ask God and he will give you anything .... puh-lease. It's not true at all, duh. I laughed several times for that embarrassment. The only funny part was when they were mute (the Shultz desktop? No, the dude who flew to the Atlantic, etc. etc.) But really this movie was not great. I do not recommend it, especially if you are not a Christian, lol.
