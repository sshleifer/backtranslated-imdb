I went away from this film and the feeling that he could be so much better. Instead of being an addictive, tense story of a boy's fate for survival in the desert, he comes as a National Geographic Documentary to Meet Columbia Sports Ad. The movie begins with Brian (Jared Rushton) preparing for a trip by plane to see her dad. Her mom soon gives him the curious choice of a hatch as a go away (evil and rubik gift?), Little knows how badly it will soon need it. Once in the air, the aircraft pilot (a stick-and-you'll-miss-it came by Ned Beatty) suffered a fatal heart attack, leaving Brian discouraged as the crash plane in a lake. Very likely to walk (or rather swim) away from virtually unscathed, Brian must find shelter, food and hope to save. <br /> Here is where the main problem and the movie begins. By the nature of Brian's loneliness, Jere has very few lines to speak, and so the movie should be rewarded by ratcheting up the tension in each scene. Instead, he shows walking around, sitting around, and so on, with only a minimal sense of danger. As a result, too much reliance on the flashback of parents troubled marriage as the source of tension. These scenes are simply found in the way and do not particularly add much to the story. Even worse, occasionally Jered ?? His face covered with mud - allows out a primal or two cry, which conjures up the unfortunate parallels `Predator. ' Speaking of the unfortunate, we could do and have killed the eye in her mullet, but she presumably helps keep her warm at night. Another disappointment is Pamela Sue Martin in a totally effective performance as the mother. Both of them and the father have a lot of impact on the film. For example, we never show how they react to Brian's extinction news, how they could organize rescue attempts, and so on. This is just one source of film-makers' tension that would do well to explore instead of spending much time on events that happened before Brian engaged in his trip.
