Terrible film with Frank Sinatra as Tony Rome. Here, she gets involved with a woman dying under the sea. <br /> <br /> Rome is soon hired to find out what happened to a woman. Of course, it's the woman below the sea. Her room companion, Lainie Kazan, soon winds die on the floor. <br /> <br /> An aging Richard Conte plays a police officer with friends in Rome. When a local club owner gets killed, the blame falls into Rome and has become an interesting Chase scene. That's how bad this picture is if you have to rely on a chase scene to give the action. <br /> <br /> Raquel Welch plays the beauty up to his neck of intrigue. Acting him leads a lot to be desired. Martin Gabel is a retired hood she's trying to pass her. <br /> <br /> By the end of the movie, you do not know why the girl was murdered. Do not even bother asking.
