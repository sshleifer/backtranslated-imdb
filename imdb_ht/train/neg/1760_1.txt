This movie has several mistakes. a few American actors in Spain, and the Spanish actors speak English. The 'Spaniards' English is OK, but it's the way it acts to do it all quite annoying. the dialogue throughout the script is very weak; It can be a Spanish script but translated harm, who knows and cares. I can only assume that these are famous Spanish actors forced into English, they may be good, but not in this flop. you will evaluate the movie in the first 5 minutes, as it is pathetic. Then the rest is just bad. Many of the time waste, much of the United Nations-unnecessary plots. Oh I mentioned one of the Baldwins' is in this.
