Fragmentarik film about a couple of people in Austria during a heatwave. This kind of movie was made more often, and most of all, better. The stories do not really have anything to do with each other, apart from the pathetic final: 'the wicked people'. Meat ugly, unpleasant people and a movie that goes on too long road without really making a point ... Ultra-realistic? Diman ... Boring? Indeed. Not even gorgeous Franzisca Weiss can save this one! 3/10
