Another 13th Ripoff Ripoff, even featuring some of its music! A group of young adults are gathering together for a small school high school and start killing one at Jason Voorhees. Is it likely that the nerves were teased at school? <br /> <br /> Routine off-festival is fun for fans of the genre, and it has the usual T & A quotation for its films. The finish is a bit more imaginative than your standard slasher. Mpaa: Rated for violence / gore, language, sexuality, nudity, and some drug content.
