I mean the word "pedestrian". Apparently the producers of the forgotten film have nothing interesting to happen. Faith Domergue can do better than that. It is supposed to be mysterious, unforgettable Cobra goddess is torn by love for Marshall Thompson (have an idea, eh?). Instead it is a common should be housewife in fifty soldiers, with the expression of salt, flat and laid in the movie making me think they shot it all in the morning before faith had its coffee. As for the rest of the cast, they are all so stiff "all-American" that the result is ridiculous. This land is more productively covered by Val Lewton in the "Cat People". I think "The Cobra's Cults" should really be titled "Kilt in the Compulsory Obligation". Why else would there be many people who have the skills of those who do not have the sleeping routes even though a shifting, predictable, failure is like this?
