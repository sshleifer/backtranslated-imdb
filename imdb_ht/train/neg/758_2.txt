This stinks show. For parents, they usually want the kids to look good for them. It is usually educational, funny, and bright. <br /> <br /> Is it educational? The name Doodlebops sings and is it. They usually sing about themselves, they do not try to teach anything. <br /> <br /> Is it funny? No. The Doodlebops rather say something that is not done as a joke and laughs at it. <br /> Is it bright? It's so bright, it's painful. As far as color, everything is very bright, so that's fine. But nothing is wrong in the world of the Doodlebop. Therefore, they are always happy. a kid of the problems will become depressed because they have never been exposed to being sad. <br /> <br /> The show is also very cheesy. Each syllable has said the highest level of exaggeration and bloom. It is overkill. For kids, it's fun, but the past 2 years you will not want your kids to see it. They will never know how to grow.
