For all the hype on this movie, I kept an open mind about what I would finally think. And, although somewhat slow at times, the first 90% of the film is quite good, with more than a few "old time" crises that make one jumpy and instability. I actually thought that the movie was excellent about many of these scenes. Where black remains, however, is at its largest. Finishing the movie with the denial is what looks like MILES APART from her body. The scenario completely falls on its face with a logical conclusion and, the answer I was looking for most - what really happened to Emma? - was not elucidated! The reason for the negative energy was the best of humor, and in the end I felt very cheated. What could be a superb superb movie was finally haunted by a terrible end.
