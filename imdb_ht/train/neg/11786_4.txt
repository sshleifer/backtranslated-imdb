The show had great episodes, this is not one of them. It's not a terrible episode, it's just hard to follow up "the man who died.", "All at home," and "digging that cat, it is real gone." about a couple who just married Peggy (Ammanda Plummer) and Charles (Stephen Shellen). In the first five minutes you find that Charles only married Peggy for his money. The two go on the bees and their cars break down on a dirt road and to seek refuge in an abandoned old castle. Charles soon finds out a secret to Peggy's family ... <br /> In my opinion you should watch this episode, but just do not expect the same feeling as the rest of the episodes in the first quarter.
