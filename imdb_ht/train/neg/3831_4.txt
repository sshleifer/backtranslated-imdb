I'll have to agree with the previous commentary and side with Maltin on this one. This is a second-rate, too vicious, Western spite that spits and groans trying to put across its central theme to the Wild West being tamed and kicking sideways by the constant market of time. She would like them in the tradition of "Butch Cassidy and Kid of Sundance", but lacking the viewpoint of the movie and charm. Andrew McLaglen's direction is hauling, with the final 30 minutes or so it's a real botch, and some incomprehensible strategies on the hero parts of Charlton Heston and Chris Mitchum. (There is someone who gives me a holler if you can explain to me why they put this hillside in fire.) There was something on the whole treatment of rape scene, and the woman's reaction later certainly not it's true. Coburn is very embarrassing as half dogs escaped from outrage for revenge, but all of its fellow underdeveloped (such as Bowling pins must be knocked down one by one as the lurches story forward). Michael Parks provides one of the typically sneaky, lethargic, mumbling performance, but in this case it was appropriate as his modern style sheriff symbolizes satisfaction that technological progress can bring on.
