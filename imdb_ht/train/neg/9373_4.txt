The peculiar feature of Martin Kosleck brings a certain credibility to the character of the frustrated artist. It imbues its dialogue with an odd sense of realism, making sculptors a convincing person. The character managed to come across as a real person and not so much a typo films B typical. <br /> <br /> The story line is nothing to write at home, and many scenes are dull. What makes it work is the weird chemistry between Kosleck and Rondo Hatton as the Creeper. Kosajck's character, philosophical character contrary to Hatton's keys, monosyllabic approach. The character of the Creeper does not develop much beyond a basic monster level, but Hatton suggests that the possibilities are unfolded and that you ask about his back story. This movie was on Theater Shock a lot when I was a kid, so I have a certain nostalgic fondness for her. It's worth seeing once, anyway, for those who enjoy sinister horror movies.
