Oh, brother. The only reason this movie is very disappointing to avoid getting the total "bomb" from me is because it's at least historically important to be noted as the first three films of Stooges (when they were not yet on their own and they has always been sealed and painfully unfunny Ted Healy). But as a long-standing Stooges fan I should say that young Moe, Larry and Curly are seriously used here as three assistant assistant Mr. Mr. Healy's Mr. Assistant. They are not tearing gradually into the movie and the comic over-and-off-again painted stints are more like the overactive cartoon characters that are trying too hard to be fun. <br /> Most of these teeth teeth and Jack Pearl are looking for vain to find some chuckles at the audience itself as a man who imitates Baron Munchausen (here's a good example of humor level: "I'm Object!" " Why? "" Coffee Shop! "). His sidekick is no other than a young Jimmy Durante, but even Schnoz herself is a do.
