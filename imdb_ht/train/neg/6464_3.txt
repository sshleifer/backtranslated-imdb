Watching Marlen Brando on screen is like watching a master carpenter dividing the complicated details into a piece of mahogany. Actio Brando is the only thing that makes this movie lookup. The draw is inhuman and ridiculous (not funny). The other great actors seem to be desperate attempts to give their characters some modicum of humankind ... these characters have humanity in wet cardboard boxes. Everything about the technical side of this movie is either mediocre or just plain terrain. The director launches freeze-frames and slow-vaccine motion impunity. The occasional music is Cartoonish and destroys any hint of dramatic effects. It's not something I really look for in a movie, but even the wardrobe was their way. The revered Brando could not concentrate far from the terrible shelters made him out. I heard this film called "David Lynch-esquire" and "irreverently funny" ... it's not. David Lynch films are made in cruel creativity - this movie was in no way creative. And do not confuse irreverence and stupidity.
