I felt obliged to watch this movie all the way through, since I found it in a bargain bin and bought it for my own but I came close many times to turn it off and just write off the money I paid for her. If you're a fan of Gore and Sadism, this movie is OK. If there is one thing that the musicians in this film know, it is the creative use of blood and body parts for a sore effect. If that does not thrust you, then stay away. This movie is shot on a home video camera, with school classroom accessories and awful actors. It's armed out of German, but even allowing for that, the sound is terrible. This film is about budget as the budget, except for the aforementioned special effects. If they spent a little more money on actors and a real script instead of blood and bowel, the movie could be a little more enjoyable. The story is about three people on an island inhabited by an army of tin-masked sadists. They were captured, and the rest of the movie is about their attempts to escape. I call this a tale of the essence, since it is really a series of torture and combat string scenes alongside damaged obscenity-filled dialogue. There is nothing that is redeemed on this movie, unless you are like misery. Consider yourself alert.
