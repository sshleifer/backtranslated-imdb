First, I would like to say that the user comments alone let me and tears out to laugh. A comment that bad SF movies gets good comedy about the brand. MST3000 made it living in that. <br /> If you look at the red feline planket as the fever dream of a 10 year old comic book reader from 1959, you'll have the handle on this sucker. All the elements have: the pseudoscience, occasionally logic, more often hilariously infantile. Adolescent adolescent's attitude toward sex, and the "gigolo" commander (good call on one, gentleman!) Make the eyes of the "buxom scientist" and her hair red to a wonder he does not put in the fire alarms. The ridiculous conception of Mars as a so alien planet that everything is red red, but one alien monster has a mouse face, and the alien blob has a rotating eye like a kid's game. The funny rescue, an overweight astronaut (!) Sounds like he never finished the 8th grade in Brooklyn and has a psychic fixing on his rifle weapon. And of course, the only fact that aliens = dangerously wrong. If these people met E.T., they would have been roasting it in two seconds. "OW" really! <br /> Do not get me wrong. I rated this movie low. Still, it's never boring (except when the scientist tries to explain everything - only making it all sound more and more ridiculous), and you have to admit, to your kid's core, it makes you jump a few times. <br /> <br /> Well, then do not admit it. I guess you've never been 10.
