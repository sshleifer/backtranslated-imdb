Words can not describe how bad this film. I can not explain it by writing only. You have too much to see it for yourself to get in the grip of how horrible a movie really can be. Not that I recommend you do this. There are many clich√©s, errors (and all other negative things you can imagine) here that will just make you cry. To begin with the first technique, there are a lot of errors regarding the aircraft. I will not list them here, but just mention the coloring of the aircraft. They did not even manage to show an aircraft in the colors of a fictional plane, but instead used a 747 painted in the original Boeing delivery. Very bad. The plot is stupid and has done many times before, only a lot, better. There are so many ridiculous moments here that I lost count of it really early. Also, I was on the side of the bad guys' all the time in the movie, because the good guys were so stupid. "Executive decision" should be without a doubt you are the choice on this one, even the "turbulence" -movies are best. In fact, every other movie in the world is better than this one.
