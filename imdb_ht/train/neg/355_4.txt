Just Cause is one of those films that first makes you wonder why she was so heavily looking when she came out - nothing special, but competent enough and an excellent performance to support from Ed Harris. Then you hit the last third and everything starts getting increasingly funny until you had a killer and a candle attached to her forehead for Sean Connery's wife (a typically styling and convincing Kate Capshaw) and young little goat (a very young red Johannsen) at the house's skin hut. <br /> <br /> That kind of movie is probably best seen on a plane, and even then only once.
