I find myself asking who gave this a 10 see to it that I did not. This movie has a very difficult time and / or remains in a scheme. If someone says you are a comedy, do not be fooled, it's about 98% percent odd-drama and 2% comedy. All actors turn into a great performance, which can not be denied, however it seems like it really loses something somewhere. Not knowing whether the original script was good and had to be edited down or so. This was potential, and instead it was really a flop. I would really like the time and a half I invest in this movie back, but the video rental location does not come back on time. Save your money and see something else.
