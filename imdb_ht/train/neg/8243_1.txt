The word of the summary amounted up to d'oh;) Five girls get lost trying to find their way home, when they stop at a store to get directions to hit a car that breaks one light light on it , the blazing scene was just in getting into trouble but suddenly they saw one light behind them (ooooh). From outside everything is screaming, crying and violence when trying to get away from this crazy man who lost it because of a light;), the screaming and groaning very beautiful remains of the entire movie (very annoying) The shotgun movie, with a cheap camera trying to make it look like "real" or "shocking" I guess, it's just nasty and useless though. In the absence of anything better to compare it with, "Blair Witch Style". <br /> <br /> The cry and shouting for the very beautiful movie at all and reckless sound was on annoying head, you literally get a headache :) <br /> I'm sorry but that's not It was scary, only an annoying wonder that hurt in crap movie.
