This film is deeply disappointing. Not only that Wenders only shows a very limited musical spectrum of blues, it is his subjective and personal interest in part of the music he brings on film making it look and cost absolutely boring. The only fate of the film is the interview of a Swedish couple who was befriended with J.B. Lenoir and show private video footage as well as storytelling. Wenders's introduction to the topic of fiction begins quite interesting - talking about the world's culture (or actually, American culture) traveling in space, but seems to limit it to the theme as well as neither comic nor repeatedly fascinating in history from The 30s render this movie as a sleep aid only. Be cautious. I was expecting more of it.
