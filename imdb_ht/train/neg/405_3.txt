This movie is worth watching if you enjoy wonderful on the special effects. Some interesting visuals. Aside from it, it's typical Hollywood ticket nineties / aughties to blind eyes without substance. True in the title. <br /> It's not worth picking apart the story. That's like performing brain surgery on a dinosaur. There are not many have to start with. It's nothing original and not very special. So do not go in for the story at all. Just look at the effects. As mentioned, he got a little flashy at the end, diluting the purity of the FX treatment in an invisible (and in half invisible half) man. However if you ignore the standard "pirotechnics", it's a sight seeing (or not seeing). <br /> In all, it's a decent FX movie worth seeing for this purpose alone.
