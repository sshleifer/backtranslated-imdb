This is quite possible the worst movie I've ever seen. Worse than the most luxurious American gulf; Worse than Glitter - Mariah Carey in American Vast Screenwriting. I can only imagine that the writer and producer have taken large amounts of recreational pharmacy, and when discussing the scheme actually thought it was a good idea. it's not. It is abstract garbage from many of the bowels of Satan himself (who can probably have written a better script he puts his mind into it). Robert Jones as Exce Producer, spending our tax payable money (money lottery money) on this piece in nonsense, should be responsible. Who on earth thought it would be a good idea to re-make Deathline ??? I ask you - camp as a Christmas tree, Deathline ... 'The Mind Doors' is the classic really bad British film, we really do not need a reminder. And we certainly do not need a poor, second-rate, seriously scripted, seriously developing and seriously pieces of waste like this. All this comes from the UK funding agency that has led us to live Sex of the Potato Men ... I rest my case. <br /> <br /> Do not pay any money to see this. It is absolute and utter crap - the saving one for the producers is that they got a big niche in cash ... cash us ... to do it. They should hang themselves in shame. <br /> I'm dimming at low, low standard of this movie. It made me that our national body of film support actually thought it was worth supporting. There is no hope for the British movie industry also idiots are running the show. Harvey Wienstein Where Are You? Come and forgive us !!!
