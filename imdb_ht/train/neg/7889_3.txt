I just finished watching this movie. It was not ridiculous, but I'm really disappointed with it. I'm not really sure why someone would make a movie like this. It was fun amusing, but I feel like the people who make it a lot of disagreement over what they did. Monday, the writer was in charge; Tuesday, the director; Wednesday, the guy who gets the coffee; etc. It almost seems like they really wanted to make a couple of different movies, but only had the time and money to make one. <br /> <br /> Another person commented that the act was really good, but I would not agree. Then again, if the actors were able to hold a straight face during filming, maybe they're better actors than I give them credit. <br /> <br /> Return to the DVD gives the impression that the movie would have a mystery ... something on the line of a historic law with Order or National Treasury. It starts like that, but then, from nowhere to take a turn towards a bad episode in the Twilight Zone, or ... what has been shown other that was not as good ... An episode bad in the external boundaries. <br /> <br /> My main complaint about the movie is that it's just being played out. There's the guy wrong with white clamps. There's the love interest, who, when it first appeared, the wind actually blows to her hair. Seriously. Once you realize it is a Christian movie, the end is also very easy to spot. The cinematography was wrong doing, especially in the opening scenes - the way to put your best foot forward. It was not attracted to most of the movie, but had the occasional bad shot of an old lady, praying, armging up a dark room while illuminating is striking - the sort of thing that just makes you a bit jerk Let's watch the movie.
