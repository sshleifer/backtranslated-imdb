I did not even bother finishing the movie because I was so bored I thought I was going to spend out I looked at her in the movie theater and me and my friend just was tired of getting up and leaving in a other movies if I ever have to sit in 2 min. in that movie again I think I'm going to shoot myself ... and I know the whole movie because my friend told me what happened to the end and I was not surprised at all i mean that did not 'knowing he's going to do the right thing and let it be happy i mean for real you should make a complete fool person do not know that. I know I did not miss anything and someone asked me to see that my movie would say "about my body".
