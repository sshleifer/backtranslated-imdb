This is a great step down after the amazing surprisingly original. This end is not as fun as part, and rather spends too much time on drawing tracks. Tim Thomerson is always the best thing about this series, but his wisecracking tone to this entry. Performances are all adequate, but this time the script allows us to go down. The action is simply routine and the plot is only underground interesting, so I need lots of funny laughs in order to stay entertained during a movie "Trancers". Unfortunately, laughs are few and far between, and so, this movie is the best look.
