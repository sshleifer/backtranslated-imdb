This was one of the worst movies ever !!!!!!!! It was so bad I was laughing at the WHOLE movie! The plot was SO Cheese; especially in the end. This movie turns out to be an end-of-the-world disaster to save-to-heal! I mean, c'mon! And I swear ... I think they use SOCK PUPPETS for the Celebs! And there was this terrible scene kissing in the middle and the two main characters that happened to divorced. How to predict! It was so terrible that my mother, my sister, and I could not finish it, and when we did it, it was about a year later! The second time we watched it and we finished it this time, we commented on MST3K as in the movie. <br /> Summary: Just watch this if you're a movie basher! Make hilarious comments, watch this in a sleeping laugh, and I mean big laugh. Also look for imitation. The metaphor explaining this movie: This film is a very deep field filled with puppet cheese and socks!
