Carnosaur 3: Species primal (1996) D: Jonathan Winfrey. Scott Valentine, Janet Gunn, Rick Dean, Anthony Peck, Rodger Halston, Terri J. Vaughn, Billy Burnette. Why even bother to review this movie? Another stupid dinosaur film in which secret military guys discovered these lethal (and very fake-looking) prehistoric monsters running around murder in gory ways. The original was bad enough, the end was even worse. This falls somewhere in between, though it relates to either of the previous Carnosial films. RATING: 2 out of 10. Rated R for graphic and gang violence, grisly images, and profanity.
