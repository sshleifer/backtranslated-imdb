Howling II (1985) was a complete 180 out of the movie first. Also the first movie was to camp and climb. The second was pacific and cheesy. The output values ​​on this one are very bad and the act is atrocity. The brother of the anchorwoman werewolf from one party wants to find out what happened to him six. The "scene" from the first movie was seriously re-created. A very thin woman who accompanies bro '(Reb Brown) to the old country (Romania) uncovered the mystery of his transformation / death murders. Christopher Lee appears and disappears on now and then as sort of a bar / guide for the two. Sybil Danning and his two major assets appear as Stirba, the head of the Werewolf in Romania. She also suffers from a bad case in the morning, ewww! <br /> <br /> Bad movie. There is nothing good about this stinker. I'm surprise Philippe Mora directing this picture because it is usually a good movie-maker. The movie is so dark that you need a flashlight to watch it (by, not the content, but the movie stock itself). For the movie round you get a lousy "punk" performance from a wannabe dance "Babel". Maybe if they are forked over a couple of extra bucks they might have had the real deal instead of an imitation. <br /> <br /> Best to avoid unless you are desperate or lose the remote, and you're too lazy to change the channel.
