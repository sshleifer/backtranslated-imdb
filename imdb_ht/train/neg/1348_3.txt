This animated animated film gadget is very army.the story is very weak, and there are little action.Most of the characters are given little to have nothing to do.the movie is mildly fun at best, but really does not go anywhere and is touchless.it watchable but only fair and is nowhere near the caliber of the animated television show from the 80's.it by a movie that brings look repeatedly, at least in my mind.it is only about 74 minutes long including credit, so I guess this is a good thing. Like in the TV show, the characters are not worth rooting for here. In the show, you wanted gadget inspectors to save the day, but there, who really cares? Anyway, that's just my opinion.for my latest gadget gadget inspector is an important 3/10
