... for the Lt chose this one. First, the film was not terrible, it was just Hollywood. Worst case-I-need-to-happen-or-we-have-no scenario movie: if Willis mission was to save the doctor, but it was determined that he "man" made it out of the missionary he would have to put it on that first helicopter and market those refugees in the bloody borders. He would not have compromised his pack for the refugees. Not how it works. But as I point out, this is Hollywood, we have to have drama. That is why we make movies, because reality is not quite so complicated. However, I thought that Willis and the good doctor had workable chemistry. That said, there are also some well-performing scenes in the movie. It's not a waste of time, "Tears in the Sun" is worth the DVD rent fee. Check it out on a rainy day and you will be satisfied.
