This flicker has reminded me of those lame "erotic erotic" I used to stay late and watch on Cinemax when I was 13. I would label this smoother-core flicker since there just do not hit balls and grind. There are, however, a ton of nudity-opening scenes in a strip club, we see Kane Hodder's keester (or at least a supreme butt) and then an inexplicable 10 minute lesbian scene dance in the middle of the movie with a naked woman witch who seems to mugged over at the Munster for a costume. 13 old boys are happy. <br /> <br /> Other than that of werewolf transformation scene has the worst CGI I've seen over the years. The shots look like the FMV from video game Resident Evil in terms of quality. Wolf is too bad to be explained, and, despite the poor quality of the suit to show ways, way too many times. The draw and act make no sense. There are some oddball stories back on werewolves and hybrid-werewolves- Darkwolf is the letter but in what I can tell hybrid to do the same all werewolves do-look people, the change of a wolf killed someone. Darkwolf is trying to find a mate but strange can not find the mate, but he can sniff out anyone he touches. Once more, this skill proves less than useful since the Darkwolf winds up slain his target targets never touched, encountered or even seen as best I can say. The spouse does not know he is a werewolf and he's fighting the transformation or something. <br /> <br /> You would think it might be difficult to chase up a simple monster movie bad as this, but well done. Wish quality low-end femur-yem, go rents Dog soldier wants a ton of T & A this is your flick.
