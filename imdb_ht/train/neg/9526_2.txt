Way back when I rented for free I chose this one up. OOPS Things I wanted to mention out of the summary have already been given. 1: Someone who had a lot to do with this film had a weird and sick passion for food, it was gross and unessential. 2: There are some types of tape in the background of the movie that seems to be there all the time and by the way I felt for days after watching this garbage my face they had something subliminal going on in the track. Either that or it was just traumatisingly bad or both. Often throughout the film you can tell the writer and director did not have much experience or talent. And do not even ask about the act.
