What a Poor Employee Professional Police Officer appears on the TV in view of this alleged reality show. One can only hope that the real reasonable suspect leads to the probable cause that leads to the investigation of circumstances involving making a "stop", then "The Pat Down" in the Outside of One's Clothing, When In order to be able to articulate why the officer came into someone's pockets and found smuggling, being cut off from the scene, because if he did not, the arrest in most places will be over, should even be found than a supervisor. A report on a radio broadcast does not constitute the actual existence of the term unless the dispatching person has the original mandate. If the dispatcher reads in a computer printer, it's good enough for an arrest, but it does not necessarily mean that the warrant is still in effect. Since I have not seen a ten-claim in CBS (I may miss it), CBS could be in trouble.
