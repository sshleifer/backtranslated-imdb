this is the first time I wrote a comment on a movie about IMDb. but I had to write it for this one. 3 hrs of unadulterated torture. Since starting u get the idea that the film will become bad. The act is pathetic. I'm a big fan of Ajay devgan (love her in bhagat singh) but she is at her worst in this movie. Amitabh seems to have worked hard for this one, but somehow the fear is missing. prashant rage is a non-actor. And the most irritating part of the movie is Nisha Kothari. I have no clue why the director took it to this movie. The background note is repetition. Somehow I felt that ramu tried to repeat a sarkar, theme of color, the background note, the camera angles, but he did not work. PLEASE BY WATCH IT
