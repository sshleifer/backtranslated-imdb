Ten minutes worth of stories stretch in the best part of time. When nothing of any significance has reached the half point I should leave. But ever hoping, I stayed. And left with a feeling of guilt to have wasted the time. Acting was OK, but the story line is so transparent and weak. The script is about as lame as it can get, but again, stretching out ten minutes scheme does not leave a lot of room in good dialogue.
