What a throw wasted. <br /> This is one of the most irritating movies I've seen. <br /> <br /> Usually Roger Ebert does not let me down, but I feel cheated after seeing this movie. <br /> <br /> The only chalk will see Elizabeth's gown in her bra. This is a regrettable claim on this movie. He has kept many promises, but it was like dry humping a transvestite. <br /> <br /> This is top absorbed inwards. <br /> I can not express my deepest bitterness of being sitting in this film, and hope I can warn you of the same deception.
