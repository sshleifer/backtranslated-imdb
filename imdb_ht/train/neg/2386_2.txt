I missed this film in the movie but there was some idea of ​​the back in my head that it was worth a look, so when I saw it on the shelves of DVD I thought "time to watch it". Great mistake! A long list of stars can not save this turkey, surely one of the worst movies ever. An incomprehensible scheme poorly released and incorrectly introduced. Maybe it would make more sense if I read Roman Robbins' but unless the film is completely different in the novel, and Robbins helps in the scenario I doubt it, the novel should make it a happy one too. br> <br /> I hope the actors were well paid as they looked embarrassed to be in this garbage of seluloid and more recently empty DVDs, taken for example to Pat Morita. Even Thurman has the grace to look comfortable at times. <br /> <br /> Save yourself around 98 minutes in your life for something more refreshing, such as your nail reduction or sorting out your socks drawers. Even when you see it's "under $ 5" throw-away bin in your local store, resist the urge!
