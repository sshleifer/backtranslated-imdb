I never really considered myself a lot of "students" when it comes to watching movies, watching them, forming an opinion with this one. But Unhinged changed all this. This film is without a doubt the most inept attempt in film I've ever seen. Every kid who rocks up at university thinking will be the next Spielberg or Tarantino need to be repaid this film and a book titled "How to Do a Movie". Not only do not have any history to be, the movie makers were not even competent enough to make a movie worth watching. It has been a while since I've seen it, but all I can say is to watch the vaccine in the top of the opening scenes. They never end! It's almost like you have toothache, it's not just fun.
