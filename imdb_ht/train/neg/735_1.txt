Five-year-old Michael sees his mother getting axed to death by his serial killer father "Highwayman," who later committed suicide. "20 years later" grow Mike (Gordon Currie, from PUPPET MASTER 4 and 5) invited seven of his friends to his home grandparents home to their "own fears master" at a party costume party Halloween. Morty, a life-sized wooden doll caught in the attic by the Indian handyman, gets owned by Dad's father and killed them off using the phobias. Characters are thrown outside a window, drowned in a toilet, eaten by rats, blow up, mortar mortgages etc. of the father and a tree, walking around to make wisecracks understand. After getting a girl cut up and stuffed in a cardboard box, the characters stay at home, act happy, joke crack and sex. The Morty design is good with Betsy Palmer (Madam Voorhees from the 13th Friday's 13th) is amazingly delightful as the grandma, but this is even more horrible and confusing than the original and is full of false, miserable, Brain-dead characters, repeating footnotes and annoying cameras-work. Plus only the two minority characters (the Indian and a half-black girl) are the first to die. BLAH!
