Rich Dixie Joan Winfield (a Bette Davis muscle texting) is engaged to marry and stupid egotist Allen Brice (Jack Carson loses). Her father (Eugene Palette) determined to stop the wedding and was kidnapped by Steve Collins (James Cagney) pilot. They crash land into the desert and hate each other, but (sigh) begins to fall in love. This seems to receive a high rating from review here only because Cagney and Davis are in it. They were both brilliant actors but were known for PA comedy plays and this movie shows why! The script is just horrible - there's not a single genuine laugh in the entire movie. The jog runs at Cagney and Davis falls first rolls in a cactus (this is done three times!). Only considerable talents are saved to be completely humiliated. As it is they both do their best with the lousy material. Cagney is trying his best and his line with Davis screeches each line full force but it does not work. Carson has this "what the hell" look at his face throughout the film all (probably because his character emotions change in seconds). Only Palette with its different voices and reading lean heads for requiring a few smiles. But all in all, this was dull and laughless - a real chore to sit down. This gets two stars only for Cagney and Davis' acting with some pretty movies but really - it's not worth seeing. Cagney and Davis hate this movie in years later and you can see why.
