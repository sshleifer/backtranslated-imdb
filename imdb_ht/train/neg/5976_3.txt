The rumor is true: girls like UYLY COYOTE more than men. And the reasons are obvious as soon as the draw is given. Jersey girls go to New York to become a song writer. After initial frustration at no luck, suggesting some girls born about $ 300 each were made last night. It gets an audition at the bar to work in with surprise! The place is completely full of "old year olds" burst into the eye of dancing beard. <br /> <br /> The story is not bad and some characters are praised, especially Cammie (the party "fashion coordinator" was beautiful) and the bouncer but let's face it, the drama was awful and completely mocked from the beginning. Violet and her dad looked too ridiculous while being relished throughout the movie. And check out Violet too blocked on this keyboard and the dancer to rest! <br /> <br /> For the first time I could think of, how could the output be so awful? For a moment with this movie, Hollywood could stand on its feet and show a new bar without any big public scandal without saying, "You've been warned!" Instead, it seems UGLY COYOTE has an intentional purpose of trying to kiss every big rear of the world. Baby advertising in a bar, but showing a thin paper "to pursue your dreams" shameful story every teenager you target! <br /> <br /> And finally, the music. There was absolutely no break in music I found in this movie, especially when he needed (hospital scenes). Every scene felt like some short music video you just wish would stop until the bar opened. But the climax was a wacky ultra: a '80s like song you would expect Cyndi Lauper to jump on the scene with jam and violet. Heck, I personally thought Bon Jovi went to jump out with the long hair and jam too! <br /> Other than some really smart camera work with the Coyote Girls when dancing (especially the wet scene), and a couple of classy couples, COYOTE UGLY is something to be purely embarrassed. If you look or do it, it seems nothing but killing time. Or wasting depends on how you look at it.
