Is this the movie ??? Is this what Indian are trying to show ?? I think this is one more effort from a sick-minded director to turn Pakistanist soldiers into reality ... but what we Pakistani know that we are still ahead of India in every part of our lives. Not only in the Army ... this bad movie was like this in the early 1997s ... and directors and writers just tried to overcome a shame of defeat at Kargil by the Pakistani army forces, by creating Films like these .. One thing is very clear ... Every time there will be a meeting between Pakistan and India .... we will win .... !!! So, Mr. Dutta tries to make some good movies instead of Nonsense movies like this
