Condition of making a film is a complete ignorance of Nietzche's work and personalities, Psychoanalytic techniques and Vienna's history. Take a well-known genius, describe it as dementia, including crazy doctors to heal him, a couple of good looking girls, have the role played by an actor and an enormous mustache, they have every talk with the strongest accent, shows ridiculous dreams, includes another prestigious figure that has nothing to do with the first one (Freud), to mention a few words used in the work of the work, too much of what you can, particularly music, and you're done. Hearing, please stay away.
