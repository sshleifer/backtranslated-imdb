Except those apparently purchased in this waste! As shows as "Moral Orel" has shown, even though you tried to make the most outrageous outrageous, the top-parody of evangelism you might have thought of, would not come near this hilarity of this show. It's hard to say what's going on when you're watching it. Does it show a news? A talk show? What's happening !? They start from reporting on various international news stories, but at random points, the news is off by this odd, troll-like little person who has a bigger face than all his face, mumbling and laughing generally they were crawling. > <br /> Pat Robertson does not even seem like a bad guy at first glance. It just seems like a senile, but harmonious old pig stuck in her reactionary beliefs (like most of our grandparents). But this is a man who called for an assassination, who was befriended and offered help not only one, but two deadly dictators, who had illegally used donation money to run diamond mines, who had been aborted Forced in China, and regularly implies that Caucasians (directly American Caucasians in particular) are superior to all other races. Still, this would all be funny, except that it apparently has a huge fan base enough to keep his little show on the air 40 years later (either that, or enough money to bribe some executives television that does not give a damn show). The idiocy of the show becomes alarming when you realize that some people, somewhere, must look at it and hang over every word. Even when Robertson repeatedly demonstrated how corruption it is, people always listen to it. I do not know if it's funny or scary. I guess a healthy blend of both.
