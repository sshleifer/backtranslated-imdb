I gave this show (I only watched seven episodes) four stars because most of her jokes / set-ups appear to fail. Some are not funny outright, but some are fun - in a 12 year old boy style style. He reminds me of New York painter who throws paint on a cloth, calls it art and sells it for a lot of money. Silverman throws out what he has, including the kitchen sink, while he prays that some things stick to the wall of his effort to be funny, but different. <br /> However, what it's "got" often times is not enough, as if it lacks the type of follow-up of a good comedy need to succeed. <br /> <br /> The whole enterprise is like a potato iron.
