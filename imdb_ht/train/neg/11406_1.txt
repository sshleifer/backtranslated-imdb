But I got on it. For me, it seemed that even the author of the book favored Caroline. I felt sorry for the character Louise, and it was still compared to Esau that was wrong, I just felt the comparison was a bit harsh and unrealistic. Really, the movie was bad. I would not really see it unless you're ready for a big down.
