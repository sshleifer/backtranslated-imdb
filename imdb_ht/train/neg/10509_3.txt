Boots from the sky, a gang of all horny naked angels (and great plastic defense) have taken up residence in a spooky forest where they eat on any hapless soul that should wander through. It's not long before a group of friends on a road trip fell victim to the bloodthirsty beard? An independent low-budget horror made in the UK, Forest of the Dane takes an interesting site and wash it under the pan and some of the worst effects, effects and directions I've seen in a long time. Director Johannes Roberts shows some occasional flare behind the camera ?? The scene of the Delapidation House is fairly tense and there are some 'tired' moments - but for the most part the movie is technically unprofessional. Throw in some really awesome performance from horror icons Tom Savini and Shaun Hutson, and you have only one real movie on your hands. Here are some funs that can be derived from the absolute sheer movie, and there are loads of Girls stripping for the tastes, but most will find this a chore to sit down.
