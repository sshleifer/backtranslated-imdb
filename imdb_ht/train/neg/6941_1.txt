This film is not only boring, it is also really bad to do. The graphics are so bad, they are not the same second rate - they are horrible. The characters do not show any facial expression, voice acting is empty and without any soul, and the plot absolutely lacks .... well ... anything with everything. My 5 year old likes it - but thinks it's a bit boring. I agree with him.
