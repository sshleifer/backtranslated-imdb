Oh people. If you want to give your Crow Robot a real workout, this is the pop movie of the VCR. The potential for cutting lines in this film is just endless. Hey, you really care if a movie of this kind is "spoiled?") Traci is a girl with a problem. Psychology develops its name when a child develops a sexual harassment against the opposite sex. But this girl seems to have one for the same sex, and I do not think there is a theme for that. It might be because her mother's dana is played by Rosanna Arquette, whose beautiful overbite, neo-flowerchild sexuality and appetizing face makes me pardon any number of bad movies or unsympathetic characters. Here Dana is not only clueless in her daughter's conduct; It seems to be competing for the gold medal at the Olympic Indulgence Competition. <br /> <br /> It is possible that Dana missed Traci's killings because truths said, Traci seems to have criminals in a hamster. Only because the script dictates that it manages to pull all kinds of a body count. A particularly hilarious note of this film is the character of Carmen, a Mexican maid who described in Dana as long as she is like one of the family although she dressed in what the director thought, "I just fell into the truck tomatoes from Guadalajara. " Carmen is so wise to complain to Traci, he might also put a sign saying, "Hey, I'm the next victim!" Sure, Traci meets Carmen as Carmen is making his way back from Mass, with his Bops and one of these little little sloping keys that car manufacturers set next to your supply as a bad joke. I rather suspect than in real life things are as useless as a murder weapon as they are to change a tire. <br /> <br /> In another sequence, Arquette puts a sidewalk dress in a vineyard, under black sky, talking to the owner. Cut it into another clever dress under sun sky, talking with the owner's fee. Then cut it off the first coat, in the first place, under black sky - but it's supposed to be later. You get the picture. We're really talking badly. <br /> <br /> As for skin, do not expect much, although Traci does her own a nice haircut in bikini. <br /> For those looking for a garbage collection, 8. For any other, 1/2.
