A dead body of the girl to get rid of all possible means of identification. When she discovers that one leg is longer than the other, it is assumed that the body of daughter is missing a couple of. Following this trauma, the couple separated from the mother to become addicted to tranquility and driving a miserable existence. All of this changed a day, many years later, she received a phone call from her daughter! With the help of a former cop and a reporter, she sets out on a journey to determine if her daughter is really alive. "Sin Sin Nombre" is a draw-wise disorder, moving at a slowly moving speed, and it is completely shaken. Thanks to saving money is Emma Vilarasau, who does an exceptional job as the desperate mother. The best part of the movie is the finish, but I'm not sure it's worth enduring the rest of the movie. Beware of the English subtitles over release of the last R1 - are not very accurate.
