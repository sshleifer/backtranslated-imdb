Maybe I could not find the DVD menu selection for PLOT: on OFF. Clearly, the default is OFF. When the credit ends they started rolling, I could not believe it was. Like the poor protagonist, but nice to me, I felt used, dirty, cheap. <br /> <br /> Characters were drawn in extremely great and displeased writings for rich Thatcherites were all noticeable . I consider myself a "Roosevelt Democrat", but would appreciate a bit more subtlety. <br /> Of course, the problem might be with me. I see that many others seem to get some meaning or message in this picture. Alas, not me <br /> <br /> The only thing that kept me from giving this a "1" was the beautiful scenery, people and plants.
