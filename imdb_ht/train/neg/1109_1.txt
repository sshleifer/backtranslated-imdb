This is certainly the worst Western I've ever seen. The story follows a formula specifically common to the West and film martial arts - heroes learn that family / friends were murdered, so heroes lay out of precise revenge, the lawful lawful foils, the deliberate kidnapping love, and murders the expert arch-nemesis in a brutal duel. This formula has often been successful - otherwise it would not be a formula - but Gunfighter is the most sophomoric execution of it you'll ever see. The scripting is simple-minded and insulting; It sounds like a high school writing the dialogue because it lacks depth, maturity, and realism. The sound is bad; it sometimes looks armed. The cinematography is lame, and sometimes they are lying facades. The act is deplorable; make sure some of the performers can blame the script, but others can not use this excuse. I hope I've never seen Chris Lybbert in a talk ever again; Every time he says a line that should be upset or mean, he does nothing more than the lower film in his voice and it just sounds like a kid trying to act sling. And speaking of Chris Lybbert, who plays Hopalong, check out her duds (if you dare to watch this movie): She puts these new clothes that make her look more like Roy Rogers than a work-down cowboy -a-sal. If you enjoy cinematic ticket fare that simply serves the graceful imagination of Hopalong Cassidy, then get this, but if you have more than two neurons, look something else.
