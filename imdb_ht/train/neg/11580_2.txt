If you want to see a mystery, do not look at that. Even though there are elements right out of Elmore Leonard territory, this comes closer to an episode of "Dynasty", since the movie focuses on "character development" - is long, boring tales between stupid, un-involving characters. Some people can make movies without real action (see "Exotica"), but not this one. Avoid it, especially if you like the actors involved in this one.
