I just spent stumbling on this browsing movie channel. My first reaction was, 'God is not yet! '. it's so hip to play a delay the days he gets firefight and frankly jerking. for some reason, though, I stayed and looked at him until the end. Maybe it was my faith in the actors, hoping they would give me something to cheer on. <br /> <br /> and surely ken and helena can act. Also, the film is progressing to something better towards the end and actually make a point. <br /> <br /> Helena Bonham Carter also amazed me with her character. Jane has a side mean that it uses to keep distance and reproach. And then he has a soft side that's just looking for love. The only thing that surprised me was the branagh's character ... this was a triumph of acting, the movie itself is nothing unique. <br /> <br /> See if you are a student acting ... if you're looking for more entertainment you can skip this one. it is serious! oh oh, that was a bit harsh it presented a couple jokes ... not for escapists though.
