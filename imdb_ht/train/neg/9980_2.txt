Do not waste 90 minutes of your time on "Fast Food, Fast Women." It's animated episodic script and three story lines patched together is ridiculous due to predictable writing, agitation act, and even bad music. I found the main anorexic character of the upsets to watch every time he was on screen. He needs fast food. Spend the 90 minutes you would devote to this turkey to do something more fun ... like your nail reduction. You would have more entertainment value. The only thing that comes down on this movie is Louise Lasser, but it deserves better than that script script. It's as impotent as the greatest guy he court in the movie. <br /> <br /> VIEWER warn!
