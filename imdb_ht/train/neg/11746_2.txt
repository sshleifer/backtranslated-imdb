Well this movie certainly has a fair amount of hype; From the Buzz at the Film Festival Toronto Gushing reviews on CBC Radio. A refreshing, wacky, hilarious indie movie apparently. I would have been looking forward to it for months. <br /> How can I put this simply? It sucks in a very big way. An exercise in cinematic sensation that Adam Sandler looks like a funny genius. At best it was mildly fun and at worst coma induced. An American script seriously led and shoddily edited in a hit chaos. <br /> <br /> And what was with the music being 500db stronger than the rest of the sound track? This was the only really odd thing about it. <br /> <br /> If you want to see a really funny, scar that involves aliens then try Repoman. There is no comparison!
