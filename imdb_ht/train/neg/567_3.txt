This movie is one of the most terrible movies ever made. How does Jon Bon Jovi play in a movie? He is a singer by an actor, What? Does it kill vampires and guitars? And what about the obnoxious plot? O God my movie that really sucks. At the end is the queen of vampires played by Eternal Vampire Arly Jover (Blade) surrounded by a host of vampires, but when the "fantastic" slayers reached only 4 vampires to stay !! What happened with the other 10-15 vampires? They run out of the sun ??? And what about the "Grand Final" when Bon Jovi strikes himself with a shotgun ??? This is really a "PA". In the "Buffy Slayer Vampire" in 100 episodes is not a single soldier killed with a SHOTGUN ??? That's really a lack of originality!
