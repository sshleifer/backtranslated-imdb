There was good performance by Robin Williams and others, but the movie was in general and very disappointing compared to the positive reviews. <br /> I think Sy could become a bloodthirsty assassin in death: a forlorn guy in ugly clothes is centered on his victims in the food court, citing Oprah and reciting his medical history until they are asked to shoot them. <br /> I think the movie mostly calls egomaniacs who think foreigners are interested in the pictures. I expect the most detailed workers to want a break from their customers.
