I am the kind of person who always goes 2 in the horror section when I pick a movie, so I chose five of the eyes, I was lousy with this movie and thought there was no story line and no point you could enjoy it, it made my skin pull thinking that people like to watch films that just promote violence for the hell in it has given budget and lots of garbage! I think I could do better myself. I think it was the worst movie I've ever seen in my life and you should not bother to watch her actors being garbage the camera was awful the picture was bad and the sound was not up to scratch, I think it was a little bit like a rip cheep to cut the project baler and he was not working at all it was bad.
