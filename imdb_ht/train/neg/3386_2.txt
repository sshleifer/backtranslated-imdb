Yes, I was lucky enough to see the original version of Michael Bennett's hit music. It was an amazing experience and I paid to see the movie when he hit the theater back in 1985. It is terrible. Almost everything fails. The first, Attenborough (a fine actor, a good director and the right material) is a choice of regret - almost as bad as when John Huston hired ANNIE. The camera still in the wrong place - to cut up the songs and the casting !!! They are terrible - the power of the play was such dancers - these hunger, talented performers just wanted a chance to show what they could do and when they got their chances - you could not take your eyes off them. But this cast just does not dance, doing a "nice" song work, but none of them provoked a bit. In fact, watch the cast on IMDb - none of them really went to do a lot. (OK, OK, Janet Jones married Gretzky - sheesh). So, this movie coach does not take for a second magic, the despair, the passion of the music scene. A total strike-out! (But even if they try to clog the music - the music still exists at times and reminds people how high the score was).
