This foolish story, weak is delivered only by the opening stage of a hard-boiling police detective delivering some almost-acoustic lines that confirms our greatest fears: It is dead. Maybe the movie would be saved, the director has delivered the bright star power of A. Martinez in favor of this sadly-anonymous actor who fills the screen for a moment. Those with no hack-torn non-racers could salvage as a dishwater movie is no less likely than a ruthless kill comet by dropping stones into a career for an unsuspecting diver. Her moment is short; His promise is immense. Maybe we will treat in more time screen by this thespian darkness if there is ever a sequel to this ill-advised film.
