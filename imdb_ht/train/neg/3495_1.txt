I watched an episode. Yes I'm sitting across miserable experiences, and I must say, this brand of comedy is one of the worst you'll get. Imagine Peter Griffin, on behalf of Family Families. Now imagine Peter Griffin as a (admittedly thin and less glasses) woman, except that she now misses something that made her hilarious. Peter Griffin is a fool, but he does not know he's a fool. Sarah has no of the genuine character, none of the ability to act pull her character. Perhaps it's the frustrated, joke formula that pulls comedy itself even lower than its character can take it by itself. Perhaps it's lack of credible foil. It is sensitive, the character could appeal to sensitive people who have been bigoted unlike the mass call that Stephen Colbert's sensitivity, the bigoted character. Like Bill O'Reilly, Sarah creates an annoying, unfunny character. It lacks something that is needed for the satire genre, let alone the whole world of comedy. What Silver Silverman lacks, its apparent. But when you do not believe it and identify with it, it's no longer funny.
