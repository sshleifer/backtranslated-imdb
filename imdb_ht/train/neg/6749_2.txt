This chaos is so bad he does not even qualify as horror. <br /> Debbie Rochon's talent is completely wasted in this movie. It's not the bad guy. The rest of the actors look like wannabes pornography and the plot so lame I will not even mention it. <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor and jump in credit to end up listening to DeMarlowe band making it "Better Than Sex" in 80 candy disco scenes. Nice singing tempo on Gambleing & Sex. Way more fun than "Bleeding". Put it in this way, when one has the equipment to copy video, but decides only to record this movie by the end of film, you have a real movie "BAD".
