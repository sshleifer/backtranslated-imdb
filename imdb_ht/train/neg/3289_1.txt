I'll tell you what happened, some people have money thinking it would be good to ruin one of the best shows on TV. Do we really need a great re-make screen? Did they ask their fans? I wonder how all fans would feel if they had made a remake of "Rocky Horror Picture Show" with actors like Ashton Krutcher, Steve Martin, Britney Spears, and Kiefer Southerland, taking the music and making it a drama. You think they would like that! This movie does not have the same feel as the original. Be sure that the original was a little regrettable at times, but Bo and Luke were always nice, they came into trouble because they were still set up to get into trouble, and their main goal was to help people who passed through the city. Anyone who counts with the people who made this movie, they might never even see the original show all the way through. My great question is, what will they break next?
