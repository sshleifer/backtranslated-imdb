I am also a great fan of the low-budgetary horror movie 80's. This is not the worst but still not spectacular. The plot line is decent, but moves out too long. You are in half the movie before you even get to see any zombie action. Kill them are not very creative and zombies are not too crafty. I really think this movie would be best if they left the zombies and just do it in some mafia movie flick. She looked but I felt that this film was stolen at least an hour in my life. I'll give the movie credit for being a bit original. If you are really in horror movies B is worth a look but if not, do not bother. But you do not have to take my word for it.
