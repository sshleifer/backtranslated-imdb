I'm sorry, I know this is supposed to be an "art" film, but wow, they should have released out the screening gun so people could blow their brains out and do not look. Although photography design and photography photography were excellent, this story is too painful to look. The absence of a sound track was brutal. The vaccine loooonnnnng was too long. How long can you look at those who just sit there and talk? Especially when the dialogue is two people complaining. I really had a hard time just getting into this movie. Their performance was excellent, but how many of the dark, gloomy, unenspired, things you can take? The only thing I liked was Maureen Stapleton and her red dress and dance scene. Otherwise this was a ripoff in Bergman. And I'm not fond of it either. I think anyone who says they enjoyed 1 1/2 hours in this is, well, lies.
