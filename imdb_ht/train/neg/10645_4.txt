I would never see a Tarzan movie before I saw it on the TV I thought I would give it a shot. Unfortunately I said I was disappointed. Tarzan was over 40 years old and a bit overweight. By how I would imagine Tarzan would look. And, unless I missed it while making myself a cup of tea, Tarzan never gave her traditional renewal. Also missing was Tarzan swinging in the trees - leaping from vines of vineyards. <br /> Well, so much for expectations. Anyway, Jane was there - the Cheeta Monkey was there. There were some guys and a guitar. There were bandits and good guys and a romance ... all very harmless and predictable. There is nothing wrong, you understand, but equally nothing good. <br /> <br /> Probably not the best movie featuring Tarzan: 4/10
