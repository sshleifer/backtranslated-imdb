This film is beautiful look, but it's like watching really bad experimental theater. The plot (if there was one) makes no sense. But it is very "artistic". Many of the half-shot shots actor show and look deep into each other's eyes. Many artistic shots across the windows and people come from frames. Mumbling and those who lose wistfully. Continue to close-ups in face and body. When you reach the Threesome on the roof and the cat, you'll be ready to throw a KYK bottle on the screen. <br /> It is assumed to be a father's relationship with the son, but you'll just be wanting two of them would just f * $ & one with each other and get it on with. If you've always wanted to see gay Russian porn without any money shots, they wanted you to be granted.
