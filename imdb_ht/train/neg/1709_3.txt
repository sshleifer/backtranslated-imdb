I got myself a copy of this movie thinking it was film in 1964 and 'Zombie Bloodbath' as ​​one of its alternative titles. Perverse, this movie actually has a better rating on this site than the aforementioned title; which may mean that the other one is really bad! This film is very bad too; Obviously you can not go to a movie called Him 'Zombie Bloodbath' and expect to see a masterpiece, and in justice he lives up to the title and the amount of gore on display ... but it all feels old and tired, which was not helped by the insidious line acting and stupid. It's just your average nuclear waste that causes people to turn into zombies etc. etc. The movie kicks off with a sequence that sees meltdown and that pretty much lets you know what you are in for; low quality zombie trash. There's plenty of film, and it's a good good job otherwise the movie would be really boring. Zombie Bloodbath looks really cheap, and it's clearly put together by inexperienced creators! The main influence seemed to Romero's superior day of the deceased, although he could really be just about anything that features zombies and gurus. It all boils down to a typically predictable and freeway finish and I can not say I was impressed with it!
