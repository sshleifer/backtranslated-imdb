Even in a bad movie, there are usually some features of stampers, something that you can say yes it was awful, but there was that performance, or part of the script, or that special effect, this was just merely horrible all the other country over. The act was ridiculous, terrible script, filled with many breakfast uncertainties in Tiffany's references, and even the special effects were shoddy at best. This was a very bad movie and one that even Drew Barrymore wanted to be exported from history. See it if you want: a) Leave your head pain. b) See just how bad a movie can be. This is one movie where I can use the stereotype "Ninety minutes in my life I will never come back" with some justification!
