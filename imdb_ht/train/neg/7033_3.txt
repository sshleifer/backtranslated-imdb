Black Candles are rather a mess muddled from the same director who made us "Vampires" and many later, "Rest of pieces", among others .. I only note what I've seen. At any rate, we have a couple of love and then somewhere near a comb is waiting for a voodoo doll and then pierce it, and the man's keels. Not sure if it was good for one of them at that point. Quickly go to the place where the siblings came to the house to investigate and hear the will, or something for the effect, and of course everyone else except it is about something that happens to be worship Satan. It's really hard to tell who at the time during the movie and it's getting a bit confusing at times. For spice things though, there's a fake biology scene (I hope it's fake) and a black goat, make sure you're a pleaser crowd. Ugh. At this time the "Baby Rosemary Baby" echo, the baby's baby, because the hostess is always given to one herbal herbal and the place of reeks at all these nasty Satanic herbs are too, because that keeps getting notice. However, herbs are not the only thing that reeks on this movie. The end seems to be back in the beginning again, and many viewers can find themselves wondering where they've been during the middle part. It's not incredible, it's just not very good, and I guess it all depends on what you like to see in the movie, and there was not much here that did a lot for me. 3 out of 10.
