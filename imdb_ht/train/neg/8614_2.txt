I must confess the right to that I've never been a fan of Rodney Dangerfield. Indeed, in my hand it becomes "no respect." I watched this only because my wife wanted to see him and found exactly what I expected: a stupid story without any real humor. It's full of blame, bit jokes and a totally ridiculous plot revolving around a developer's plans (Dangerfield) plan to build a ski resort in Utah that just did not take my attention to all. <br /> In addition to the movie Dangerfield played a weak cast, including the likes of Andrew Clay Dise and totally on Mount John Byner (I did not even know he was still around until I saw his name, in the credits for that.) <br /> <Surely it's a Dangerfield disaster. <br /> <br /> 2/10
