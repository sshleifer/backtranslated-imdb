Proof why Hollywood conventions are in place. Diarrhea, underdeveloped and flat character and a disjointed storyline are only part of these issues and wannabe Gangster Gangster. An attempt to be daring and different, but this appears to be a calm-set attempt at Recording the Magic Bonnie Arthur's Penn and Clyde (1967) and the Butch Cassidy George and Kid of Sundance (1969) - truly innovative filmmakers and films - but fall well below the bar. Problems with the storylines were self explanatory results of the need for a wave to explain the problem areas. The change seems to be an attempt to copy the classics first, but is occasionally disjointed and causes more problems for me technically. Vaccines necessary to dispose of the film's justified, but would have to better serve the viewer by sitting on the cut-off floor. Styles, black & white montages and music periods are thrown in from time to time in either attempt to have different or to cover up for scenes that can not properly transition or replace the scenes that just did not work at all and yet are reminiscent of Butch Cassidy and Kid at Sundance (1969). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> since the 1980's - I left asking who was in charge of this film during production and during post-production. Play in music at most of the shots and shut-ups and then suddenly stop at heavily overly highlights emphasizing a weak musical score. No sound editing has been clearly apparent as the big movie was shotgun, door, track and dialogue (a style used in the late 60's by the mid-70 by new directors) but lacking background noise that caused it to be artificial - particularly The tire squeaks on the dirt road. In my honest opinion, the biggest problem at all is no 'favorable' character for the audience on the road to neither were we brought to see as the protagonists of the story. Both the gangsters and the laws were the characters I wanted to see and they were focusing on as the 'hero' - a necessity for any story to work for me. We know from Penn's movies and the Hill that the 'Heroes' are. Though they are criminals, we love them and want to see them get away. I could handle fewer people on the screen of this movie. I received the impression that John Milius was trying to provide a non-historically unrealistic re-documentation of events surrounding John Dillenger's life from June 1933 to July 1934 (his death). <br /> <br /> To be fair, there are some moments in good tale storytelling, which is the brightest moment out of dark cancer and the participation of that movie is sitting. John Milius gets the earliest movie in which he does not seem to try to 'copy' other filmmakers. Dillinger (1973) is not a total waste that many stars and famous faces have in the shorter of breaking out are involved with this first big budget budget, but wait for it on a classic movie channel instead that spends money to rent or buy. <br /> <br />
