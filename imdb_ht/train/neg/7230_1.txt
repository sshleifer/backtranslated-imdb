I love science fiction, I am captivated by Egyptian mythology and I appreciate digital animation. I figured out a movie that combines these three should be at least enjoyable. I could not have been more wrong: The story (or actually the lack of) was completely uninspired and lacking imagination - while fantasies usually are the major component of any science fiction history. The dialogue and act even worse than in an average porn movie. Especially Thomas Kretschmann gives new meaning to the 'bad performance' theme. Bad act would not be such a big problem if only 'Director' Bilal did not take it seriously; All the lines sounds as supposed to be poetic, it seems Bilal really thinks he's made a piece of art here. Well, no art or poetry must be found in this piece of junk, just pretense! This man should really stick funny, since it fails on all possible accounts as a director. The worst of all is the terrible digital animation, which is so ugly that it actually turns watching this movie into a physically painful experience. The graphics look so fake they even make the werewolves in 'Van Helsing' look like live actors! And since half the characters are CGI-animated, it is quite a problem that CGI effects look so fake. If the Egyptian gods actually exist then Bilal a dead guy, because they will no doubt take vengeance on him for the ridiculous way in which he shows them in this bad movie success.
