WARNING. This movie is like a mess. It's a disaster. Do not waste your time with this one. I warn you! Acting, story, dialogue, music ... basically everything is so over the head, it's absolutely annoying and ridiculous. He made me want to throw (if dialogue / acting / story did not make it, it's all shot crooked). You will feel like watching a comedy. The problem is, the supposedly supposed parties are not even funny. Acting, the story, cinematography, you can feel everything is just trying WAAAAY too hard - but it never succeeded. Practically every shot is canted, but so what? This movie just feels like a student movie. No wonder they shot this in HD because it would be a waste to spend more money to shoot on this movie. <br /> <br /> If you're easily amused or loved by poor acting, writing, editing, directing, full clich√©s, everything that has been forced into your face, oh and I have mentioned poor acting? (well, actually, it's not all the actor's fault - it's the director!) then I guess you'll love this movie. <br /> I had to watch this for a class. I would have been turning it away if I could. If you still can not say by now, I felt this movie. She made me want to throw up and find my time back ... at least I did not have to pay for this waste. Jeff Goldblum, you know ... The guy from Jurassic Park / The Independence Day, is in this movie but he sure has come down to that - accepting roles for movies like this catastrophic.
