I must admit that I'm glued to this one thought something should happen, besides the dead body of the first scenes ... and throw it to him. I was guilty. It was a movie cinema in Betty hit the beach surrounded by the first part by Mordant Morven. I really do not care what young lattice from Scotland does these days, which screws you, what the drugs are taking. Visually, the tour of the Cabo de Gata in Andalucia was beautiful and surely the high point for me. Nadir has been the shop of mens for her dead boyfriend. As the movie came to a close I had two thoughts ... 1. That's all there? 2. Now I see why her boyfriend killed herself. Change its name. "Have bitch boredom, or what I did in my trip to Spain." I'm like a sucker for sticking things out.
