I liked "American movie", so I rented Chris Smith's first movie, which I thought was a documentary too. In the first minute I saw that he was not, but I gave him a go. <br /> What a movie is dead. Being true-to-life hardly serves you if you're simply going to examine tediousness, esp. tediousness that we are already familiar with. <br /> I'm sorry, but it will come as a decisive of any 1) a lot of sucking work and 2) most of them are preventing, minimum wage work in the service sector ??? I knew that before I saw the movie. It did not really give a test of it anyway, as during the movie struggles to feel "real" (portable camera, no music, etc.), what's going on hardly playing out as it would be in "world the real. " <br> <br /> Is an employer so happy Randy when choosing his check, after Randy left on it after 3 days when the guy said he expected him to stay 6 months ?? Or the day after abandoning his job (and fucking the car he was working on), that everyone would be so easy on it? <br /> A big problem is "our hero" (?), Randy. This guy is a loser. Not because it was stuck in such works, or having a very hungry apartment, or looks like one. It's a drug. It does not pay attention or even really try to work. It has zero personality. If I had hired someone, he would not do it through the interview. <br /> I'm looking forward to what Chris Smith does next, but guy, hit in "this-is-the-important-movie" thing. "American Job" does not work.
