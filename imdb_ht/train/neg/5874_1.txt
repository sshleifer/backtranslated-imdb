one of the worst films I've seen on date. Pathetic action scene and really bad act also do not help. The only good point is Gary's busy part but that does not raise the movie much. she lives up to her movie B movie and passes the test with color fly. A trash in my money although I found fun to start and it gets annoyed after a few watches. I do not recommend this movie unless you look it free or read a gift. (a gift you can ask for and return it for a full refund). <br /> <br /> Really BAd. <br /> 1/10.
