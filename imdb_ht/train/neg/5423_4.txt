I've been using IMDb for some years now, but never wrote any previous review. However, this film has deterred me (even with a modest score of 6.4 at the time of writing) that I can not keep quiet again. <br /> <br /> Boom is the story of a New Yorker (Tim Robbins) who is so perturbed by noise pollution that it takes on a change-month as a vigilant, "rectifier", and vandalizes any His car found with a car-alarm sounded. The name of the movie must be a bit of a misnomer. Although there are only one or two cases in other sound sources being addressed or mentioned, only the true focus of our protagonist is car alarm. Alarm for cars, alarms, alarms. There is really no other focus. When the film tries to tie other examples of noise pollution into the problem of alarms, it seems to be just thrown in to merit in the actions of Robbins' characters. <br /> <br /> Yes, we are all annoyed by noise. Nobody likes the sound of the car alarms. Of course, we all have that internal encouragement to take a baseball bat in a booster car, and this movie uses this reality, and pretty much that reality alone, to sell this movie. I say 'pretty much' because there is also a sexual relationship that sexual conflicts (including a completely useless drain) which is obviously dropping into people who go film-those who need things to throw in order to enjoy a movie. Honestly, it's eye-rolling. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Robbin's character, very briefly in the movie, gets completely unrelatable. It seems less that he decided not to step up and the noise again, and more so by focusing so much on the noise he began to lose his sanity. The first half of the film is essentially the story of how it turns out to be just a mad, car-booty dude of the hero of the little guy, the rectification. However ... the transformation does not take place. She just changed herself. <br /> I could go on for a while. Bored Socialized Social Comments Coming to every now and adding to the pretense of the movie, and the self-satisfied smirk that never thinks Robbins face does not help either. <br /> <br /> In general, I think it's very obvious what this film is trying to be, as it's pretty much pushing down your throat, but in my opinion, it fails in a great way. Just one opinion guy, cheers.
