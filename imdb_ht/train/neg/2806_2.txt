The worst kind of movie. Basically, the U.S. Independent Declaration has been replaced with a plasma screen and it deceives the museum security for several days. Eh? <br /> The plasma screen could be theoretically running for less than 2 seconds on that battery look, assuming it had enough adequate internal resistance to deliver the required current, which it would not. <BR> <br /> It would be possible with a dozen large piles of car with an inverter, but this system would not fit in the case. Sorry to be in the back, but this is not even close to being possible. The rest of the movie was not a great deal of artifacts and I was wondering why the budget could not have been charity or me.
