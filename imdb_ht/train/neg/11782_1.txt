The Danish film "Slim Slam Slum" surprised me to be the worst movie I've seen on that date. I did not think it was possible to top my list of bad bad b-movies but that's one worthy of gold. It's not funny. It's bad act, It's bad filmed and the storyline is bad. The only positive thing I can say about this movie is she has three girls in her. I really believe that flicking this film has the potential to hit the other film "Danish scene" as the worst Danish movie ever made! And it's really something. Congratulations in advance!
