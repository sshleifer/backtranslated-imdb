This movie is like a thousand "cats and mice" movies before it. (The following may look like a beckle, but it really just describes a great class of movies) There are passionate, the main characters, identical to him, but well-meaning sidekick and his ill-placed attempts, In the comic, initially-hostile commentary but quickly honors gorgeous ladies who unleash the inevitable "easy" love story, the loved ones are taken hostage, and of course the opponent neglected evil with his brute minions. Everyone has seen tons of films already, and "National Treasure" is like any one of them, and only a slightly modified packaging. Each turn of the story was easily predicted (and I can assure you that I'm not the best tool in the flow). I'm very tired of feeling cheated for money after exiting the theater in a Hollywood movie, and if you've ever felt that way too, listen to my warning; Stay away from this movie.
