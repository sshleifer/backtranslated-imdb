Pretty bad movie offers nothing new. The usual quack and moaning attempt to make-up for a muddled, but thin story. Acting is barely higher than miners. Why Liam Neeson signed on for this is to guess anyone. Owen Wilson really turned into one of the worst performances of story-film movie horror stories. Catherine Zeta Jones is fun to look at and not much else although Lili Tayor has done a job above average. Special effects were fairly memorable and the home itself was enchanting and hauntingly gorgeous. However they can not makeup for the poor act and the scenario that appears to have been thrown together in the last minute. Do not bother.
