I'm not going to waste a lot of time in this one because as far as I'm concerned it's not really a movie to start with, just a mish-mash negligence of lending footage and embarrassingly new footage made just for the purpose of stuck The whole chaos and call it a "Boogeyman" end. Literally 80% of this film was stolen from its far superior predecessor, "Boogeyman," a movie that writes in this garbage apparently did not even bother to look because they could not even name the original Suzanna's character of character (Lacy) right. And add insult to the assassin's crash is invisible to the original foot and visible to the new foot, apparently to think the audiences are as stupid as they are. 0 out of 10 and I wish IMDb's rating rating was low, the most ruthless and blatant attempt to cut people whom I had seen, YOU WARNED!
