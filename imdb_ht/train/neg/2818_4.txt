Engineering (Zoe Trilling) came to Egypt to visit his hypocrite, Bib-quoting Father Otterologist (William Finley) and attracted the attention of a group of cultures led by a descendant of the Marquis de Sade (Robert Englund). Englund also plays the Sade of flashback, ranting in his cell. There is genius led by Muhammad (Juliano Merr), who is naked rides on a horse with Sabina (Alona Kamhi), a bisexual that introduces him to smoking opium, which leads to a wild alicein featuring topless harem dancer, a woman simulating oral sex on a snake, an orgy and her father preached in the background! Meanwhile, black-haired coupe members, cut out eyeballs and throat slit. When genius is slipping the drug was read, she imagined two Sade hanging in a cross, a woman-painted woman in a g-green string and herself on a bed covered with snake. It's all because it is the reincarnation of Sade's love. <br /> This usually sleaze Harry Alan Towers production is redundant, seductive and pretty lurid, but the sets, costumes, cinematography and work where they are all excellent and at least there's always something to go. <br /> Score: 3 out of 10
