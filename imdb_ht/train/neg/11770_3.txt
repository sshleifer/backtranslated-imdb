'P' (or Club-P) should really call 'L' for lame. Each festival has a deception and this is the one that fails to live up to many-hyped ranks: "Thai lesbians are fighting monsters." Instead, this is the story of a Khmer Khmer girl who taught her a small magic along with a few odd (but specific) rules: "Do not walk under a dress," "Do not eat raw meat, "and" Do not accept money for your power. " Well, guess the way, the girl moved to Bangkok to raise some money as a 'bar-girl' and managed to break down all the grandmothers rules taught him that immediately releases a demon that easily kill the 'johns' aliens who pay to read their services. While this film can not even be released in Thailand due to its controversial topic, most American audiences will find this horror ho-hum pic cross between "Showgirls" and "The Vampire Interview" as Walt Disney has led. <br /> If you are not for a few scenes and the significant amount of blood MPAA can probably rate this for pre-genes only. There are literally television broadcasts, although you expect at least one sex scene to consider the fact that the movie is on a brothel and one of the actresses is a Thai porn star in real life. As for the 'lesbian' angle, there is a brief smooch and a couple of "I love you in" to prove that the two main stars really are a couple (over fees). And the p-bar had to be the only exotic dance club on the planet where the girls kept the Sarongs on and carnival stunts (there's a sword that cut cucumbers from a girl's mouth ... ooh, phallic imagery). br> <br /> NO nudity, NO real monster (unless you count a five-leg high Thai spirit with yellow eyes), and there is no way any ADULT would ever pay to see this kind of sort except on DVD. You've been warned!
