The first time I saw that when I was about 7. I remembered what I believed to be a wave of what was happening. Turn right now, 15 years later, that I remember everything with great accuracy because it seems the writers never received beyond making a description of the story. There is no scheme of this movie / cartoon. There is no character development, no history back, no archive characters, nothing. The good guys do things because they're good, while the bad guys do things just because they're bad. An unintentionally hilarious party is when someone who you think should die without dying at least. They just shrug their shoulders and move on. There is barely any dialogue either. If you cut out the battle scene and the running scenes, you lose 70% of the movie. Watch this because you want to see some good animations and for any other reason. Or if you like to look scantily clad chic chic cartoon designs (or scantily clad dough designs hot designs).
