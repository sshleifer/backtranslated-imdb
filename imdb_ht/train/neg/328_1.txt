I'm a big fan of Sandler Adam, and one day I looked at the Cast & Crew selection on one of his DVDs, and saw 'Going further' and decided to go out and rent it. So I went out with a few buddies at me and rent it. We put it on and we were shocked to see an Adam Sandler who had not hit again, and it seemed like he was 12 when that movie came out. I could not even watch 30 minutes of this crap, I did not laugh, chuckle, or even smirk in this movie, actually the only time i smirked was when I saw how surprised this movie was. I could not believe how hard he tried to make street viewers in this film ... and did not work once. Although seeing the original awful horrible angle and hearing the disgusting script I realize why I have never heard of this film, ... because it absorbs more than anything ever has sucked before. This movie, in my opinion, was the WORVER movie each made, .... EVER!
