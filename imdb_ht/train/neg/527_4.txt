Put to death for a movie that is considerably less. Vanessa Redgrave is dying but before she goes she starts telling her daughter the story of her life and her love for love ... This is one of those movies that has the look and expectation of being a movie because simply because They have many great actors and actresses in it so it seems to be something else than the potboiler that it really is. Not bad as these but with Redgrave, Toni Collette, Glenn Close, Meryl Streep, Danish Clare, Natasha Richardson, Eileen Atkins, Patrick Wilson, Hugh Darcy and others (all giving fine performances) you expect more than a story though somewhat more than a romance arlequin. <br /> Wait for cable.
