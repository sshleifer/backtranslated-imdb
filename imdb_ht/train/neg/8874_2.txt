but there are not too many of them. Probably the worst "movie released" movie I saw in my life. Definitely the worst for this year. There is no point in commenting on the plot, the cast or the act. The problem is beyond that. It puts in the sheer sort of annoying type (not the silly kind) of everything that takes place on the screen. I do not know why I gave it a 2/10 instead of 1/10. Probably, because of Steven Martini. He really tried. Bottom line - 95 minutes wash down the toilet and a few brain cells. Avoid at any cost.
