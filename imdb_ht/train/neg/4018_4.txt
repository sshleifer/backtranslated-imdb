This movie is too skeleton. It's a low budget-budget film (I hope!) Which excuses it a bit, but the lack of a decent throw and a plot out of hurts it too much. Phillips is quite credible in her role as a torn-out son in a well-being family who is searching for herself (though her family is ... he ... well, a little too white ... ), but the rest of the cast is grasping of straw. Each moment has the potential losing by too much melodrama, and there are * very * sub-scheme ways * (which is a clear sign of draw deficiency.Yo need to filler ...) I would not recommend this movie to anyone who is by either a hard-core Phillips fan, or who has absolutely nothing * to do. 4/10.
