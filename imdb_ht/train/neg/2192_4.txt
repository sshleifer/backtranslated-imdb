Another film that relies on the trite, worn-out clich√© of the mad scientist goes to hit. The center film around a surgeon whose life ambition is bringing dead ... back to life. I know, I know ... you never heard one before! Of course, as all these movies go, the experience goes very, very badly and creates a maniac, killer creatures. For this promising setup, you would think it should be at least a bit suspense. Move. Like many movies in this era, the idea is beautiful, but the execution and the script is mediocre. By the worst horror film I've seen (no, Abominator: The Evilmaker 2 always takes the cake) ... but not one of the gems, either.
