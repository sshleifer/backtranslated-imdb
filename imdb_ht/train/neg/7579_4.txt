The names of the "film films" often provide films that continue to be screened, or to sell in the home movie format, more than one generation after they were first released. Superchick, which was first released in 1973, now comes to this category. Her image culture is largely due to continuous interest in her by women who consider it as a facial and early film facial. <br /> <br /> Despite the "Superwick" connotation, "Superchick" is not a very attractive cartoon character young lady working as an air stewardess - a career option in the 1970s was often considered one in the most celebrity celebrity of any girl, and allows her to emulate the traditional matelot that reputedly has a wife in every port. Since she holds black belt statue in karate, she is in a position to make it clear that she is very happy with her bachelor's existence, and she is in no way beolden in any of her extensive suite of admirers. This film is a humorous comedy that generally shuts the live appeal offrightly outright. Her appeal to feminism is also increased by a major point in which our heroine uses her karate ability to avoid a hijacking and save all other passengers on her plane from a potentially unpleasant fate. To ensure that this film will appeal to men as well as their partners, the Principal has wisely assured that it is liberally poured with eye candy. <br /> <br /> Superchick can be enjoyed by people who are not too critical and want a very light light to watch comedy that will be forgotten soon after watching. It is so forgettable that they will probably find it equally enjoyable if look again in a year's time; despite its age it can therefore retain its status as a cult movie for some time to come. However the dialogue and acting would make it difficult to give this movie a rating of more than 4/10.
