This is a depressingly deep, naive and mostly unfunny look at a wildly-related relationship between Brooks' psychic film editor and Harold, his stepfather's girlfriend. The two have ZERO chemistry together - primarily because Harold is incapable of doing nothing besides looking at this stage in his career; but also because Brooks' character is neither interesting nor favorable. There are 15 static, lousy minutes at the start where Brooks, she just breaks up with Harold, breaks on her apartment in a depressed, drug-driven state - unbearable. Sappily and unimaginatively embedded by Joe Cocker in "You are so beautiful", there is simply not enough material here for a feature film. There is hardly anything going on periphery in their relationships to the appearance that these people exist in a real world. I assure that Brooks's intention was to shine a white spotlight on the matter and, in a way, deconstruct it; but if you're going to do the writing and acting needs to be far better than it is here.
