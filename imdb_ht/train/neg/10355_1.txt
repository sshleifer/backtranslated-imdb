I liked this book since this 5th grade teacher in our class many years ago. And I read it in every one of my 3rd and 5th grade classes over the past 18 years of teaching. Supposedly a movie was made in the past but I could never get it. Well, my students and I were all excited when we heard that Disney had a great deal of L'Angel's portrait of the screen. <br /> <br /> As I watched the movie, I had higher hopes. As the movie went on, I became more and more desperate. They have botched it wrong! Never I was so let down by a favorite book-to-movie adaptation. I understand that films can not be banned in a book, but they do not need to change things for the sake of! Most, if not all, the departure of the book was totally unnecessary! <br /> I kept my opinion in my head and just listened to my student discussing the movie. Well, it was not just me. Almost every one felt the same - scam from the great story that Madeline L'Engle was so skillfully created! <br /> <br /> Why, Seized, Made Aunty Beast Look Like Chewbacca from the Star Wars Movie? Why could not Calvin's hair be red? Why wife Does not have a good "witch-like" outfit like a smart play on her name? Basically, we all wonder - why almost every single detail must change? <br /> I've always dreamed of how beautiful a movie this book would do. I'm still waiting for that movie. This one was a rid of the only time the bigger in essence. I'll write Peter Jackson and try to convince him to take over the job!
