This movie is terrible if you pay attention to it. It's a perfect movie if you just watch the colorful dance dances across the screen - each one with no visible connection to the next. I rent this movie because I'm a fan of David Bowie, and I really appreciate musicals. In fact, Bowie was in the movie for a total of ten minutes and the songs and dance sequences were sparse and left something to be desired. Moral in the story was really befuddling. I could not tell if it was about racial issues in London in the 1950s or over by selling out. For the first half of the movie I was chuckling in how her cheese was but I loved the campaign in the "not selling" message. When the blacks began to assassinate I thought my tape got messed up. Maybe I rent half of different movies? Nope, there was a "Hold Great Britain" with dance sequences. I'm sorry, but WWII is not something you can write a music about. At least not a music that could be conceivable must be described as "campy" as I have several times in this review. Overall I would say this movie might make a whole lot better if it made up its ideas and cast the best actors. (And put David Bowie in her for a long time goddammit!) My Class: C-
