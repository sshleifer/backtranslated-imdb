The Teasers for the Tree of Palme try to pass it as a sort of allegory for a fairy tale and true meaning, then immediately begin to ravage on the animation. I should know what to say. <br /> <br /> The main character, Palme, is a good example of the entire movie issue. One minute, Palme is a hero submits in search of himself, next to a violent psycho and an unhealthy fixation on a girl he once took care of. Like all of the characters in the movie, Palme is wrongly defined. You do not bail with the characters at all, although Shatta has acquired a couple of girl fans. It seems that the writer was more interested in cramming the entire drama and complexity he could in this movie than actually exploring his character's motivation and personality. <br /> New, unnecessary line lines were introduced in the last minute minutes of the movie. The writer seriously needs to streamline his story. Perhaps she was trying to be epic, but she was simply too much information for a two-hour movie. However I can not help but wonder if a plot with many dimensions and characters would be best suited for a TV set or graphic novel. <br /> <br /> In the last five minutes of the movie I simply could not endure the absolute lack of quality again and began to laugh at how to understand the characters, relationships, and The whole plot was. I touched my boyfriend and started to split up, as a young man sitting next to us. We tried so hard to control ourselves, but we simply could not take the terrible quality of this movie. <br /> <br /> On the bright side, the animation is incredible and viewers will find themselves admired a prestigious lush origins and good character designs. The animation almost guides you; when you do not care about the characters, it tells you how to feel.
