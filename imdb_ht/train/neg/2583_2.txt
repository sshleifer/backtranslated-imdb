Another film American movie has pushed our throat and this one is the worst of them all. It does not deserve the American pie. They should stop at the "wedding". This movie feels like just a stupid porn movie that is slapping the American title. When I was watching what I felt like I was watching a different set. It does not fall as American Pie at all. It has different humor and it is much more rude and it has lots of gender sex plus then other American pie. <br /> I do not recommend it ever. Actually I do not recommend any of the "Present American Pie" movies. Just stick with the beautiful original trilogy. <br /> <br /> 2/10
