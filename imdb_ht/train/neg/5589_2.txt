I was skimming over the list of films of Richard Burton when I came to that title that I remember shining from when I first saw it on the cable in 1982. I remember the dialogue from Tatum O'Neal that was just amazingly bad. I remember character character Richard Burton looking so promptly lost, and then remember how his motivation did not translate me. In short, I remember "Circle de" because it was so terrible phenomenon. This movie came from a time when America went on a rather disturbing period of passion and unhealthy angle or skewed about young sexuality. Recall "Blue Lagoon" (and other Brooke Shields annuities), "Lipstick", "Little Darlings", "Beau Pere" and other films that just seemed to stay on sex, especially with adults. As a teenager during this time, I found the obsession, combined with the sexual excesses of the 70's and 80's, made for an incomplete subconscious environment in which face it all out, so to speak. <br /> "The Circle of Two" is not exactly acted or without priorities, such as "Blue Lagoon". In fact, it tackles the question of love between the youth and the old in a brave, if totally failed, way. But honestly, it is one of those films you will * never * see if you did not see it on its first run because it was so awfully awful. No one would want to have this garbage all the time to be publicly distributed again.
