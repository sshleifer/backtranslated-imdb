The plot is not so original. If someone saw "L'ultimo bacio" nothing new. A wealthy family of Rome living everyday life is boring and fake, and everyone asks others to think about them. Really boring after a half hour because it's simple to understand where the story will end. That's because it's simple to see the look of moralist in Muccino in this movie, so even the hardest part seems normal. To summarize in the first 2 minutes of the movie it would be enough and the purpose of the movie has already been told. The family saw in a 30 year old, I do not like to see films that want to show the reality, but to adhere to his thoughts have pushed more than the usual situations. Really good how Muccino puts the camera in the right place to move with the carathers and it's the only reason that does not bring me to sleep in the movie though still in the movie shouting from the start. Maybe it might be good for seeing the family how they are in fact and not putting the blame into something out of it. Morente was intense with great as usual but unfortunately about a bad movie!
