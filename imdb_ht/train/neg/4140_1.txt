As you can or can not hear, there is no current fight between vampires or zombies in this movie. One can then ask why the title suggests something, but really it's kind of suitable because nothing else about this movie has made any sense either. There was absolutely no story or draw, just things happened. The act was incredibly bad, worse than safeauto bad claims. <br /> <br /> Not only had there no fighting between vampires and zombies but I think there was only one scene with zombies even in it. They make up as if they were applied by a 8 year old girl. The scene was totally random and out of place and featured one of the characters who are fighting the zombies off with a hedge trimmer (I'm not kidding), but used the sound of chainsaw. <br /> This was undoubtedly the worst movie I've ever seen in my life. The only circumstance that I would not totally assume is that everyone responsible for producing this film is if I learned that it was produced entirely by the 11 year old. <br /> <br /> Really though, even with all the criticism I offer here, I would suggest watching this movie only based on the fact that it can pretty well be the worst movie ever, and because In this is quite funny. Even just count the flaws in it should keep you entertained.
