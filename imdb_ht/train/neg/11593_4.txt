I think this movie is one of the worst of the nightmare series. It was so boring that I could not remember something 20 minutes after the movie ended, and even my tires wrote a review about it. Okay, # 4 was a joke and Freddy was joker. # 5 tried to return to the roots of the series. It was darker and more atmospheric than nightmares 4, which is good, basically. They tried to shoot a horror movie instead of a comedy. Unfortunately they forgot to add suspensions and crises. Because of this nightmare 5: Child of dreams is neither funny nor fearful. What we actually get is a boring film and the usual bad actors (possibly with the exception of Lisa Wilcox). The Complex (Freddy kills Lisa's friends using the dreams of Lisa's unborn children) has a good basis but it's just not enough for 90 minutes of film. Sometimes the story gets very confusing (maybe because there is no) and you can not stop asking what the filmmakers are aiming at. The scenario must have had more holes than Swiss cheese and the movie therefore was very cheesy itself (let me say that I do not like cheesy though, even though I'm from Switzerland). Not even the special effects were good for example in Part 4. <br /> <br /> Do not borrow leasing / buying this movie if not complete, it's quite a mess. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br/> <br/>
