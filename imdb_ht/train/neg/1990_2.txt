This might be a strong candidate for "The Worst Ever Flick". Maybe without the presence of John Hurt, he might be tolerated as a kid-movie. However, the TRAGEDY of this whole endeavor, is that John Hurt, one of the major screen actors, has reduced himself to this .... I gave her two points just because Mr Hurt showed ... I Take away 8 points, because he did not run out of it fast enough. As far as the rest of the cast, they are, simply, terrible. Janine Turner, as beautiful as she might, can not act to save her soul. And the lead actor is, for all intentions and purposes, AWFUL. If you can spare yourself this embarrassment, please do so. It's so bad, it's almost HURTS.
