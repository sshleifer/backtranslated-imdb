Dane tries hard and is extreme and all shouting, he goes crazy, watering over his head and rolling on the floor. Many. Calm down, take your head and make you laugh. I did not quite understand its comparison toward comic and rock stars. Just because there are both up on stage or something? It is said that every comedy wants to make a rock star. I'm sure Rodney Dangerfield was really at that when he was alive. It has a few good jokes like the King Burger joke where people call in the drive. I also liked Reese's piece. If Dane just did not act for mental he might be funnier and I might have been giving this a higher rating, as high as maybe eight.
