There is only one problem with this website, you can not give a negative rating. In addition, a mate rated it as a class movie D. I said it was too nice. A piece of wood could show more emotions than the actors in this movie, and the money used to produce this movie was best used to starting a fire. This is absolutely awful, 2 hours of life that anyone who supports this unprecedented bloodbath will never get back. After watching 5 minutes, my head and boys are surprised if it's going down heavies essential would make this fun yet. Half a Carto and a Bottle 151 later I finally find some of this G class that remotely remembers. It's an insult to this entire planet that the director thought anyone could get anything beneficial from this plus, he should go and buy a code. With the actors in this movie flick, I hope you got well to be in this joke because I doubt you'll ever work again. In summary I fine everyone in this 100 Grand Movie with 12 points demerit in your acting license.
