This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I look at it mostly from a morbid curiosity since I liked the novel, and I wish I did not. I turned it after a little less than an hour, even though I wanted to turn it in after five minutes. I wish I had. It absorbs the very novel and changes all kinds of factors. Unless the movie manages to surrender in the last 50 minutes or so (which would be impossible) I would in no way recommend this. It is a reproach to one of the greatest writers of the 20th century. I do not think, as many people say it is, that the "Bell Jar" is necessarily unfilmable, but this particular proposal was made without. I would almost like to see one day in the hands of a director and senarist who can do it justice.
