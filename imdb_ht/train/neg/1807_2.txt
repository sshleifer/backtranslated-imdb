I admit, having aged at the hippie-dippy age, I'm a sucker for these kinds of movies. I can enjoy some of the genitals in the genus Schlock more than most "normal" people. However, this movie is simply awful in every reasonable way. <br /> Every twisted perception of the Hippie Lord is presented as gospel, cops kill a young long hair when it peacefully lands a plane. This movie is so awful that it's not even funny to look like a goof on the excesses of the hippie drone. It is like a left-wing version of Dragnet, except without professional actors. The only reason I gave her two stars was because some obscurities of interest on the soundtrack, besides, I could not find a selection of negative stars. <br /> No actors, almost no draw, sheeze, barely even a script ... you got it, an "art" movie .... All this makes in root watering root canals, dragging out Each senseless scene just fills up time. Sad sadness in life imitating art, star "nonactor" in the movie came into a real-life community and robbed a bank in Boston, one of his thieves was killed and sent to prison where he died in a weightlifting suspect "crash" ... and just think, he's got to leave this back as a legacy ... Oy vey.
