That's NOT one of these films it's one of the biggest pieces of drifts I've ever seen, the camera work tries to flashy, but it's really just crap the whole thing seems to tell the red shoes newspaper, but without They do not have sex, the only reason I bought this I wanted to try out DVD and this was the one cheaper I could get, possibly the worst buy of my life and could put you on DVD Forever, the band is really pathetic and most of the film is made up of endless repeats of clips from the first two films, why anyone wants to make a movie as horrible as this is far me, if they really try to make an original movie and fail I would be most beautiful in this review but they have not just got the right to reproduce stuff in the first two and then edit it and repeat it in This movie and perhaps under 1 foot 3 original are on up to the standards of film school students, NOT BUY THIS FILM. The only entertainment this DVD can offer is if you've stuck it in the microwave and watch the flashing lights! UTTER UTTER UTTTER GARBAGE incredible! 0/10 if only the voting system would allow that.
