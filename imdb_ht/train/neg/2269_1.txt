Lets make a movie on an existing talk show and basically have everything that's going on the show! Well if this idea does not intrigue you, which it should not be, stay away from ringmaster. I had the annoyance of seeing this in the theater and actually being able to sit in this mess in a movie. I think Jerry Springer does not play himself as he shows the cheapest owners to show him (yes it looks even cheaper than the real show Jerry Springer) and is only known as jerry in the movie. The plot (if you can call it) is about a daughter while living with her mother decided to start sleeping and living the mom of companion. So the smartest mom's idea is to call the jerry springer show as well as finding it over with her daughter's companion. (Is it coincidence that they live in a trailer park). Meanwhile elsewhere in America a woman finds it scam 'man and her friends in bed together. So, of course, call the American therapist Jerry Springer! I would talk about the rest of the movie but even thinking about the movie now giving me a headache. Jamie Pressly who plays the daughter looks totally unattractive to the movie. And remember Michael Dudikoff kicks the master karate master from the NIN American series? Well take a look at him now as a white garbage drink. The thing is it really looks too horrible and out of shape to call it "getting in touch with his charecter". And if your idea of ​​fun is to see Jerry Springer sing a country song on his own show or guys skating up and transvestites ... well ... Just watch the game show! ... at least steve was smart enough to stay out of this movie flick.
