This is even worse than the original game of death. A symbolized, instrumental storyline leads to "Billy Lo" falling into a helicopter in the ground below, killing her, as we are leaving to follow her little brother, Bobby Lo. So, not only do we start out after some Bruce Lee script, the movie kills the one and has us following another thirty minutes in the story. The main reason to look this one is when Bobby Lo fights a lion, which is quite obviously a guy in a lion suit. Jang Lee Hwang is also the villain, who is usually very scary, but his screen time is significantly tiny. Mostly watch this with the original game of death because they're part of Bruce Lee's set box. It is not surprising to include Lee's finishing work. No one would buy them otherwise.
