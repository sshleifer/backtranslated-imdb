So you might read some of the comments posted on this movie, and you might think in yourself, "Huh. There was to be a bunch of RAVE REVIEWs posted on December 30." Funny things are, most of these reviews riot sounds like they are coming from the same person, or at the best of a small, coordinated group of "Open House" groupies. The truth, my friends, is that this film is really indisputable. Just because it's "independent" does not mean it becomes a free pass. If you're going to make a music, whether on movie or scene, whether on Broadway or in the local community playhouse, you should probably ensure that (a.) Your actors can sing, (b.) Actors you can dance, (c.) you have decent equipment, (d.) you have a well-written note, and (e.) you have meaningful lyrics. Even Anthony Rapp can not save this one. It's one of those unfortunate movie experiences that will where I actually felt deeply embarrassed for everyone involved.
