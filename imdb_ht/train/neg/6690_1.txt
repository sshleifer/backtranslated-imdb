I sit down watching this movie with my friends and very low expectations. My expectations were not near enough bar. I honestly could not say what this film genre was from her view, and if it was a comedy, the humor was completely missed. The plot was nonexistent and the act was horrendous. My friends and I managed to look about 30 to 40 minutes of this movie before we turn it off and promptly ask yourself the video store to take it back. I do not recommend this movie to anyone unless you're deliberately trying to watch the worst movie ever. I honestly do not know how this film lasted more than one day in the theater and in addition I can not understand why anyone would want to look at it, considering not only it's very worthwhile title, but also the lack of any famous actor / Actresses at his disposal. This review is not a joke and I honestly think this may be the worst movie ever to do. It's certainly the worst movie I've ever been to.
