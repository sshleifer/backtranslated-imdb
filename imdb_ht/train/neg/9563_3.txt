This injury is based on the ideas of the original 80 hits. It's set in the modern day as we see a base in Afghanistan found to be destroyed by a right-wing drone at the start. <br /> <br /> And exactly where the movie jumps the shark. UAVs are not armed. They might be but I do not think he's ever tried for real. We get to see the computer that has masterminded this operation, called R.I.P.L.E.Y. We are featured in "HACKER" Will Farmer (it's good at chemistry and electronics that does not make it a computer hacker) & his love interest, Annie) & Will's 1st attempt at hacking is not just a complete failure IP address He also logged in and Annie guessed who he was. We also meet Wills Moms who work for a chemical company. <br /> <br /> Wills take money from his bank neighbors (Mr Massude) is not a hack (he helped him set up the account), then we get a nod to the original movie where they decided to play Global Thermonuclear War & to play the Dead Code. The RIPLEY office track runs is NOT about Will, but on Massude's packet for all the evidence that was gathered was useless to Will. <br /> <br /> Exactly why RIPLEY closed Does the machine down is not explained (it's playing only an online game?) & also why it felt the need to have all the electricity in the entire block he lived in as well. Why a counter terrorist agency would see that as a solid target is highly questionable. As for RIPLEY to activate its mobile phone? I think not, it was not connected to the PC and the message would not play unless it actually answered the phone for having more "hacking" science there too. <br /> <br /> Agent RIPLEY arrives at Massude's house, takes him away & going to give an envelope that turns out to win a lot of money. Looking for the car plate that took Massude is not a "hack" as you never saw it break in the DMV computer. The RIPLEY agents who grab Dennis at the airport as he was looking for Is no authority to seize or hold him. Will's mother did not "steal chemicals & bio agents" either. And even if he did not have to arrest or hold Dennis. Patriots Act or not. <br /> I do not know why being worried being detained for any crime in Canada as a totally different country with different laws in the US. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The computer has gone naughty with all its actions against Will, her mother & Dennis was not sanctioned by a government agency. The phreak phone we see will make is the 1st show of any hacking skill in the movie, we also get a hack of RIPLEY that seemed too easy for such a powerful system. <br /> <br /> The guy who runs at Annie at the airport & was also watching them on the street had nothing to do with RIPLEY & the ridiculous notion that RIPLEY was able to track a cellphone underground such as stupid as the idea that a computer lips. Another reference to the original movie by Stephen Falken as the designer of the RIPLEY system replaces, the Joshua project. We discover that the "guy" that came in Annie is Falken (not played by the original actor Unfortunately) made his own death. We also get to see WOPR as "what will help" to beat RIPLEY and keep the same voice used back then. Falken & WOPR are destroyed too quickly after being used at all (the same blast should kill Will, Annie & the Russian. It's also easy to create an independent computer system that has the ability to nude or drop chemical weapons on land to operate from .. All the scheme of "decontamination" scheme & ideas are totally unbelievable.These types of orders would have to go to the President or Joint Chief of Staff. So, yet another stirred & incredible idea. The hacks against RIPLEY are not done by Will, it's just contacting one of his friends who suggests & applies the idea. It's too ridiculous that would get a login just to increase the RIPLEY's operating temperature. a backdoor in Ripley (especially after it was blown in bits) is an incredible kick-out and a very desperate writer who screamed to have left and wanted to get this movie over and done with. > There is a good place where RIPLE is playing Dead Code and we see a countdown (it says 17 minutes) then RIPLEY says "the decontamination 30 minutes ", how crap is that when they can not even keep up with their own clock? RIPLEY's attack against Philadelphia stood (far too easy in my opinion) and decided to attack Joshua in his internal circuits and rocket reroutes aiming at a Philly in Washington where RIPLEY stationed. The idea of ​​nuclear exchange made RIPLEY to realize what he is doing will not work (surely he would already know if Joshua had initiated it as he had already learned this lesson in the original movie?) It is yet another nod to back in the original movie. <br /> <br /> Knife-out of having RIPLEY repeated Joshua exactly same word form at the end of the original movie just going to show how many original ideas could come up with. > <br /> If you want to point finger to bad & steal people's ideas to blame them Randall Badat & Rob Kerchner. This is a terrible movie and best avoided.
