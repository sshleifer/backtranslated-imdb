I saw the way this film came back to the first theater release, in a legitimate theater. Believe it or not, after decades of watching movies, this one still sticks clearly in my head as the worst movie of all time; or at least the worst that I would allow myself to look. <br /> <br /> The act is far below the standard set by any random group of high school slang yanked on the street and forced to learn the lines in 5 minutes or less. After the first trauma of disbelief, we laughed for a while as every new hit scene allowed. But after a while, even dubious fun was put in and he just had to be really sad.
