There's little here in the fantastic book Anne Rice that's here makes no sense. Some of the characters - intense and surprising characters - do not make it to the screen at all, and those who are watered down to the point that there's no reason for their existence. the relationship between Christophe and Marcel? Where's the affair proceed between Marcel and Juliet? Why Dolly Rose looks at all, since her story never explained? Where is the rape and redemption Marie, whose biggest attribute (and fall) is that she can spend for white - and her marriage to Richard? Why does the film end with Marcel's beat in her father's hand? We learn nothing at Aglae beyond that she is a bitch who hates her husband; why no backstory explaining this hate? <br /> <br /> As for their performance, no one is better than mediocre, though this is likely due to the disgusting script. The best of the many is that of the actor playing Richard - but Richard is not on screen enough to save the movie. Worst is Jasmine Guy as Dolly Rose, though again, he comes down to the actress has nothing to do with which little he has to work with. <br /> <br /> All in all, this is just awful. I thought it would be impossible for any Anne Rice book-turned movie to be worse than EXIT FOR EDEN, but BEST in all SAINTS to make that mess seems like a critical hit. How is it that rice is such a pig it will allow its best to become junk as on the screen?
