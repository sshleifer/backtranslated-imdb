The film begins with promises, but pockets too long in a sepia world of distance and alienation. We're leaving hanging, but with nothing much else save the depression shots of serious figures and pansy tastes to taste. Certainly not rode up the wall to help us climb over. It's a shame, because the concept is not merit. <br /> We are wondering why a loving couple - a father with no less - should be so alienated from the real world that their own world is preferable when clostrophob beyond imagination. The loss of the real world presence is, rather, too obviously and unnecessary, contrary to the son who has mobilized in the armed forces. Why not circus, so can we at least appreciate some color? We left with a gnawing sense of loss, but sadly no Enlightenment, which is baffled to give the movie is apparently on some form of accomplishment not available to us all.
