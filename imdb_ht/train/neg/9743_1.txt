With this line begins one funny, boring British sci fi movie. The Great Vorelli from the movie "Devil Doll" builds a teleportation car only to have his financing cut off by Blanchard, a man with a skinned tie for bow tie and big eyes. When his experience fails, the good doctor learns that Lembach, the man who controls all the awards in the world, will stay in London for a few days. He tries to project himself at home in Blanchard with the help of his laboratory assistant, Sheila. Needless to say something goes wrong and it winds up looking like a rat. The rest of the film is devoted to the good orange haired doctor walking around London shocking people who have her mutation but he puts a diaper on his face. Some more killings, some modest paperwork, and finally, the doctor disappears from where ever rats have faced doctors away. Fortunately, no one has decided to make an end.
