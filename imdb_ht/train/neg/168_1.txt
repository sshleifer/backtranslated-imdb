Despite a decent first-round event this series has never come close to achieving its potential. Set as a prequel to the original Star Trek series it ended almost from the start of an executive producer, Rick Berman, who felt obliged to artificially limit and construct the definition of what a series of "Star Trek" series could ( which made this increasingly anachronistic futuristic show from a dramatic way). The current runner show, Brannon Braga, did not help matters by re-importing and tired of epic treads before and overlooking the frenzy's internal mythology (it was painfully obvious earlier on being in it only for checks la). I've never seen a series of 'always doing bad in a cast of talented actors (Jolene Blaylock except) last long. It is as if this series was all produced in bubbles that exist outside the contemporary TV landscape where the audience (even a trek audience) is much more demanding and sophisticated in their desire for dramatic and desires. Unfortunately it looks as if Berman and Braga have succeeded in convincing the highest UPS of Paramount that "Enterprise" suffered from "fatigue franchise" and that its core audience did not walk away, but was driven in. Produces a quality offering that lives up to the high ideals and standards of its precedent and the (audience) will come. <br /> <br /> Simply put, in a TeeVee universe where we're giving shows such as "Battlestar: Galactica" and the "Shield" power-to-be must be given to the public to watch a "Star Trek" that measures up and it is dramatically competitive. It's just simple and easy.
