I had to take my nephew in this movie, as I did not think he was going to do well. Children, ages 6 and 10 have been placed on seeing it, so I caved. I must admit that it was not as bad as I thought, but it was still a far cry in the book. The movie seemed right on with the 10 year old's understanding and sense of humor. I found that the 6 years old understood what was going on it he presented the solution to the issues that took place. I eventually explained that sometimes movies do not show the best solutions to the problems because it is more fun to watch what happens if they make the "funny" or "choices" stupid.
