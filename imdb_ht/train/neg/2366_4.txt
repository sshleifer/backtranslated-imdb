I'm a fan of the Nightmare series but this is awful. Death is so trendy. If you've watched this 20 years later the whole Nintendo stage is outdated. I did like the flashbacks. I think they should just make a prequel on when he's still alive. It would be more interesting. This is a movie you can take or leave. Depending on how long you have.
