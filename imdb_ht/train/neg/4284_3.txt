Jason Lee's pies are back! If that's what you're looking for, look no further. If not, better move on ... <br /> <br /> But on the movie. Cliche glazed, some bad shot, but exotic fighting scenes (using JKD) and many bad actions and cheap effects. Poor Lee seems to be in pain throughout the film, and not surprised. It's not a nice comeback. The film does not even cut it as a B-movie - sure, had a blonde white rutger-wannabe bad guy guy, but no free sex scene or even one shotgun shotgun. None. Zip. Nada. Even in vessel 2 vessels have common sense included the required nudie scenes (as for the rest of my comments on this excellent piece of classical cinema excellence, please refer to our upcoming review on the end-soft end ...). I did get the feeling that the writer took revenge on someone and this - so I will not go into the "plot" of the movie or pretty much other related stuff. Except that it had some obnoxious non-heterogeneous, so 'nuff said. However, this movie has only one thing to go for - no Jean-Claude :)
