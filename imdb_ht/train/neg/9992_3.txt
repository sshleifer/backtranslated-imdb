Ah yez, the Sci Fi Channel produces Yeti another abominable movie. I was particularly taken by the scenes immediately after the crash where, as the survivors desperately searched for matches, at least half a dozen burnt burners ?? with no apparent reason? at various points in the wreckage. Fire seemed to be a predominant theme at all. They were digging lumps and matches, and finally found a box that built a fire every day for, apparently, 12, but no one was gathering wood. Then when the Vegan (HH) burns, what is it used for an accelerator? I mean these guys were frozen? well maybe not. Despite the apparent low temperatures low, the bleeding. Maybe it just me, but even in a totally incredible story (none of the survivors have ever heard of a yeti, or an abominable snowman, until the very end), if you take care of the little things big becomes more acceptable. Oh, what did the prolog (1972) have to do with the rest of the movie? With the revolver, warm enough to hold in his hands, froze up, it would not fire. Gimme a break. Well, at least we have Carly Pope, another eminently beautiful Canad Canad. And, with little irony, Ed Marinaro as the coach. <br /> Well I could as well add, the rabbit was fed (despite looking like chicken) is not a rat, but a lagomorph. Now, if it was a squirrel (or a rat) it would be a rat, but it still looks like chicken. And the writers lack a real chance to have someone note "It's just like that ..."
