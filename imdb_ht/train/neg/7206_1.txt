Well. Where to start. Let's just say that; avoid this movie at all <br /> expenses. It is based on a cartoon series. The movie makes the cartoon look <br /> like Hamlet. Full and hugged actors who seem embarrassed to be here, disgusting camera work, awful music, and adequate placement of products <br /> do you want to never visit Yahoo! again, this movie is really <br /> below in the barrel. For the New Yorker quote, Matthew Broderick and <br /> <br /> Rupert Everett mug the ways in this picture and abandon the gay <br /> of people who have spotted a rare species in the check the distance "They should pay us some of the millions earned for watching it."
