REALLY ??? <br /> I'm really surprised to see the glowing reviews here! <br /> <br /> This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. It's one great pathetic, seeds, cliche. I laughed loudly, and very much, but was on a date with a former military guy. I could not hide my other answer, BOREDOM. Yes, I think my date, a flat-line "good old boy", loved it. It's not a compliment. I know an actor wants to work ... Fine for the others. But Ralph comes on. <br /> It was a painful tease at Ralph. I voted a 2 only because Ralph was watching SO STUNNING. But I must argue, Ralph, how can you? And, why? <br /> I'm going to go to the end of the affair to recover and recover now .... C1
