Ah, bait. How do I hate you? Let me count these ways. 1. You try to be funny, but they are coral and unjoyable; Each joke is predictable and expected, and when it comes to, does not inspire laughter. Instead, I want to hurt. 2. You try to be dramatic but incredible; The woman releases a horrible degree, and "the bad guy" looks like Bill Gates, and is as frightening as well ... Bill Gates. (Just try to imagine Bill Gates trying to intimidate someone with a gun .. does not work, it? A lawyer, maybe, but not a weapon .. does not fit.) As for Jamie Foxx, well, just watching it, try to deliver a dramatic and sincere dialogue is funny and make me want to swing. 3. You try to be action-packed, but instead are dull and drag too many times. But when the action sank up, the tripod for the camera was lost, so the scenes were shaken more than those of the Blair Witch Project, and I found myself nauseated, and once again I want to hurt. 4. You try to make a good movie, but you fail, you FAILED, YOU FAILED! I prefer to walk barefoot across the Sahara with a full pack of beef and no water, no sunscreen, and only Meryl Streep for firms. This hell would be lovelier than a single minute more than watching everyone in Bait overacting their way through an idiotically written story with Bill Gates for a bad guy, and let's not even talk about the massive bomb that goes into a car that Jamie Foxx's character was just driving OFF A CLIFF, but somehow managed to escape ... just killing me right now, or doing the right thing with my promise that somehow I'll never have to watch a movie which is bad this, ever again.
