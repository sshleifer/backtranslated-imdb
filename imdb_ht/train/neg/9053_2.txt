Simply, I found the TV show "Mach" Trite, preachy, oh ever so "politically correct", repetitious, firefighter and biggest sin at all, and that is,? that it is (was) incredibly dull. You have Alan Alda as the main lead, "(star)", who is so in love with himself and his intelligence, that he actually makes me comfortable even try and sit in an episode. The original series was both McLean Stevson, and Wayne Rogers, whom I will happily admit there was a certain panache and style presentation style. However, Harry (Henry) Morgan, and Mike Farrell, both singly and composer sets are like eating caviar and fresh oats and Wonder Bread. Loretta Suites, which I also found dull, also no fault in her own was not a wonder of looking, and Gary Burghoff, who was good at the movie was tired looking and acting as the show was wearing so. Seeing a show a year showed me. Jamie Farr has just given "comedy low" film and it's not even worth mentioning here at all. The reason I did not give it a (one) rating, which anyone reading this by now would ask, is that the evaluation of any sort is not just a subjective but one relative. Television, except for some exceptions, is like crud. This relatively speaking, Mash had some quality output, (by standard TV) in this day today, and therefore it deserves of a two. Rob Knight
