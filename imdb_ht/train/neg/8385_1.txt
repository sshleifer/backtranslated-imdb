I've just realized that by watching this movie I've lost valuable precious moments in my life I will never get back. Thi film is not only poor to last. She reminded me of all black nut sitemap ever done. <br /> <br /> Flixmedia rows it a race problem, apparently "White" people do not like it because it does not have white actors. Mate, I think you'll find the reason why no one liked this was because watching dry paint is far more entertaining and funnier then this pile of drivel. <br /> <br /> Please stop doing crap movie
