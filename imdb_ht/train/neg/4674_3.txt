I do not know who blames, Miss Leigh or his director, but his performance as Catherine is almost impossible to watch. Ben Chaplin on the other hand does a superior job - against all odds as far as I'm concerned. Her character is entirely too good and appealing. but certainly does not show as greedy enough, to put up with Leigh's character's character. Chaplin appears accused by what can not be understood as Leigh's shyness and lack of grace, but rather his orthopedic goodbye. There were some elements of credibility of his interest, but as played it is incomprehensible. Performances are not jeeps. Maggie Smith and Albert Finney are, of course, wonderful despite their desperate efforts. Throwing in support is also a pleasure to watch. What a pity, too, leads them not to work together because the output is nice to look at.
