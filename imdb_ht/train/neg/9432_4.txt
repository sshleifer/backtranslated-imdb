"Unhinged" is one strange little movie, a forgotten slasher from the golden age of the genre. It's hard to really write a satisfying review of this movie simply because of the fact that the movie is so unique. It's plot is fairly late - three young women on their way to a rock concert get into a car crash and finish stranded into the castle of an old old woman and her spinster daughter. Very well, the ladies realize something is not quite right when they hear chicken evenly and noises from the attic. On top of that, the mother and daughter seem to have a very, very strange relationship, as they encounter intensely in front of their houseguest at dinner. The old mother even goes as far as calling her daughter a whore and pig and accusing her of sneaking at night to sleep with them. Half of the movie, when a girl finally decides to better wander to get help, the killing begins. <br /> <br /> As far as the act goes, this movie is at the bottom of the barrel. NON of the three girls blocked can act, particularly the "lead" girl. It is almost incredible to listen to the lines of the same, wooden tones throughout the movie. Mom and daughter are better, but not much. The film is also quite dull in part and really, really shooter. The killings are rude, but nothing we have ever seen before. However, as mentioned here, the movie really gains points and it's brilliantly disturbing and gory unfinished. It comes totally to the left and has the same shock value as the classic camp "Sleepaway Camp." Unfortunately, the rest of the film is a do and suffers from current horrendous and boring, boring gatherings. Isolated, climbing the castle and the darkness, flashing lighting gives the film a realistic green, but this is quickly breaking when one of the characters attempts to act. It can be worth it if you can stick it out to the end, but I say you're best just fast transferred to the last 10 minutes. 4 out of 10
