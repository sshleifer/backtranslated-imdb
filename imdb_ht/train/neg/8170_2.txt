A friend and I went to a few phases (lots of) years ago in choosing the crappest horror movies in the video store for an evening entertainment. For some reason, I ended up buying this (probably v. Cheap). <br /> <br /> The cheap synth band is a classic of its time and genre. There are also a few very fun scenes. Among them is a scene where a person was attacked and defend himself with a number of unpleasant objects, he made me laugh at the moment (does not seem quite so funny in retrospect but there you go). From the fact that it's total crap, your mind. But probably worth a look if you like films like "Mall off". Yes, I saw it too.
