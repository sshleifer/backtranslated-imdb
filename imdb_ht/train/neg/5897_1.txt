Akime Japanese director Takashi Miike can not seem to find the moving wheels with this soldier thriller, an adaptation of the book Yasushi Akimoto regarding a bad old woman (and abusive children!) Which is part of a new urban legend: If your cell phone ring with a strange tone - and you see the 'One Missed Call' message - you'll replay the message only to hear your own final word before dying. The most successful part of the movie is the satelite satire of TV reality television hackers on the future victims, but the deaths are not elaborate (including a hidden piece of red candy!) They are irritating and dispiriting. The frequent shots of corpse corpse actually appear rather unobtrusive, and this polite general power is the reason why the film is finally so solid. Hollywood prediably jumped on the far-sought scheme in 2008, yet the US version packed no better. NO STARS from ****
