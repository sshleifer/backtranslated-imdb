Possible horrendous George Sanders car where he went from being a thief to the police. <br /> While Sanders was an excellent character actor, it was certainly no one who brought this film to prove it. /> It's absolutely beyond sort. Gene Lockhart gave some funny relief until a moment of anger led him to fire his weapon and tragedy caused. Unfortunately, George Sanders and co-stars Carol Landis commit suicide in real life. After doing a movie like depleting as that, it's not shocking. The usual appeal to Signe Hasso is really nothing here.
