As a Southern Baptist, he paints me that I must give a rating below a Christian film average. There are certainly not so many that I want to discourage film-makers from a genuinely under-exploited genre. Still, I must honestly say that "Enjoy Loving Joy" is a budget low, low key, self-conscious Christian movie. The plot is predictable, mediocre in acting (I'm kind), and correction. As a TV movie he might have been slightly higher than average, but as a feature film he leaves much to be desired. Keep trying guy. You've got to have a movie about on real Christian inside you somewhere. Can I suggest you visit G. K. Chesterton or C. S. Lewis for some inspiration?
