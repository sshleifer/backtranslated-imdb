This film feels depressed. At each stage of the film's maximum number of actors on the screen is like 10. Because everything was shot in front of a blue screen never really any expense and the movie just feels weird. ACTING HORRIBLE! It is so obvious this was in front of a blue screen because every stage of action you can see the actress / actress asks around half to run when they should run for their lives .. Look at the floor for the brands ... <br /> <br /> Spoilers: Also you will find yourself hitting yourself watching the movie. At one point in the Captain Sky's home base there are as 100 airplanes sitting on the airstrip. They have advanced warning of an upcoming attack ... So, what do they do? There is nothing. All of the jets get blown and again the only person fighting back is Captain the Sky ... <br /> <br /> The whole world is under attack and it is the only person ever to fight back. At the very end of the movie you see hundreds of plainly taken in the end ... but what they do? Nothing ... the movie is over ...
