When I saw the forecasts for this movie, I did not expect much to begin with - around a movie movie second teen. But wow, this movie was absolutely awful. And this is being generated. <br /> <br /> First of all, the casting for the film was awful. You feel no sympathy (or for that matter any morbid feelings) for the characters. The act was so awful that I was just simply waiting and hoping for the things God-terrible at the end. Secondly, there are points in the film that have absolutely no relation to the plot as well. Can someone please explain to me why the girlish-girl boyfriend starts to scream "PANCAKES !!!" at the top of his lungs while going to Jackie Chan moving I've never seen before, and even more biting the guy who has the virus? Why does the dad of the kid continue to get upset with the infected virus guy, and go on a hunting ax spree hunt to get it? I left with a feeling of confusion and my utter negligence literally said aloud, "Where did hell come from?" I just simply could not believe what I saw. I really thought I had seen some bad movies, but I said that Kabin Fever themselves all. This movie makes me want to fuck and then fuck again. Then blow my brain out. <br /> <br /> Please save yourself an hour and a half and do something more productive. Watching grass grow, maybe a suitable alternative.
