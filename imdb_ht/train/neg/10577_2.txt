Some of the filmmakers who are participating in this series have made some films really great but they make sure they do not show much skill with this series. Particularly the writing. Ok, the first season was a bit better but these new episodes created just stink. I'm a big fan of horror and in my opinion the vast majority of these episodes are total garbage. There is nothing new or really interesting. Some of them are visually creative. It's just typical to manufacture Hollywood crap, refreshing, childish, wrong design and in some cases, flattened out. Much like Account from the only cryptic good thing this set has to offer is great nudity! Other then this series of challenging courses. I get the impression sometimes that a lot of people in the eighth grade have been writing these episodes. Maybe they did.
