Veteran sleazeball Bruno Mattei is in it again with this erotic thriller that clearly echoes Joel Schumacher's 8MM. But, as expected, Mattei makes his film on a Miniscule Budget - so it's already dark when it's just released. <br /> After her daughter gets kidnapped, a mother enters the dark world of underground pornography, because the kidnappers belong to an international organization that smiles directly as long as customers are besides paying well. The research for her daughter not only leads the mother across Europe, but also in prostitution. She goes to bed with some guys getting her clue. When it finally came to contact with lead the brown organization by the dead physicians, he came to great danger. There is not much good to say about this one, even if it starts promising. Problem is that the film is not far away as sleazy or explicit as one might expect from the director who made films like VIOLENT BLADE. SNUFF TRAP (which was first released in Russia!) It's neither gory enough nor it has the amount of dark and gender really to keep the viewer's attention. The plot is not special either, except perhaps for many amazing places in Europe. The finish is hugely disappointing. The act is not really remarkable either, except for Anita Auer who plays the doctor in front: It looks like acting very crap. You do not want to meet her like this in a dark go (or bedroom, for that matter). <br /> <br /> All in all, SNUFF TRAP only appeals to collectors of Bruno Mattei's film. But it's good to see the man back on the helm again: It was his first comedy since 1994 at giallo GLI OCCHI DENTRO.
