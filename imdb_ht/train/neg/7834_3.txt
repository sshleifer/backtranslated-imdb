I usually do not write reviews but I can not understand why this is rated so high and wanted to give a horror hate warning since I can only assume that all of these high ratings were provided by average TV Watchers. <br /> <br /> I only looked at the first two bits but the two were so shiny, it was not even funny anymore. even the old stories you've probably seen / read a couple of times already - living toys, evil things out of other dimensions ... and not just that these stories are not innovative, they even Also they are very bad versions of clich√©. I prefer, e.g. "chucky" and "silent hills" on two episodes at any time. and they do not even ask about the visual effects ... the ones in the first episode are well but the ones in the second ... terrible. looks like some of the student's film projects go wrong. without ... or gore ... erm ... nothing worth mentioning. <br /> It might be interesting for some old year olds who probably did not see that many scary stories again (although I'd rather recommend "beyond belief" - now that's what I call a TV shows decent). but for an adult horror fans is worthless. I only gave 3 points because there are some nice movies (especially in the second episode) and some nice acting.
