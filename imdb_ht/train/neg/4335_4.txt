The movie and acting is not bad with Jay Hernandez doing a good job playing Calito Brigante, but the movie is supposed to be a prequel to a hit movie. The markers of this prequel clearly did not look Carlito's original way or at least did not care about continuity. This movie is a prequel that means the original film has already put out some stories for us and this movie should end the original place to start or at least lead to it. Not one of old old Carlito's friends from the original makes an appearance in this movie, they do not even mention. Luis Guzman, Pachanga of the original, is in the movie but plays a completely different character. The original takes place in 1975 and the prequel takes place in 1969-70. Considering this film takes place less than 5 years earlier, do you not think one of Carlito's long-time friends would make an appearance? In the original, Carlito starts out being released from prison after spending five years in prison. This is just one month from the end of the prequel and the beginning of the original! *** Semi Spoiler *** We know from the beginning of the original, Carlito has spent 5 years in jail so when the prequel gives us this Hollywood happy ending it in an insult to the intelligence of fans of the original. What happens to Gail? It's the lack of continuity that made this movie go straight to video release.
