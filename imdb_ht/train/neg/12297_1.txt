Witchy Hildegard Knef catches a group of people in an isolated hotel and chooses them one by one of the twisted, disgusting ways. I thought I would see it all until an unfortunate man here is nailed to cross and then has himself set on fire. Hildy is quite the prankster too: he takes a harpy edge and sews his mouth shut ... then hangs himself down to the fireplace just in time for a roaring fire! "Witchery" made me sick. It made my eyes hurt. I was ready to write it in as the worst movie ever-ever made by anyone otherwise competent ... until the final. I must admit I like the finish. It involves a boy and his tep-archive corner by Linda Blair fantasyly owned. The scene only lasts for about a minute and the movie over, but you know that old saying, "If you've got a great finish, people will be forgiven for just about anything!"
