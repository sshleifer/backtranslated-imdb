The producers of this film offer to pay funeral expenses for anyone dying in great fright while watching this movie. They should have offered intensive psychotherapy for anyone who really enjoyed this stinker. A young couple moved to a house, where a woman who looks like the woman from the couple lived. Very boring, and very predictable. At the end I ended up not caring about anyone in this movie. <br /> <br /> Avoid this one at all costs.
