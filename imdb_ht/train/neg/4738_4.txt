I liked watching Azumi's original and mixing it in live action manga, simple stories, cool sounds, led (Kitamura rock!), Corrections, and not to mention the beautiful Uya Aya that filled the party perfectly. So I was really looking forward to seeing Azumi 2, but after finally seeing it I felt like I won the Lotto and lost the ticket :( Azumi 2 chooses where azumi leaves off, however these are completely 2 Different movies, a lot slower, the action is not as interesting and as good choreography and there is not much of character development. This was apparently directed by the same guy responsible for further reducing the value of the TOHO Monster Franchise (if this is possible!) I agree with some other recent reviews that this was a lost opportunity If only Ryuhei Kitamura continued with this installment.There are however some nice Japanese scenery to look at while the action is slowly unfolding and we they feature all too little little characters who quickly find their killing .. Even the real bad guys, get killed in too easy without too much of a fight. The fight with the spider guy (straight from a The monkey episode!) In the bamboo forest was on the eaves and memorial battles scene Wheras of Azumi 1 we had a climactic battle scene with barrel camera effects, Azumi 2 made us Cam Azumi Cape! Azumi rampage at the end was compelling, but Aya always does a harsh job. It looks great in Cape ... but where did he find it in? I do not think I'll look this one over and over again! ... that a pity.
