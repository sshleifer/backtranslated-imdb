Very a movie of their time - very long sequence with no dialogue, bad ref√®back, and an almost totally cast cast. The two women appear to have a total of under 10 lines and exist only as romantic interest for men. <br /> <br /> O'Toole is riveting every time he speaks; unfortunately, it spends much of its time peering in the shrub. Alastair Sims is always happy to see her, too, is terribly underused. The film has another positive aspect, in which it depicts many aspects of British fascism and fascist sympathy (such as the casual appearance of the Mosley Graffiti) that many today today are unaware of. Too many of today's film about WWII paintings are all-good and the All-wrong Ax, when history tells us people are far more complicated than that! <br /> This should be a good movie for when you are recovering from the flu and bundled on the couch and can not absorb anything too complex. If you just need something to spend the time while your electrolyte stabilizes, this is the movie for you.
