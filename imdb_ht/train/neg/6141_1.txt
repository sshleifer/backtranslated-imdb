One night I was waiting for my friends back to the apartment and "Gymkata" happened to be on; I look too much in it. It is indeed hilarious, and terrible, really. Think about it this way - if at work you had an idea for something bad and went to execute it in as horrible a fashion like this, how long did you last? Not as long as this movie. It is a must-see, obviously.
