In one respect, it's like the 'Oz Wizard', and Paris in black-and-white and the Riviera in color. But it's supposedly about posing love, destructive and decadent moral, while actually being on designer robbers, shots in the Riveria, lots of expensive cars, and music and dancing interludes that suggest Vincent Minnelli on one of his days them. Approval, but a remarkable example of desperate, dark pattern material and glitzy style titles in opposite directions. (Was this model for the Ripley Mister Talented? Does anyone have sense of anonymity between Jean Seberg and Matt Damon?)
