This film is very awful, but I have some interesting information about it: it was filmed in 1976 at the Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, AZ, as well as at Oak Creek Canyon near Sedona, AZ. A good bulk of the extras in the movie is then-drama students from NAU. I was a ninth year, minor in the theater, but for some reason I did not participate in the production. I've been told that several people have been able to give this fact rather odd: There is a scene from this movie where two of the principal, as part of their favorite ceremonies, must be naked in Woods. They see in the back of the movie, doing just that. The thing is, these are not the actors at all, but two guys I knew from the theater department. The identity of these "stunt posters" will remain anonymous, at least on this website, unless they decide to, "reveal" themselves!
