The plot of the Thinner is decidedly thin. And british. An obese obsession lawyer on the gypsy woman, and the gypsy curse causes her to lose and lose weight ... in the bone. OK, Gypsy's curse should be fun, but weight-losing goes bad? Nope. Except Stephen King thinks that. And Michael McDowell, other horror authors and screenwriting in this movie abysmal, do so, too. The lawyer is not just criminally criminal, it is also fat, haha! The decline is like an immature piece of crap for somebody who moans as he / she has never seen anything so disgusting than fatigue. Hey, I can only say: Well, look at the mirror.
