Two old buddies are sent to Japan to get back to a genetic search of videotapes, which are stolen by the black ninjas adapted to the start of the movie. First they just have to learn some ninja skills, because "ninja can only beat the ninja." <br /> <br /> Sakura Killer is trying hard to be enjoyable Ninja-flicking movie, but fails seriously. The entire movie is just so hollow and predictable that hard to say anything good about it: Even the drawings that have been seen in different variations dozens of times before, the characters are too briefly drawn, direction is dull and script does not offer anything surprising, even in The stage ends, which does not itself decrease (garbage) value. <br /> <br /> Even the 80-ninety-flickering movie-fan, who understands the aesthetics of waste cinema, is hard to find this movie even barely enjoyable. It simply does not offer anything new to the viewer, neither at the visual level nor in the draw. The Shurikens cast and the fourteen swingers, but it's not enough to lead the movie direction it's meant to be with the same backdrop as scene fighting numbs even the most expansive viewer after the first 30 minutes. It is difficult to recommend films for anyone. Even the Franco Nero's performance of the "Ninth Entry" falls behind the American-ninjas Sakura Killer. Even in the visual level film there are no balls and it's waste in time to try to find any big scene battle in this movie: No. In all, one of the ninja-most ninjas, I've ever seen. Not interested in curiosity. Believe me on this one. <br /> Â½ out of 10.
