Set in a post-apocalyptic environment, cyborg led by job warlord re-on the human population. They are basically caught up as animals, just as they need fresh human beings to live there. Nea and his brother managed to survive one of the attacks when he was a kid, and years have passed when he came face-to-face with cyborgs again, but this time he was saved by the Cyborg Gabriel , who created to destroy all cyborgs. Job and his men are on their way to take a hugely populated city, while Nea (and revenge on yourself) pleaded Gabriel to train him in the way to kill Cyborg and he will get him to Gabriel. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> interesting. Very small structure makes its way into the threadbar story, as the turgid script is weak, blown and survived. The lead prohibition tries to be witty, but it's pretty much stinking and coming across were funny in the unintentional moments. Most of the actions are very stupid and routine. The material could be used by another Polish up, as it was an inspired idea swallowed up by lazy inclusions, lack of a narrative and almost jokey tone. The open conclusion, cliffhanger conclusion is just too abrupt, especially since an end has yet to be done. Make it feel like what runs out of money, saying "Time to pack up. Let's finish it on another day (or maybe in another decade) .There is no hurry." However he found it rather distraught, thanks to its fast-speed speed, some well-executed combat and George Mooradian's movie cinema that captured the band's visually captured. Their performance is fair. Kris Krisofferson's Christ of Crisis and Character works perfectly like Gabriel and a self-assured, partially capable Kathy Long pulls on demonstrations expertise with aggression. However it acts too wild. An Mugging Lance Henriksen provides a mouth-watering performance in Ham, most, like fighter witch leader who constantly has a salivary meltdown. Scott Paulin also drums up gleefulness as one of the Cyborgs and Gary Daniels pouts on as one too. Pyun strikes up some exciting martial arts art pieces, involving some flashy and sluggish slow-motion vigor. Drying in the background is a burning but mechanical sounding music. Special effects and make-up FX stand fine enough. Look, but not quite a success with its minimum limit can be a reason for that.
