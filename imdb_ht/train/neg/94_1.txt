ZOMBI CHRONICLES <br /> <br /> Aspect ratio: 1.33: 1 (Nu-View 3-D) <br /> <br /> Also format: Mono <br /> <br /> Also looking for a (literal ) The city's ghost in the middle of nowhere, a young reporter (Emmy Smith) chooses a grizzled hitchhiker (Joseph Haggerty) who tells her about the story involving animal meat-grass recognized in the haunted area. An ABSOLUTED waste in time, hobbled from the beginning by Haggerty's performance to romantic performances in a key role. Worse still, the two stories that make up the bulk of the running time are absolutely routine, made worse by indifferent performance and substandard direction by Brad Sykes, who has already been responsible for the likes of CAMP BLOOD (1999). This is not a movie 'fun' in the sense that Ed Wood movies are 'fun' (he, at least, believe in what he did and was sincere in his efforts, despite a lack of talent); Their home cinematic films are, in fact, aggravated, boring and almost completely devoid of any redeeming virtue, and most viewers will feel upset and annoyed by these unimaginable, malignant junk. The 3-D format is completely wasted here.
