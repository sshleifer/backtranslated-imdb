Stanley Kramer directs a thriller action and leaves out of the key things: action and emotions. The DOMINO Principle features Gene Hackman as a convict person in prison to perform some mysterious tasks. Richard Widmark, Edward Albert, and Ella Wallach are the opponents - they are presumably working for the government, but that, as most of the line draws the film, has never been made clear. Hackman asked a lot of questions that never got the answer to the movie going absolutely nowhere. While it strives to be like motion nights and look at PARALLAX, the DOMINO principle mixes up ambiguity and mystery and confusion with boredom. The movie is very good photo but even that works against it. The direction Kramer is devoid of any style. It's a very sunny movie! <br /> <br /> The act is fine and hackman proves it is pretty much incapable of being bad. Widmark and Wallach are nasty embarrassing and Albert is well cast as the evil villain castley. Even the obnoxious Mickey Rooney is very good as Hackman's sidekick. One of the oddities however is deposited in Candice Bergen as Hackman's wife. We said he had made time in prison and it seemed trying to put on some sort of sidewalk. Kramer's idea to make it appear for trailer trash is to put a brownish wig. It is a better fit for the likes of Valerie Perrine or Susan Tyrell.
