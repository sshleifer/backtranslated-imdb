I do not know much about Tobe Hooper, or why he gets his name in the title, but maybe he should not be bothered. As another comment mentions, there is not really enough horror or eroticism to bring in fans of genre either. The draw is incoherent, the Sade sequences are free, and most of the acting is so-so. Englund made its best with weak materials, and Zoe trilling has a really big bottom, but neither is enough to bring this movie. That's one of a tapes-on. Grade: F
