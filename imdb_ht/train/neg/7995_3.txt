I remember watching this movie when I was young, but I could not remember the title for her then going to my horror movies to find her and thinking myself "who is the title?" This movie is a kind of movie film combination film / film attack and fewer remarkable stars in it. It's also a bit boring too, as it has its TV vibe where you can see the film fade out for advertising with these. The plot has this sort of resort being invaded by ants. I think they were a bit disturbed by construction or something going on nearby, but do not quote me about that. The most memorable assault for me in the whole flick was the first one involving the kid who fell into the swim swimming pool after swarmed and in the course of the summer scene as well. What else that stands out from this one is very jump to where the survivors use the cardboard sift tube. At the end even though most movie movies this movie is very tame and not very scary at least unless you panic the ant's face.
