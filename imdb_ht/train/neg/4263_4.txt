Enjene movie. Performances of weak actors. Together they are good, could be better. The story is also weak. The sequel battles are terrible. Sound and movie types are trashy. The story of Kazakh people has been said very badly. This film should include more Kazakh actors, in the leading role. And also should be in Kazakh language. Kuno Bekker and Jay Hernandez are Spanish backgrounds. I did not find it. Since Hispanic people play the Turkic-Mongolian people. This movie is ashamed of movies. Rustam Ibragimbekov wont me. It is one of the finest filmmakers in the world. Director Czekh is excited, since he is not the nomadic origin, he can not know the real spirit and the nomadic history.
