I saw the Crispin Glover "What is it?" at the Ann Arbor Film Festival. Admittedly, the movie was at least just called, because I got the different meaning that even the writer / director can give no answer. In the question and answer session after screening, Mr Glover said that the movie was originally meant to be a short film to show the virtue of using actors and down-syndrome. However, this is in itself not enough of a reason to create a movie. The actors, in my opinion, built blocks for a larger vision - a major vision that seemed to hurt at best and absent at worst. <br /> <br /> Crispin Glover also said he wanted to address taboo subjects. Well, it does. But why? The film looks like no position, no reason to address anything. Does it feel things should not be taboo? The movie does not even give me an indicator of that. Taboo for taboo relief is not interesting. It can not even afford to make the taboo disturbing or encouraging on any level because it has not been cared for by audiences in any way. <br /> <br /> Ignore issues with the concept for a moment, the thing that actually shocked me most was how wrong the movie was put together. Editing, cinema, and other technical aspects seemed often to be very amateur. Glover said 125-150 thousand dollars went into the movie, and I felt that the money would have been spent on different designers (Glover actually made some design itself - I know I've seen at least sound design of the credits) . The paintings that are painted are okay (not great), but they are used incorrectly. Party feels like a picture scene picture - that would be fine if it was going to any sort of purpose, but from the Glover it just feels sloppy. Other parties are filmed as a sort of home movie, in kind of inferior to a lot of things I see first-time filmmakers doing on iMovie. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the biggest problem with "What is it?" I can not even understand how badly the movie should take. Some parts feel like Glover is screaming at you thinking seriously. At other points, he looks down on his own joke. Maybe it meant for this to be ironic, or meaningful in some ways, but I just felt that Glover could not even get himself to his movie any kind of serious attention. <br /> <br /> Glover said he wanted it to be a short film. If only he was. In seventy two minutes, the film runs out of imagery and ideas of the first twenty, and it is argued whether the ideas were formulated enough to claim that they were the same for the period of time.
