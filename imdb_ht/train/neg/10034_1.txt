If there is one movie that is the worst of this year- it's TASHAN's first promotion gave an indication that the movie will be a Dhoom 2 boring film style, and well I knew first only it would be a bad movie it maybe because of it was a Yashraj movie or maybe see the cheesy promo but this movie gave me a shock, it was even worse then Dhoom 2 and what I expect the first Saif introduction that is boring then a, Saif-Kareena meets, Kareena is so artificial and then Anil Kapoor o God, what is she doing in a strange movie? What kind of role is it? What act does he do? His first scene is okay but then his law becomes repetitive and he overacts then became Akshay who gave some beautiful scenes, but then the movie became more boring and the obsolete childhood romance , overdose of scene scene Rajnikant style scene with all boring scene Fini is another joke <br /> <br /> Vijay Krishna Acharya would have 3 more direct films, if this film worked, thats the strategy of yashraj, only money is nothing else so Vijay is another addition to the list of music magic cremers (Vishal Shekhar) is typical <br /> <br /> Performance Akshay Kumar comes in the movie as a whiff of fresh air actually giving some moments to engage Saif Ali Khan is irritating, Kareena is equally bad to Anil Kapoor carethral to scratch and spoil the even more remainder show is okay
