I actually went to see this film in a theater, but what a complete waste of time and money! Bad act, I'm sorry to say, did not help to enjoy this rather sticky scenario. <br /> <br /> Some friends have told me to go and see this movie, since James Redfield, the author of the book, was very heavily involved in the scenario. They really liked the book, so the movie just had to be perfect. Well maybe I was hoping I got a bit too high, but I absolutely hated this movie! It was predictable, too sweet at one point that I actually let myself have had to vomit and worst of all there will be an end! Will the world favor and stop this abusive crusade.
