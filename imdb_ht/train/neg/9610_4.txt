In Hollywood in the 1930's and 1940, I think every studio can do a west, except Warner Bros. The few times they tried, it's still ridiculous (except, perhaps, to die with the boots on - which is a western rider.) I read that Humphrey Bogart, James Cagney sewn with this big cowboy hat on his head, was say it looks like a mushroom. True! Cagney and Bogart are too urban, too XX century to be credible in a western film. The story here was no surprise, and it did not help. Every 10 minutes, I figured I could see Bogart and Cagney drop their little guns and put the hand in a machine gun to get to the series of a 1930's car.
