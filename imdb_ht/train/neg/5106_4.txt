Alien Love (As This Movie is Known In Great Britain) is a very unusual movie. I do not mean that it is a film movie esoteric movie in the style of Peter Greenaway or Derek Jarman, I mean it is a TVM and swearing, sex, some really good T & A, a bad script and a very retro feel . You can imagine someone like John Hughes who ruled the ten years earlier, though of course it would cut out the T & A <br /> Go back to the bad script, one of the issues is that some of the characters They have any kind of motivation especially Amanda. Why did he pick up Connie in the coffee shop? Just so he could meet an alien? Do you see what I mean about retro? ET, CIRCUIT KOUT and a whole lot of other movies from the mid 1980s had this type of plot and most of them were much more defining and convinced than the one seen here. The scenario will continue to follow a definite ill, unconvincing and logical pathway <br /> <br /> That said I found ALIEN LOVE look and not just down to T & A on display. As a sex-sex comedian she's better than FLESH GORDON and GIRLS EARTHE EASY
