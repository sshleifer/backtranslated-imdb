I wanted to like this movie, yes it's a saW, blah blah blah ripoff but i like those movies. If done well, there was all the ingredients for being a good, not brilliant, but good movie .... unfortunately these ingredients went there! The act was terrible, and this was first seen when the prisoners were introduced with one capture by one (Hood Removal), the remarks with a covering material are just awful, yes I know, bad writing. .. but this is more than that, it was bad writing coupled with bad acting. Two of the prisoners were in a relationship with each other and did not even recognize this until a lot more in the movie ..... <br /> <br /> Sorry, Im even wondering why I'm mined to review this movie at all. <br /> I'll end up with moths, moths MORE & MORE bold holes! DISAPPOINTING!
