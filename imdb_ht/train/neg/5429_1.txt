The movie begins with a beautiful song looks like a thriller, and Arbaaz Khan is walking around in a suspicious way, but then suddenly we are forced to a comedy With the idiots idiots routine like GOLMAAL and Tusshar, Sharman, Kunal and Rajpal act like grown child Scene is quite funny first and then get boring There is a booty sub bored of Tanushree's brother being killed At the end of the film trying to get serious and the villain kidnapped our hero, but here he gets even stupid then a long bashing bashing climax out of HERA PHERI and wait, there is also a long chase in the payle house <br /> The movie is so boring that it makes you fall sleeping <br /> <br /> Direction by Prihian is very bad music (Pritam) is routine except the first song <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Rajp Yadav is good at his first stage where he goes to pay his rent and I was happy that the actor is not loud and s you the head like other films but no, it gets itself usual and gets disappointing most of the times Tusshar should not speak in a movie, calling it is terrible Sharman is the saving save, he is the sole actor which acts very well in this movie Kunal Khemmu tries hard in his first comic movie as an adult, but does not impress much Tanushree is as bad as always Arbaaz Khan gets less scarce and is usual Payal is a non-Murly Sharma actress terrible
