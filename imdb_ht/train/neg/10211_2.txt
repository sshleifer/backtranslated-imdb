Except for recognizing some nice cinematography, I can hardly say anything positive about this movie. The only real problem is the protagonist's dilemma whether to stay with his childhood friends in the world of misery or leave them and take his own life. Pleasant "emotionally powerful scenes" do not go and draw this, and, because of the bad act, they also fail to create the intended atmosphere. The director only managed to present Anthony's dilemma and eventually bring an easy solution. Characters do not seem to evolve, although it's difficult to talk about any character ... maybe except for Sonny. In addition, the actors do not get to play a lot and when some of them have them come off as romantic self-esteem. I wonder what lost the movie much more: the superficial script, throwing away all the potential of the draw, or the bad act, disturbing any call that might leave.
