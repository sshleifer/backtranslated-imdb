I have no idea how anyone managed to stay awake during this show. The act was com-fisted with amateur, the story was old news, and draw drawings (or lack thereof) has always had my eyes less than half of every episode. That's all to say in it, because it really misses the substance of any kind. <br /> <br /> How can you man like crap like this? It's frisky stupid, it's a crap of intelligence. I do not even know how to explain it more ... It's as if some of you will fix mindlessly in junk like this only because you like the way some of the actors watch, or because, for whatever crazy reason, The same mechanisms of dozens show a million times before. <br /> I just .. forget it. This show sucks, and fortunately it goes forever. I wish they would find work on demolishing O.C. once for all.
