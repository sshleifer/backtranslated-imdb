I must admit that I have kept this one few times on the USA Network. There's just something about it, well, sheer absolute in this movie flick that makes me want to watch it every time it's over. Yes, you have the right to sub-the act, the scheme that was only a seven year old can love, etc. But I can not help feeling sympathetic toward some of the actors. Then again, a few of these actors have signed up for the more atrocious end.
