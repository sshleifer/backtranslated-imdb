I agree with all the above who said anything that will convince you not to waste even a briefing at the moment watching this movie amazingly obsessively. Very poor acting, evaluating production value, pedestrian direction, and a so inept and inhuman clone that should never be written, let alone produce. Even Hollywood "professional" apparently goes to work just for a check, although no one should pay for this bad job. Careers should instead have ENDED on this inconsistent drivel. <br /> <br /> OTHER, there is something fascinating about watching something so jaw-droppingly bad. And Chad Lowe is terrific and always bad.
