Every time in a while while a movie is coming together will be so awful that I feel obligated to warn people. If I work all my day and I can save one soul from watching this movie, how great will my joy. Where to start my discussion about pain. For starters, there was a musical fit every five minutes. There was no character development. Each character was a stereotype. We have sworn guys, fat guys who feed donuts, goofy foreign guys, etc. The script felt as if it were written as the movie was shot. The production value was so incredibly low that it felt like I was watching a high junior video presentation. Do directors, producers, etc. ever see a movie before? Halestorm will get worse and worse with each new entry. The concept for this movie sounded so funny. How could you go wrong with Gary Coleman and a handful of some legitimate actors. But trust me when I say this, things go wrong, very wrong.
