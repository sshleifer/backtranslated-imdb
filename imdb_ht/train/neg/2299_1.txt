Before I start ... let me say that I completely believe in God. I believe in Heaven and Hell. Home now that comes out of the way, I just want to say that what's in the world doing those morons that call themselves "the hosts" think they're doing? The last time I checked an army not to discriminate, hate hatred on television, or try to drink their own beliefs down every unfortunate soul that is the channel's initiative. ALI of those crazy, idiotic, conservative, impossible Bibles, Fred Phelps lover Pat Robertson performed daily. I'm all for free speech, but since doing so cover a guy who is pretty much saying that if you venture into his ideal way of life is far off in hell? This is just a perfect example of why religions are the cause of so many problems. One day in my classroom we had a substitute teacher so we decided to watch some TVs since teaching did not give us any work. And we (against many of us are) watching the 700 Club, and of course that dipping was not about ranting and raving about the Bible, and saying Simon on the lines of "God says homosexuality is a sin" and I actually hear a kid go "Hmm i guess it is right." WTF ??? Seriously, if the host tries to make people think that someone else's sexual orientation is a great sin, then they are seriously needed to take the army, tape adhesive, and throw them off in a cruise liner in the middle of the arctic.
