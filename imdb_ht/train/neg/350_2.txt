The performances of Fishbourne (which seem strange to somehow seemingly) and (short featured) Ed Harris are remarkable, unlike the Connery that does not appear to find the essence of his role and ends up in the motor behavior of a 80yr person old. In fact, the scenario does not make sense; Imagine a 60 min. happy ending-plotting a sudden turnaround without any argumental structure in respect of the characters. It is more an accident than a scenario and may be good for school-writing screening purposes. The more you recall the most details of this impression becomes. The capital punishment is not a problem here, although it is a subject from the beginning; it sort of disappear without further comment. Topics-matter and environment could be good.
