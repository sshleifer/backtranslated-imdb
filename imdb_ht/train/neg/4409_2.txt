Strictly a non-to-western routine (directed by genre-mainstay Andrew V. McLaglen, so is that any wonder?). Colonel Colonel Brian Keith froze and murderer Sandman Dean Martin, who recently kidnapped Colonel's wife (Honor Blackman, who never found her nest after playing Galore Pussy in "Goldfinger"). Point-fighting, shooting-outs, stolen stagecoach and Denver Pyle in a supporting role ... in other words, absolutely nothing new or original. Speaking at a low monotony, Keith gets dally with a whore (something in a shock after the run on the TV's "Family Affairs"), but otherwise this is Keith's affordable low-cost material. It is also bad news for Dino, who does not seem to notice or care. Hack directions, poor writing and many unfunny attempts at lowball humor. * from ****
