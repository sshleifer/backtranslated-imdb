I came here for a review last night before deciding that the movie movie resolved ahead, and those I found to make this one look indispensable. How foolish I feel! First, it needs to be pointed out that this is a lot of a daytime movie of a housewife. The wooden performances, each sentence is an attempt to 'poignant' in the way that the cinematic day-to-day housewife with the soap opera continues to grow, and is based on projected and well-traced sites that men (particularly soldiers) are essentially violent and incompatibilities. The entire movie is on the apparent 'drama' in the moments when the male characters threaten to develop a second dimension. <br /> <br /> If this sounds loyalty (or even enjoyable) for you, then be warned. Linda Hamilton's German accent, while quite good, is unduly distracted - as is his face, for some reason. The other performances have no doubt an indirect source of embarrassment of the perpetrators, with the painful and obvious feature of being the order of the day. There are some surprises, but look for Monty Pythonesque's endless equipment in food and drink that miraculously appear from the soldiers' hunger scoops! <br /> I was not expecting action, but I was hoping for beautiful or tesstal or emotionally charged. What I had was was a particularly bad Christmas story that will have a clever audience cringing and spitting in it all. <br /> Look under the following folowing circumstances: 1: Nothing else about. 2: You are a fan of predictable housewife 'taking on men and winning' TV movies. 3: The only way you can appreciate a true story is when Hollywood turns it into a feature film. 4: You've embedded enough that your emotions are easy to do with telling sophisticated stories.
