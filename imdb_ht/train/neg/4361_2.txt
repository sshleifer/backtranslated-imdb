Use the weed of the Dinosaur Planet in this shot on video (except for the stolen footage) to worry a bunch of people who shoot at the land space on a dinosaur planet that is ... Do not wait for it, really earth. It's a five minute draw stretched 90 minutes. A little better than Chickboxer (another of the bad movie films series) - a nostalgic home movie feel coupled with good stolen effect, this movie is still an impossible slave to get in. I let them meditate the question is we become so uncreative that we're now diving old movies not only for scheme, but also for unbalanced footage? Clearly low budget producers will become so desperate they really will give us nothing to take our money
