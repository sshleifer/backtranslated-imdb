How does a movie have Ozzy Osbourne and still suck? I just do not get it. Trick or treat managing to do it. This sucks and loves it. <br /> <br /> Trick or Treat is one of those movies I have to warn about. It is a vomiting-inducing vulnerable aggression just begging to be seen so you can feel that worst about yourself. Trick or treat no redo factor. <br /> For a heavy metal film, it sure does not seem to understand what heavy metal is or what it represents. This film managed to make blade method look and this was in 1986, probably one of the most heavy metal hours. That's quite a feat, however negative. <br /> <br /> Trick or treat = so bad you will be mad in your head to look at it. This simple equation will hopefully keep you away from this brainless brain and drop.
