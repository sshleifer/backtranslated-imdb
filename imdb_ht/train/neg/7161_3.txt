A young Indian woman visits her Irish roots and spends in a drid witch from her own. Inspired sound but after an exciting start, I got lost and spent most of the time asking where he was going. The film seems to be divided in two directions - we are watching the travails of the Irish-American woman fighting his alcohol problem or are we watching a straight off cops on an evil witch who returns past? The principal may not seem to decide. The two do not seem to frost and in the end you get nowhere. This would be so much better to do and the story seemed to drag towards the end. This was more boring and irritating.
