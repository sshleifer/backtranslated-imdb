I do not know where to start. The cast is all those who have never done before or since. Debralee Scott is listed on cover box but does not appear in the movie all. Writing this is quite bad, even for the college movie. It is obviously very low budget, and one home sorority scene has very hideous editing. The characters are very typical for college films - shy guy, nerd, black guy suave, hard guys, guys and whiskers, attractive girls, little girls, etc. you would expect ... heavy-handed guys wear guys who become sidetracked easily. <br /> <br /> If you can not see a Flick College, stay clear of this one. It's so bad, it's not funny.
