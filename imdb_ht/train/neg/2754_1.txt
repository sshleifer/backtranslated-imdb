The original review of this movie was simply the word * writes 2000 times over. Although this was a very accurate criticism, I felt my review would be a little more descriptive. <br /> I'll start with the lead actress; Her facial expression does not change once in this film, it does not show fear, happiness or depression. His skills in the body of a beautiful body come down to darting his eyes left and right and looking like he does not know Jack. It's a emotional sting that I guess there was too much botox. His lack of facial expression in the movie is outmatched however by the dear love affair with the lead actor that looks like spring from nowhere and has brought out on a beach and falls in love at a couple of hours to meet each other . The lead actor, whose hair requires more attention than he did, was the best mediocre and did not once make me feel like he was really in danger. <br /> <br /> The only thing that the foolish acting head is the directing, scenario and inexhaustibility of sketching. I saw tampon ads with more structures than this movie. There is no development of character, they just seem to say and do things that I can never believe that a real person would. <br /> This movie would not have been bad if it was trying to be crap about goals like snakes on an airplane, but it was trying so hard to be a repeat hard action that I could not even laugh. I believe I now have a brain tumor from watching this movie and thinking up all the different ways I could use that budget and cg teams to create something far superior. If I bought this on DVD I would break the DVD into pieces, burn it then dissolve it into hydrochloric acid for good measurements. Do not watch this video!
