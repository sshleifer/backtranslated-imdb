I thought this was a really awful movie - I found myself actually calling in my TV once a couple. One or both of the gay male leads were miscast; There was absolutely no chemistry between them and Richard Ruccolo seemed to have preferred to kiss a dog. The film covers long and tortuous customs, highlighting each break-up and make-up, but does not develop the whole reason in any detail. These reasons would make for some interesting characters, not the battle or scenes of make-up of bed (lame though you liked the movie). Andrea Martin and Adam Goldberg shine as their characters, but it does not make the film worth renting. Save Your Money.
