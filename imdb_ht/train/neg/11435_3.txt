I wish I would know more about this movie when I rent it. I would put it in my queue on the basis of Heather Graham and her strong credit as an actress (IMHO). While part of the film was good, many of the movie felt, disappeared, or otherwise just boring or predictable. Not to mention the ICK factor in many people thinking the sibs were a couple ... I do not care how big a part of the story line is, it still felt a bit, um, gross. And Charlie, for a zoologist, it certainly does not seem to be very suited to signaling from other Homo sapiens. What was it about (including her with some common interests) that made Gray fall for her? The story could be so much fun and a little more in depth. High point - Molly Shannon (although I agree with her annoying review on occasion), the cabbie's dragged, and the dance sequences (if Sam & Gray were like big dancers, I wish we would see more of that, as bits they showed they were better than most of the rest of the movie). Could be better.
