This film was slow but tiring and often drifted into the country of ham. Redgrave's character was unappealing as 60 something women trying to compete with Thurman's 20 stuff for the love of Fox's character (why is beyond me). The title of the movie was "Show people on the lake". The actors played like they were in a rehearsal. An unpredictable ending boot end. I can not believe this is on this website as a comedy!
