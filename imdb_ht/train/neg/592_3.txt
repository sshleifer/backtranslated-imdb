All logic goes straight from the railway window of this brutal British movie, set in London under the ground and begins to usually Franka Potente's Running (Run Lola Run), Franka plays Kate, a merchant on the way to an office party to meet Friends who fall asleep at an underground station, only wake up and find it closed and to find themselves being pursued by "someone" or "something" with bloodthirsty intention. <br /> <br /> Horror and incredible holes are plentiful and there are many moments that are actually paradoxed / awesome, but many are just plain dull. <br /> All in all an unpleasant movie that should just remain closed underground forever and make us all a favor. > <br /> The only point here is the inclusion of cast of popular actor veteran Ken Campbell, who does better than this ?? This even includes "Erasmus Microman"!
