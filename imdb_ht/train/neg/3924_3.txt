Surely horrible, firefighting, endless movie. Director Bellocchio seems to be infatuated with the beautiful face and face of his actress Detmers - and who can blame him? But maybe, just maybe, it should focus his attention a little more about doing a good, engaging movie. I hate her when a sex movie poses as an "art film" just to become more "respectable". Sectors often, sexually explicit sex is the only reason for this movie's existence. If you are not worth sitting at the rest of the picture is prohibited a matter of taste. (*)
