This movie was exactly what I expected, not great, but also not wrong either. In my opinion PG13 movies are not scary enough so that's why I already knew I was going to be bored of the entire movie. Make sure you have to worry about going to the hotel room, but nothing we've never seen before. I guess I did not like it because I thought it was too much torn and turned over; It was old and repetitive. I also did not understand if all this Cusack had experienced in the room was real or not. There is no explanation for any of the events held there. The movie just drags on and when it finally reaches an end you want it to keep going because you're still waiting around for someone to tell you what the movie is all about. What I liked was the special effects. Other than that was not much fun in her. Maybe it just me but I thought this was below average.
