The Twilight Zone has achieved a certain mythology about it - much like Star Trek. That's because many lovers are devoted to the show that no matter what every episode was was a winner. They are people scoring each one showing a 10 and not able to evaluate the show. So, shortly back I reviewed all the original Star Trek episodes (good and bad) because the overall ratings and reviews were just too positive. Now it's time to do the same for the Twilight Zone. While I scored 10 episodes, this one gets a 3 simply because it's bad. Writing this was anbarrassingly bad. Two people from opposite sides of a great war are seen losing up in the entire episode. After a while, it's apparent that they are just two people left on Earth - as you learn from the conclusion is really stupid and totally compelling. Usually the twist at the end makes the episode great - this one kills him!
