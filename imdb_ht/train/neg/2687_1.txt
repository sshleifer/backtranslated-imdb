Eleven "big" filmmakers, eleven pieces of waste. Eleven minutes each in absolute seductive, sophistry, condense, self-indulgence. Treat for people of all nations. Yussef Chahine in Egypt gives a "hip hip hooray!" for terrorists in her amateur segment. Along the green line we have Amos Gitai in Israel, using his eleven minutes to show a terrorist act and focus on a junk newscaster. Alejandro González Iñárritu in Mexico focused on the twin towers but seemed to forget to turn on his camera. Sean Penn did not know that there was no building in the shadow of the Trade Center on 9-11. Shohei Imamura in Japan ignores everything. Claude Lelouch is fixed on a trivial love affair and hat. Ken Loach in the UK focuses on Chile. Etc etc
