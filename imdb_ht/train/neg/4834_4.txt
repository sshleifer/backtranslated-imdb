I was looking for Kathryn Bigelow's movie with a great anticipation after the endless hype and 6 Oscars that he gave. Unfortunately it really is not a good movie. Presentation of the situation certainly seemed to be accurate and credible on all counts, but beyond that the story simply came across as incomplete and directional in the film appearing to be uncertain and harsh. The actors put in a good effort, but for me I did not really get what the movie was trying to be. It's not as atmospheric and as attractive as Jacket Full Metal, not as epic as the Band of Brothers, not as action packed as ... well, nothing. I certainly can not see why it has been nominated for many, nor why people are 'hyping up' these seasonal proportions. Mind you, given the caliber of the couple's movies in recent years I suppose there's not much to choose from.
