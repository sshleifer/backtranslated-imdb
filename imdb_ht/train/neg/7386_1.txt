I tried to restart the movie twice. I put it in three cars to see what was wrong. Is Voice Seagal Voice Change? Is she dying while filming and the studio has the dub sound and someone who does not look like her? Or were the sounds on the DVD destroyed? After about 10 minutes, you finally hear the real actor's voice. Even though most of the film, it sounds like the audio was recorded in a toilet. <br /> I should be ashamed to donate a copy of this movie in goodwill if I own a copy. I rent it, but I will never do that again. I'll check this database before renting any more of his movies, all of which were (more or less) good movies. Usually you knew what you got when you watched a movie Steven Seagal. I guess that's not more.
