Obviously a lot of talent behind the scenes crew members worked on this movie, so do not even look at their credit in the end, you'll only keep it against them. Nobody was interested to see this film, only 3 was in the theater; Two days later, after 10 minutes, and they were the ones lucky. The 'Monsters' were the worm's work from Star Trek 2, the anger of Khan, and rejected the cartoon creatures of the aliens. The creators of the film obviously did not want to cover their third movie monsters, so they hired actors rates that apparently did not get to memorize their lines, or in some cases learn to pronounce their words before filming began. Some scenes are incredibly inept in transmitting just what is supposed to happen, if anything is. If you are unfortunate enough to be in a theater where this movie shows, and you do not go out, you'll laugh at what's supposed to be awesome or thrilling moments in the movie. The plurality of several scenes will just skip you, and Stephen Dorff's regular spewing in the 'Queen Mary in Cursed Words' translates the feeling of anyone paying to see it. If you have to view this movie, make yourself a favor and wait until it's binary bin in the video store. If there is any justice in the film industry, one of the main actors will have to rent it to you.
