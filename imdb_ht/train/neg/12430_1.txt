Home alone 3 is one of my favorite movies. It's the cream of the crop, or s *** if you tend to be more cynical, as it lacks up (or down) there and things like Earth Battle and Flinstones: Viva Rock Vegas. In fact, it might even worse than those two, since those at least intermittently made me laugh at their stupidity. This just makes me cringe of pain constantly and beats when credit began to roll. No other movie made me in pain. Now I'll point out exactly why this movie is so incredibly atrocious. <br /> <br /> The first, the plot is ridiculous. It revolves around a chip in a remote control car (?!) Which is deploying and how these terrorists want it. Dumb thing. <br /> The action that follows is similar to that of the other two Home Alons, with boobytraps and all, but watching these boobytraps being executed is, rather than being funny, incredibly unpleasant to watch . I did not laugh (or even so smile) once, instead, I cringed constantly and hoping that the terrorists would kid the kid. The bird, rather than giving comic relief, was unfunny and annoying. The act, as does not bunch of names, the poor atrophy ranges. There is not one good performance here. Alex D.Linz is absolutely unlikely and unfunny as the kid, while the terrorists act (and judging by the movie credit, look) as they've been hurried to pick up the street ... and well, li. <br /> I can see some people say, "Man, it's for the kids. Not ten, man." Well MAN, kids can love this, but they can get a hell of a lot better. See Monsters Inc and Toy Story before even consider getting this out. Hell, even Scooby Doo and Garfield (who suck - see these reviews for more) are better than this! <br /> <br /> So, in short, this is a irredeemably atrocious film. This was clearly recyclable for the money, as it almost completely torn in the first two; The only thing is, it completely insults the first two. No one, kid or otherwise, should find any reason to see Home alone 3. Ever. It's wrong. <br /> <br /> 0/5 stars
