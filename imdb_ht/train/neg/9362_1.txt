The plot sounded as he promised. To be honest I did not watch the entire movie. After an hour of the movie I made a decision. Is this movie worth watching until it concludes? The answer was clearly NO! It was not the fact that the human body could not get a transplant from a different species without rejecting it. Nor the citizen that he was being chased by secret government authorities for a person / wolf transplant. It was because the film was badly written, acting without emotions and I did not understand the sequences of several dreams and wolves and buffaloes. When he ran to the zoo with a dog pack and left them in front of the zoo door saying "If you can not run with the big dogs do not let the porch" keep running in my head bored. Save yourself the time and jump this movie. I can guarantee if you dare to look at it you will sit down to jawed as I did so wondering why someone wasted money, time, energy and effort to make this outrageous insult to the American cinema.
