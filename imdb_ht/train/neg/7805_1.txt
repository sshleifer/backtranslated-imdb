The actor's first film is usually something that can pay off - it's often the first job where the lack of movie experience by everyone involved is really on display, and this film is no exception. That, even by 1982 this standard is so bad, it's funny hysteria. Movies entirely in the Chicago area on a relatively small budget, most of the act by the entire cast is stiff, wild, and cartoonish - a cross between a high school playground and the bad theater community. Rushing from nearby traffic often drowned from the dialogue, and the dialogue is really bad, very declarative in a way that comes in as force and easier than natural and organic. Scenes appear with effect, and even though the characters go through a span of years, both children and adults are all ages. <br /> I believe it's possible to make a Christian movie that's tasting of a huge, exclamation audience, but too often the creators of these films, so focus on the 'message' or in this case, own own autobiographical link in the project the value of film production is aside. (I'm sure he does not have coincidence that the main character has the same name as the producer / director / editor - and cast members.) Odds, Michael Madsen was much more interesting - and credible - in the look of his subsequent film them. Careers like it are certainly not built on such films as one.
