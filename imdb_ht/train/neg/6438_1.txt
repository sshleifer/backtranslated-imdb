I did not really know what this movie was about when I went to the theater to see it (hype on Satanism etc. etc.) as the trailer in the last movie I saw seeing very interesting. Oh my dear, Roman Catholic mythology? Not my idea of ​​a good scary and honestly, I just felt like watching a really good, scary film, not some trace of relative mosaic that tries to score cheap emotions by some chick getting up every few minutes! /> I'll try to keep away from the defocers (!) But I found it very odd that an atheist, who gets a string of Rosary pearl from a dead priest, can suddenly end up with Christ's wounds (not stigmata supposed to be deeply religious ??) I mean, he hangs out with losers, doing things that is lost, behaving like a typical rebel and al, and here it shows the lesions of Jesus Christ ?? Come on! <br /> The scene of crucifying him, throwing himself back, screaming, without widespread, came rather tedious after seeing it a dozen times. It's neither scary nor frightening, just stacking. He did, however, became painful to watch - these flicking scenes were very annoying ... <br /> <br /> CONCLUSION: If you are a Catholic, defintly do not see this. If not, always do not see it.
