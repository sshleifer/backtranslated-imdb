Sequels has a nasty habit of being irritating, and the best credit I can give is that it keeps that old tradition. These three accounts are nothing as good as any from the original Creepshow. <br /> <br /> By far the best of the trio involves a wooden idol that comes to life to take revenge on the thugs that killed his master. The second story is about a lake monster that looks nothing more than a lot of floating floating, making you wonder how anybody can possibly be frightening of it. The third story includes a queen from Stephen King as a truck driver, but other than this is a very unmemorable story about the victim of a road traffic accident that comes back from the dead for those who hit it down. <br /> <Look at the original Creepshow instead, or if you've already done then be happy with that.
