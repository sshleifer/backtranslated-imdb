(this may be a bit on the spoiled side) I would like to start by saying I did not watch the movie all, nor I can because it was obvious in the first hour that I was going to do incredibly disappointed. This of course is the problem and take, what many believe to be an amazing book, and turning it into a Disney movie made-to-TV movie. <br /> <br /> A rush of time should be made in an amazing movie a long time ago. He received a great storyline that would raise children and adults. Plus it was built in high quality suites. But Disney-fying did not go the way. The problem with the movie is that everything is changing to turn it into a visual story dumbed down that was so great about the book. It's a complicated and emotional story for kids. There was no reason to do Charles Wallace purely "Psychic" because it was the easiest way to explain it. There was no reason to write a fight between the three Ms. W. as added tension, there was enough tension in the story without that. There was no reason to remove Meg's glasses ... that prevented us from having a very sweet scene between Calvin and Meg who came to the book. <br /> I could nitpick for days on little things, but I also think bigger things, such as the art direction was a. Take for example the road to see Camazotz look, with its unusual black sky. The creepiness that comes across in the book is that Camazotz might be Earth. It looks like the earth. He had people on it who looks like people. The blue skies, the green grass, and the kids are playing. But something is a little at. The directors chose to make Camazotz a complete other instead of taking the lesson in the book and applying it to the overall direction of the movie. The lesson of course is that Camazotz could be very good on earth, that's if we forget how they love. It would be very creepier to have a nice afternoon as they are walking down the street and the kids bouncing the balls at the same rhythm. <br /> I unfortunately did not look at the end. Maybe someone can tell me how Disney messed up the end as well. <br /> Overall an artistic deception. <br /> <br />
