I've watched a lot of cartoon movies or animated because I have a baby girl who likes to watch TV. I started watching this movie to see if I would love my little ones to watch it ... and no. At the beginning I thought it was like a beautiful movie like the Bambi movie, but all the way it was like insinuating the ducky was a homosexual. The information was said to have fun in him because he was not good at sports, but that was not the case. It just seems like a movie made for kids to learn to be okay being gay. It was also very sad, as far as Ducky's father and all. I do not know, I guess if you are gay you would like it, but I do not think I'll watch it again with my little one.
