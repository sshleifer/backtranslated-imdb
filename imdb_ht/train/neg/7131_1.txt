I like bad movies. I love renting movies with my friends and ripping about them for their duration. Then there are abnormal movies like this. Redline is not only a bad movie, but a sign that maybe the American movie industry should please, for the sake of the viewer, at least the scripts before financing a movie. <br /> If a stereotype took a crap, this movie would come from that. The scenario is unbearable, and acts all around is ridiculous. Nadia Bjorlin and Eddie Griffin have, perhaps, the worst screen I've seen at a good time, and even individually they should be isolated from humanity and beating them with a bag of oranges until they change their profession on street vendors the only thing can be legitimately qualified for). In addition, how Angus Macfadyen was convinced to make this film is far behind me that I can not even think of an analogy. I'm a faithful fan of it, but this made me question him. <br /> <br /> To sum it up. Several people want revenge for different reasons (and if you care enough to know what they are, you are someone who is bigger than me), so much to come back to violence (I guess). The film is like Ouroboros, the snake that swallows its own, in that it's an endless cycle of confusion and dialogue does not fit for people's ears. This film is essentially a big commercial car for the first half, with an independent action movie for the rest, it should be avoided at any and all costs. <br /> I wish I could find one positive aspect of this film, and I think it lies in the fact that eventually the credit is rolling. <br /> <br /> PS Nadia Bjorlin, if you have singing these two songs in this movie, then you're a hack, and I hope your old age breakage. If you rent this movie looking for an upsetting experience, listen to the lyrics of Nadia Bjorlin's awesome song.
