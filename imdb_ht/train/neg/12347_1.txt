This is easily the worst movie movie of Ridley Scott. Ridley Scott is a wonderful director. But this film is a black mark on his career. Demi Moore and Viggo Mortensen, both totally miscast in an overaggressive film about a girl going to the army. Very stupid. And never a scene convinced in any way. It is really not difficult to make a movie like this. All the crew could have been an idea of ​​just anybody. The writers did not have much inspiration either; many foolish dialogues that made no sense at all; with some brainless actions. I recommend staying away from this waste. I hope that many talented people in this project realize this kind of movie does not deserve attention, and that in the future they will work on more honorable and more intelligent movies than this useless mess.
