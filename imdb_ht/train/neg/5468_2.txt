I absolutely adore the 'toxic Avenger' series, but this weak offering by the Troma people did not make any sense, and it gave me all the time. <br /> A nuclear plant flow (with growing weeds near it) fasting in Tromaville high goes black, which leads to joining a gang, sex, exploding, and whatever. Also there are some sort of monster breeding in the high school ... my God, this movie is a mess. The actors pretty much stop their efforts after this one and they should. (Intention) overacting began to get on my nerves in about 5 minutes ... <br /> <br /> Irritating. 2/10.
