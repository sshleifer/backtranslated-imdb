This was not all that great. Not terrible or lovely or anything, just forgettable. <br /> It has a sort of, um, hesitate, diluted time, as it never thinks if he wanted to go for laughing or sweet or satir. So we left with weak mixture of the three. The actors seemed a bit lost. <br /> <br /> Also, the ideas were really tired and recycled, almost zombified themselves. How often should we say 50 years in the United States have been infected with a sense of compliance? And that's been perpetuated by aggressive intake? And that emotional repression of men is something baaaaad? Old hat. <br /> <br /> The biggest crime in my eyes though was just how detached from reality it was. I know it was a comedy and all but - especially in a full movie where you must keep the interest in an audience for an extended period - you still need some sort of emotional cast, some related guides in the story, doing it engage. For the 'hero' kid to watch an old woman, two fellow students and finally her dad died very painfully in the hands of zombie or whatever and to salute it all with a better smile and a little bit of the shoulders, then I just struggle to deal with that in any sort of positive way. The mum was the same. If you make two main characters you are so stubborn at this level, then you risk losing me and that's what happened. <br /> <br /> The biggest positive I can offer is that I love looking at the type of apple pie pie and this has captured it well enough, it was a beautiful movie, and Robinsons' home. Also, the opening of the news was beautiful, in a sort of made-before-but-always-funny way. <br /> And I thought Billy Connolly was OK and from someone who was not a big fan of Billy Connolly: Star movie. I just had this scary he was going to hamming it up and trying to steal each scene, but he played it very low-key for him and probably out the most sympathetic character of the whole movie. All in all, not great though.
