Be honest. As a movie school project, made without budget and "real" actor, this is an incredible movie. As something to be released on DVD for an innocent viewer, it's a very productive product. If I would be moderating changing channels and arriving to catch this movie accidentally, it would probably catch my eyes and watch for a while. As someone who bought this DVD under the impression that I should receive a good Cinemas product, so a movie, I feel deeply ashamed. It is a video TV video, something about the line of sixth old, but without certain charm. Aside from Mr. Redfield's leadership (who is also the director), the other actors seem to either escape from the campus (somewhat too old for that actually), or members of the principal's home The camera without any help does not only couch to act, but also the make-up artist or hairdresser (a charm on bang revulsion or a head hat on mullet is a very long way out of creating 1840s). It's all injection using a cluttered camera mounted in a small, studio, sometimes using blue screen for outdoor backgrounds. Synthesizer produces unenspired scores of "lip" period lame inspired romantic karaoke insults listening to ears over more than one occasion. The movie tries to be "dreams", whereas in fact it's merely coordinating the queen of those shots that made it to the correction (and believe me, the standards were not too high to begin with). There are interesting dialogues all right now and then, but overall it's very blame and two-dimensional output in more than one way with no engineering flash from either the director or any member of the crew. That's how "artsy" movie tried to look at the 80s. Mr Redfield is doing a better job as an actor than the director.
