SPOILERS. Those weird and generous tastes have been revisiting this movie. Allow me to add balance by displaying the following: <br /> Script script: Serious. As Tom and Dan are "getting to know each other," bantering on the movie, the talk is clearly that of one man, and I suspect he was the director, who carefully worked his words sound intelligently. At one point, Dan asks, "Did you hear from HIV?" and it sounds like natural as asking, "Do you communicate with the nine foreign races?" <br /> <br /> Actress: Tooth whitening with a wet face does not make a sensible scene done. Speedman did well enough and what he gave, I suppose, but Marsden was terrible - unsympathetic, incredible, and outright smuggling and smarmy during his captivity. There is a blank in his performance (also see Interstate 60). The moments in half the escape did not typify but disappointing and weak. Remind Marsden tackle the key to the door and then send them down: "They do not work, people!" Tea-hee. But take precautions of black-and-white semi-finals, which are initiated with some key sheep sounds taken from CSI and other crime drama. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />! Tom says that Dan could get into the condom or not use it at all - excuse me, where Tom while having sex? There are some villainizing of the insert partner that comes as a villainizing of the gay man in general. <br /> <br /> In sum: Beware!
