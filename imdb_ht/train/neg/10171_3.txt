Comparing with American Graffiti is inevitable for saving your money and time spent by timeless classics. Speaking of timeliness, there was an episode of Cheers where Norm and Cliff compete on who could find the most anachron in a movie. They would like all these films in some of the songs and some of the clothes they were wrong. There were sly references like 'parasite paradise to put up a parking lot'. The filmists were hoping to give some smiles from us but basically made me groan. <br /> <br /> The characters in this movie are incredibly politically and socially crafty for adolescents. Almost as clever as the people who were in the thirties and quarantine when they wrote the darts movie. Very little of what the characters said they were credible. Combining the bad writing and wrong acting this movie just totally weakens. Although, there were two exceptions to Kelli Williams living things as children in future flowers, and yet another review said, Rick Shroeder was quite good. Showing that brooding features that would come in full boil in its appearance eventually to "N.Y.P.D. Blues".
