I went to this movie thinking he went to their next peers, but left feelings left down. The humor was weak and the characters were fairly flat. That is not to say it was all wrong, the idea of ​​the dating service in the grocery store seemed like lovely fertile material, but the director changed the focus of the cliche'd to "save the mother-and-pop shop from society evil guy ". I felt as if it would just flush and draw the dating service, it would come out with a much more memorable movie. Now, make the movie justice, I'm out of the Rochester area and like the way she described Webster. In fact, the best Kevin Smith (Klerks) tribute here has been providing accessory to his hometown. Webster, NY is checking what the Red Bank, NJ is Klerks. The director wisely threw on a date in the Nick Tahou. Believe me, as far as things are done in Rochester, a garbage plate is at the top of the list. I was lucky enough to see this movie in Little Rochester so everyone knew when the city odd came and appreciated them.
