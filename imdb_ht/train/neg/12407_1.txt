Alisonne (Laurel Barnett) has become a babysitter for young Rosalie Nordon (Rosalione Cole) who recently lost her mother. But Rosalie miss her dead mom very and continuously visit her grave (conveniently located in a plot right behind the house) late at night ... where she also meets her "friends" ... starting from good and a Very unusual sequel to the cemetery ... then fall apart. The story is thin and has TONS of padding to make the movie 85 minutes long. The act is terrible across the board (and Cole easily was the worst). Leading and some of the corrections at WORST I've ever seen in a motion picture. Scenes (and sounds) are just off and there are no rhymes or reasons. Also the film has terrible (and obvious) post-production sounds. As for blood and violence - forget it! There are very few and those who are very incredibly fraudulent. I have never seen such as blood-foam - looks like tomato sauce! Boring, freeware - a drive drive that's just forgotten. You can jump this one.
