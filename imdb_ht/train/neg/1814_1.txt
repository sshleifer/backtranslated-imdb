All of these reviews are stained on. I've seen many bad films over the years, believe me, and that's so much! <br /> <br /> This is not just a "so bad one of good" exploitation waste of time, but a genuine, hilarious, atrocity movie. <br /> <br /> Check out these white fur furs! <br /> <br /> Wet yourself to peel through Thur Christopher's "Spell Tissue" act! <br /> GIFTS IN THE SHEER ** DISPLAY E-CLENCH! in the wired series! <br /> This is one of those "European co-production". No wonder we have a lot of wars. I swear, some of the people involved in the 'Wizards of the Lost Kingdom' are not actually aware of being featured in a movie! <br /> FACT! I originally watched this movie on HTV Wales late a night while suffering from concussion and sleep deprivation. I had to follow a copy several weeks after making sure it was really horrible. He is. Worse even than Lee Major of the Norseman, more ridiculous than all of John Derek's films, that's really the Kane's citizen in garbage.
