This ambitious movie suffered from the writers / Paul Paul Anderson in excitement. Highly derived from the best materials (Altman's "Nashville," the "Lumet" Network), this lumbering elephant takes far too long to get nowhere. A couple of silly daggers on the road (an embarrassing nasty music, a biblical harm) does not help matters. Nor does the unequal level of performance. Especially bad: William H. Macy, whose characters and scenarios can easily have been eliminated altogether; Julianne Moore, for her subconscious. And how often should we see John C. Reilly 's Sad Shtick ring ("Chicago" and "Hours" will suffice)? Tom Cruise comes in well by comparison ?? His misogynist, mouth-lull Holy Roller was rather fun. Speaking of bad lips, the script was loaded with "F" bombs, they lost their impact in no time. Do not even talk about the soundtrack, full of voices and bitter voices by Aimee Mann. Extending her pronouncement of "A," a number of maudlin to begin with, drove me to distraction at the beginning of the movie. I should listen to the writing on the wall and save myself three more hours, in which time I would have pushed to the brink of hell. A redemption feature, which I have not seen mentioned in other reviews, is the optimal performance of the bunch, by unknown Melora Walters in the role of Claudia, damaging the ending coke bent on self-destruction. Her credibility exceeds everyone else. This movie has taken itself too seriously and just did not know when to finish.
