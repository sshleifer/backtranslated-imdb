Apparently, the person who wrote the back of the box did not bother to look at this so-called "movie." They described "choreographed whitening and violence." I saw no "intrigue." I rather see a miserable attempt in dialogue in a supposed film of kung fu. I saw no "violence". At least, I do not see anything that could cause me to stop my disbelief on what could possibly hurt someone with "impermeable" skin - but here I may be too much to reveal to the "draw." In addition, as a viewer of many films and various films (some of which include the occasional film kung fu), I can be authorized to say that this piece of seluloid is invisible. Whatever you can choose to do, I will always stay <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I have not been chained in choreography.
