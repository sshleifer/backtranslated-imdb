I was not entirely impressed by this movie. It was originally called Sin Eater and should have remained in this way considering that all this was talked about for the last half of the movie. I'm not sure what the first 20 minutes of the movie did with any of the rest of it. It was very slowly and what was with Robocop picking (Peter Weller) as one of the main actors. That was a sad point. <br /> Of all I would say check this out if you are in matters related to the Catholic religion, but do not expect an exorcist or Stigmata from this movie. It will surely flop after a few days and words come out.
