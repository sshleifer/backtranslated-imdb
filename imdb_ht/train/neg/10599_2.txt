** IS A SPOILERS ** <br /> <br /> The government continues to develop UniversalSoldier program, called UniSol. Soldiers are now stronger and they can take more damage than before. However the government is reduced, project harmlessly with the supercomputer that is among those who feel threatened, so it takes steps to ensure its own security. It activates and controls UniSols and starts running mayhem. The only one that can be stopped is Deveraux (Van Damme). <br /> <br /> This movie is about one thing. Choreography Battle. The story is bad, and it is soon drowned in every fight. Whatever happens, and wherever they go, they fight. Unfortunately for this movie, it's not fun watching a fight where you know a part of it is indestructible. Normally you are very assured that the hero will win, but you still want to feel the fights between the two equally small fighters. Not one single indestructible and can not be lost. Then the battles just become a time stretch tool. You wait until the final battle when Deveraux miraculously finds a way to beat its unbeatable enemy. Further lower my opinion, a desperate and sure sign of a bad movie is how many scantily clad women have. Well, there are not really many of them, because the characters are more men (there is at least one UniSol woman though), but almost every woman is useless to show and at least just a bra at once. The female drivers get by and this, but we also pass through a strip-club (to use a computer no less) and more disaster women. These moments do not give anything to the story and just have to try to please the teens-minded male audience. <br /> So, in the conclusion, boring fights. No more, no less. Well, maybe less ... <br /> <br /> 2/10
