I used to love this movie as a kid but, seeing it again 20 years later, it actually sucks. Up The Academy might have been ahead of it back in 1980, but it's almost nothing to offer today! Movies such as Caddyshack and Strip hold-up are better today than this dogpile steamer. No T & A. There is no big joke except for one-material we all heard one million times by now. <br /> <br /> I just bought the DVD in hoping it would be the gem I remembered it was. Well, I WAS OFF! The soundtrack had only 2-3 broadly-recognized phrases (not compilation to combat others mentioned) and often voices-overs were awful. The only thing that was interesting, to me, was predicting what line the character was before they were told. Yes, I watched this movie that many back then! <br /> <br /> The only reason I write this review is to give my two cents about why this movie should be forgotten, sorry to say. :(
