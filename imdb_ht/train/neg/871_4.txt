Nicholas Walker is Paul, Reverand of Hometown, who is married to Martha (Ally Sheedy), but also is a familiar womanizer and decided to fake his death with his current affairs, Veronica (Dara Tomanovich). However in doing so, it has become a bout of amnesia (hence the name of the movie). Sally Kirkland is also in the hands of an old coot crap that is a good tree for the good reverend in a variety of types of "Misery" in style. It's sad to see a very good cast wasting like this. Not least John Savage's bit of a stupid forgettable role as a private shoddy investigator. In a movie that billed as a 'dark comedy', one brought the BOTH component to the movie. While this carries the former in shovels, it sadly is none of the letter. In addition you can not emphasize any of the characters and as such, there is absolutely no interest to invest in them. Technically not an all-along movie is just a pretty forgettable. <br /> <br /> Candy eye: Dara Tomanovich gets topless; Sally Kirkland also shows some skin <br /> <br /> My class: C # <br /> Where I saw it: Showtime Showcase
