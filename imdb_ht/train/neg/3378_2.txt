Since then this film has been released I've seen Chorus Line on stage 4 times, and has anticipated the fastest-ever-rumored production of a movie in the story. My wife and I were in hours before the open box office on the day the movie was released. It was not just a disappointment, it was a kick in the stomach. <br /> First, the story was "moved out," so to speak, do not include scenes not within the boundaries of the theater. Those are a great part of the meaning and impact of the story. <br /> <br /> Second & Third Set (Order Your Own): was one of the original songs, with very dynamic numbers, removed; a song that was NOT in the production stage added. Tell what ?? I'm confused! <br /> <br /> The only reason I gave this movie 2 stars instead of 1 is my admiration for the talent and hard work of the performers. I have now seen Chorus Line on stage 6 times, and would not mind seeing it 6 times more before I died. It is superbly written, with beautiful music, and heart-wrenchingly true story. If you want to see a music that includes a huge "cow call" audition, I recommend that all jazz. If you want to see the story of A Chorus Line, see it on stage.
