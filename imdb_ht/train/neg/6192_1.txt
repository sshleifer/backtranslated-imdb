The Great Exstest of Robert Carmichael is the bad movie in every way. The script, the sad march, lack of depth of any character, useless sub-plots, the obnoxious act, the climax without doing so probably the worst movie I've ever seen. I find nothing convenient, enjoyable or intellectually interesting in any way. <br /> I imagined the movie makers thought they had done something smart and dark, with its moody lighting, long silence slowly and vaguely haunted classic band. If so, they failed completely. She just bored me, and I wish I never looked at her. <br /> <br /> Avoid at all costs.
