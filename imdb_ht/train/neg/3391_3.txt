I wonder who, how and more important why the decision to call Richard Attenborough direct the most sensitive sensation hit Broadway in many years? He is a Academy Award Award. Yes, it was Gandi you moan! Jeremy Irons is an Academy winning actor you want to see her playing Rocky Balboa? It has experience with musicals. Really? "Oh what a wonderful war" do you forget? To answer your question, yes! The film is a clear, simple and simple disappointment. It is not a live energy ounce that has survived the army in the proceedings. Every dance character was very good, but the projections were theater. I do not feel anything. But when I saw it on stage I felt everything. The film should have been cast with stars, unknown, newcomers but compelling and convincing to face even the most invisible in the group. Great actors who could dance very well. Well Michael Douglas was in it. True I forget I'm absolutely wrong and you are absolutely right. There is nothing like a Richard Attenborough Michael Douglas music.
