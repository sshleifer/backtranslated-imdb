and rent a huge movie movie. It's like the writer never saw a movie horror before and did not realize every single thing he wrote was smashed and hacked and it was parody of perfection of movies like "scream" and "scary movie". <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> In between scary bits are more BANAL and BORING the dialogue ever written. Stupid "we're going to the bullet" junk. I wanted my ear claw. Honestly, the "Hills" have better dialogue. There is really no need to do this movie. Leading ladies is refreshing and I've kept thinking "It really? Guy is obsessed with him? Really?" <br /> <br /> All the characters act in stupid ways, including the police. (Cover the seat of the team 2! Before and back! Not one cup cop sits in his car and the window rolls down just waiting for his throat to be slashed.) <br /> <br /> The Assassin series just signs of killing everyone he wants without the slightest bit of trouble. No resistance against victim (or door). Nobody has any protection or the least idea of ​​fighting back (or flipping the security lock on the hotel room door). People are like mental cattle sheep. <br /> <br /> No, no, if you're a Gore fan, you'll be ashamed too. All the kill is keeping screen and is - ahem - nicely done. (So ​​boo for you!) <br /> None of the killings are the least interesting. Most of the time they have already reached the time we get out. The only missing clue was the cat that still pops out of this kind of movie. "Oh kitty! You're scared of me! I thought you were the killer - AIIEEEE!" <br /> Then at the end when it's time for the dead killer - well, let's just say it's the easiest and most obvious choice. Snore. <br /> <br /> The audience was jeering and talking back to the screen at all. It was too dumb to believe and not really scary enough. Do not encourage this kind of lazy film .. <br /> (Oh, and by the way - there is no crown in a bullet or queen king .. No tiara .. No buckets without.) <Br /> < So save your money and rent "Carrie" or "Friday 13th" or "Halloween" or "Call" or "Scary movie" (any of them) to get a good scary and some original twists .
