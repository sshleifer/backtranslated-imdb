There are two types of 1950s music. First you have brilliant MGM outputs with great names and great music. Then you have the minor league with a less popular cast, famous music and director rate second. 'The girl can not help her' belongs to the latter category. Neither Tom Ewell or Edmond O'Brien became famous and Jayne Mansfield was famous for her ... well, never mind. Seems like every decade has its share of Bo Dereks or Pamela Andersons. The plot itself is thin as a razorblade and someone can not help suspect that it is primarily an attempt to sell records for Granny Domino, Little Richard or others in the 1950s rock acts that appears in the movie. If this music appeals to you this is worth watching. If not, do not bother.
