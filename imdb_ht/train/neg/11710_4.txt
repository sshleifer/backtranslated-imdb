There is one reason to watch this movie if you are not related to one of the stars or producers: actress Nichole Hiltz. It is the show off of this slow slowing and wildly inflammation of revenge. Led by Simon Gornick, the movie stars Joyce Hyser as a betrayer wife who decided to seek revenge on her scam 's bride. Oh, but not conventional. He plans a total guerrilla warfare and recruits bad girl Nichole Hiltz as his weapon of choice. She wants Nichole (as Tuesday) to get close to her former (but handsome but dull Stephan Jenkins, who must stick to music) to embarrass her and ruin her life. David DeLuise is good at some short moments, and the former "Crime Story" star Anthony Dennison has virtually nothing to do, but gross. Hiltz on the other hand comes in at various times as sexy and playful, then wrong and devious. He also cares for vulnerable and "maybe a bit psychotic" well. It is also quite hot (though there are no rogue shows) so you can understand how it might be found in any guy she is targeting. But the performance is kind of wasting in this movie, which is just not crazy or interesting enough to recommend.
