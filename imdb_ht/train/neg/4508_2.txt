Andrejlau, I could not agree more. My girlfriend watched this at that very moment, and I found this movie awe-inspiring. Quote from my Chinese girlfriend, laughing: "They're doing all this for a man!" <br /> I find these women have no intensity, no sense of a fight between tragedy and identity, and that these guys are hardly worth fighting for. During the dance scene where Zhang Zi Yi wins them, the guys look stupid more than admirers. <br /> <br /> Japanese people have more intensity than Chinese people, and geisha are Japanese culture. I'm sure Chinese have something similar, but faces are not the main match. Anyway, the dialogue is so unmysterious, so American. There was a European doing it with the Eastern Europeans, they would do a better job. <br /> I have add: it looks most of the people who liked the movie is American. Sorry to say, but not surprisingly. All spelled to you, not instinctive, not passionate. I think the Chinese actresses are beautiful, but I could not say they were good actors in this movie. Yes, the movie is great, but really, I can not see how it can be seen that these characters are complex, deep people. <br /> I'll see Japan real things. I'm sure that would be amazing.
