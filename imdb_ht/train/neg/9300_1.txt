Spoiler Alert Well I think this movie is probably the worst film ever made. Probably in the style of Ed Wood (without the heart). Lightning is terrible. The music is very bad (piano and org ... come on!). The act is ... well there is no act! <br /> There is a guy who actually goes to the wild to search for his wife miss him and take time to have sex with a stranger. <br /> The assassin is a fat, incarnated clown that could not surpass a turtle! <br /> <br /> Each member of the cast is stupid and the director puts every cliche in the movie slashers in the movie without effort. <br /> <br /> The end is so far the most stupid ever made. Think about it: The guy (ken hebert) who acts skill is about the same as writing it (it is the brain behind this flop) invites a co-worker and two of his friends in his cabin to end week-in and kill them. .. On Monday morning he goes back to office as nothing happens. <br /> <br /> The tragedy is that Mr.Hebert tries to believe that it's a family affair that goes on for generations (her uncle is clown stupid) <br /> So, of course, NO cops will be His question after his co-worker goes missing ... <br /> <br /> Whatever. <br /> <br />
