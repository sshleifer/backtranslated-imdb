I can not stand the most realistic show and this one is worse than the one with Paris Hilton, and make sure it's his company. But "have you been fired" or "you are hiring", for how many seasons now? After watching the show I would not want to work for the guy and his months, it all and I think watching dry paintings have more fun pipes. <br /> I would like to hear just one person woke up "Donald I left and took some of your money and bought a decent hairstyle". I see him trying to buy fame in the WWE struggle. I hope he gets hurt so I do not have to see her tacky face again. It must be sad to want to fame very much with no talent and make a donkey in your head trying to buy it. I would give this show a negative mark if I could but it gets a 1 and it does not deserve it.
