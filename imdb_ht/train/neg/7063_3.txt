The guy made a lot of design titles for a bunch of movies and I guessed a day he said; I should choose a cheap storyline, try to put as much title into it as a case (cause after all I'm a title designer) and try to convince people that this is in fact a movie. One of the worst I've even seen this for sure. If you are promoted to see beautiful titles, go check out some posters by wasting time you watch this. <br /> <br /> It's ironic as you think, did you see the poster? The only part of his project that has job work has almost nothing!
