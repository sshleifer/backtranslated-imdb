The problem with family theater is that, out of TV movies on all channels, most people do not want to watch them. And those that make their look tend to be sensational and current or topical issues or issues in the news (or recent news). Movies explaining or exploring the human condition is not popular. Particularly with the young people who might be the fan of Mr Lohan's or the smaller people who tend to make movies not simply popular but financially successful for the studio. The specific issues I've had with this movie are the design of some of their characterization. It was a bit much to blame all the Loan's act-driven characters (demolition of the car, drug use, etc.) about what his father did. While not possible, it's just a bit of a lot to expect the audience to swallow. In addition, other aspects, such as giving the young man Mormon, oral sex, or that he would actually make a good assistant to the vet, who hurried to have something for his mother, etc., all these elements they just did not really help this movie together. He put it more into elements of a comedy situation trying one of "special dramatic episodes" then he did for a fully realized, well written writing film. <br /> <br /> When watching the DVD and listening to the next, particularly for the various endings, you can really see all of this is to focus sharp.
