Fine performance and art direction does not make a good movie. This movie is so manure and depressing, I could feel absolutely no happy at the end of the "happy" involving the union strike. The humorous attempts to involve Lake pregnancy are absolutely disastrous, and any movie involving a Baldwin fee already has a strike against it. On a positive note, Lang is still one of America's great actors, and almost makes this worth keeping in the VCR. I give this a 4.
