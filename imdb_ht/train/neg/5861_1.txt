I saw this movie when it first came out in 1978 when I was a high school sophomore. I took a date to see it. I did not find any, "Useless says, because the movie was so bad! Joan Rivers' career never fueled as seriously as it deserved to do this terrible, unfunny malfunction. In fact, unfunny is not a serious enough term: this movie is ANTI-FUNNY! You walk out feeling like any laugh that could be done to beat out before it might happen. This is not worth watching from curiosity, or out in any sense of it being "bad-it-good." Not even the gang of MST3K could do this worth seeing! The fact that Billy Crystal's career survived this early suicide attempt is a miracle.
