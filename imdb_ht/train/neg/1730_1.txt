First of all I would like to point out that I know only in the show because of my younger sister. I find it the most annoying program on television. There is nothing funny about any of the 'jokes' and the laughter of boxes is unbearable. The show would work best if filmed in front of a live audience. In this way the street would show just how 'unfunny' the show is. However, I give talent credits to act in the youth cast. It's ill I however think they'll look back on the show in the future and see how bad the first TV shows were. Links are shown in good and voiceless overall annoyance with style of the CBBC presenters. Why young people in today need to call loudly in much is beyond me. That's all.
