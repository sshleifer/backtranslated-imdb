"Sleep with the Enemy" is a predictable, 'in front of' thriller who never seems to find any inspiration no matter how desperately dropping and trying to crew. I can not believe a bunch of friends I've been told to see in this movie some sixteen years ago. The complete lack of originality from the Ronald Bass Scenario (based on the novel Pri Nancy) does not help or makes the sting of Joseph Ruben or the very average performance of Julia Roberts. Throw in support including Patrick Bergin and Kevin Anderson do little to help. <br /> There really is not a lot to say. Just give it a miss. <br /> <br /> Sunday, April 14, 1991 - Hoyts Cinema Center Melbourne
