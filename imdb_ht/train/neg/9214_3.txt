Many things become clear when watching this movie: 1) The act is awful. Tom Hanks and Wendy Crewson are so-so, but the parent-child conflict is soooo opera-ich. The other two boys: a childhood prodigy pupil with stereotypes I-a-babe-but-I'm-truly-sensitive-inside blonde dreamboat; 2) The movie as a whole is depressing and irritating; 3) Robbie's dreams and the disturbing episodes (acting by Tom Hanks); 4) Inclusion at the start of their love ballads is an odd choice ("we are all special friends"); 5) The strange lines and side cemetery were not made any better by the terrible act; and 5) this is a really bad movie. Expect to be ashamed - and probably disturbed.
