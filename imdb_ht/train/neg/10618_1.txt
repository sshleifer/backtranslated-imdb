The film is a very serious thing, and it's a victim of rape. On the surface, it can be a daring movie on rape, but if you dig under the surface, what lies is a not-positive message about rape. Aishwarya victims of rape are shown to be a negligent victim who can not cope with all because she is a woman. He needs a MAN to help him. When society makes jibes on it and launches comments in it, it does not stand for itself. It is all that let Anil Kapoor do all the talk while Aishwarya makes all the weeping. The director (Satish Kaushik) goes down the wrong path to portraying a raped victim as weak and submissive. What would be most effective is to describe a strong woman who rebels against her enemies in a courageous way. The director is famous for being chauvinistic. Its films are usually filled with weak women but it tries to hide them from controversial roles. It needs to learn that just because the role is controversial, it does not mean that the character itself is strong. <br /> <br /> The most degraded scene in the film is when Aishwarya 'cleans up' herself after just being raped. She is pleased to please her father who thinks she is now dirty. Though it is ridiculous that Shah shows the stigma against rape victims in a big light, it does not show us that if Ash's father was wrong to have his daughter do something like that. So we left with a confusing message about rape. <br /> <br /> The comedy too is not needed in a strong subjects like this. Even so, the comedy is simply not funny. Ash is wild in his role while Anil Kapoor does not do anything but call. The music is mediocre except for the title track, which is very well picturized (only the brightest point in this movie). Sonali Bendre's role is disappointing and pointless. Overall, what could be a great movie to remember to end up being a mish-mish terrible that will give some serious indignation viewers.
