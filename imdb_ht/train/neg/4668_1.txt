Extraordinary dung in film, set during the 19th century, failed to produce. With great non-actors like Maggie Smith, Albert Finney, and many others, there was no reason for the movie to fail. However, the movie was missing a sequel, there was a sorry excuse for a drawn line, and dropped into pieces with its continuity. A typical story of a rich girl with a poor boy, brought along with love and destroyed by beauty (or lack thereof) and disapproval, has a touching side of a mother's death and a absent father. The father, played by Finney, is a man who affects his daughter's death as well as death. She believes her daughter's lack of good looks to ruin her fortune by getting married under social conditions. The actors tried to save what was left of the scenario. Washington Square is a black hole in ruin and destruction, wasting precious time in those sad sadness. I give this movie a 1 instead of a 0, purely for the actors' attempts. Save yourself, stay clear in Washington Square.
