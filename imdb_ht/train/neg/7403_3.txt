This was not the worst movie I've ever seen, but that's as much as it can be said about it. It starts off with some good atmosphere; The hospital is suitable sterile and alienating, the attitude is set to "weird". Then ... there is nothing. Well, maybe. Just some that clearly do not fit into ... and no effort has made clear the connection between comics are scarce and yet not particularly intimidating, and the hospital being taken over. I mean, come on, biker dudes? Some band watched a little too gwar. <br /> <br /> My favorite one was the devil himself, which seems rather a lot like a middle-aged truck desperately trying to threaten, while looking like it would really love to prefer to fall down on a Afghan-covered beds, defeat his belt, pop a cheap beer case (probably Schlitz), and watch the game. Honestly, I've seen away from scary aviation. In truck. Drink coffee. WWWwoooooohHHHHHoooooooo !!!! Scary! <br /> <br /> Other monsters are even more cartoonish, and even less scary. At least, on the DVD, the videos provide some explanation of their presence at the hospital ... they are apparently just randomly pop up in places, playing some "metal" bippy, and causing people to die a bit. Prevent a few good special effects, and acting that is not totally awful given a lack of decent writing, there's just nothing here. It's just a background-sound movie.
