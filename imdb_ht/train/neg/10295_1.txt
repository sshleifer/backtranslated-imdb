There are a lot of pretenders who are going to pretend that this is endowed with some kind of beautiful meaning, and similar fools like me do not 'get' it. It is obvious this means that we should stick to Hollywood grate. It has all, a-ride, skating skating in the book - I guess it's good that the director is one of the few choices. Almost a parody self drowned in its own loyalty. The director of (almost equally embarrassing) movie 'Ratcatcher' returns with another roller coaster in artistic nonsense; It is difficult to understand and apparently a study of alienation. The best way to describe this movie is alienation for its viewers.
