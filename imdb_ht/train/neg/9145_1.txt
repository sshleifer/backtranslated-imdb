Let me first state that I love watching "bad" movies. It's funny how some of these films leave more of a lasting impression than those really superb. This bad movie is in a bad way. This machine for Sam Mraovich's exemplar is not just the boundless talentless incompetence, he has redesigned the meaning of many of these words. This should be forever the barometer for bad films. Sort through the Mendoza line for film. Mr. Mraovich writes, directs, and stars as Blunt Arthur Sailes objects battling wives to apologize to Christian forces in evil as he and his partner Ben "dying behind their eyes" Drawing on marriage equality. As a libertarian I believe gays should have the right to marry. Ben & Arthur do more harm in causing than a host of homophobic. Portrait of all these Christians, so ugly and charming-fisted, trademark Mraovich, that you can not possibly take any of them seriously. Victor's brother Victor, the Bibles toting Jesus freak, so horribly over-the-wrong / gay girl that you must wonder how he was cast into that role. That's because Sam "Multitech" Mraovich has also filed the director. The worst of it all is Sam Mraovich himself. When do you think that the leader of the words, balding, and chubby come to mind? Sam also delivers lines such as domino's pizza, cold and usually wrong. The final tally: you suck in writing, directing, acting and filing. This Ed's Wood Quadruple Crown. Congratulations you terrible little man.
