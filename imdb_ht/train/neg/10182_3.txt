Well, just do not read the title you would think it would be a good movie. Well, at least I did. It started out good but became so boring after the first half hour. * * <br /> <br /> It tells a story about a mother who is so desperate for her daughter to become a cheerleader that she will go through any length to get what she wants. The only problem is that her daughter's friend is the girl in the way. He still has the competitions, therefore, pushes the mother further towards "eliminating" her. After you talk to a "Hitman", the mother decides that the girl needs to be stir up a bit. So the actions take but it eventually gets caught. <br /> <br /> Throw is horrible and the movie is flying over too long and nothing happened. Do not waste your time watching this. <br /> <br />
