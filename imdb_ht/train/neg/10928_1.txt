Just see this movie, and what a waste of time. The movie was predictable and slow. It's basically the Mormson bad bear that plays basketball sanctioned church. Rather than watching this movie, I should have a root channel. The comedian's performance was obviously driven by sponsorship / funding. This film was potential due to the outrageous behavior that was exposed by Mormons when playing basketball sanctioned churches, however because it's rated PG, the true nature of the spectacle could not be transferred to film. The act is horrible with the exception of Clint Howard and Fred Willard. Thurl Bailey's appearance in the film was completely needed.
