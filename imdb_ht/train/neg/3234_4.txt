Well, how do you even rate for a movie like this one? Does he even have the value of cinemas really? It's a movie that tries to get as close to being a movie movie as possible. Basically the entire movie is purely a bunch of guys torturing a young girl. Not very appealing and on top of that too realistic. <br /> It's obvious that the movie tried to be as realistic and shocking as possible. However the movie is just all too fake for those outdoors as intended. The slapping and stumping are all soft and fake looking, as well as sounding. They are often just kicking off the floor, rather than in the girl, obviously. Also the way the girl responds to all the torments is very tame. I mean if this was real, surely it would have been called out. There is more to cry than scream at this one though. The film is obviously low budget and it's a valorous attempt in trying to achieve something shocking and realistic as well as original and provocative, with very limited resources. Do not really think that this movie has made a lot of impact even though at the time it was released, even though it had to do something well, since a total of six end was released afterwards. <br /> <br /> Fans of Shock and Gore will be more likely to be ashamed of this movie, though there are still some fetish people out there who will get a kick out of this movie. <br /> <br /> 4/10
