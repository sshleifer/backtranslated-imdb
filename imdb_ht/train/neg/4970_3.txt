Good folks, I stumbled upon this movie in the evening while I was pissing notes. My academic specialty in Anglo-Saxon literature, and I can say that no one ever makes the genre the honor she deserves. The Icelandic "Beowulf and Grendel" are the least offensive I've seen, and I've paid $ 3.00 for my copy. This sci-fi version hangs with the version of Christopher Lambert. Yuck. <br /> What did not I like? CGI for one. Amazing bad. More importantly, it is the loyalty of the scenario, not to mention the vibrant act. I use both the versions I've seen. <br /> <br /> Deliver Whatever, Peter
