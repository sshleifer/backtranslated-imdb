I was thrilled to watch this film awaiting her to be the classic cult end of the "Private Lessons" showing the dream of any male teenager. <br /> <br /> "Private Lesson II" has nothing to do with the title I mentioned. It's just a regular soft-core Cinemax shouting film that will not make a change in your life. There are only one hot sex scene in a three but this one. I've watched this a long time ago but believe me, this is just a regular boring soft core core. <br /> <br /> Women are hot, but that's not enough to rent or buy the movie. My advice is to watch this only if it's broadcast on cable.
