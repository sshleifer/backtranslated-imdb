I recently saw this in the 2009 Palm Springs International Film. This is the length of the model's first model of Dutch actress Monique van de Ven and Dutch-born Dutch veteran and based on my observations it should be his last. I hate cinemas that are so implausible that you are choosing apart almost every scene. This movie immediately lets you scratch your head. as it starts a young photographer and his girlfriend who works for an international aid organization to have a leisurely drive in the Taliban Mountains to control Afghanistan who have a conversation about their love when a missile stops a truck ahead. They get out of the cars to look like Talliban Fighters equipped with rocket launchers, machine guns, rifles, pistols and grenades executing all five people in the truck. Bob (Waldemar Torenstra) begins to take photos of this thing when he was spotted by one of the insurgents gaining a grenade but who killed his girlfriend. since they and their sending distance can not be more than 50 yards away yet it somehow gets away. Her girlfriend is blown and takes a picture at the time of grenades' impact that kills her and wins a price as photographer of the year for the photo. Each scene and situations in this movie are as ridiculous as it's opening. The following year, Bob found himself on National Geographic placement on a Dutch resort island where he met Kathleen (Sophie Hilbrand) and insisted on his midnight saddle to international drug smugglers. Avoid this movie. I would give it a 4.0 out of 10.
