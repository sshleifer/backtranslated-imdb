If you are going to try building tension in a movie it is still a good idea not to build it beyond the total tedium point. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately the Butcher Brothers have not picked up this again. > <br /> This film sucks, unlike the majority of its characters (if you did not work out vampires in the first few minutes then shame on you) preferring stringing up the luxurious supply of 'no one knows where I am' cheerleader quality with homosexual drifters that puts a good one with a fast food swagger, than the isolated doors. <br /> <br /> The only small original origin of the plot is how these vampires become vampires in the first place but the rest of it is funny and sloppy. Force up rods (as opposed to opposite) on a regular basis due to the tastes to fill the basements and blood bodies, they are really not too bright. If they were fed victims, they could clean their own small farms and could cut off on the mortality rate, thereby allowing them to settle and get chintzy. Why the producers felt it was necessary to introduce twins and homicidally homosexuals to the older brother I'm not sure. He added zero to the plot, which was unfortunate provided that there was not a big deal of scheme to start with and there was no value at all. <br /> One never said why parents were dead, unless of course explained during one of my frequent breaks. Clearly the worker must have been warned in the family for some reason or another but again, for the viewer to write their own reasons. <br /> <br /> Only the well-rounded character was the little brother who appeared looking like Pugsley from the Adams family. Indeed it was way too rounded, with the appearance of a child who was inadvertently wandering into a Watchers' class of a very bad movie superman. Oh sky, he's got. Never loved, there is another donut and a yummy smell.
