I just saw Dick Tracy and I thought it was terrible. The paintings in the background of the cities look horrible. Also, the mob characters looked too weird. Warren Beatty did not do a terrible job like Dick Tracy but was definitely not one of his best performances. Madonna should just stick songs. Glenne Headly has done a great job in this movie. I gave this movie a 2/10 just because of the amazing act by Al Pacino. It was not a high score in his career but he always did a good job.
