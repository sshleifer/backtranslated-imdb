I rent this movie just to see Amber Benson, though after the box I thought he sounded like a good story ..... however the first problem was that there really was not a story ... or actually There was a story but it did absolutely no sense. The second problem had no set up for these characters ... yes I got that they all went to school together, but in the first 3 minutes of the movie you realized they had nothing else common and did not like each other ... so why were they still getting together. Defective number 3 ... the director even though pauses and camera shots are equally suspended (especially with the typical armed suspicion of the music) ... it was sadly mistaken. It was painful to watch a terrific actress like Amber Benson waste time trying to bring this back to life ... only my hope is the money he's made here to put in the direction of producing his own movie.
