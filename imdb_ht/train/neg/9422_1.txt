This film describes the experiences of a couple of hit people (one of them Burt Reynolds), a whore, and two Queens dragons on the interval in a few hours at one night in Miami. Converged stories are eventually bringing all the people together in one place and time. The film was mildly fun, but the big problem was that everything happens at night and many scenes were literally under-exposed to the point that it was impossible to see what was happening. In a few scenes you can actually see where they tried to "stretch" the process developed to save the images. Someone did not know how to operate a movie camera. Amazing that this movie was released!
