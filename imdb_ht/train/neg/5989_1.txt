Wow I paid Â£ 3.50 to go this movie to the movie. Cant believed I was wasting my time. The act is the worthy crite and the special effects are bullies. Probably the worst script in history is a very embarrassing quotes I have ever heard in my life. I swear by God 'Sweep' is better than this. Madonna should have won with Oscar compared to these guys. An hour and a half in my life I want to go back. Honestly not seen this, even small children would get this movie a insult to their intelligence. I found this movie very strange in the fact that he was told to say who is more wooden, theses guys here at the current puppets. Fun guy does not waste your time on this movie you will live to regret it.
