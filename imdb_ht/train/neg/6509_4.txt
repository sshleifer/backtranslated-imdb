Sean Bean is great, as is the photography, place and costume. However, the draw is a bit blocked, with the conclusion flat. The plot was substantially changed from Cornwell's novel, and not the best. Unfortunately, this adventure is best to watch. Sharpe was too narrowly drawn here, in contrast to his literary month changing, which seems most intelligent and determined despite his arrest in his new role as an officer promoted from the ranks. I really enjoyed the short scene at which Sharpe cheated by a "real" officer, and after a quick pause and piercing, pushed the surprising officer and cow right back. It sets the tone for later track as a commander officer. <br /> Rating: "4" to "10."
