First, let's all agree that Lorenzo Lamas can never be regarded as a skilled actor, barely even decent, sometimes just plain distressing. However, at this @ @! ^ Calling SnakeEater, the film industry as a whole dive. <br /> <br /> First, let's start with the plot. A Vietnamese veteran called Jack Kelly, aka soldier (who is supposed to be as difficult as a bracelet in leather and then some, which you can believe when she shoves a palace in nails of 2 guys and pins in floor), gets the words that her family died and her sister kidnapped. Therefore, he goes on a solo mission to save his sister. There were some potential, but still very thin to begin with. <br /> Now the act. Being an actor myself, I qualify to say that this was some of the actor WORST in the history of the art !!!!! Lamas is, well, itself. The Jackas who play the trumpet / The rescued rescuer should be nervous and firing for their so-called performance that they insult actors everywhere, especially talent that never gets the big breaks! <br /> <br /> Finally, the action. Gunfighting is so-so at best, and the point fights is deplorable. I saw more real battles in the Renaissance Festival (and these were very fake-looking)! <br /> <br /> Reader, listen to me: AVOID PIECKE in CACA in all currencies! IF it was the only movie of existence, you always want to avoid it! For your brain-cell counting, do not look at this!
