I do not know where to start. Tara Reid needs to be suspended before she has put in another movie. Stephen Dorff seems to have received his character's motivation from Val Kilmer's "Top Gun". Slater sleep in this trot. The direction, correction, sound (we really need a heavy video in the middle of a gunfight?), Costumes (flying ballet and muscles on them), and hey, no discernible trace either. He surprised me that no one attached to the project stopped, saying, "Sir, this just makes no sense, let's start over." Hopefully the Slater career can relax from this disaster. <br /> <br /> But down the worst movie I've ever seen.
