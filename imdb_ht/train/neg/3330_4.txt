This movie features an o.k. score and performance by David Muir as Dr. Hackenstein. Early and late credit shows along with most of the actors and "special effects" that this is a low budget film. There is nothing in this film that you could not get to other mad scientists, horrors / comedians, or low budget movies. Not special for any nude scene entertainers or bad movie lovers either. This movie is simply here. Anne Ramsey and Phillis Diller are nothing to get excited about as well. If you are curious as I was and can actually find this, you will realize the truth in the sole lines of the line.
