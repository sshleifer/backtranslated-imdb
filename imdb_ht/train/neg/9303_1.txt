I am writing this review that has been observing it several months ago ... The trailer looked promising enough to buy excuses for this tram for a movie. It's a complete joke .... and literally a spit in the real-world fascination of the early generation of horrors like Texas Massacre cheat (1974) that they even had the gall compares to himself on the back of the art covered . The producer who played Brandon should go to flip burgers and serve up fatty hamburgers .... hell he might not even be good at that either! The illumination was bad bad and a great annoyance in the movie you could not even see the actor's face sometimes. I do not even remember the rest of the cast members really sad, the bad ones never did anything to impress you to make them memorable. That's all I'm going to waste on this review PLEASE stay as far as you can from this pile of junk even if you get it for 25 cents by making it buy s gum pieces at least IT would keep you entertained! br> <br /> If you want good quality low budget budgets, far better than that ... then check out a movie by Jeff Hayes .... because it takes talent to make it into horror and the kid read it! br> <br /> I gave this 1 star just for the art covered .... thats the only thing worth sympathy this so-called "movie" <br /> <br /> -Rick Blalock
