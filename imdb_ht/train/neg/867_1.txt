I was hoping drastically for this movie, though it had a bad review of the paper. I was very tolerant, and sat in the entire movie. I felt sick at the end. Although I'm not in most cautious or particularly sensitive to movies without taste - I enjoyed both Woody Allen 'All You Ever Want to Know About Sex,. 'and Michael Hanneke's funny game - I found the manic directors' and this ten-year-old wants to drink women's woman totally disgusting. But when the movie climaxed into an "orgy" where the boy blows both his mother's milk, as well as that of the woman he was lusting after for the whole movie, I almost vomit and disgust for the total pervertion and sentimentally pop that he is. <br /> <br /> Do not get me wrong, I enjoy the vast majority of European cinema, as well as independently making films, so this flicker movie should be happy to enormously. Avoid this film at all costs, it should be relegated to the stories in History as a lesson in bad movies.
