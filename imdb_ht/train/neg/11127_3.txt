I'm not sure what Diane Silver thought when she made this movie, but it obviously had nothing to do with Richard Wright's novel, which is the movie based. We read the novel this past summer for AP English 12, and just watch the movie. During periodic note-taking and checking the timer, I consider the chance to be hit by lightning. Of course, the sky was completely clear, and I was forced to watch the rest of the movie ... and then write a 5-paragraph essay on it. <br /> <br /> Roman Wright discusses very real terms, in the mind of an assassin and the psychology behind it. Silver's film turned a murderer into a victim, which is NOT what Wright wanted (see: "How Bigger Was Born" 454). <br /> I'll do this short and sweet: if you want to leave your conscience, in Raphael Lambert's words, name, skip the movie and read the book. Adaptation of 1986 is not thought-provoking material. <br /> <br /> :: sigh :: Now I have to write the essay.
