Every year I watch hundreds of movies, including many low-to-be-abusive abdominal budgets that nobody in the right mind would ever want to see. I saw thousands of movie in my time, very excellent, very forgettable. Zombie Nations I'll remember forever as one of the most horrific movie 'Thunder' I've ever seen ?? In fact I still have not recovered from the experience of watching it. <br /> <br /> The next day, it looks like some kind of strange dream. Did I really see what I thought I saw? Why the police work out of a warehouse? Are the voodoo priests really recommended that the 'zombies' eat cheeseburgers? Is it safe? Is it safe? Is it safe? <br /> I would not recommend zombie nation if you want to see a 'good' movie, and I would recommend it as 'so bad good' it. However, if you are entertained by the prospect of watching the movie abysmal independence ever? this is for you. Now anyone who asks me what the worst movie I've ever seen is, I'm going to tell nation zombies. I think it's a major crime to make a boring movie than a bad one, and Ulli Lommel deserves credit for producing a movie that actually stuns you and its incompetence. It really is Jr Ed Wood in the digital age, and I for one can not wait to see if he does another film as always ridiculous as this one.
