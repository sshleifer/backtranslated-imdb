Ok, I've stuck this TV off and misses the very start. The movie was about 10 or so seconds in the titles (I suppose) so if anything happened before I missed it. Many people say Mark Hammill is in that I did not see him. I recognized Clive Barker, John Landis, and obviously Stephen King is doing some really awful act as the graveyard's assistant. Alice Krige looks beautiful apart from the scenes where she has the cat face or is in full foreign make-up .. Even with the opening titles she never really explains very well exactly what the Sleepwalkers or where are they from. From the title of the title I suppose they are fourteen bipeds that live by extracting life force from people. I suppose they live a long time with these particular ones 2 possibly the last of their kind. <br /> <br /> Add this a very large dose of incest (yes! I thought it was a little suspicious too), shapeshifting, killer and invisibility cat and you have Sleepwalkers. <br /> It's a very bad story with no real explanation behind the main character 2 and far too many cocks to try and distract from the simple fact that is not enough to explain the viewer. <br /> <br /> Avoid.
