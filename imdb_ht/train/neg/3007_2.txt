Well, on the endless quest for horrors, we'll come across this movie, apparently re-release on DVD lately for some reason not correct. The transfer is terrible and the quality just sucks. I do not think this is due to a bad remaster or something, I just think that the movie is wrong to do. Obviously filmed in an abandoned school with a budget that had no doubt wasted on cheap beer and no hacking talent, "Slaughter High" started out slow and did not pick up pace until about an hour inch. First, we get to see a 'nerd' as it is taken over by a group ... I actually do not even know what they were supposed to ... jocks? The chief, with his ultra-hooknose so ugly he should definitely have been cast like the nerd. Then there is a 'big guy' with a couple of dumb and chicks losers who are supposed to be 'hot' but not. It's a mystery why this group of rejects is picking on one of their own, but I guess the viewer is to assume these are 'cool kids' picking on a be. The casting options are horrendous as most of the high schools are played by thirty-somethings. As other reviews on here have been pointed out, the actors (if you can call them,) is a bunch of brits whose accents slip out many times throughout this piece of crap. We assume that the 'kids' groups are students only at this school, as the 'meetings' are only at school, which is now being shown to be abandoned, is fair to them. /> Kill them is lame, the gur is not great and the script is like Scooby Doo and real people; lines like: 'This place gives me the ramps ...' and 'someone gimme a beer' online ... It's just not good. Skip this one unless you are wasted with some friends and want to laugh in a real blame attempt in a slasher. If you want to see good, get the Bava "Blood donation," making 14 years earlier and a heck of a lot better. If you want to see a good slasher blaster, see "Just Before Dawn" or "Burning." 2 out of 10, children.
