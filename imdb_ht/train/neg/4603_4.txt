I was p *** ed when I could not see this one when she screened at the film Film Festival last year, so when I saw that she was going to be on the cable evening, I put it on reminding as soon as I could. So, was it worth the wait? Well let's return a tad as I have yet to draw you. Sean Crawley is a young man who does not know which way he is in life. Put Duke (George Wendt) who introduced him to his boss Ray (Danny Baldwin). One night Ray totally lays out asking Sean to the guy to have Sean following. And it goes from there. Leading me back to the question poses. Is it worth waiting? Yes and no, the rally was very good and George Wendt stole the movie for me. He just took the ball and ran with it. But it's nowhere near as violent as I led to believing and somewhere along the movies running time the ball is not only dropped, but fumbled and taken in the other direction. I know where this point happened exactly, but it can not be said without the movie movie. But the useless say it happened. The Finish does not save the movie either. Poor Stuart Gordon has nothing to do as "Re-Enhancer" or "Castle Freak". <br /> <br /> Where I saw it: extreme heat <br /> <br /> Candy eye: Kari Wuhrer shows his Ta-cup in one fantasy and then in the next plus ta-cup and he pan down with ... oh my god eyes my eye !!!!!
