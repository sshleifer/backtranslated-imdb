I remember that show. I always remember that kick the lucky ass kicking "America leaning people." Frankly it should be the title of the lame American or unfunny or outright people who are disgusting. Dave could not save this show and could not Bob Saget or the replacement army for AFV that came later. The Jackalope segments were hilarious and yes yes Dave could make some good voice audiences that were better than Bob's. But this show went to hell because of those who bengi video submitted submission submissions. Also it was developed as a bit of a variety of shows and lively guest stars including Olson Twins. Plus AFV was in its debut before they started picking ugly drooling as baby babies as the winner. Did I mention the videos were lousy and lame? But still the theme songs rock!
