Pros: Nothing <br /> <br /> Conspiracy: A female reporter runs into a hitchhiker who tells his story about the deaths of those killed by zombies. > <br /> Review: Never in my life I come across a movie like The Lost Zombie Story. Filmed on a budget of what seems to be about 20 bucks, TZC is a completely horrible movie that is relying on lame, careless actors who could not act to save their lives and this gurus is most more gross than scary. How does a movie like this get? Simply put, avoid TZC as a sexually transmitted disease. <br /> Last Last 2 My Cents: Humorously enough, this movie was made by a movie company called Brain Damage Filtration. Brains have really been damaged to come up with a craptacular movie like this. <br /> Rating: 1 out of 10 (If it was up to me, this movie would get the rating of negative bajillion)
