Snow White, which just came from Locarno, where I was lucky to see it, of course refers to the world famous fairy tale. And it also refers to coke. In the end, real snow in the Swiss Alps plays its party as well. So all three aspects of the title are addressed in this movie. There are a lot of drugs on stage, and there is also a pale, black haired girl - and a chef who has to go through all sorts of trouble to come to his rescue. <br /> But it's not a fairy tale. It should be a realistic drama located in Zurich, Switzerland (according to the tagline). Technically the film is near perfect. Unfortunately a weak scheme, foreseeable dialogue, a mostly real landscape and mixing the mix does not add up to creating authenticity. So, as a spectator I remain intact. Then there were the Cliches, who drove me crazy one by one: Snow White is a wealthy daughter with top class spoils - of course her parents divorced and she never has enough love from them, because they was so busy all the time. Her best friend, on the other hand, she has parents love and caring. They (an assistant and housewife) live in a small, poor, and cheerful - and ignorant of the desperate situation of their daughter is in the good guy (= chief) is a musician (!) From the french party to talk in Switzerland (which is considered economically less successful, but emotionally easier fraction of the country). He has problems with his parents. They are immigrants from Spain, who do not seem to accept his wildlife in living - until the father gets sick seriously and confuses him greatly admired for his son from a hospital bed. So it goes on: Of course, the drug dealer is brutally, bankers are crying, the club owner is a playboy and the photographer, although a woman (!), Has only her career in itself when she expelled the Snow White photos of pornographic art in a show. This <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> As I like other films by Samir, e.g. "Forget Baghdad," I was quite disappointed. Let's hope for the next one.
