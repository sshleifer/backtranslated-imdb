I am the guy who always holds the opinion of himself, but I just got back from this movie, and felt I was expressing my opinion. Let me start by saying that I'm a big fan of horror. But what makes a horror movie? I am sure to like to see even a little bit of a good script and character development. I know they are often lacking in horror movies, but Night Prom seems he did not even put out any effort in this department. And we all love suspense. That on the corner of your seat suspension and unpredictable surprises. Yeah, Prom Night was not there! Of course, we love a terrifying assassin. Prom Night Have This No, he has a beautiful boy and a beautiful 'knife'. But when everything else fails ... at least horror has its fun pleasure making it enjoyable like gore gore gore, and the occasional naked scene! Yeah, well when you have a horror movie rated PG-13 like Prom Night, they leave this stuff out too. So with all the missing elements, I ask .... this is still counted as a horror movie? Nope. I would call it more in a comedy. People in my theater have laughed more at this then when I saw "Semi-Pro" that was supposed to actually have a comedy (which also sucks, but that's another story!). I think I'm just going to have to give up on new horrors. All the sinister films are good on the good days of the rest of the studio films to make money. The people I went to see it and did not even know this was a remake! Which makes me angry! I wonder what will happen when no more movies are noticeable ??? Where will horror go next ???
