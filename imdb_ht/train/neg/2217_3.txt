As the faux-Russian scientist says two-thirds of the way in the film, "I came for the science." That's a lot of sum up why I watched this movie - anything that involves a half-man, half-handle shark definitely deserves a serious empirical investigation on the part of a fairly aspiring scientist. Or, as they say in the biz, my girlfriend's brother was remote and the rest is story. To say that the special effects were bad would be a bad in the field of special effects. This is 2005, it is not that hard film a car scene without a bluescreen cheese background. Yeah, this was good and state of the art when Hitchcock was filming the "birds", but in 2005 it just seems to budget. Spend me the cheap Sci-Fi attempt and make the service actually do an attempt at the desired suspension of disbelief. <br /> However, having seriously damaged the overall concept of this movie, let me tell you that, as sad as it may sound, this is probably worth your time. If there is nothing else, it is a journey of force in bad sci-fi - worth the education for the new movie film and certainly worthy of a refresher course for those who have seen a few movies in the days. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> "B" comes with Adjective Synonyms: this movie also pretty much to satisfy one of my continuous past - bad guys always wear sunglasses. <br /> <br /> If this was not 2005, I should suffer from the reality of this film was some sort of insanely poor metadata for the Cold War. I mean, you could as well have Khan on a Bird Klingon Bird in Prey wearing leaches in Chekhov's area. See Charlton Heston, "wait for Tom" as he tries to lift the helicopter to escape the earth. The thing is, Tom is wasting the bad sunglass guys and never-ending clip-it attaches Kalashnikov, or AK-47, to the layman's theme. <br /> <br /> As the mad scientist says near the movie end, "my goal is to evolve the human species" - it suffices to say that this film contributes only to a devastation of humanity. The weakened Freudian remarks are explained by the mad scientist as she prepping the female protagonist to be mated and a math shark is a simple reminder that even in the worst of science fiction we can all find something to laugh about.
