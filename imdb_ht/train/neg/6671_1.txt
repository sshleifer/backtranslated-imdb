I felt this movie started out well. The act was spot on and I felt for all the character status, though the true unity really was not fully revealed. We never have enough info about the dad really feel his pain for his involvement or build up for his animosity with Tobe. I mean in one scene you see him admire his prestige for dignity and to another scene he's just about to take himself off. Another problem with the movie was it just unraveled and lost all focus to the end, and I asked for it just got more and more. Any movie with such a long drawn out, and painful ending should never get an automatic rating of 7 or higher just for the act. We are looking at all kinds of movie experiences. In this case the end movie is so bad I seriously gaze just walking out of the theater. This movie pulled me through then just spitting me out.
