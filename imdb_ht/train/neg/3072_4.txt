Margret Laurence probably did not intend to have any of her novels adopted for film, let alone the Stone Angel. Hagar, as a character, was one who constantly challenged the social norm (gay dread, anyone?), And ended almost sacrificing his humanity in the process. The symbols of the book (the Stone Angel, Silver Thread, etc., etc.) are constant reminders of this old and new struggle, with the carnage (so to speak) along the way. While the film is reasonably faithful to the plot of the book (but it is not really a kind of draw-in storytelling, is it?), I think he missed the point on capturing the spirit of the movie. Discouraging the agar (for sake of challenge) was not there. Bram could be a lot more than bitter, and Agar's father could play more "traditionally," so to speak. If the film maker insists on painting most, the film would drive the point straight to the house. <br /> <br /> Together with the same vein, why should we see cell phones, organic products, and other modernization? Are we trying to make some points for the sake of making some points (for example, the girlfriend of the Muslim and the people). Hagar and co. is everything but politically incorrect in the book, so why should we see that in the movie version. Modernization can be an excuse for a low-budget operation, but using that as an excuse to send politically correct subliminal messages that are totally irrelevant to the novel (and the movie) seems like pushing the bottom of the intelligence. <br /> <There is also the audience. It looks like we were conditioned to see the bitter old man as beautiful and lovable. Why should laugh every time Hagar is emotional? I doubt Magaret Laurence wanted his readers to laugh at, or with, Hagar. These people are frustrated and they are full of bitter, and all we do is laugh at them. I do not think he did Agar and others in his situation any justice.
