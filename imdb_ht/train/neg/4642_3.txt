I saw "Rachel's Attic," thinking I should be in for an enjoyable associate, ride. However, he did not have to be the case. Visual, yes, but enjoyable? That would be a great, fat, no! In fact, the only reason that I gave him a "3," is due to the fact that Gunnar Hansen appears (ever so shortly) as one of the movie films. How was Mr. Hansen ever attracted to this piece of work, I will never know. The story idea is interesting, but poorly executed. The direction is pedestrians and the act is mediocrity. The only thing that is worse than that, is the special effect. YIKES !!! I've seen better effects in a play school. Give it, Mr. W, it's time for a career change ... I hear they're hired to Mel's diner! There are many, well-done, Indian films are coming from Michigan ... and the "Attic Rachel" is not one of them.
