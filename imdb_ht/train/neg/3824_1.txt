I feel the movie did not show Smith historically. The purpose of this film was to tell Smith's life in a way that would be "comfortable" to the LDS Church leaders, historic accuracy seems to have been in little anxiety. The film was designed to be a "faith promoting" experience, not a balanced view of Smith "as a man." I took it over myself to study Smith's life and read both LDS jobs and no LDS work. The film, like most LDS projects, was very well filmed and well-acting. However, this was not a realistic painter at either the start of Mormon's or Smith's relatively short life. <br /> A meaningful time has been given to reenacting an injury that Smith had when he was seven. While this event had no significant influence in forming his mental outlook, it appears that the main reason for including it in the movie is to help establish a sympathetic look at Joseph Smith. Another point is the Smith's film film is silently about Smith's involvement in magic practices during the 1820's. Another problem is that while the movie shows Joseph Smith's good-natured entertaining competition, she does not show how she sometimes loses her temper and becomes violent. <br /> I could go on and off. This film was not historically in any way and should be considered a movie movie about a man. I would not recommend seeing this movie for any other purpose then entertainment.
