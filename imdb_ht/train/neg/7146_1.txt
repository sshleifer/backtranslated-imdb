I'm just recording this comment (which pretty much echo some of the ones here already) The act is worse than subpar, explaining about stereotypes often occurred, some of the worst shows of similar female objects ( all bod is no brain) and it has some of the cheesiest lines known to humans. <br /> <br /> including, but not limited to "initially allowing to see what these guys can do" I should also mention that when they show crash involving innocent civilians, you end up feeling bad for the innocent people and begin to hate the characters themselves. Eddie Griffin's character is also one of the most stereotyped black guy people who just rub the way the wrong way. It may or may not be a good actor but this movie does not allow for the type of character exploration. Do you want a movie that leaves the audience on the side of the bad guys? Ocean 11. This movie just makes you hate the bad guys instead of capturing the audience. Even the machines can not make up for this film in a movie. That Enzo that Griffin breaks up this movie perfectly. It just sucks.
