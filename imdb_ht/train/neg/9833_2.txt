Misleading accusers, chips-chums John Wayne (as John Scott) and Eddy Chandler (like Kansas Charlie) have changed their identity to become "Alias ​​Smith and Jones". Mr. Wayne becomes "John Jones". Mr. Chandler is supposed to "Rev Rev. Smith" but Wayne calls him "Dr. Smith". There is no time to be one of them as fun as Roger Davis, Pete Duel, Jonathan Harris, or Ben Murphy; Although, Wayne may consider infinitely more successful than any of them, wise careers. Pretty blonde Mary Kornman (as Anne), grown-up in her day at our "Gang", is a wonderful interest for Wayne. He and Chandler have a couple of beautiful scenes with Wayne. If you're not a fan of John Wayne's budget films in the 1930s, this movie will not make you one.
