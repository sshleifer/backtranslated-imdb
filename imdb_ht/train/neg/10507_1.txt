OK to me with a friend rent this a few days ago because we like to keep track of b-movies since we have them ourselves. Anyway, the cover contains bloody and strangely looking naked girls and defenses and other things ... and Tom Savini! There is no way this movie can fail! Right? times !! It just looks like a waste! There was really no history, the dialogue was awful (that's anyone with xx 1000 !!!), the characters were .. well, they really miss any kind of personality ... The effects were awful .. and what and these long artsy shots of people are scared to run around doing anything .. and securing extreme eye and other things? We sat the whole movie waiting for something ... anything happened ... but no ... "Oh, here comes nymphs! Great! Oh .. they're kissing ... again ... and now for the violence OK ... nothing really happened ... yet ... oh, now they're running around ... with the crowd in sight ... again ... oh, heres Tom Savini Oh ... he died ... right ... OK, maybe now something cool or even interesting that will happen .. no .. oh! Cool! A head off! At the end ... oh crap. "And finally, since I'm so full of myself .. I'll tell you that! Give me a van, six actors, a strange looking house, Tom Savini, a couple of nude girls and defenses with bucket of blood and I could make the coolest movie you've ever seen ... I made movies with zero Budget in two days has the best effect, better acting with a script better than that ... what does Guy Guy do? Making cool movies is easy! It could be so great ... I'm really angry!
