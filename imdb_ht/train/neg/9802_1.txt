Many people here say this show is for the kids only. Hm, when I was a kid (about 7-9 years old) I watched this show first. It was disgusting to me. I talked to other kids about this, and, sure, show other and know what? This was the disguise measure, every time we wanted to emphasize something silliness (either on TV or anything else) we said "Uh, just like Power Rangers" and laugh. <br /> <br /> And before visiting this site I can not imagine that there are actually fans of MMPR. It was so strange for me that I decided to look it again and try to understand why people like it. I did not enjoy this look. But it shone on me: maybe I do not have enough imagination? It can. However this argument is not enough for me to rate it more than 1 star.
