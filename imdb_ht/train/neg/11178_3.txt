Firstly, I must admit that it is not a good movie. And I would never watch this movie if Pacino was not in it. The movie is about a 24-hour publicist. And it is too much work, dizzy, sick and sometimes regretful.I do not like the character at all. It's really boring, after 20 minutes you can fall asleep. And I do not understand why Pacino wanted to be part of this terrible movie. Just because of money or what? Since I'm a fan of Pacino fans, I bought this 2002 movie I know. If you have not bought it yet, do not even think about it, it's just a waste of time.
