I read reviews about this movie and decided to give it a shot. I'm an open minded guy after all and I gave good reviews of some pretty bad flicks. As the credit ends rolling on this one I searched for meaning and something nice to say. Here goes: "This movie was mercifully short." That's all I got. <br /> Okay, Okay. Their compositions and visuals were well done with the music helping to borrow from the attitude of asylum life but the film was painful to watch and the endless dialogue took away the good bits. I found myself laughing at this movie but the way you laugh at your best friend who just embarrasses herself in front of a crowd. By the time of the "chicken chicken" in the final I had just decided to tuck and roll with the movie and let their bodies fall down. I do not know what could save this movie. The act was not bad and it looked like it had a budget but there just was not any way to make it lookuz; not even the presence of beautiful breasts do. Perhaps I should have been spitting a doobie or drinking a lot of beer to get the full experience of the movie. Either way, I'm not watching this movie anymore unless I'm really depressed. Then I can say to myself "At least I was not in Dr. Tarr's Torture Dungeons." I'm better than those guys. '
