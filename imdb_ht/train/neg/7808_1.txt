I'm a big fan of Michael Madsen, so unhelpful, I bought this movie without even renting it or anything ... This movie was so awful, I did not even take it back to the store, I would not want anyone else to be subjected to this poisonous human, I just threw it into the trash, never mind the money, it was worth the price to be able to throw it away. The act was not that bad, it was not good or nothing. The story was terrible, and the end was something I despised. It was a broken man, alcohol. His life was a bunch of junk. I thought her horse, peanuts, was a terrible device to show her innocence, a dog would be much better. I also hate religion, so this end without a doubt my anger. Jesus heals all ... I hate knowing that people just like this are Christian and great Catholics, and time is showing that God does not heal all, or anything. It was a terrible movie, if you have the option to see it, spend, or better yet buy it, or rent it, and throw it in the trash, and leave the coffee bar on it in the morning
