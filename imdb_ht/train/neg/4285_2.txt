If you want to check out a good movie by Jason Scott Lee, I recommend the following: <br /> Dragon: The Story of Bruce Lee <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Timecop 2: Berlin's decision "is a terrible movie. Profitable production. Have fun acting. Awesome script. I would not recommend this movie to be watched by anyone who seriously believes that flipping like this is entertainment quality or American American consciousness advances in Hollywood (this movie is not). <br /> I would at least say so much that this film is entertainment on a rainy day if you ever come across it during the surfing channel. If you are curious, maybe a rental from Netflix, but this movie is definitely not for keeping. <br /> If you are one of the few people watching this movie as a way to increase your Asian American awareness, and have become ashamed, then I recommend the movies to watch your personal. These are well-written films and high production values ​​that feature a talented cast of Asian American actors: <br /> <br /> Best Morning Luck <br /> Mulan
