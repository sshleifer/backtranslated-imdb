A horrible movie! It must have arisen against some real stinkers to be nominated for the Golden Globe. They took the story of the first renowned female painter and mangled it beyond recognition. My complaint is not that they have taken liberty and information; if the story was good, that would be fine. But it's simply scarce - not all against the true story of this artist would make for a far better movie, so why did they come up with this damaged-dull water script? I suppose there are enough people not enough in the real version. He ran over to the end with a summary of the life of the artist - we could save ourselves a couple of hours if they would favor the rest of the movie with even fury.
