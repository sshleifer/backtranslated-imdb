I must agree with the very first comment: this film sucks very, very hard. Although there is a very large B-cast cast, the cover of this movie (for those who do not watch it on Comedy Central during a weekday that is probably exposed to only this film will ever get) try to put the blame on Dangerfield but in reality is just a check for every-got comedy from the '80s. Randy Quaid? Check. Ed Begley, Jr? Check. The Voice of Lisa Simpson? It can now say that Maximum Overdrive was not just terrible sticker: double check. And many, many others. <br /> <br /> The sadest thing about this movie is that it was so lazy to write and joke already-said. Nothing about this movie outside of its existence is funny. You better look for dry paint. This is definitely the direct-to-video scratch-bottom-of-the-barrel thing that still believes in the old video adage: cast an old-time star on the cover and you'll get some money back off of the rental. Viewing days of video rental locations, consider one of the recent examples of expelling garbage. <br /> <br /> Serve only this movie there if you're having fallen asleep. It will get you there.
