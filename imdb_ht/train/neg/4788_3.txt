At the third entry of the Phantasm series, Mike and Reggie continue to pursue the Tall Man, helping by a 9-year-trigger-happy, a black G.I. Jane and the deceased brother Mike (he died in the original phantasm). Number 3 is a rather disappointing sequel, since the Gore and Dark Actress is a much less inspiring and interesting as it was in Phantasm II. I got the feel of the stress simply put on Reggie's incompetence as a lover and his talent as stand-up comedy. The humor of the previous film was a lot more circle and oppressive, which fits a story like this best. Also, the settings are not as ridiculous here, the more presence of the Tall Tall (Agnus Schrim) is not as obvious ?? There are still many in hand, but not half as to satisfy this time. By the way, beware of the much off version as it shows the most delightful assistance on the screen. All the Phantasm series is the lifetime achievement of Don Coscarelli, who wrote and directed 4 episodes so far ?? The fifth was in production. The first is a classic semi-cult, the second is a horror-war and violence and the rest can easily jump. A. Michael Baldwin returns to Mike, though James LeGros describes his character a lot better in Phantasm II.
