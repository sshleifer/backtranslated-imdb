*** A from ten stars *** <br /> Because if she was, she became a F. Holy Mary Mary of God was that bad. I mean, I gave him all reasonable accommodation considering it was a video movie right, but he let me down at every turn. Like many other movies B, the basic storyline was decent and the filmmakers seemed to have a reasonable level of resources, but the execution was ridiculous. It's a shame to attach the good name of Halloween to this fiasco. Most primarily surrounded by some sleek, frat loving Halloween hosting bags, they are hugging deep home rocks, when a satanic poker book shows up from nowhere and jumps to the frat boys in a living hell. Well this is the idea anyway, but instead most of the film is devoted to show frat's boyfriend's show, there are plenty of an outrageous lesbian subplot. It is very little in the current story devoted to Halloween or the mysterious spell book. It actually made me angry that the movie makers thought they could get away and make such dribble. The movie is essentially about frat boy relationships. This is not that the movie is billed as. I'm tempted to dig under the producers and at least in very threatening and bodily harm. The act is about as bad as it gets, it's atrocity! The script is incompetently funny. Cinematography is just plain laughter. The whole movie is amateur night. This film actually makes SyFy song production look like masterpieces. The last hour of the film felt like the movie makers realized they were not producing a soap opera and thrown in some sort of horror sequences. The wrong spell book finally came into play and turned everyone into the haunting home of the characters dressed as. I almost feel as crying as I write this review. Wow! I mean wow! This thing was a decay of indifference.
