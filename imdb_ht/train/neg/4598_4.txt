Woman at a stage producer in London hopes to rally American singing-and-dance man to begin her latest show of her husband and a friend, an American girl who model her model model of circles society. Unfortunately, the couple has already met on their own, and the girl thinks the guy is actually the show producer to her friends (the fact it does not bring a wedding ring to discourage any misunderstandings!). Wafty Fred Astaire-Ginger Rogers music is eventually dragged back down on the ground by Dwight Taylor and Allan Scott's idiotic script, which is full of youthful behaviors. Astaire and Rogers do not just 'meet beautiful' - they encounter ridiculously (he tap-danced like an oven in the hotel suite above itself and complains). Audiences in 1935 probably did not care how these two were going to get together - as long as they did, and happily. Looking at today, the central characters appear to be no motivation at the end of each other's arms: he plies it with flowers (after telling his friends he wants to stay "fancy free" in the love department) and gives him brush -Off la. There is nothing that a little dancing could not cure! This twosome celebrity is as deliberately real as they are the London and Venice settings, but we simply look because the drives are Fred and Ginger. It's a fantasy to have-not ... those who do not mind the dumbed-down scheme. Music movements break down the monotony of the storyline, but do not weaken transient vibrations in the vicinity. ** from ****
