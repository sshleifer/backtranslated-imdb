With titles like this you know you get pretty much in junk. Acting bad. Script move. Bad administrator. Bad grammar. <br /> <br /> Movie Making Many Noises That Many Musicians And Many Callers. Movie makes bad racial stereotypes. Why come each movie and black heroes have addicted drugs? Why does hero come always to dance to be successful? Why come popular crap still have to be in dance film? Why letters "s" can not be titled? <br /> <br /> Hollywood needs to stop dumb down audience and make movies with people who have brain that knows how to speak English good. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
