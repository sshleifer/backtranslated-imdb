This is a German film in 1974 which is something to do with some women who come to a castle and beyond, I can not really tell you the goals or even what the purpose of the movie is. I can tell you that there are several women who are also Moonlight as those serving in this particular mansion, laying on paint and gyrate bongos as they were in the Goth Kit-Kat Klub, though, with which seems to be a good portion of the time running in this movie. Yeah, there seems to be something with devil worship and vampires, and there's some girls about girl stuff, etc., but the main focus seems to be the babies that are painted girating away in the basement. I did rather like the eyes-rolling of one of the main adolescent / devil mains, who lent an authenticity of the procedures and make it even more wrong-looking. Was this Wanda sick wrong (as billing in the credits)? There are no problems. If you're not too picky about your movie movie adore movie, you might like this, otherwise it's very dull and I could not even finish it, I was so bored. 3 out of 10.
