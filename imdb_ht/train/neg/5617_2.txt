This documentary film based on incomplete consideration of the evidence, in which Brian Flemming, maybe deliberately, neglected to mention important evidence of the contrary. Perhaps his most important mistake is one of the earliest: his claim regarding the invalidity of Paul's testimony about Jesus Christ does not consider important things, such as: Existence of some Christians in Paul's letters. These Christians suggest that most of the central claims about Jesus have already been formulated in faith statements perhaps in a few years of Christ's death and resurrection. ** The testimonies of early Christians can not just be off as only fantasy. There were indeed many who claim to be the Messiah during this period, but only one of them lived: Jesus. Why? Because it would have been preposterous for anyone who actually believed that Christ was the Messiah, and went to die for those beliefs, knowing that he was not resurrected. ** Even if the Gospels are more liberal, we are still talking about the accounts of Jesus written in their lives by other witnesses who would point out the evidences of the Gospels. And there is evidence that the Gospels were written earlier. <br /> What I say is Flemming's documentary is an incredibly partial piece with self-serving portions that harbor different arguments and evidence to serve his anti-Christian lifestyle. Do not be fooled by poor investigations.
