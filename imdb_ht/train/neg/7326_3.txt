This film has an interesting plot, but the act is quite bad and the script is poor. I was very disappointed. The moral dilemma facing by the main character is an intriguing one, but due to poor writing and filing this property that has spread loot. 2 of 4 others in the theater left after about 45 minutes and the other 2 were laughing at how bad the movie was. I stuck it out to the end, but I must admit I played Blackjack on my cell phone to make the past 30 minutes payable.
