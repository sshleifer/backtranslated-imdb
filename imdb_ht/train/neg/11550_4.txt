I knew I was going to see a budget low budget, but I hope most of Alex Cox's movie. Acting of the two leading men was terrible, especially the white guy. The girl should have an Oscar compared to those two. This film was filled with what I guess would be inside jokes for those movie industry and a few other jokes that I actually understand and make me laugh loudly, which is scarce. Without these laughter-out-loud moments I would give this movie 2/10. What happened to Alex Cox who made all the 80s classic? <br /> <br /> Spoil: <br /> <br /> There was a couple of questions I had after the movie ended. Why does the Mexican guy go to the other guy's home at the beginning? What was her daughter saying she got 100 people fired from her last job? Why did he break his own thing when he was upset? I guess I should go to Q & A after the movie, but I did not want to get up at 10am.
