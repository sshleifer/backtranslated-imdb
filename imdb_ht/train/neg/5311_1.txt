This is almost the worst movie you'll ever see! 2012 Doomsday now pulls the carpet underneath this one, for me. The heads are a perfect example of what Frank Zappa once referred to as 'cheepnis.' It seems that if the space scene was made at a power station 1950, just before demolition. The music is really absorbed. The act is wooden and ham. The characters they show are funding and compelling. The plot is predictable. It is immediately and brazenly obvious when copying techniques and ideas from other films. The quality of beliefs direction candidates. But you have to see it, if only experience what has to be one of the biggest waste in a small budget ever. This is a priceless example of a stupid movie!
