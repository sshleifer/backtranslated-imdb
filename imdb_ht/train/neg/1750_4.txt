Priyadarshan's HERA PHERI has been a wonderful comedy this situation however actually misses a story but is quite funny but logical <br /> In fact they have no proper story yet it somehow manage a nice sink even if it is not great <br /> <br /> The first half has 2 funny scenes as one in Akshay and John where Neha invites for a lunch and another time Paresh enters <br /> <br /> The first half gets boring slowly but second Half is funnier though they have no script <br /> <br /> The jokes are funny even if one asks how they never heard everyone's voice from inside the rooms? <br /> <br /> Confusion in the climate is treated as a step in step but it's quite funny but the movie ends abruptly <br /> <br /> Direction is okay Music is good <br /> /> Akshay Kumar excels in his part who is now becoming his second skin, but this is his movie completely and overshadows everyone else <br /> <br /> <br /> John stumbles at all and fails to comedy Paresh Rawal hilarious Rajpal is okay the girls and loud at times and left Nargis, Daisy and Neetu (only Neetu seen now) are good at party but shriek too often Manoj Joshi is okay
