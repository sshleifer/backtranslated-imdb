You can not imagine how I look forward to King of the Ant. As a massive fan of Gordon, I was waiting for European trials and antipathy. Particularly since I loved Dagon - Gordon - a lot. King of the ants premiere here in my hometown and Gordon himself has come up with it. Unfortunately, I could not go and congratulate her for her later. Kings of ants are the most inspiring and mediocre movie to date. Really, the quality level is never out of the ordinary TV-thrash standard. The scheme plot is very loud routine with the exception of a few poor scenes, the typical Gordon-touch never recognizes. On top of that, the script already weakens more than a Swiss bowl of cheese! It involves a young wannabe-thief that hires to commit a murder. So he does.and of course they're not paying him.and of course he falls in love with the victim's wife.and of course he denies himself .. Only the sequences in which the guy descents into a spiral of stuff The fools are worth a mention and they're the only ones that remind you of reality you're still watching a movie by Stuart Gordon. Their performance acts below the average and McCenna as the heroic lowlife, George `Norm Peterson 'Wendt as the Chubby Battal with Kari Wuhrer as the good-sex sex gum. Things are very seriously still and dullness in the story gets disappointing very quickly, while the make-up effects are not enough even satisfy fan-terror fans. I read some other comment on King of the Ant, claiming Gordon's best since it's finally a thought-provoking and mature movie. Well, if that's the case, it's a bit cool and give Re-Animator another look, you thank very much. Oh well, I guess all good guys run out of steam and inspiration eventually. So bad it also sticks to Stuart Gordon.
