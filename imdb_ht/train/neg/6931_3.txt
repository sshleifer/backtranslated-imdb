A rich guy around circa around 1800 wants to go to a nearby mental asylum to see how a famous doctor cares for his patients. Despite an initially hostile response, it is now cordially invited to and give a tour by the good doctor. And, as the doctor shows him about it, he talks with talks and talks !!! And as he speaks, loonies run amok here and have nothing specifically productive. While there are some actions here and there (and some of it quite disturbing), it's amazing how dirt and cerebral everything is - lack of life and energy, which is odd for a horror movie horror. Even a guy who thinks it is a chicken and dresses like one gets rather tedious. The more tour this visit, the more disturbing it gets until finally you realize that the prisoners have taken over the hospital and tortured the guards. But again, despite this twist, the movie is amazingly dead in many places - especially when it moves very slowly as a rare ceremony takes place or people are just wandering around the series. Only when workers from the asylum found in a prison cell, starving, the movie has any real impact. Considering this plot, it is certain it is hard to imagine making it boring, but the people who made this cheap movie exploit there! Now with the same plot and writing writing, acting with directions, this was an exciting and refreshing movie. <br /> <br /> You know, now that I think about it, this was the plot of one of the episodes of the original "Star Trek" TV show! You know, one with "Lord Garth - Master of the Universe" and Kirk and Spock are being taken captive by this crazy and uncle of his uncle. A final note: The movie has quite a bit of nudity here and there and includes a rape scene, so be recognized - it's not for kids. In fact, consider how worthless the movie is, it's not for anyone! However, with the version included in the "50 Movie Pack - Classic Chilling", the printing is so incredibly bad that it's hard to see all this due to the printing being so pretty black.
