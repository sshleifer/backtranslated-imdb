A common horror story about a luxury building in Brooklyn that hides the gates of hell. It is reminiscent of the Polanski "Tenant" (published a year before the "Sentinel"), but is too far from the film of the movie cinema in any possible aspect. The "tenant" was so disturbing, whereas the "Sentinel" is not all. <br /> What's more surprising from this movie is the cast: it's full of great names in American movies (Burguess, Gardner, Wallach), veteran actor acting for me (I guess). <br /> <br /> Adjwen: barely fun. <br /> <br /> * Me Rate: 4/10
