This was the Christmas movie I've ever seen. I took two kids to see it. It was the darker, most involvement of the family's family has no money, mother lost her job, dad died at the bank, robbed robbers robbing family cars with both children in the back and after high speed chase, drives at the bridge and the extract of the river. Mother left alone. No wonder it's Christmas spririt gone. Christmas angels do not save children who have drowned, and Santa does not bring back dead ancestors! I thought this was the bad message for sending the kids. Better say that no Santa than shows them a movie like this !!
