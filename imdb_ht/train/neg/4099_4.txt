Mulva is put in a sugercoma by Teen Ape. When she woke it in remarkably warm (the parts played by Debbie Rochon at the end of this), and went out for revenge on those who had hurt her. As the sub-title and art box implies this is indeed a take off the film "Kill Bill", but that's being a Chris Seaver movie, it's a satire incompetent satire (and I use that last term very injuries) I would like to say this is better than the first movie, but truths have said I was so impossibly drunk in my ass when I saw the movie before that I can not even expect to compare the two of this point in time. But I must have loved it since I bought the end (look when I drink I love, for lack of a better, complete and full movie movie) There's a little laugh out loud (very few) moments I remember Bonejack being funnier though. Well at least in a little over an hour, it's about warrior quickly for what it's worth. <br /> <br /> My Classes: D + <br /> <br /> DVD Extras: Audio Book by Director Chris Seaver, actress Debbie Rochon, and the Lbp Gang; Second Book by Seaver; 31 Minutes Made in featurette; Lloyd Kaufman's 6-minute tribute pays low budget photos; Fake 2 minutes of commercial syrup; stills gallery; Promo trailer; and trailer for: Mulva "," demand for salad eggs "," Fiilthy McNasty "1, 2, & 3; "The Man Feral", "The Bonesetter", "Midnight Skater", "Summer Demons" & "Splatter Rampage"
