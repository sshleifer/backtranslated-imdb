I'm a big fan of B5, it's been held on only the end of three seasons. I faithfully watched all the seasons before it was union, concluding that it was one of the most well-thought-out archers ever popping TV. Even the filler episodes were interesting. These films, too, were well produced and as fun as anything hit theaters. <br /> <br /> Which brings us to 'soul soul'. Of course, after all else, I had great hopes. Martin Sheen appears to be acting in a movie Ed Wood rather than a serious Sci-Fi story. The story itself, might look good in the shape of the description, even make it to the story board. However, it suffered obviously when it came time to complete this notion from a film of time. There is no special effect to keep us entertained in the absence of a compelling story. There are obviously short-time and just the dialogues to complete the story out. Had this been done the regular season, it would be rated among the worst of these episodes.
