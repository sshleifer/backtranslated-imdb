From a compromised conspiracy line that makes almost no sense of bad dialogue and disorientation scenes are the ultimate downer, malicious actor (even Peter Falk can not find his way) "Get Jan Christmas" is best left to lose. Ms. Bertinelli's performance is deep or emotional as its co-star, William Russ as brother Hank and David Cubitt as Noah's interest. Jennifer Pisana as Soccoro, Noah's grandfather is almost unbearable to watch alone sing songs. But who can blame them with such material. Script Michael J. Murray is the best youthful. <br /> Every year at this time I dig the TV guide and wait for some of the really classic Christmas films and movie inspirations displayed on the small screen. Films such as "Miracle on 34th Street", Ernst Lubitsch's delightful "The shop at the corner" and, of course, the 1951 version of "Scrooge". Frank Capra's classic "It's a wonderful life" and "Meet John Doe". Hey, forget the classics. What about "Home Alone" or "Home for the Holidays" and Holly Hunter with a great performance by Robert Downey Jr.? <br /> <br /> My presentation is not the way to advice. Time would be better than looking for these films than finding "Get Jan Christmas". Merry Christmas!
