Do not get me wrong, I love action and cops revenge, I've seen many of them since I was a kid, including the latest Dolph Lundgren "Mechanics" which is quite good. And Tony Scott certainly knows how to use a camera and even could be a shotgun and movie editing films. <br /> But with "Man on Fire" (and even more then with "Domino"), Scott shows that instead of using his film-making "genius" intelligence skills, he uses it puposelessly the show and offset a lack of material that material does not offer it. "Man of Fire" is close to 2 hours and half when it really should be at least an hour less. <br /> <br /> The way Scott shot and edited this movie also makes you wonder if he really wants you (the audience) to sit in his movie because his constant camera motion and flash really are a tortoise for the eye and let you want to leave the theater or turn it after 5 minutes into it. MPAAs and studios have skepticism regarding PG-13's assessment, violence and movies, and I also suspect that a $ 70 million movie is made in a B-movie script with a finger-cut character, putting a bomb on the mother a man's ass and neck but a guy with a shotgun, all this is the death of a girl who does not die! Go figure then why a studio will pass a better script because of the language or violence ... Thus says ...
