I just visited the Russian TV-channel forum that showed this movie. Well ... 99 percent of Russian active audiences are disappointed. We wanted to see more true reality in our space realization in this film. But the author was in mind something else ... :( We are great and beautiful country with intelligent people living here .We are proud of all our space dreams, realistic achievements on the one hand in this field and in science on the other hand so I would like to ask the author: Where are our LUNOHODs and where, where are our mIR stations? Ah? I'm sure LUNOHOD event was taken earlier earlier "Walk on the Moon" Armstrong and science sciences - I really have no time and enough space here! Our constructive criticism in Russian forum is on www.1tv.ru
