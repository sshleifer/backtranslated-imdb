If you simply look at the cover of this movie, it's cool. PA PA. The movie itself puts me to sleep. It has slowed rhythms, had minimal violence and poor use of suspicions. The acting was beneath the feeder material and the draw, while it would have been cool for a different film, they were wrong shown here. They even kill only the favorable character of the whole movie! I give it a 2 out of 10 because the only thing that was good was the plot twitch at the end. Otherwise, you might want to save yourself from this movie waste.
