I was really looking forward to this show giving the quality of the actors and the fact that the brothers were involved Scott. Unfortunately hope I was shooter! But again we have come to believe that the KGB is a group of human morals that have no sign of what they are doing. At one point there is a ridiculous scene where 4 KGB agents could not handle one CIA agent. I grow weary of these portions, a sided and completely incorrect portrait of the spy game that went through during the cold war. I find it ridiculous that the U.S. is incapable of making movies the goal of participating in WW2 and beyond. Just like the pathetic U-571, where we are led to believe that the U.S. finds the Enigma machine, again, fake. For its credit, the "Company" is very well filmed and acting. The premises are exceptionally well realized. Alfred Molina puts in great performance such as Keaton (the conflict between them is very well done). I really wanted to like this show and no doubt I will end up watching the other episodes 2 but I really want that US output would stop trying to show the spies, servicemen etc. as supermen that is largely intellectually and superior to anyone else on the planet. It gets old fast and seriously detracts from plausibility in what could be a 10/10
