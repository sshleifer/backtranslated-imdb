I saw the film trailer and it looked great, so I came out and bought it. What a mistake, the act is a shambles, the special effects (if you could call them), look like something that should not be out of place in a school play. Some of the characters are so stupid in this movie you will blow the minutes on the screen, which unfortunately is all common. As for a story, forget it. This is a warning, not wasting any money at all on this movie it must be one of the worst things I've ever seen. If, for some reason, you like this movie watching Troll 2, you'll probably enjoy that too.
