Well, TiVo recorded this because of Angelina Jolie. It has 2.5 stars. It seemed promising. He quickly descended. <br /> There are many overacting, even from Angelina. He is about 20 and plays a 16 year old. There are three characters to be Italian. All others are Italian Americans. Native Italian accents were good, I thought. The young man is beautiful, my wife says. All others in this movie are a female Italian fat. Even the guys. <br /> I should know that when Dick Van Patten was cast as a Randy doctor, that was a bad sign. Two couples chase the kids around them like the four Italian Stooges. <br /> <br /> My wife would not let go of the remote. We hope she has not taken makeup, dress or decorating advice. It was a sickly combination and braided in hideous and garish. It was hidegarishous. <br /> <br /> Cut off my left grim I was not enough to distract from the pain in watching this movie. If this movie shows on your TV, make yourself a favor and ram yourself on the TV screen instead. You will be glad you have done. The only movie I've ever seen was worse than this was "hamburger: the movie". Or perhaps "Deadly Friend".
