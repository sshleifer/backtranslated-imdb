I just saw the movie in the theater. The movie has some good points for you to talk about. Beauty of the Kareena and a couple of songs can be. That's it. The film is a complete disappointment in all areas. Anyone associated with the movie will be disappointed, even Indian Mumbai too (just now Chennai has made it's semi-final). <br /> But the worst I feel about the movie is the action scene. Now, Bollywood's day is trying to copy action scenes in Hollywood. But they forgot that Hollywood director took a great deal to make it seem like real. But unfortunately Bollywood director does not have so much time. They spend time on songs and advertising in the movie. Now these staged actions are too stupid to work in South as the audience just pays to watch their favorite actors killing bunch. But in Bollywood this is certainly not going to work. Every stage of action I wish I could send. At the very end some Chinese people appear to be nowhere to beat Akshay Kumar. This is the height of stupidity. Audiences do not pay attention to such sort. I think Bollywood should now forget about the action films. They can not do it. The last good actions I saw were from Ghatak and Khiladiyon Khialdi. The actual scene of Bollywood is really sad for action movie fans like me. Do you see these films after finishing? Can not they know that the slow motion action (which is done using code) is too unrealistic and childish? Better does not have action scenes if you can not handle it. I just want to go back to Amitabh's era where films like Zanjeer and Deewar had a thrilling action scene. The sound effect was not very effective in those days, but visually it is better than the current era scene. This film should now open the eyes of the Bollywood film directors. Please do not make any more movies, until you get the art of making it realistic.
