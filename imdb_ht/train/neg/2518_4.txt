Thinking a darker version of one of these kid shows as "Rangers" and you have this movie from 1990, "Robot Jox". A movie where you fight with giant robots, two people get into the arena and whoever comes out of the country wins. The robots are great and look like a little better version of the ones from said show mostly because they are less colorful so while this movie is not good, not all the bad ones look. There's as I remember fighting robots in this one, one that ends seriously with the final confrontation. There is a partial twisting part to traverse the part as an inset is revealed, but in the end the plot is nothing that will stick to you for any amount of time after the photo does. The battles themselves gathered giant games on the rampage, but still a bit fun to watch. This movie would also spawn a couple of other films and similar drawings such as the giant robots and the competition. So it's worth checking out once, but probably no more than that.
