The basic formula for the original set was; take someone, get the love hearing, then put them in mortal danger. This formula worked for 32 episodes that took place between 1964-68. <br /> Now we jump ahead 40 years for 2004. We present for Alan Tracy, a young school that's a bit less-than-college, and her friends, Fermat, a young-known reader -out. They whisked off by Lady Penelope in his pink Ford Thunderbird in the island paradise where the Tracy Family lives, for the school holidays. Almost immediately, leaving in care of Kyrano and his daughter, Tin-Tin also adults are going to deliver John from Thunderbird 5 that was damaged by a scene crash. This is the whole part of the Hood's plot to take over Tracy Island to steal the Thunderbolt cars ... <br /> <br /> To rob a bank! <br /> Yes. The plot is as lame as that! <br /> The dialogue is banal, the more wooden act than that of the (fiberglass) puppets, the effects, anything but special and Hans Zimmer's notes ??? Which little Barry Gray's glorious theme was shining in the room's substandard orchestras. The rest of the note was eminently forgettable. In fact, part of the note was issued the following week on the radio and did not recognize it! I did not even bother to keep witnessing the busted mediocre effort and the ending titles <br /> <br /> To be fair, Ron Cook worked well as Parker, he and Sophia Myles as Penelope seemed to be wasted. With the right material, they could show stoppers. The CGI work was what I would have been called leading edge - 5 years ago. The dynamics of the main craft were just wrong; The original model models at least moved as if they were masses <br /> Another worst point is that the entire production seemed to be a long series of product assortment, from each machine being built by Ford's content The entire Tracy Freezer produced by Ben & Jerry. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />! When Star Trek hit the big screen in 1979 and the 'Motion Picture', a whole new lease of life was borrowed from the franchise that then continued for another 20 years or so. With this movie, Frakes lacked a golden opportunity to do the same with the Thunderbirds franchisees. I predict that this film, like the 'Avengers' and the 'Saint' before it, will shed the obscurity within 6 months, leaving the original set of its 'classic' status.
