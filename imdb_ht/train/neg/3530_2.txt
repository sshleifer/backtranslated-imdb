When Ritchie first broke out on her movie film scene was considered comical, witty, well-directed and original. If someone could compare the hype he produced with his first two attempts and the universal practice of his last two clutter created one should consider - was Ritchie found out? Is it really talented? Is it really original originally original? Or is it simply a firefighting and egotistical director who really wants to make Fincher, Tarantino and Leone all rolled into one monstrous and disorganized? After watching a revolver one might excuse for thinking that he's all gone wrong? What happened to his great sense of humor? Where did he find all these ideas mixed and complicated from? Revolver tries to be smart, philosophical and succinct, she tries to be a smart psychoanalysis, she tries to be a complicated and complicated comedy. Ritchie has made a gargantuan effort to accomplish all the many goals and investing huge fragments into a script of existential musings and twisting many plots. However, in the end all that it serves is to build a very disorienting, unstructured and finally frustrous audience. His plagiarism is so blatant that although Ritchie does at least try to give his own spin it should be punished for even trying to pass it as its own work. So what the audience finally gets a terrible scenario multiplied and many firefighters and slave slaves. <br /> <br /> Revolve is finally an inaugural and bold movie that stole countless themes from leaders such as Fight Club, Usual suspects and Fucks. It aims high, but inevitably vacant vaccine. <br /> <br /> Revolve deserves to be lambasted, it's a really poor masquerading movie as a wannabe masterpiece from a wannabe author. However, it falls flat on her colleague's face and just fails in everything she wants and accomplishes.
