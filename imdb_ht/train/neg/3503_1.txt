But when I look at Sarah Silverman, I get the same results. I like original, humorous humor. But this woman is so darn B-O-R-I-N-G, annoying, and junk-worthy. It's also totally lacking in anything funny. The troublesome road to attempt to deliver its line is just to die on arrival because it's just not funny. I looked at the segment of her program and was ready for Novocaine. <br /> <br /> Geez, my kid (age 19) saw his promotion on Central Comedy and said he was a "dumb chick." I thought it was a compliment. One of the places he says "Look at my show or I'll kill my dog," is actually credible. I know he's a comedy wish. It just comes across as a black-can decouple. I just never want to see her in my dog.
