The repeaters of this review are offered as an utility, because the only way to enjoy this costume melodrama is to know that our protagonist, Barbara Skelton's Lady, is raped and shot down to the end. And it's not a moment too early. I would have shot the screen myself, but I was afraid I'd hit James Mason. The original novel of 1943, entitled "The Life and Death of the Bad Skelton Skelton" (I guess people did not reveal those who were lost then), were written by a woman, a British navy who was either troubled or cynical or both. Her heroine is devastatingly beautiful, and the author seems to think that if you have beauty, nothing else matters. But other things have problems, such as the fact that immediate Response and Lady Barbara's response when a person gets on his way is homicide. He killed three people in five attempts. A fatial female serem, having a case of social persistence that should have landed him in either Bedlam or Newgate. <br /> Lockwood plays it as a narcissistic vampire, wearing many makeup that I thought of as a Renewed-Joan Rivers (or Joan Rivers renovation-ha!). But Lady B. is irresistible in three male manuscript characters - Michael Rennie, James Mason, and Griffith Jones, all doing good work, like Patricia Roc. Of course, all three admirers realized in the short order that a Barbara bitch psychic is, but the plot keeps them all in orbit until one of them finally makes it down - accidentally, in what means to be either irony or just desserts. Given the dramatic death scenes with a boom lifting the camera out of the window and the sky, I suppose we're going to give a damn on his death. But it is the first corpse we do not care about.
