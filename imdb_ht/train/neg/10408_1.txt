If Fassbinder made a movie worse, I'm sure you do not want to see it! Anyone who complains that his films are too talkative to claustrophobia should be forced to see this, so learn to appreciate the style of his spare parts opting for in excellent films such as the "Bitter Tears of Petra von Kant". This movie bumps down with very artistic, quasi-symbolic image looks like a parody of an "art-movie". The scene of the slaughterhouse and scenes in which Elvira's channel-surfer friendship for what seems like ten minutes are just two of the most blatant examples of what makes this movie a real test of endurance endurance. But what really angers me about it is the few scenes that feature just Elvira and his ex-wife and / or daughter. These are the only moments that show any real human emotions, and to prove to the core of this horrible film, there was an excellent film struggling to free himself. What a waste.
