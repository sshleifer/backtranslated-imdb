Summary of the IMDb draw in any way describes the essence of this movie. It should be read 'Prepared to break back into the prison in the 3rd toilet at the back of your family church in 8 years old, listening to the abundant plethora on God's will while all you can think of going back home to your Lego. <br /> It starts thoroughly, intriguing build by planting some real and surreal revelations like Renny's how to make the cut on my thumbs healing fast? moment. It then slowly morphs into a Christian jamboree, sacrificing to draw it completely into a washing of evangelical-induced babble. I believe I use the word "pray" about 53 times in a five-minute span near the end. After 31 years, I tried to twist the context of the synonym's word, 'beast'. Unfortunately, this little game has made the film at least tackling for the last 20 minutes. Plus it made me laugh every time a character would say 'pray' ('preyer' at me) as it totally became. Indeed, even my Catholic wife leaked to her chair from boredom, almost to the point of ending up on the floor. <br /> For all the salivian Christians who rank this film 8-10 stars, I suggest sticking to the theological safety standards that reinforce you like circles, ten commandments, anything from Narnia, Jesus Christ Superstar and the love . Stay away from more difficult subjects in films such as Jesus' Camp, which was not there, what would Jesus buy, or briefly-to-be religious relief. <br /> Maybe Robert Whitlow's book is best.
