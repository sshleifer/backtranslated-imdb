If movies like Ghoulies Rip off Gremlins, then hobgoblins sink into the new chip off trash like Ghoulies. These barely-animated furbies have some kind of plot to satisfy fantasies (including dreams of grotesque characters - oh oh), but what has to do with anything is to guess anybody, except leaving the director appreciating her crap for eroticism. They show this down to the 8th circle of hell, one suspect. There is no real scheme - just "Elves - kill!" with low humorous attempts and a mild attempt to excite the audience to look.
