Shintar√¥ Katsu came tons of fame playing the wonderful character, Zatoichi. Zatoichi films have a strange and incredible concept - a blind guy is the greatest sword in Japan and spends every wrong movie right and repeats precisely on evil evil. It's a heck of a nice guy and these movies are interesting and addictive (I've actually seen every movie). It is because this I saw this final installment of the Hanzo razor series, as I suppose it would be very similar .... and my boy was wrong! It seems that the Hanzo films are very sexual in nature and they also encourage the rape of "deserving women". You see, Hanzo is a policeman in the Meiji period and he regularly takes wrong women into jail and interrogated by violent violators and his "part of the steel". How he made his membership so strong is something you have to see to believe, but it certainly is NOT for the crab. <br /> <br /> Overall, I just can not recommend anyone to see the violent and misogynistic films. However, in view of the other comments, I can see that they are still very popular ... and that's pretty scary. Despite some decent action and amazing battle scenes, these films are just like brain pollution - and I would hate to imagine how these films would contribute to violence towards women.
