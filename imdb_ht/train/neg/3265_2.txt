I have no idea about what the director of the hearing George Schlatter hoped to sell this comedy-of-wrong. With Redd Foxx in the central role and enough pimpi team with the 1970's carpet 1970s, "Norman" plays as a blaxploitation photo combined with any number of funny sitcom episodes that involve funny misilstandings, not to mention a long chat at Waylon Flowers! Based on a play by Sam Bobrick and Ron Clark, this story of a married couple lined up (Foxx and Pearl Bailey) learn the hard way that their sons are secretly gay - and living with a mincing, white primes Homosexuals - there are enough fish jokes bravely shudder any early episode of the "Company Three". Bailey keeps his dignity, and the sheer confusion of Foxx is good for a couple of chuckles, but the rest of the performers are outraged. * from ****
