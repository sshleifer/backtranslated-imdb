I love British humor, I believe it's one of the best in the world. I like almost every British sitcom (okay ... maybe by Monthy Python, some of the jokes were great, but some of them I did not understand.), But this League of Gentlemen is just a good thing to make you sick . This show was good in some ways; It helped me lose some weight because watching this piece of trash makes me feel no longer hungry. This is really just disgusting, sick and not even funny TV shows and I wonder who actually laughs at this stuff. I watched her for about 10 minutes and turned around. It was so disgusting to look people dressed in the woman with yellow teeth and urine on the car ... I mean ... what's funny about that ??? She makes me want to fuck. No humor, just disturbing image and cheap, lazy toilets ... I do not know ... if you like this thing ... you go ahead ... look it ... but to be honest, Watching and enjoying this must have some emotional problems. Garbage.
