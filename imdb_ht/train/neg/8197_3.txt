I just saw this film tonight and I must say it's a mess. I love Vince Vaughn but it ends up more annoying that funny here and the movie is more than less a remake of the classic 80's villain at the "Santa Claus Movie" but and out the camp or singing Sheena Easton the song at the end . The story is running you to grind the black sheep into the family that comes back in the face of his family for the holidays, but with North Pole as its surroundings. Fred's Vince (Vince Vaughn) is the family vice who comes home after a series of back-ups including his girlfriend (Rachel Weisz's role as a roulette) dropping him, so he comes home to face his parents, , his success more successful Santa Claus (Paul Giamatti) and wacky high jinks followed with a bit of sibling rivalry and a bit of anarchy as well as threatening all Christmas. Now, if you think you know that ending this movie, I think you should be fine because it's predictable to the hill. As for the act, Vince Vaughn plays the same lovable deficit she still plays, but this time she ends up more annoying than containers, Miranda Richardson plays Mrs. Claus, but the role is more than less than one score, Elizabeth Banks plays wizards Santa's but not much of a character of all other than a neurotic and poor joke Kevin Spacey ends up basically playing even those he plays in the film "Glengarry Glen Ross" but a little more anal. The only actors from this film and their dignity are Paul Giamatti, who brings a real sincerity and heats up his role as Santa Claus but it seems a bit nasty to be in the movie and you can not blame it, , Rachel Weisz, who managed to do a lot more with a lot more roles than most of the main actors to do with them, which is a shame because both Rachel Weisz and Paul Giamatti deserve a better than that script was given to them. <br /> Put it in a nutshell, a great disappointment.
