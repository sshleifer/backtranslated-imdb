"It has to be yours" is another sign that Hollywood is running out of mind. This picture is about Charlie Hudson a former police officer turned to author. When Charlie's fianc√©e goes out of town he stuck with all the wedding planning. She spends a week at a fancy hotel and meets Anna Penn a professor who just happens to marry. The two quickly become friends and set out to plan their divorce together. This is when the draw becomes boring, Charlie falls in love with Anna and she has to choose between a safe life or Charlie. This movie rips in all romantic comedy ever doing and just have you waiting for the end of the movie so you can do something else. Micahel Vartan and Natasha Henstridge provide really some mediocre performance that just makes this movie all the best tools to watch.
