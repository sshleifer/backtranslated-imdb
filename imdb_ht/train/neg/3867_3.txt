Oh-so-familiar comedy story about Low-key cute-guy Paul (Jason Lee), who after night at his undergraduate party, wakes up in bed with Becky (Julia Stiles), a blonde attractive she met just the night before . After he was lying on it in Selena Blair, Selma Blair, he was forced to say more and more lies to cover his train. <br /> I'm sure most of us have witnessed a story like this at least once before ... on film or on television. The movie is formula and EXTREMELY predictable, and an end you can see comes a kilometer away. At least the cast gives some interest and keep it lookuz. Lee is just right in the lead, and Stiles is a lot of fun in a light-hearted comedy role role from the very serious roles it usually plays. Becky is a free spirit who seems to change jobs as often as others change their clothes. <br /> But you know, this is not exactly well written. At least one question left unanswered: why, exactly, is Ray (Lochlyn Munro), brutal old Becky boyfriend, being investigated by the IA? <br /> And I did not like the character of Buck (David Koechner), Paul's stepfather; It's a super-obnoxious moron that got on my nerves so quickly I was begging for someone to punch him. <br /> <br /> Add another debit: a gratuitous, unraveling comedy by comic / actor Larry Miller, once again playing a Grouch (in this case, it's a little justified - his character is a minister ultra-conservative). <br /> <br /> Not good at all, but as usual for me, I give it a third out of ten based on the efforts of the cast alone.
