1st look 5/27/2009 - 4 out of 10 (Direct - Harold Young): The 3rd Universal Movie Mummy is about the same as the first two as far as the final outcome of the viewer's perspective. The story is similar to the results will be-hum. This time, where the story is the United States as the new Egyptian follower of the priest sends a mummy into our country of hope that it can revive him to kill the offspring of the original grave. This time the mummy plays by Lon Chaney (which does not make much of a difference because it really does not require much to act for this character). The new priest becomes a guardian of the city and sends the mummy out of his room after eating his juice in the tana leaf. Again, a girl gets in the way, as the priest falls to one of the fiancé's fiancé and wants it, yes --- to be immortal with him (not we heard this before?). The plan is, of course, called as townsfolk hunt down the mummy and candle (similar to the Frankenstein monster) and burn to the animal to finish the story ... how to find an end ?? I guess you'll get out with the next one in the series ?? or not .....
