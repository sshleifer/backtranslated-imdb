The first question that springs in mind after watching this garbage is that Earth gave these idiots the right to use the Ommen name on this movie? It is a shambolic, embarrassing, pathetic atempt bearing on the Ommen franchise. When the movie starts music that sounds like it's got straight from a Cartoon Bunny cartoon and then on the movie gets worse! I do not know who wrote the script, but I bet they got an E - for it when they took it back to their teachers' show! It's hard after a while to tell if this is a comedy because it's so funny and so unlike the original omen she starts to believe. The act is ridiculous, especially in Faye Grant's leading lady. Does she keep pulling funny face or does she find it hard not to laugh? It's hard to say. I never had to witness. 1 out of 10.
