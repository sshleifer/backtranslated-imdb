This first movie was Ewan McGregor I've ever seen outside of Star Wars. Since then, I have become a big fan of Ewan McGregor but I still can not bring myself to forgive the movie's existence. <br /> <br /> My sister is still a great fan of Austen Jane and therefore, I have had several of the classics, Emma was one of them. I always considered them irritating, stupid and boring. However, after watching this terrible pronoun, I was forced to admit that the original Emma was delightful and charming. Ewan McGregor recently served a purpose in this film after being hacked and hacking part of Frank Churchill. Gweneth Paltrow is ridiculous to a character that is already ridiculous and the rest of the film is unremarkable and stupid. My recommendation to anyone who is remotely interested in English drama periods ... go see the original. If you are a fan of Ewan McGregor ... believe me, do not skip this movie, you have not missed anything but five minutes collective in her in a funny hat with a bad head.
