I simply can not believe the number of people who compares this favorably with the first movie. He moved me to leave this comment! This is just an obvious attempt of cash-on success in the first movie. The dialogue is expansive and nothing is as authentic or compelling as the original movie. <br /> <br /> The story is ridiculous, the paintings of the French police scoff and characterization of Doyle a mile away from the movie first. br >> <br /> How many drug bugs do you think go down to the docks of people to see a shipment into? The ease of which Doyle finds his guy is just pathetic. Like all French police they just drank coffee until Doyle turned out to America and did some real police work. What a joke. Try to go to a foreign city and unravel the biggest creams of the place with a travel map and some tourist books. Pathetic. <br /> A really horrible end, anyone who thinks otherwise is crazy.
