I want to start by declaring I'm a republican, even though I do not agree with a lot of things to do in office bushes. And I love the daily show with Colbert's report. They have to be two of my favorite shows on TV. I enjoy the bush jokes on Conan, Letterman, Leno, because I admit that W is not the smartest guy ever to walk the world (I believe he's not dumbest either.) But he comes to a point when enough is enough and it's not that funny yet. I see where it can be funny and it is (hey it makes fun of our authority figure it's hilarious.). Central comedy though it's just trying hard to sniff fun at him. I mean perhaps one special episode, but a whole series is just mute. It looks like CC is just saying jokes are the same bushes that we've heard the way many times. I really can not see this show going past 1 seasons.
