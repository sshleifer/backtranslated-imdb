urgh! 3 things a movie needs: a good script, a good scheme and good casting. I watched this movie awaiting it to be hilariously awful and was unfortunately disappointed when it was just plain terrible. I have lost willingness for half of all. The only thing that stopped me from stinging my eyes out with a fork was Rose Byrne (which was the reason for me to look at him in the first place). He did a great job as Rastus and his appearance did not change much since he was 13. It was a fantastic first effort in a movie. The dog was also very good. Both did a great job with these terrible materials. Sandra Bernhard I think is the biggest mistake in the movie. he was completely miscast, and I do not think he's ever got the character. <br /> I give the movie 2 out of 10 - and that's just because of Rose.
