I was attracted to seeing this movie because of this plot and my desire to watch a horror. <br /> <br /> For my disappointment, this is back in more of a comedy than a horror. Acting, dialogue, and flow of the movie were all very wrong done. Many of it did not make sense. For example, there are about 30 people part and they're all scared of one person despite being in a secret place and they are all healthy young adult and the guy threatens to haggard. I kept thinking, maybe this was a parody of another movie like scary movie, but was trying too hard to make it look really good - emphasis on trying. I saw Halloween costumes look more credible than that. A guy and cut his head clean ... look clean - missing bone, body, blood, and even the head. A great down strike with an ax on a corpse should spend the night in something ... seemed like the guy waved a bat instead of an ax. <br /> <br /> Revealing that the main villain was supposed to be a twist, but contradicted other parts of the story. What went to mind the guy to turn out like that? If there was a twist, you should at least build up to add mystery and suspense.
