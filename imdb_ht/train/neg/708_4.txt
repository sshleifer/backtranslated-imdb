The story and the show were good, but it was really depressing and I hate depressing movies. Ri'Chard is great. She really puts on a toothpaste performance, and the girl who played her sister was really awesome and gorgeous. Seriously, I thought it was Carmen Electra until I saw IMDb's profile. I can not say anything bad about Peter Galleghar. He is one of my favorite actors. I love Anne Rice. I now read the vampire stories, but I'm glad I saw the movie before reading the book. This is a bit too "real" for me. I prefer Lestat and Louis titty little little in the struggles of slaves. Eartha Kitt was so creepy and after her character did what she did was the movie lost to me; I could barely stand up to watch the rest of the show. (sorry for the ambiguity, but I do not want to give anything away) Sorry, but it's just not my type of show.
