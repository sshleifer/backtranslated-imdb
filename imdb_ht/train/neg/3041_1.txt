Yes I was rated this movie as one terrible star. But it will be in my rotation in Christmas cinema now. This is truly so bad it's good. This is another K. Gordon Murray production (read: buy a really cheap movie / Mexican movie, spending zero money getting it armed in English and releasing it to kiddie matin√©es in the mid 1960s.) It's a shame I stumble over this late life as I'm sure some "amusing mood" would make this an even better experience. I will not rehash that much of the other reviews have already been said, a Christmas film with Merlin, the Devil, the windmaking reindeer and some of the most pathetic kids actors I've ever seen nothing. I plan on running this on the backs back and Kelsey Grammar's "A Christmas Carol". Surely a holiday experience made in hell. Now, if I can only find "For All A Goodnight (aka Slayride)" on DVD I will have a triple feature that can not be beat. You must see this movie. It moves slowly that I challenge you by touching the fast forward-especially on the two dance routines! This item ranges like an expensive cheese-guinea fume you have to get past Stink to enjoy the experience. Feliz Navidad amigos!
