I just saw this movie on DVD last night, and decided to check out the following morning reviews. It seems that "I, robot" has polarized the community to look critically here on IMDb (and give rise to a lot of insult and non-call, too). <br /> I find this a bit surprising, as this film is not great (or even good), but neither is it terrible (or even really bad). What movie really is, is ... depressions. The depreciation of the American film population is so ready for ever getting insipid, re-flushed clich√©s, and their reputation as spectacular new jobs. This movie as "retread" writes all over it, from the line drawn (a comfortable mix of Asimov and modern-day Uber-action) to Smith's characters (a cynically intelligent-mouth and a scream of titanium ), in special effects (borrowed from cervix and some others). <br /> <br /> "I, Robot" is, sadly, quite possibly the movie of perfect action for today's audience: superficial plot, snapshots rapidly dialogue, and many and many adrenaline. Smith is mediocre, but we already know that (it seems to be the latest Hollywood unsuccessful attempt to create a black Bruce Willis). The story has lots of holes in it, in all sizes, but I do not think most people drawn in this movie are critically-minded enough to notice. Maybe a blockbuster in today's standard, but very B-movie compared to true winner.
