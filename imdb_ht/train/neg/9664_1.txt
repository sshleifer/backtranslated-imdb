This book-based movie is really awful, and a great disappointment. We were waiting for this move over a month. Many movie reviews have been hoping for it. Also in newspapers and television, he made great sense. When April 29 comes, many people regretfully notice that film is really awful. Why? The first of all stories was so monotonous. He has many indefinite scenes, sometimes it's hard to realize what's going on. The actresses, from Hulya Avsar, were not harmonized with their role, especially Vildan Atasever. He acts best in comedy films, In this film, a kind of drama, he could not be able to stand before his role. And finally film is too short, just 66 minutes.
