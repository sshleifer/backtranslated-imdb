I had to stop watching this film (a pseudo-intellectual product for fetish viewers) twenty minutes into it because it was mediocre and dull enough to inspire yawns, not to mention that I was soon close to tears of $ 3.99 I was wasted in blockbuster. Joanna Pacula's agency and awfully accentuate their Slavic accent are terrible enough to put one in one's gritting teeth. I knew that two hours would be two hours too long. Both Breuer and Nietzsche are played by unremarkable actors in talent hit some talent. While we're on the topic of talent, Breuer's overwhelming assistant appears to have been pulling out of a local acting troupe. He clearly did not learn his craft. In fact, it's really quite awful. All public performances are watching scenes, and their extras are gearing up on the best Sunday. This film was far more satisfying than turning it on. Do not rent this horrible movie. You will be sorry to have spent your money.
