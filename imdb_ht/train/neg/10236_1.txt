Absolutely fantastic. <br /> Now, before a regiment of cinema purist choking on the lattes, allow me to elaborate. Much as I liked it, this is simply one of the worst movies I've ever seen and is certainly the worst movie I've seen in the movie (an impressive claim, as I remember seeing Daredevil on the screen great). The two drivers (Daniel Gillies and Elisha Cuthbert) were convinced of the best and horrendously terrible at worst. Of course, they were not helped by a script that had emotional depths as a Daphne & Celeste single and characteristic that was as compelling as the OJ defense. The plot (to stretch the theme slightly) was thin in non-existent with the 'gore' scenes, also undoubtedly brutal, being irrelevant and ridiculous formulaic. Which draw has to turn into a twenty-something model (Cuthbert) who is kidnapped, imprisoned and subjected to various types of torture, both psychological and physical. The torture scene feels like disconnecting pieces with the emphasis placed on shocking rather than scrutinizing the audience. While there are really very, very few positives drawn from this movie, its lockout features are the very flaws that make it like a big movie. I have never heard a more vocal audience in a movie. In twenty minutes, the entire movie was in stitches and remained in that way at all. For the part I came out red and laughed, buoyed by a movie that climbed into the pinnacle of movie-making hunger. Whatever the way you look at it, this is really a Cinematic success and a future plan to wannabes directional guides how not to make a movie. I omitted to mention that I managed to get into the free movie ... so I can pay attention to it. I was always tempted to ask for my money back ... it really was wrong.
