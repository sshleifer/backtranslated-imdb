I thought that my favorite martian was very boring and drawn out !! It was not funny at all. The audience just sat in the whole movie and did not laugh at all !!! Not even kids laugh !! That is sad for a Disney movie! I thought they could find someone better to play the martian rather than Christopher Lloyd !! It was really stupid! And it was not funny !! I thought the costume talk was really mute! In the original TV series the suit does not talk and move around! In my opinion they should not have wasted their time on this movie !! I give it two inches down !! Really a waste of time and I would not recommend the movie anybody !!! Thank you !!
