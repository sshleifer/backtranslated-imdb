Just finished watching, I can not say I was impressed. <br /> It starts quite good, visual and the atmosphere gives a creepy feeling like this type of movie should be. But it all ends when the first lord of the monster appears. Not only do you recognize them from the lordi band, but they are seriously moved to the movie. Monsters Doomsday with leather jackets and piercings are so 80's. As for the scenario, it starts like similar horror movies, those trapped inside a hell hole. But there is no clear story about why and what's happening. The viewer is casting some lines on possible reasons, but the lines are never satisfied with finishing up to anything but a mess. With all the money spent on this movie, with an intriguing start and some good effects, I thought someone would take the best care of the product. I wonder if Lordi made this movie just proving that costumes show they might be scared (except they do not). So, the movie becomes credible for the visuals, I guess the money went somewhere. But the rest is a nasty attempt from a rock band to perform on-stage missions scarier.
