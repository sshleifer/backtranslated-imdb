Although there's Flying Guillotines as part of the title of this movie, he has no connection to the original Flying Guillotines (1975) and its sequel flying Guillotines II (1978). The original two are the kung-fu films and still stand out as a classic. This is a very inferior copy of the original, and even as a regular movie kung-fu, it's below average. <br /> First of all, this movie does not have much to act. It's a nonsense battlefield after another, and flying gypsies does not even play a major part in them. History is about some Shaolin monks who follow down some bandits who have taken with a sacred book, and an evil ruler who owns part of this book is part of the plot. Even the prince even has plans to lure the monks in and use the guillotines to fly over them. There are four movies and flying guillotine as part of its title. This in my opinion is of lesser quality. Design of the flying guillotine in this movie is different from the other three that indicated that this film was produced by a different entity from the other three. The film has no chemistry aside from being humorous involuntary due to poor production. <br /> Best jumps and watch the original two.
