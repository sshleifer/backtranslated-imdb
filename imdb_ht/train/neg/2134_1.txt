With this cast and budget you will expect more. <br /> <br /> John Cusack made a movie number of borders on the weird, constantly working. Neither his sister, nor Sir Ben could do anything to save this travesti into trite wrong writing waste. <br /> <br /> The movie is nothing more than a series of gags in front of the poor and poor. The scheme goes nowhere, it is written to composite, essence and paper thin characters. If you think of a movie like three-dimensional where the story and character bring a depth of imagery, this stinker comes across as flat as mickey steam. <br /> <br /> Apar the Akroyd Dan in this brought memories back to another really horrible movie, 1991 There is nothing, but there are problems. Frankly this movie is the kind of project that kills career and gets silver shot.
