Relying on the positive reviews above, we've seen a free screening at this last night. Now I know that the cinema plant reviews positive, because there is no way one person could write these. "Destiny become a 'classic cult'" ?? The theater is packed, apparently with friends and family crew productions, because only a few of us walked out of the first hour. The songs were the most literal I've ever heard of a music ?? "Do not take the short cut, honey, have a wolf in the woods." Eazy Mazar saw blinked as he struggled. Fortunately, most of the tunes lasted for only a few lines. Now whoever plays the heavy in this story would be good and seductive. Instead, we find Joey Fatone, former N'Syncer, living up to her name as it is not well-old. It's not exactly lithe with extra 50 books and junior high school-quality makeup and out-of-music songs. Seriously, this guy was in vocal group? The rest of the actors are semi-adequate, but they can not do much on the unimaginable script. You know, it is possible to write for adults and children at the same time ?? See under "Pixar". On the positive side, the virtual sets look nice and were well integrated with the actors. And it was not as offensive as "crash".
