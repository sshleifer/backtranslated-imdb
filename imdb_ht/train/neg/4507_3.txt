Although a general plot of fun and expensive production is one thing of wonder as a director can make many cultural illusions. Where was the Japanese wardrobe and cultural consultant? Not on the payroll apparently. <br /> A Japanese friend I actually laughed at some of the cultural absurdity he watched unfold in front of him. In a later conversation he said, "Imagine a Finnish director to make a movie of Fnnish on the U.S. Civil War using blonde actor Sweden as Army and French Army as Confederation. Worst Imagine Brown's O'Hara Dress Size a skirt period missed the skirt and sporting a 1950's growth. Maybe some people in Finland might not realize that the skirt skirt was "missing the basketball" or recognized hair in Jane Mansfield hair, but in Atlanta they would not believe their eyes or ears .... and must laugh at the hallways ... excellent stories and photography must be annoyed. <br /> So ... watching the memory of a geisha was painful for anyone familiar with nuances Japanese culture, jewelery or Japanese clothing, and that was the subject of the movie! Hollywood is amazing in viewing its myopics in making films. They often find great things money right while leaving the details that really polish an improvement movie embarrassingly wrong. I thought the "Samurai Last" was crowned to the success of how bad an otherwise good movie about Japan might be. The memory of a geisha is anbarrassingly better and worse at the same time.
