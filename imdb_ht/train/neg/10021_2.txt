The worst movie I've seen since Tera Jadoo Chal Gaya. There is no history, no humor, nothing! Sequence of shares looks more like a series of azar Akshay Kumar Thumbs-Up advertisers sew together. Greatly influenced by the Matrix agitation and Kung-Fu but very poorly executed. <br /> I did not go a lot of expectations, but watching this movie is an exasperating experience that makes you ask "What were these guys ?? ??". <br /> <br /> The only thing you could remember after looking it is an anorexic Kareena in a bikini. <br /> <br /> The reason why I did not give a rating of '1' is that every time I think I saw the worst, Bollywood proved me wrong.
