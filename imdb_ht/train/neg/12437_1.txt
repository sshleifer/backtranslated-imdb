'Home Alone 3' is the first of the Home Houses movies by featuring Culkin in the main role and the same bandits. However, the plot is very similar to the original movie 'Home Alone'. Instead of funny bandits, we find three or four of them. This film involves some traps, but it also has a long scene with a remote-control machine. The slapstick humor is consistent as well, but the young boy and the bandits really fail to make an impact in this movie. (No pun intended.) This movie offers nothing new or different than the previous movies made, and there really is no hot, the feeling of holiday or subplots that the other two movies have. It's more of a pure comedy, but it did not succeed in making me laugh as the characters really did not do it for me. I would not recommend this movie; it is very nice. If you are looking for a movie movie good movie and comedy, then watch the original 'Home Alone' movie.
