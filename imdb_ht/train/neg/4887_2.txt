The first movie is very good. This is very bad. <br /> <br /> Get a lot of feet (including the opening credits and ending titles) from crazy criminals. The new footage, shooting on video, really sticks out as wrong doing. Scenes lack proper lighting, the sound is sometimes inferior, there are even popping videos like the rolling picture and so on. <br /> <br /> Like all bad suites, it basically just repeats the story of the first one. Ethel kills everyone who shares his living space, often for reasons making and getting in the way he or she wants. At least it's only an extra on the DVD for the first one, including the movie director of the Black Devil movie. Too bad it does not include philosophy Disable their deaths though.
