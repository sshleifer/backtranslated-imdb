I read all these reviews about here about how this is a good movie. Jeez, this movie was predictable and beautiful boring. The act was below the least average in the time, especially by Mckenna. I have not seen an additional attempt to make someone "badass" in a movie. Oh, this movie was a disappointment. I also read somewhere that would be a cult classic. I know there are followers of the director, but this movie was just an average piece of film. <br /> <br /> The script was disabled, for the most part acting disabled, this movie was lame. > <br /> Oh and prayer for the guy who used to be in Cheers. It looks really bad. <br /> <br /> The best actor in this movie was probably the guy in office space, and was only in this movie for about 8 minutes.
