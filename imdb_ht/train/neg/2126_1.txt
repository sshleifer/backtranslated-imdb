Jason Alexander is a wonderful actor, but it's ridiculous to throw him as a cuddly romantic lead. The fact that it dances well, croons so effectively, and throws himself to the party so completely somehow just made him look all the creepy. At his most cutesy moment (and the girl at the train station, in the final number with Rosie), I could not take my eye on him and he was so reprehensible. You wait to drop the beautiful-guy act and start snarling. Vanessa Williams was the real star, the only performance was better than the movie in 1963. By the way, if you see an output of the stage music, the 1963 film and this 1995 film, you will see three versions of more Review (different songs, even songs assigned to different characters and in different situations) than any other music I've ever seen.
