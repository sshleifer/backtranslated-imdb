This was among the STUPIDEST and PREACHIEST of the anti-nuke films from the 1980s. <br /> The idea that a kid with a basketball star could "change the world" is very far-fetched, given how many "Children's Peace Markets" and "Celebrity Manifestations" had with them. But the idea that the Soviet Union would agree with a Nuclear nuclear Nuclear, because some children apparately learned of a "silent protest" in the West are funny. <br /> <br /> What Cold War Finished? America is tough, dare I say "Reaganesque" position and internal failures in socialism. It was NOT the peaceful walkers, their "dead-ins" or films such as "Grace & Chuck", Miracle Mile, or "Testaments".
