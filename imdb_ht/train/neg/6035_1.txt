I really want I could give this a negative vote, because I think I'm just wasting 83 minutes in my life to watch the worst film movie horror movie ever. The act was just awful God, I mean REALLYYYY bad, the dialogue was worse, the script sounded as it was written by .... I can not think of anything awful enough to say. And the day out and night "inside" the shots make you think the events took more than several days. Terribly acting, directing, writing, etc. etc. All the way down to the gofer how to get lunch for everyone. LIVE FROM ANY POINTS. If only my saving grace to stay out of hell is not to make one good paper, it is said the world does not look at this crap. This film is the exact reason why horror movies have never taken seriously.
