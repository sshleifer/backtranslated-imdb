Even when I saw this film in a teenager, I was wondering just how ironic it was that Pia Zadora starred in a movie about an artist who lay his way to the top. As beautiful and sexy as Mrs. Zadora is, even she could not keep this excuse-ass excited in a movie of tanking. Not even his photochot for penthouse, in which the "Lady Lonely" was encouraged "back in the day," was able to keep this movie from tackling. The only thing that could save this movie? A completely different script. Give this one missing.
