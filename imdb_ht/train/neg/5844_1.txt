This movie is easy one of the worst I've ever seen. And I do not mean that in a great way. We wanted to see a scam / suspense horror, so we chose the one that seemed to be the lousyest in the store. For once, the movie was everything we would expect. And more! (or should I say less?) <br /> The actors look like they're reading the lines from posters behind the camera. The so-called special effects are created by putting red-saw plastic in front of the camera to give the impression that we see in the eyes of the bloodthirsty rats. With the script? Not even finding me started on the script ... And just when you thought he could not get any worse, it seems that the first part of the movie was Oscar-material compared to the finish. <br /> <Take it from me, this movie is hilarious if you are in movies movie movie, but if you want a good movie, keep on looking. This is not for you.
