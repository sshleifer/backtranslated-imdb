My friends and I rented this for "bad night movie" with high hopes, but the brain was something of a deception. The brain itself is gloriously so-looking, but it mostly just sits on its little platform. Who thought it would be cool that the brain only gets munch about three people in all 94 minute-drawn minutes? This movie has a number of things going for it first, including a lead Estevez-knockoff playing a rebel genius (we're saying that its enormous scholar is misdirected in its elaborate pranks and school exhibits, including put krazy glue on someone's chair). It also has some great lines, a hilariously out-of-form and out-of-breath lenchman that just barely managed to be everywhere and, yes, some chick gets naked. However, the director desperately needed some schools in the art of rhythm. During these last half things just start dragging on and over, with at least 3 or 4 freeware, booty scenes make up the third in the middle of the draw. The scenes inside the PRI complex are especially bad. At least 15 minutes of this movie are people running up and down the stairs. I could fix the scenario in this thing in half an hour - more cheese, more gore, more nudity, more brain action. If you're going to make a bad movie horror, at least give me something fresh look at while my superego goes down. Perhaps the director was trying to really bring the audience into his movie-I started to feel like one of the zombie townspeople at the end of this crapfest.
