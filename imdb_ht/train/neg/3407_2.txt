OK, forget all the technical inconsistencies or physical impedures of the Space Shuttle accidentally launched by an original robot with a heart of gold. Forget the special hideous and characters that do not build a dimension. Just look at the quote in the story. The very reason for the film exists in the first place, and you'll see just how badly this movie has been pieced together. <br /> I know 9 years old who watch this insult in the intelligence and just laugh at it. The story is terrible. The act is funny and the message it tries to show is incomprehensible. And what's worse, is that cable TV channels keep it! It's about twice a day every two or three days! Why does anyone in right mind think that people who want to see this painful piece of seluloid multiple times, much less to see it all? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> My recomendation does not even bother to spend energy in watching this stuff. It's just not worth it.
