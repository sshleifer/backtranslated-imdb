I finally saw the incubus after waiting 20 something odd years to see it well, it surely was not worth waiting all the time to see it. The INCUBUS is simply by-number-movie film: unseen killer / monster is violence and killing women in a small town. The movie goes like this: movie open and killed; Then blah blah blah; more blah blah blah; Then another kill; even more blah blah blah; continue with blah blah blah; yet another kill (surprised, huh?); blah blah blah, etc. ... The film is totally predictable from beginning to end. Even the stupid "big" red-herring used throughout the movie would not convince a 5 year old. And I calculated the secret identity of the incubus the moment I saw the character, so when the "shocking" surprise ended up, I was not shocked or amazed. In fact, it was so funny that I kept on chuckling days after seeing the movie. It's so funny! <br /> In any way, the movie is so by-number that the section "Band Band" is one of the few standing-out flickering flicking moments. It's a stand-out scene not necessarily because it's fine, but because it's funny and pointless: the movie playing on the big screen shows a rock-loving video moment with a guy in red leather pants getting obviously her hair fake Long, all this edited and the scene of a girl who was attacked by the movie theater by the incubus. The best thing I could say about this movie is the cinematography, which I actually liked. But over there, almost nothing is worth mentioning about the incubus, except that it's unheard of hilarious.
