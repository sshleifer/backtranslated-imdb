I like munna bhai MBBS but "Lagging raho ..." SUX really SUX. I have never seen such a boring film throughout my life. And these high ratings really seized me that what happened to the taste of Indian cinema viewers ?? <br /> <br /> ** You can be better ** <br /> <br /> An educated girl needs a guidebook from a Bhai, people discussing personal issues. on phone comes on people from that part of the world u r ??? I agree that the films should be handled but things are really endigestible. <br /> <br /> 2 out of 10. (2 stars is for 15 min good start)
