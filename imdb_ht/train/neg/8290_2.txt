Alan Rudolph is a so-called director, without special touch. As an example, there was one shot in the Secret Life of dentists in the dental office that could have expressed the relationship between the husband and wife. Rudolph wasted it. The camera is in the hallway at the entrance to the two dental offices, with Dana and Dave each alone in their respective rooms. You get the idea of ​​desolation and insulation, but not much more. Lighting, color, body language, facial expression can all be greatly enhanced. If I was headed, I would spend all day, if needed, to get this shot injection. That's the beauty and power of films: it can express so much, everyone's life, in a matter of seconds <br /> The shot and the toddler left in the puddle size puke could be improved on. The child should show more passion with the puddle, should be stomped and shuffled to his foot, should have had himself bending down to look at the puddle with his attention. Campbell did not deliver. He plays a communicative man, but instead of conveying his inner turmoil in voice, gestures, body movements, the film slows down on voices-on narration and dialogue with his imagined change-month, played by Denis Leary.
