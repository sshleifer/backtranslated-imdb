I love music, but as a Dickens fan I HATE this one. ** MILD SPOILERS ** Hungry boy with enough energy to sing and dance to the worker? The Poor in London comes from singing? Fagin and Dodger are walking in the sunset? It's not exactly the loyal novel. As I remember, Dodger was publicly hanged and Fagin went crazy in jail. ** ORDER SPOILERS ** <br /> <br /> Oliver Reed is very weak as Sykes, doing little more than fat to show her wrong. Worst however, is Mark Lester as Oliver, who often comes across so awkward and passive you wonder if it is really the main character. His paintings in no way helped by the fact that the best they could do when he was singing is dub in the voice of a girl. Guess they did not realize that boys' trumbles can be found in almost every church in England. <br /> <br /> Self-respecting Dickens fan: Wood of David amazing 1948 movie or BBC's 6-hour adaptation from the mid-80's. Avoid whitening bleaching into a music.
