If you ever saw this movie, you would know it! If you do not have, and you want to see a classic movie BAD, I suggest you see this movie, because it hangs down right and the worst. So, if you're really bored, go to rent it. If you want to know what it's like, here's my little resume: Adam Sandler is employed to work on a giant cruise ship with some Ms Universe models and five others. Adam does not like how a passenger will get all the babies, and he tries to take over with the cheezy jokes. But wait! It only gets worse! You will have to rent the movie yourself to see how bad it really is.
