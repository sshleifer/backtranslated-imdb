What is it with the Americans and hanging-up and religious gobbledy-gok? To think this was a best selling woman is incredible, but to pull it as a movie you really need to act wisely with a saved script. In this case, all the good actors go to heaven and we're leaving with Kirk Cameron as a CNN-type journalist (!) Trying to discover why a lot of people have simply disappeared. Oh yes, there is a subplot on an evil and hungry evil world, or something. The good news is that this is done so cheaply, with such horrible dialogue, that it has absolute entertainment values ​​throughout its unintelligible laugh. Do not recommend anyone with an IQ 3-digit.
