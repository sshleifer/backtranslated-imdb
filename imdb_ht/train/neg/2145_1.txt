I had a question for those who thought this idea. Why? What made them think they made a second movie in this. If memory serves, did not Cinderella end with "They Ever Had Happily Ever After"? I'm pretty sure he's done, or he's been implied. Wait a minute, if they all lived happily ever after, how could there be an end? Unless they tried to make the most boring story in history, could not be a sequel. I mean that, Cinderella could sing about nonsense for two hours, but why? A movie that ends in "happily ever after" can not have an end; if he does so then they do not live happily ever after! Something went on going wrong that caused trouble and finished first! Why? That's wrong, it's wrong. This is my last word on the issue.
