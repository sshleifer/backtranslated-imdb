Boris Karloff is Matthias Morteval, a dead, lonely black old man who lives in Morstenge Castle with some servants and tells his friend's doctor, "Do not try my doctor, doctors! I'm louder healthy!" He invited his niece and nephew to his house and warned them to have inherited a genetic disease that caused frenzy by "reducing the brain" (?) <br /> <br /> *** SPOILERS *** <br / > <br /> Morteval / Karloff ends up dying, and murder "game" (born by his dead brother) begins to kill in their families. A real cannon bullet fire in a guy face, a knight of life-sized gun attack with an ax and a dancing Sheik stabs people with a knife. A guy gets hurt to do some hilarious faces. In the end, Julissa and her companion find Karloff is still alive and hiding from the dungeon gate seal in the room. He plays the theme of renewable organs (sort of death rattle used for the killings), the brother's spirit begins to speak ("the whole house is going with me!") And the castle rises in flames. /> This mess chaos is too dark, boring and the stupid dialogue never matches the lips.
