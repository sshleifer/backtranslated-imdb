I had no other hope than to be entertained for 90 minutes, and that's exactly what I was. <br /> Of course it is campy, of course some of the dialogue was not perfect, of course "special effects" were a bit hokey. This is exactly why I enjoyed the movie very much. It's a perfect fit for this genre of the classic Horror 70. The talent needs to start somewhere, which goes for the actors and the crew, and what is the best piece of material to hone your skill over than that. <br /> I'm looking forward to another movie of these producers and directors.
