This movie is terrible. At the end of it you will realize that several hours have been stolen from your life that you can not get back. The "twist" end is very understandable. The character development leading up to this end is not consistent with the final actions of the conclusion. Ninety minutes of preparation - with the quote that Rob Lowe's character will die on Christmas Eve - to explain far in literally ninety seconds of "Our name was just tricking you." Then the Rob Lowe character does not even upset it! "I'll forgive you if you can forgive me," it's as mad as it gets. If someone persuaded my week I was about to die and then said "No, sorry, just defending you" I would raise some serious hell. I do not feel bad about giving away the jerk because I might be able to save some of you out of watching. Please save yourself and do not look at this picture.
