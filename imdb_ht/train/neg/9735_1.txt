I tried as hard as I was able to sit all the way through this irritating disruption, but I just could not do it. Brad Dourif absolutely sighed as the lead and all the support in support was only very badly worse. <br /> <br /> All the stuff is just funny, from the terrible act of the ridiculous FX to the stupid plot. <br /> Complete waste of time; Do not bother. Canal Root Therapy would be more enjoyable. Bamboo slaves under the nails should be a lot more beautiful. <br /> Look at a movie Boll Uwe would only be a little worse than that. Get the idea?
