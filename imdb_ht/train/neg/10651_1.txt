Want to know the secret to making a slasher movie set in a fitness center? Just paddle the movie out with beautiful ladies in tight super workout outfits and have to hit and grind the floor as they are in a gentleman's club. That's what the musicians in this movie slasher hunger did and that little gadgets kept me watching until the bitter end. This is the worst slasher movie I've ever seen, but every time I was ready to change the channel, they would add another scene to the workout girls and I would stay up. As a slasher movie, Killer Exercise fails in every category I can think of. As a showcase for beautiful girls working out, it is a success. Good recommendation to avoid, unless thought of half the film being a great T & A shows your appeal.
