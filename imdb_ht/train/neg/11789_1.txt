Currently it was stopped. Do not get me wrong, love bad movie monster. But this one was way too boring, regardless of the suspense music that never brought you anywhere. The actress had too many teeth at this time when he contacted one of the animals, there was way too obvious a clich√©. This movie totally betrays the cover on the DVD that looks very interesting. From the one cover expects a giant monster, but you find these beauties not as monstrous as airports expect to electric. Move about to watch another film called The Killer Rat but that's another review. Deep shock was really crap, a great shame considering the fact that it looks very high budget.
