Spoiler Warning. When the main character's sisters are pushed down the stairs, the killer breaks a glass of vodka next to it, so it appears to be drinking. But right before her death, tell her sister business partner (Teri Garr) to the phone that she did not have a drink in 4 days. But the police never mentioned the results of a toxicology report! And, the characters talked about drinking when he dropped down the stairs. Huh? Really bad mistake in this movie, which is very terrible, in general. <br /> <br /> Surprisingly bad, consider the great cast. There are some flaws: the writing is not very good, the music-made-for-TV bad, and there is no tension at all because we already know the answer to the mystery from the first stage of the movie.
