Yes I know "talkies" have just been invented for the movie 2 years earlier then produced in 1929 but this movie has shown that many have learned about the art of film products. It comes on as a filmed " host "plays stage with the actresses melodramatically enunciating the lines, rolling their eyes, using too many pause pauses and using the more appropriate silent movie gestures, which I suppose was normal during the process of educating them more naturalist on screen. The lines between the lines should be tightened up during correction as it considerably slow down the film. It is currently only the interest of Titanic slingshot who wants to see an early example of this sailor crash on film. In the next chronological order they could see "Titanic" (1953) a night to remember (1958) "Titanic (1997), to see how the cinema in the transformation of this tragedy as evolved over the years. There are many documentaries and TVs film was made including the atrocious "SOS Titanic" (1979) On my verse on which is a DVD, David McCallum provides the introduction. He has been playing Harold Bride Marconi in junior wireless operator of "One Night to Remember" (still the best feature film - please read my "Tribute to Walter" comment on IMDb under Howard Morley.demon.co.uk) and gave the commentary on the series of 4 videos called "End of a Dream" so it was well qualified to give the narration. In more interest I found a recording accompanied by current photos of the US Senate Hearing 1912 on the DVD. The speakers spoke the words by Lightoller 2nd Officer, J Bruce Ismay, Managing Director of White Star, Harold Bride and others including Gloria Stewart ( The "Old Rose" of Titanic 1997) whose voice is used for one of the first surviving women.
