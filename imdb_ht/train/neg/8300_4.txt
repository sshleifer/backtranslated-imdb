This is a sequel to name not only in "A Christmas Story," originally entitled "A Summer History." Ralphie tells his family's adventures during the summer when they moved to a small village in the middle of nowhere. Hilarity, unfortunately, does not happen. The original work has been due to its irreversibility and honesty - everyone can relate to it. This one is simply stupid and not very funny at all. Charles Grodin's latest film - not surprising! It's one of his poorest roles. I felt sorry for her. <br /> <br /> Mary Steenburgen is given little to do, formulaic everything, and you have to ask why they are bothered. <br /> And I mean, come on - a competition with spinning top! Unfortunately, it's the best part of the movie.
