Well, if you have a couple of hours of garbage, or if you just really hate your life, I would say to watch this movie. If anything is good for a few laughs. Not only do you have obese, native topless, but also special effects so bad they are probably outlawed in most states. Seriuosly, rating of 'PG' is pretty funny too, once you see the Native American Porn Extravaganza. I would not give this film to my delayed nephew. You did not even show this to Iraqi prisoner without violating the Geneva Convention. The plot is excuse, clich√©, and mute, and stupid. The act is terrible, and the end is so painful to watch I actually started pouring salt into my eyes just taking my mind off of the idiocy to fill my TV screen.
