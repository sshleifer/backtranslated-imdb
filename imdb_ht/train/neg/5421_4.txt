This is one of the topics I can relate to a little more than most people as I hate noise & no idea how people in big cities, New York especially how people get any sleep at all ! It astounds me that people can stop all the noise from those days. The basic draw of the movie is that it makes for an interesting topic. It's too bad that's about it. Tim Robbbins is decent although except for a couple of scenes (especially with the absolute supermodel looking Margarita Leiveva) it did not seem to really be all along. My biggest hope for this movie is that casting agents will see absolutely stunning & talented actress in boots, Margarita Levieva. It does not have much to do, but it is supermodel beautiful. Even when trying to make her look at more girl next door. It makes me sad that there are people like Paris Hilton & Kim Kardashian in the world / have no redemption skills or talent, have more fame and success than this talented beauty. I did not care for much of this movie because the script is not very good, but I'm glad I got to see some new talent. I hope the producers and directors think about Margarita when they need a nice new actress to be in big movie budgets. If Megan Fox is able to make a star (c'mon it is not hot, and he acts "talent" worse than make-up for Disney TV shows) in 1 movie, it should be easy for him, as he is gorgeous & has talent! I would recommend changing its name so we can pronounce it, and make it more marketable. Here's the hope of doing his career, and if there is any justice he can pop up on some big summer film or two of the next couple of years.
