I was all excited when I saw the ads for this movie because I recently read the book and really enjoyed it. The movie, however, did not meet my expectations. Having read the book recently prepared me for great let down as often happens when stories are translated into movies. The characters did not seem to fit very well with the book. The direction was weak. I had a hard time getting into the characters. There was not a real connection to the viewer about what was going on. The dialogue did not explain adequately what happened. It just seemed slapped along with the run. All in all I was very disappointed with the movie. I suppose if you do not read the book, it might be ok alone. At the very least, he might persuade you to read the book, which you will probably enjoy more. <br /> <br />
