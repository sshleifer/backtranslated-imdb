Rebar is an astronaut who goes to the world's first Saturn mission, but in the course of this movie a horror movie has turned into an ugly way and returns to earth as the only survivor. Including some rare conditions that cause her to slowly melt and lose her mind unless she regularly eats human flesh and kills what is apparently the nurse only in the hospital and saves the neighboring city to treat more victims. /> I like the site with the monster and gore effects are actually pretty good, but the space scene is just glued together from stock NASA footage to the hospital looks like curious as a warehouse. A very weak script, little character development and usually poor performance to keep this from rising above anything else than a mediocre slasher flicker and the gift of having a lively candle like the killer, and more or less only has its gore effect to keep you interest. <br /> 4 out of 10, strictly for the dead-hard movie monster fans.
