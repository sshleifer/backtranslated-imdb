With a movie entitled "Gayniggers from Outer Space" how could you go wrong? Just throw some of the stereotypes themselves for the characters, use the People Village as their main supplier for the band and throw in tons of gay gags. Conspiracy is important. Too bad, this movie does not have any of this and every joke misses the place. The characters all seem even apart from the German gaynigger, one or two jokes, the rest failed. <br /> <br /> The title makes me laugh and I was prepared to laugh even more on the movie. My exposure was high apparently.
