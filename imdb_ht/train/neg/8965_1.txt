This is pretty much a low budget, made for television, the kind of movie intended to capitalize on the success of the original. I'm a fan of b-cinema, and this one might be good they have not attached the name "cube" to it, because as is, the director and the original draw was the best, and this movie just about Losing everything I taste for the whole series. Characters are annoying and clique, have problems with continuity, and multiple direct visa-ups. The story hardly becomes a chance to develop because of unnecessary dialogue and suffers from it. They more or less use the same on the internet in the movie, and because the first was so good, this simply turned out as a disappointment. <br /> <br /> If this was a stand-alone b-movie, I'd probably give it to a card. The "1" rating I provided was pretty much a statement about how it completely paled into effect and intelligence as compared to the first.
