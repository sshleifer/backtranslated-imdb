I have never been a big fan of Taiwan film production as opposed to Korean, Hong Kong or even China. Quality act hardly found in them as clearly shown in this movie. I do not consider myself as hard-to-hear audience as I, in fact, a fan of independent movies. However this movie shows weak schemes and slow speeds. I found myself losing in the middle as where the plot is going. The act certainly does not make it better. Rainie's act is subtle as it 'over-act', trying to be perky and beautiful. Although I have admitted it is a fun look. Isabella Leong on the other hand plays a more appropriate role as a confused, sad, sorry, very reserved character. Overall I find this movie is a disappointment.
