I've read all Love Come Softly books. Knowing full well that movies can not use all aspects of the book, but generally they at least have the main point in the book. I was very disappointed in this movie. The only thing that's contained in this movie is that Missy's father is coming to visit (although in the book both parents come). That's all. The story line was so twisted and far off from yes, sad, from the book, that I just could not enjoy it. Even though I did not read the book it was too sad. I know that Pioneer's life was rough, but the movie was all a downer. The rating is for the same orientation of the family of the movie which makes them great.
