When I heard the plot for this movie I simply saw it, I mean whole cities being wiped out by killer tomatoes! Unfortunately the title is about comics as it gets. <br /> Led by Detective Dick Mason, a special team of military and scientists (including Greg Colburn who has never equip his SCUBA and Lt. Finletter who never photographs his parachute left behind) The Attack The killer tomatoes' are a funny parody of B Movies, in particular Japanese horror in the 1950s. The movie begins with a standard size tomatoes being discovered by a woman washing up in her kitchen before we find ourselves in a middle of a crime scene as the tomato supposedly killed this lady and let me tell you she does not get no unexpected as the movie progresses! To be just a couple of funny moments, for example anytime Japanese scientist Dr. Nokitofa speaks his voice armed over in an American accent, or when disguised experts Sam Smith infiltrate the tomatoes, can someone please pass the sauce the tomato? '. Equally this film was probably a lot funnier in 1978 and all of this is so good its concept. Unfortunately for the film 'Attack of the Killer' movie movie like the 'aircraft' and 'naked guns' series have been released and made this kind of comedy a lot better since. <br /> <br /> The act is atrophy; There is zero continuity of correction and it just feels really slow and lacking energy. For a movie parody of work you need a lot of things happening at once, one gag after it's over. The song of the movie looks useless with the ads for the furniture store that flash across the screen are damn right scarce, even for this movie. Finally, however, you can see why this film is only one cult; I can not see many people being indifferent to it. Sadly terrible would be as I would sum this up.
