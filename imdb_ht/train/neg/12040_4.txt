I do not know anything about the Iliad, so can not comment on its accuracy in this story. However, as a movie stand alone I found this very boring. The battle scene has tried great and spectacular but was just obvious CGI. The act is poor and no doubt Brad Pitt has cast just to attract the ladies. But it does not make a good warrior, too cute I'm scared. <br /> <br /> Good points are the design. This movie looks good with the landscape and castle buildings / impressive walls. I do like a movie that at least tries to find the true accent characters, but this movie just seems to ignore it completely. We hear American, Scottish English anything but what you might expect for a movie about an ancient Eastern civilization. <br /> In all, I do not recommend this movie for a family sitting. It is too long and the youth will get bored. <br /> <br /> For adults, it is OK if you do not care about the lack of realism.
