I know you've read that before, on many other films no doubt if you read the comments here, but voodoo academy still stands as the worst movie movie I was able to track down. No doubt that they really are not even available to buy or watch TV, but even so I feel it's just qualifying that I'm not just a few people who have been seriously picking up. <br /> I've seen two-thirds of the 100 films listed here on the IMDB, and I'm ticking at the ones left with all the luck. most of those who stand with their shoulders above this ... indispensable in absolute monotony. <br /> I like to pour really bad movie (as in people with no same humor in how bad they are) by how many people you need to watch it and do it all the way through. If you can look it in yourself, it is not that bad. if you can watch it with a single friend ... it's bad but it may be a lot worse. <br /> It took 5 of us to do it all the way through Voodoo academies. and not even moments are usually fun in watching the bad movie (stopping the boom moom for example, 3 times in this one if I'm not mistaken) could take the taste in my mouth. yes i would watch it, but i would also force 4 of my friends to watch it with me to achieve that end. <br /> I hope and pray you've seen the cutters directors ... think that there could be a version of 20 more minutes at large edgy edges and baby oil glands rubbing the rails just scared from hell out of me. So many of the movie centers around this. <br /> I'm proud of David Decoteau to manage this movie lens in two days on a short budget, as I applaud people to convince him to pay for it is no doubt a celluloid version of some of his fetishes them. but it is not a good movie. The original store of horror was shot at the same time in time for a comparable amount of money (considered inflation) and was a pronounced gem. It's not an excuse for how bad this baby is. <br /> <br /> Defoliation front ... <br /> it's not even worth picking apart the scheme holes or kichich know it all hero characters .. the rhythm of the movie ... is crazy ... Nothing ... is interesting for the length of time d√©cor dedicated to the pectoral massage head. no matter what your alignment or sex ... just rub can not sustain that type of screen time. <br /> <br /> The act is cheesy ... but not overly amatuer ... I've seen a lot worse in the best movie ... but somehow it's incomparable delivery of some in the worst line you'll ever hear in a movie, which really scratches. <br /> <br /> This lease if, like me, you have a passion with the worst of the worst, and only if you're going to look at it with a group of people who are preparing to work to get in it. This ha ha ha ha series wobbled artifacts. It's an endurance test you probably want to jump. <br /> I'm sure there is worse ... but I should not be surprised if she has the name of the scrutiny on it.
