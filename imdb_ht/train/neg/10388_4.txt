From it all the comments posted here about IMDb, this film seems to get declining over a lot, but I did not think it was wrong. I've seen much worse, actually. <br /> "House of Bad Living" is a ghost story about a husband and wife, Ted and Laura Fletcher, and their daughter, Amy, who moved into an old home in Japan. Little is known, a Japanese ninja brutally killed his wife and his girlfriend, and then killed himself 100 years earlier with a samurai sword. As strange things happen in the home, the ghosts of the residents begin to own their bodies in the living, and plan on re-adopting blood clots that took place 100 years back. <br /> I saw this movie and decided to give it a chance, from the cover it looked like a decent ghost story. It was routine, and it was corny, but I saw worse in my day. The ghost sequences were a little over-made, we get to see the translucent blue-tattoo figures randomly pop up randomly into the family and take over their bodies. To be honest, the ghosts of this type of movie remind me of the ghosts of the haunted castle ride in Disneyland. I can make mistakes, but after watching this, it seems to me that the film is Japanese movie "The Ju-On: Grudge" and the American rumor in that movie tear this to a little. The old Japanese house where a brutal murders took place, ghostly activities, curses put on the house, etc. But I can be wrong. <br /> <br /> To sum it up, this is a wonderful story story ghost. Do not go in the way you see it, but if you like this kind of stuff and it comes to TV you can give it a shot. 4/10.
