I think Micheal Ironsides acted as a career, if he had stars in this sort of crap crap crap. Surely he could do better than waste his time in this trash. <br /> <br /> This movie might be far better, if it has a good budget, but it shows repeatedly across the movie. There is only one scene in a previous post, similar, out there before a train station, and I bet it was. There is one scene that made this film a 3, and it shows the space craft landing and taking off on a lake, surrounded by forests. This was done well, but the rest of the movie, forgot it. There is another scene, which looks like a genius plant, which I bet it, and does not seem like a space as its character is. This film is stupid, has a very serious budget, makes no sense to God Help Micheal Ironsides.
