Once again I took a chance and rented this bag of crap. Budget as a horror movie, there was not one scene, not one, was the same distance effect. NOT ONE! Make sure you have some nudity, but all the lesbian action got a little old. I guess maybe have been supposed to be this film film saving? And Dann, what an annoying donkey !! Right from the beginning I knew I was in it when the good ol 'Dan first spoke. And he thought to be intimidating? What a laugh! All in all, this film is terrible! How to hell do movie like this get made? If you want a movie and some emotions in it, do not rent this one. This movie is about as thrilling as the Teletubbies.
