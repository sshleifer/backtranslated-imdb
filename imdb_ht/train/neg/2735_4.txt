I thought it was not the best re-mouth episode I've ever seen (though my watch partner gave me a tissue in anticipation at Brendan Fraser's time ... * sigh *). It was good to see Cox outside of the endless brush "Coxism State" it is in those days, if only for short moments. I also liked trying to put the episodes included in the character's length (or height, in JD cases) and juvenile in the earlier episodes. I can also see how Zach might well on the way to a very Chevy Chase / or is Matthew Perry? Prat-falls has induced chemical slip (already known as Conan). A short note beside this song (now stuck in my head) from the dvd-driven timer assembly was "diner" by Martin Sexton.
