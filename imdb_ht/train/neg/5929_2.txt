People who praise this movie are the real deception - I hope at least that Leonard will see some good $$ from this, as his life economy was embezzled away by a couple of years ago and it's over 70 now. But this movie is simply awful. At the beginning of Leonard himself said he is not sentimental about his past, and then for the next hour and a half the movie emphasizes all the faintest elements of Leonard's song. He is so bloody pretty and endless shut-ups on emoticon musicians. Cohen's interviews are all done in batch-video closeups and I wanted to see a medium or a long shot in her whole body! I could not care less about the reviews of the performers, especially those dizzying Edge and Bono boys. None of the performers of this movie have made even one song as good as Leonard's own music and if you're thinking about seeing this and you have any doubt at all, be careful. This would be an acceptable PBS special, perhaps, for one time show. But I'll be even hesitant to find a DVD in this. When the movie finally shows Leonard's semi-made "Tower of Song" it's lost by Bono to take a verse. Even the occasional good performances (Antony, Rufus's first number, Martha's insidious) is spoiled in the context of the rest of this turgid blagla. Forget this one, and go buy Leonard's most recent album if you want to pay tribute to it.
