When MAGIC at LASSIE opened at Radio City Music Hall, I was crazy enough to believe it would be as heartbreaking as some of the first Lassie films were. By story. The story was wrong, sherman singer brothers were below the usual levels, the characters were inspired by JAMES STEWART and MICKEY ROONEY both had seen better days. <br /> <<<<Then I was interested in seeing what contributions ALICE FAYE would be like, since it was absent from the screen for many years and has always been looking at its earlier role in Fox. Alice too, being dismayed by the crazy script and the unflattering photography. Another disappointment. <br /> <br /> There is nothing original here, there is nothing even remotely interesting for an adult to enjoy - and clearly, there is no magic present for anyone. You can skip this one without missing something.
