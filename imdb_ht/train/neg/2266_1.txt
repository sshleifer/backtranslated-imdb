Ringmaster, Jerry Springer's pathetic excuse for wasting films that should be recycled as toilet paper has recently crushed my confidence in the art of film. First of all, he did. Second, everyone went to see him. Third, some people have voted it the best movie they've ever seen. If a monkey could make a movie, I'm 100 percent sure it would be 1 billion times as good. Most cinema movies have moments, (even Godzilla had some cool cool effects) this movie was when I left the theater nauseated. The only thing that perhaps could have made this movie any worse would be if Jerry Springer was the star. If I want to set in crap for an hour and a half, I'll take a dump in a case. If anyone has ignored this film, I have pity for you, your children, and your grandchildren; However, contrary to Springer's belief, I clearly do not condemn gender.
