A shame that even a talented director, Desplechin, could not pull a decent performance from an unprecedented-actress, Phoenix, Esther Kahn lacks substance to convey a very brief and clear scheme. In an attempt to satisfy the circus circle of a behavioral actor, performance and presentation is too understandable and incorrectly executed to draw any compassion from the viewer. In a very long time running, the redundancy of Esther's battle is too melodramatic to be effective and to reduce the scenario to a fragile frame of a disaster display. The content is incoherent and free as Phoenix writes to carry out Desplechin's instructions, as Esther is supposedly trying to do the same. Never felt a victory over Alexander's pain, we never felt a victory in Phoenix's talent.
