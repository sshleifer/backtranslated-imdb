Once upon a time in the mid 1990s I was used to writing for DOCTOR who was fants and the whole of fandom kept its bidding on the new American producing DOKTOR that TVM. As soon as it was announced that the Archer Enemy Master's Doctor will play by Eric Roberts everyone scratching their heads and calling "Who is Eric Roberts?". I should point out this was before the IMDB came online when all you were doing was kind of a name in this resume website, but one useful helpful writing in a publication I wrote to explain that Eric Roberts was best known for a role in insulting F Murray Abraham, the film was called by SWORD and was on a fence school. Currently looking back now Roberts is best known for the POPE in GREENWICH VILLAGE and RUNAWAY drag, but didn`t stop people wearing the boot in both Roberts and by SWORD and his idea made up that Master This American and pulll sid he went to a phase. Strange most of the fans were angry at Roberts playing the Master, but after seeing the DOCTOR that TVM was a big fan of many (Myself among them) thought Roberts performance was the best thing about American disappointing production <br /> < Yeah I`m digressant but BY SWORD was a movie that I wanted to see simply because it was the first time I heard the name of Eric Roberts but I didn't get the chance to see it until that time the weekend and I was fairly disappointed with it. I do not know anything about fences (everyone else on this page looks like duty to mention if they are fence or not .. I'm not fence) so I do not know how accurate it all is, but as to mention the movie feels a bit Little Anachronism though you saw it on its release in 1991, the hairstyles seem a few years from date along with mixing her teens to cast a little dance routine that makes you wonder if she wouldn`t worked much pure good if it` was produced by Jerry Bruckheimer in the mid 1980s. You might argue this would mean that the relationship between Max Suba and Alexander Villard were cutting centers for most of the film but I was not convinced of love / love relationships with Abraham and Roberts gave better performance before and since the SWORD
