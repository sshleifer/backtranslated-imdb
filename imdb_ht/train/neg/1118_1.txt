I was really frightened by this strange movie. What a strange dark atmosphere. And such a creepy note music. Really promising! Indeed, after ten minutes you really start sweating, and feel comfortable, so you begin to fear the worst. This film has the atmosphere of a true nightmare, and what's worse-it all comes out. For an hour and a half I tried to fight full boredom and fell asleep, but the whopping band kept me awake. Noire Noire is a really awful picture - for your eyes, ears, intelligence, and most of all: your wallet, since the thought of spending precious money on a movie ticket for this cheap home video amateur is the biggest horror to everyone.
