Do not be sucked in renting this movie. It has nothing to do with an escape from death row, despite the title (English). I can not think of one good thing to say about the movie. Poor acting, poor correction, poor direct ... "draw" ridicule, and the sound / music was so irritating, it's a wonder this movie does not come with a warning label. The only possible way to sit in this movie and enjoy it is its quality cheesiness quality. They just do not make this movie anymore.
