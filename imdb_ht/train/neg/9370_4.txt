Although this is not a "big movie", there's something compelling and memorable about it. Like another comment on the movie, I've seen this from childhood. It was thirty years since 1952, but I never forgot the story or its ridiculous title is cumbersome. See if you have the opportunity. You will feel like a pious in small town life as it evolved in decades. More than any other film, this one brings a human face to the historical drama of the early "twentieth century" progress. It enjoys enough for a young and memorable viewer for a bigger one. In addition, it's easy to love the characters and watch the passages of time.
