Charged with fine actors, I expect more from "Deceiver" than was delivered. The plot is very understandable and manipulative. Many recapitalities are only added to the confusion. Cognition jumped out the window and the finish became unbearable and downright ridiculous. I would advise all those who love film scheme to be based on something that is at least possible to avoid "deceptive" because you will be very frustrated. Perhaps I'm just not hip enough to get it, but my suspicion is that many others were totally confused by the storyline and especially in the finish. Bluring the line between facts and lies simply does not work because the movie all made no sense. - MERK
