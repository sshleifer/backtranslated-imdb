T. Rama Rao has made some pretty beautiful films in the 1980s, but it seems to be a moviewriter who can not mature and time to change, styles and mods. It's like stuck with the same old-fashioned movie-making style. <br /> <br /> The actors are not bad, not good either. Anil Kapoor generally acts convincingly of the role of a father and his son, but the defective script often makes him look funny and pathetic. Rekha is good, but then - it's always good, and here it's nothing more than that. He does the best of what he has given, but he does so. In conclusion, there is nothing big at all. Raveena is OK, which means ordinary, not bad, no good, nothing. This film is melodramatic, occasionally stupid. Maybe it's a late film? Well, even then it still should be the standard standard. The script is awful, the movie is overdone, and the story goes nowhere. He felt like a movie that was born in the early 1990s, but the script made it look even greater, the style is like in the 1950s. <br /> <br /> Do not recommend, unless you are a big fan of the actors to start.
