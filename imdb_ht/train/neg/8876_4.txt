Sorting of family parody melodies "An officer with a gentleman", "Heartbreak Ridge", "Full Metal Jacket" (and no other movies I can not remember right now) in a rather dull movie, with some bright spots. Gags are always there where you would expect, and the Damon Wayans line, well, predictable. As I said, unfortunately this film never surprises you ...
