I do not know what would be so great about this movie. Even worse, why should anyone bother to see this one? First of all, there is no history. Someone could say that even without a movie a story can be worth it because it invokes some sort of strong sentiment (laughter, cry, fear, ...), but in my opinion this movie does not either. <br /> <br /> You are just watching images for +/- 2 hours. There are more helpful things to do. <br /> I think you can tell the movie is an experience and it's crazy because it misses all the above. But is worth 2 hours in your valuable time and 7 EUR in your money? For me the answer is: No.
