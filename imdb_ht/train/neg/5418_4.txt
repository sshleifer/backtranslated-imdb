This movie is like S.E. Hinton wrote in the 1970s and Copola was adapted to the screen in the early 80's, and Trueblood had actually been a product of either, the results might have been best (especially in the acting department). Instead, we find a rather so-fussy-it-funny piece of mediocrity. <br /> <br /> Jeff Fahey plays Ray Trueblood, an ancient street rumbler, I suppose the description is accurate. This was in the days of action films that were used to men in the 40s and mid30s and dressed up in grease greases or some kind of more versatile selection of garb gloves and they struggled with 80s lousy music. However, Ray is the caretaker of his younger brother, Donny (Chad Lowe at a party where he screams a lot), who he was forced to leave behind inexplicably at an air train station, on the run out In the cops, he is nabbed and forced to serve the time of the Marines. Flash forward to present day and Ray is back in the city and looking for his brother who has also become part of the street gang, although in a gang of Ray's opponent and now old scores to be raped established (and yet, cops to be excused with this time, a woman's honor in defending the sense of movie action) before Ray can bring about life at normal speed with his brother, Donny. <br /> <br /> For the most part, the film is quite ridiculous. For me, most of this was done and too far too many, although not by Fahey or Sherlyn Fenn who plays the waitress it befriends. The guys at the gang and Lowe himself seem to do quite a bit of exaggerated exaggerated as New York street stiff. Although, the larger hanging line is recycled and maybe a kind of film that has been well past its prime as a product in 1989.
