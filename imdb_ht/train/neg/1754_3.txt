Why do Mary and Rhoda stories be so astute? Divide women with indifferent daughters. And why so many small references to the original and character show? The daughter characters were funny and refreshing. Why can not any daughters love their mothers on TV? It makes sense that Mary would leave Minneapolis, and Rhoda would return to NYC, but why could not Phyllis or Sue Ann Nivens invite stars? It just looks a pitiful way to remember these wonderful characters. It was nice to see Mary and Rhoda together of course, but she could be better, better. Well, there was a Mari Tyler Moore Show Reunion, a Dick Van Dyke Show Reunion, hoping that Mary will do better next time if she reviews her old Mary Richards stomping ground again.
