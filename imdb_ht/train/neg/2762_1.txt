... no other person is watching the movie. My husband and I went to watch him last night. It's just a small theater, but there are usually a decent amount of people there. Not that time! My husband and I were the only people they watched dragon war last night! Now we know why. The film was by far one of the worst I've ever seen. Yes, the CG was good, but that was it. Acting, script & dialogue, directing, editing, etc. was God-awful! Since we were alone in the room, we felt free to talk during the movie. That is, we talked about how bad he was, that he reminded us of the Power Rangers Mighty Power Rangers, Godzilla, o combat and Lord of the Rings. It was like we expected to see Rita and Lord Zed portrait commander of Sauron's army. <br /> <br /> The animals were ridiculous. You can not only present the lion's dino / dragon / lizard stuffed down with cannon without explanation. The Lord of the Rings has a wide spectrum of characters, but it introduces and develops over 3 movies, not in an hour and a half. <br /> <br /> Transient scenes are awful. I did not fall asleep during the movie, but even though it was a pretty simple plot, I found myself getting lost in the draw hole. Characters were American white, but spoke almost and broke English because of the dialogue seriously written in the script. <br /> <br /> The final scene that might have saved some value in the movie ... failed. Etan did not cry when Sarah died ... though she did not know it for so much time during this life anyways. It did not seem too upset to be left in "Mordor", not knowing where he was or how to return. We could not for God's love know where it was or how it was there, but if it was not angry we would not be either. <br /> Oh, and why did the dress that Sarah's spirit brought as she borrowed from Queen Elizabeth? Another thing ... all 3 of the main hero characters were reincarnated to bring back to finish the job. Sarah completed her job and moved on the afterlife. Jack does so too. Then why Ethan get screwed? She was left alone, without the girl, without a map / compass / helicopter to help her get back. What should he do? Send smoke signals? What if he came back home, and just returned to his job? It should have been getting the same mercy of getting killed out of the movie that other heroes were. <br /> Do not waste your time or money on this movie. We only stayed until the end because we would pay for it, but as soon as the credit hit, we got out the door.
