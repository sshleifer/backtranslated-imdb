I do not quite get the rating for the Amati girls and I think I really gave it a 4 out of 10. What might otherwise have been a wonderful story and actually a series of more or less decent actors have become a total mascarade of my eyes. There are many clich√©s in that flicker, women's hair are just awful and most of the scenes are more than unrealistic or seemingly false. There is no real passion in this movie but a bunch of actors over-acting on any boundaries that it hurts. It's not funny enough to be a comedy, it's too scarce-sad really touched, so in my eyes it's just not good. Watching it I could not believe how something like that made it to my TV set in my living room in Switzerland. But maybe it was OK and it just got lost in translation? What knows. Definitely one of the oddest movies I've ever seen and this certainly is not in a great way! Padon.
