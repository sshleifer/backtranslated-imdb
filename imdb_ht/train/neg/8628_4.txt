My 7-year-old daughter loves her, as Disney expects krassly to figure out that she would. This is the problem with "Air Buddies." It is a not-to-number film-filled film that is filled with smoothly calculated carefully, a politically incorrect moral couple, and enough skin humor to avoid the reduced G rating. As a parent, or as a 10-year-old, you've seen it all before, and do better before. Think "101 Dalmatians Satisfied Home Alone" and you get the idea in general. I'm opinioning that a good child's story is a good story, period. "Air Buddies," which are about as original as recycled paper, neglected to meet the standards. It is not the worst video your child can look, but there are megatons of the best people.
