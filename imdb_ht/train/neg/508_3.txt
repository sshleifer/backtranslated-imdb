Early film directed by D.W. Griffith; He presented a glorious King (Arthur V. Johnson) and his queen (Marion Leonard) - but wait! When the king left the scene, the queen made music with the Minstrel Palace (Henry B. Walthall). When the king discovered the lovers, he decided to take a revenge Edgar Allen Poe-type. It is difficult to believe the lovers can not hear what they are accounting against; Although the actors are trying to look at the noisy (lovers) and quiet (mixer themes). These groups make the "Seating Room" look very scenes. Their performance is okay, and the story is easy to follow. <br /> <br /> *** The sealed room (9/2/09) D.W. Griffith ~ Arthur V. Johnson, Henry B. Walthall, Marion Leonard
