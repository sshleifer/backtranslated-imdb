I rented India Games, never heard of it but my fan of political scandal so I thought I would give it a shot. After doing some research on the movie, I found out that he was initially intended to release theaters, but instead went to narrow DVDs. After seeing it, I think, "Do not be surprised." The film is shocking in its unoriginality. The plot and the characters are perfunctory. I figured out about the half-way mark but the finish was a curb ball. I said, I did not expect it to end the good road he did, but that's not a point in his favor. The more predictable finish would be preferable to one that is so bad. Perhaps the movie makers saw how predictable the film was and so they decided to throw in a twist - even one that made the movie even worse. <br /> <br /> Stay away. I want $ 5.98 and 107 minutes back.
