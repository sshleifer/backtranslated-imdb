Spoilers <br /> <br /> Well, summarize one line saying it all. Melville's "Le Samurai" is the original and contains elements of "Leon". And they are best - best! <br /> Alain Delon's "Samurai" is a mighty warrior / professional who holds a bird in cage and is robbed of his work car (and lots of suspense in these scenes!). Even the end is exactly the same: the samurai seeks death in dignity and gets injection with a blank gun in his hand. The world has changed it and has no place for the samurai in it. Delon does not kill many people like the Holy Dog. But I guess Jarmusch liked "Leon" a lot or even "desperate" by Rodriguez. So, he added that, too. And let me guess: The girl will become a professional like the Holy Dog (like Natalie Portman in "Leon")? So what was Jarmusch thinking after all? Where is the unique, original thought of this movie? <br /> I can not see the point of copying carbon (seluloid) .. A 4/10 rating by Macaulay Connor
