This film, once sensational for its forward-thinking policy and reputation in free love and sexual liberation, has been reduced by time to a curiosity. It seems absurd now that this mostly boring little movie has been banned and seized by governments in many countries. Given the social status of Sweden eventually became 'radicalism' in its political, once controversial, appears naive and almost mainstream four decades later. With its sex scene, at one time the subject of essential cessantal traces, look nice to tame in a modern context. But the film and documentary accompany detailed detail its many controls and influence remain marginally mounted as an early reliquian of the 60th Youth Rebellion. Part of the movie that always keeps up: its self-esteem relating to the 'fourth wall'. Each time in a short time, the movie movies themselves make the movie. The satirical playfulness still exudes a chuckle.
