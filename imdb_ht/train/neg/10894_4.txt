"Vodou Academy" features an "Academy" like no other, one that only houses six students in one room. These young men are instructed in religion by a young young priest, who enjoys teasing and comforting together. The sole administrator of this "Academy" is a young and seductive head, and it keeps her beautiful charge on a short east, so to speak. young man. These young actors occasionally descend into the underwear panties sneaking on the "Academy," and their sexuality is focused at all in the movie. If you are not interested in the male form - stay away! Burdened by weak and awkward dialogue, this low-budget OS piece just stumbles along with a few special ridiculous effects kicks in between yawns. The atmosphere is claustrophobic, and tediously time to take, a handful of cheap sets and some costume changes. These visual elements come interfering with seemingly unending sequences of banal dialogue, intended as characters and drawings development. It gives one feeling of being filmed in three days.
