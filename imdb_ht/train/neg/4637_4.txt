Bangville Police supposedly marked the first of the Keystone Kops, named after the studio they worked for. In this one, however, they are not dressed in the funny funny costumes or driving the fast-paced car in their trademarks. Anyway, Mabel Normand is a farm girl here who asked her father for a calf. He later saw some strangers in the barn and quickly called the police. An answer to the chase is over. And Mabel slams her door as someone is coming in. Turn her out of her mother who jumps to the conclusions of the thieves! So, while Mabel blocks his doors and furniture, Mom and Dad try to fight their way through! This was perhaps the most fun part of the short and some explosions in the cop car. This was a short 7 minute walk that was not so fast on it before it started. The only real character that develops is the Mabel who hesitates charm and just his face, and big eyes and looks so optimally better here except, of course, when he was scared. It's easy to see why it's been a star. It's largely because of it that I would recommend seeing this at least once and why I give this a 4.
