This is the second film I've seen for Horrorfest last weekend, the Gravedancers were the first. Gravedancers were better. I can only guess from watching this that the production would be quite limited. I'll admit the story started out interesting, but really fizzled for me to the end. We have not really given time to sympathize or understand any of the characters that made only in their irregular features even more annoying. I have mentioned that there was also a bit of missions-filed with a 12-year-old boy acting as Sheriff. The only reason I sat in the whole movie was to find out what the big secret, which turned out to not all that interesting. Some more backgrounds on the family would help, but they did not seem really a family at all to begin with. <br /> <br /> For me, this movie is so amateur that I could not even see putting it on DVD. Evaluation of the map is for the first potential of the story to have. This was one for jumping to horrorest.
