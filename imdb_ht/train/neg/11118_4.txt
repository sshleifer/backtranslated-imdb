This was a popular movie probably because of the humor of it, the fast-moving story, an unbreakable character that locked all the loudmouths, etc. Funny stuff is, you probably could not make a movie with this title if you replace anyone but "white" like anything else would be racist by PC PCs. However, Woody Harrleson as the white guy turns out to be as good if not better than any of the black basketball players, is interesting as his main counterpart Wesley Snipes. /> Snipes had a lot of funny set-down lines, giving lots of humor. The bad part of the movie - which does not bother many people - is the extreme unreality of here and tight in all the characters. This includes Woody's girlfriend, played by Rosie Perez. There is no really clean, beautiful person in this movie. For this reason, I can not honestly recommend the movie, at least not to give friends or people offended by a loton profanity
