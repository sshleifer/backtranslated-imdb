This seemed to be a good movie, I thought it would be a good movie, and throughout the movie I was hoping it would be a significant use of my time, and yes, I must admit that the acting talent in Dim Kapadia and Naval Deepti where truly commendable, but despite the best effort this film falls short of effectively transmitting a meaningful message, which it seems is it seemed that Somnath Sen is trying to do. The final point comes short and the end seemed kind of satisfaction after all that happens; a bit like real life in respect but cinema contrary to real life ends at about 2hrs and the ending should leave the audience satisfied, if indeed what was the intended director. This falls short in this respect and that's what's missing me the most. <br /> Another aspect of my national stereo-typing national of American characters - they all seem to be carved out of the same block. Look at me that most American characters in American cinema are based on how Indian indians themselves see Americans to be like and it is clear that no effort has been made to bring any sense of depth or complexity to any American films in. /> <br /> These aspect sets together to make for a disappointing story.
