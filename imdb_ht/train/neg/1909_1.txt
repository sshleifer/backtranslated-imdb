One of the worst romantic comedies (No, Worst Cinema) I've ever seen. Boy (who works as a psychic phone!) Be pretending to be gay to move in apartment and woman to her dreams. Hilarity does not. Bribery, gay-bashing lights, and horrible dialogues do. If you read Brad Meltzer and such as his or her dialogue, you will love this movie. <br /> Be smart. Avoid it. if you see it, destroy the copy.
