I usually try to be professional and constructive when I criticize movies, but my God !!! This was the worst movie I've ever seen. Bad acting, bad effects, bad script, bad things! <br /> <br /> The draw follows a group of teen stereotypes on their way to a rave (which takes place in great daylight) in a remote island. However, when the group arrives, all they find is an empty dance floor and blood clot. Determined to find out what happened in the rest of the gated part, the tribe set off on a mission in a infested zombie forest. During this crusade, they will help by a police chick and a sea commander who just happens to have the right number of weapons to give each child. They also meet up with Jonathan Cherry and some other survivors. Basically, the rest of the movie is a collection of uninspired actions that include a shootout far too long outside of the "home of the deceased." This fight came complete with Hollywood cheesy violence, redundant clips from the HOTD video video, and sloppy cameras-camera cameras. One of the same volunteer volunteer characters himself to save the others. Why? Not because he was noble and brave but because part of his face was scarred by acidic spitting a zombie on it after he continued to beat the animal long after he was disabled! I suppose I'm sorry for this guy ?! <br /> To sum it all up, there is absolutely no point in viewing this movie unless you want to see for yourself just how terrible it is. The theater I was in was more dead than the zombies on the screen, and I'm sure the money I wasted to see this piece of sh * t can easily cover the costs it took to make it. GRADE: F
