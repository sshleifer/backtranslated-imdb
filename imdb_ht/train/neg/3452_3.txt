I opted to see the film at the recent Dubai Film Festival because it was chosen by the prestigious competition competition Cannes festival. I was surprised that Cannes might be so on the brand of judging quality. The film, some review, was noted there are too many bullets - but the inherent violence is abundant. Imagine killing your enemy / contenders in front of your son. You force someone to eat a spoon porcelain to prove loyalty. Some suggestions to contrast the Corleone sons of Copolla's "godfather" who seem to resurface here in this Chinese / Hong Kong movie but the quality of the two as distinctly different as chalk and cheese. The film is only recommended for junk violence .. there is no big movie here. At best it might be considered to be much better than normal Run Run Shaw production for value production.
