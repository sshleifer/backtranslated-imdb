Having seen before I had high expectations for Alive. Description of the movie on the back of the DVD jacket blown promising. Alive did not deliver. VERY slow development. The potential charge and the throw and the cool visuals. The first was intriguing but the settlement did not offset the builder. Could do much more to the end. Most of the movie is just "sitting around". To put it clearly, three of us were amped to sit and watch this film and not 50 minutes marking we had difficulty making it to the end. It really needs more traumatic elements. If you are looking for the Ichi killer or fight the version then save yourself some $ and loads of deception.
