A friend of lent me this video with me and I was fairly excited to watch it, but after ten minutes of easy easing the James pitchfield pitchfield and Lars hit his drum set in what appeared to be slow motion began to think, 'Why do I watch this? 'This question will be coursing in your mind at 5 ?? 10 minutes after you hit playing. I gave the tape back the same day, as you suspect, is not worth buying or watching! <br /> Just my opinion! <br />
