WE ARE AVAILABLE RIGHTS <br /> <br /> Asset: 1.33: 1 <br /> <br /> Format: Silent <br /> <br /> (Black and White - Short Movie) <br /> <Stan ' N 'mixing up with a couple of floozies (Deslys and Vera White) after putting out to visit a theater that burns down in their absence! Needless to say, the tyrannical ladies (Vivien Oakland and Bess Flowers) are not amused ... <br /> <br /> The comedy OK McCarey puts the narrative framework for William Sister's Prince in the Wilderness (1934), and L & H plays the brow-beat victories in circumstances, forcing them to say a mischievous falsehood that looks at spectacular fashion. Many of it is very funny, especially the stage in which Stan is teased by Deslys, leading to a violent game of pushing and shoving. However, some of the fun is off by Oakland and Flowers, playing their roles completely straight, which adds a component to the unpleasant scenario 'henpecked husband'. Originally released in the UK as we slip UP.
