Oh just what I needed, another movie about the England 19th century. Which is pretty much like regular England, only vandalizing the normal football stadium. In this picturesque setting of princes, dames and other randomly selected titles, Charlotte Gainsbourg walks around harsh as Jane Eyre, from which nobody ever wants .Jane usually hanging from MrRochester's crib, where she tries to teach a French girl to look at a blank blank board all the time. One day MrRochester (William Hurt on self-pilot) has fallen in love with Jane and all that, but there's always the problem of wife's coffee wife who is close to the attic. Or, that was not in the brochure. After some people were thrown around with some fire spread very carefully (they probably rented the set) , the movie finally came to an end. All looked really authentic, it's something I guess. But then again, close.
