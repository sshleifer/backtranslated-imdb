Rarely has such an amazing cast wasted. Griffin Dunne, Rosanna Arquette, Illeana Douglas, Ethan Hawke, Dennis Hopper, Christopher Walken, and John Turturro, all flying on board, only to be torched by a script that seems like nothing more than a Hollywood joke. Attach the name Martin Scorsese to this was probably the draw, but the end result is way less than the sum of its part. Entering a nightmare goes horribly wrong, each scene looks more flawless than the next. "Search and Destroy" is nothing more than abstract, stylish, self indulgent, and filmmaking of all is definitely dull .......... MERK
