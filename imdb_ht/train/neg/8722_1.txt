Not to be confused with Lewis Teague's "Alligator" (1980) which is actually an excellent film, this "The Fiume Del Grande Caimano" finishing worker's exotic trilogy Sergio Martino did at the end of the seventies (including watching over "L 'Isola degli uomini pesce' and not so good 'La Montagna del dio kanibal'). Draws the extreme scheme of "jaws", the script fails to create any suspense that forever. The beast is funny and its victims are simply jerky. Stellvio Cipriani's stunning melody illustrates the adventures of these funny tourists presenting from the very beginning as the obvious items of meal. No chills from this, rather laughing actually! And we could get this flickingly ridiculous flick if the dialogues and appearance of the natives were not so obviously inspired by pure racism. Very soon the giggling stops in favor of a feeling of temptation as a patronizing attitude. We could excuse seriously film and poor FXs, but not the kind of mentality. Do not ever!
