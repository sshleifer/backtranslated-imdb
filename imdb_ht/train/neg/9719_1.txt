Ummm, please forgive me, but have not been more than half the characters missing? In the original novel, Valjean is a man imprisoned for 19 years for stealing a bread pen and then trying several times to escape. He breaks free and pursues relentlessly by the Javert police inspector. Along the way there are many characters that were not in this version. Some worth mentioning should be Fantine, Cosette, M & Mme. Thenardier, Eponine, Marius, Gavroche, and Enjolras. The only character with the same name is Javert. I was confused and frustrated in the entire movie, trying to see how he was in any way connected to Victor Hugo's novel novel.
