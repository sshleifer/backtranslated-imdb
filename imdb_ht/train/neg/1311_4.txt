Jerry Spy Tom listened to a creepy story on the radio and sought the opportunity to scare his nemesis. <br /> <br /> I did not find this particular funny episode: The humor seemed rather constrained and put in all as host (Jerry is essentially the 'bad guy' of this one, tease poor Tom for no particular reason). There is the occasional flash of inspiration (like Tom's literal experiments, and the moment when his nines life sucked out of his body), but, in the whole, the effort to miss the frenetic rally, excellent animation and understands the absolute most of T & J's animated cartoon.
