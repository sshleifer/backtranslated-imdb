A very usual Italo-Western Trashy, stupid storyline full of clich√©s and lack of logic, some mediocre actors, dirty surroundings, many of the punch battles and those who shot dead on a massive scale. <br /> This has nothing to do with Django. - At least not in German translation version, this German DVD-release called "Adios Companeros" and was Macho Callaghan fighting Butch Cassidy and Ironhead because the gang killed one (it is the only survivor). Then you have Butch Cassidy and Ironhead fight each other because they are chatting with the cracked glove. And you have Ironhead fighting against everyone because it is just stupid at bigger and most vicious anyway. Yeah, that's it, no more clever in the storyline, hehe. A small role by Klaus Kinski as Cotton Reverend is remarkable (That's why I bought this DVD). In one scene she tries to separate two men fighting by striking them and screaming "I told love!" and in another scene she has a competition to send Horseshoe and go black for a second - FANTASTICFANTASTICFANTASTIC !!! <br /> It is also noteworthy that JOE d'AMATO aka Aristide Massaccio has made the cinema - I love this incompetent exploitation-thrash master, so it was a "aahhh" for me.
