Your heavy film Paper purple holes a secret organization (purple moths) against the Japanese forces worn in Shanghai. Ding Hui (Zhang Ziyi) and former lover Hidehiko Itami (Toru Nakamura) find themselves on the opposite side of the conflict after a lucky meeting. I agree with the review from Paris. The film overturns a conflict, semi-historical conflict for a draw, without giving the audience a reason to care for the characters or to cause them. The sudden change of time does not help matters as it appears completely unwarranted and pointless. Normally I do not mind movies, but the absence of light, foot-jarringly incredible foot camera, and the generally bad movie-making techniques really make this a movie difficult to look and stay interested in. I agree with the viewer from Georgia that this movie "has a chaotic modification style and claustrophobic movies", but I do not think that helps the movie. The group of films is one of the most powerful events in the 20th century, and I do not think you can do it any justice by correcting it as if it were a Michael Bay movie. Short-term melodramatic times do not add to its readability. <br /> <br /> The actors are all of a sudden saddeness. Zhang Ziyi once again shows that she has an exceptionally limited range of acting as she spends the movie all by herself that she looks best at all of her films, brooding and she is generally annoyed. However, at least it adds some variety to this role by chainsmoking and engaging in the worst performer scene since Michael Biehn and Linda Hamilton at the Terminator. <br /> <br /> All in all, a very disappointing movie, especially seen as it comes from Suzhou Li director. 2/10
