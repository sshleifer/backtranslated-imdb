The stereotype of the warrior-shocked soldiers from the war here is providing treatment materials. Spare a splendid cast, acting on their talent limits, can not deliver 'return to the soldier' ​​from its stubborn-inability to move the viewer into emotional involvement. Best time, as another review noted, comes Glenda Jackson on screen; but even the incomprehensible Jackson's inability to nuclear can not pull this movie chestnut from its cold, never warmed hostels. Ann-Margret, she's sex-kitten reputed and too often accused of lacking ability to act, finding current and profound ability to waste here - despite talking to an unprecedented Middlesex accent. Blokus notes, redundantly in many ministries 'ministries' slatered-on sacralist emotionalism, are in lamentable and emotional remoteness of the script, blocking, and overbaked formalism in the direction; except for its scores and script clips and directions, the 'return to the soldier' ​​has all the right bits but it fails to work together.
