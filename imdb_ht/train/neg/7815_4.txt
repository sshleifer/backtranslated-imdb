As a longtime fan of comics, in the 1950s, the first two Chris F Reeds and Lois & Clark, and finally Smallville, I was * really * hoping for something clever and "Superman Returns". Instead, we received Lex Luthor * another * attempt at real estate conversion, another sequel to superb-beats-while-put-cryptonitis, and internal inconsistencies: it could not stops itself falling into the ocean when stuck with 6 "of cryptite, but when Lois breaks off 3" of it, * leaving the rest integrated into him, it can arise * a continent * in space ?? Really, the only hero of the story was Lois' partner - I can not remember his name at hand. He has made all sorts of life, heroic things that are nothing but intestinal and competent - there is no superpower, no invulnerability ... just a normal person. <br /> They keep to superman for tiny. Why can not we have Brainiac Battle Superman or fight to save the universe from General Zod instead of little Lex's quick. Oh, I forgot ... they're doing this in Smallville. <br /> Yeah ... I think I'll stick to Smallville ... <br /> <br /> You probably should, too ...
