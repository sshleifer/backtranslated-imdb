All David David movies are terrible on all counties: bad writing, bad acting, bad movies, no budget (the principal's fees are usually cast as the male lead). But they all have incredible entertainment values ​​because of the unintentional odds. The plot of almost every David Before "movie" (as I like to refer to them) is basically the same. Manly all-American team bomber ups to blow up wicked communists. But unlike other Cold War-era trash like Red Dawn, movies are actually funny because of the over-the-top and acting premises. The best part of Jungle Attack is the scene at which Becker (or was the other dude?) Named General Mitchell for a top-secret mission in South America. The funniest line of the movie then delivers, something the effect of "this is my roommate, I train it well". KISA. Do you train your roommate? And apparently this will be the solutions to avoid eviction. <br /> <br /> If you can find these gems on video used anywhere, buy them. They are all funny and even funnier after a few beers. Look at them with a group of friends for a true MST3K-style experience. So far my friends and I have managed to get a hold of Night War and aerobicide aka "Killer Exercise". But the one I recommend much more about them all is the final penalty, and the freakish-looking Robert Z'dar.
