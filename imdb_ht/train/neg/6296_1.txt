This movie looked interesting; I would read the book a number of years ago and informed me that the following track follows the plot very well. <br /> <br /> Start looking at him and almost from the outset it fails to live up to expectations. In fact, I did not bother watching the whole thing ... drivel extract - bad performance, bad acting and immediate immigrant characters - that was the point in the movie I guess. Leave a bad taste in the mouth and put me on a downer for my weekend weekend. <br /> Do not bother with this feature.
