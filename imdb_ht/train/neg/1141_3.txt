Having many expectations is happening, new foot openings (more than five minutes' clock) in 'Mary' has come as a wonderful surprise. I will not say that the new foot is class A material, but it provides a very solid foundation for what "could" be a good all-original movie. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this was put together in 1955, during a time of a day shooting schedule. After the new footage, Jules White decides just thumbtack stocks from 'Bridless groom' in this short, making for a not-so-smooth history transition that Jules and Felix Adler try to remedy with a quickie bit of new feet Finally, give us the old, end-end of the boys (Moe & Larry in this case) getting shot in the butt.
