This video has an outsmart way to confuse and manipulate Americans about Islam. It's a pity that the people who did it really believe that the Americans, so dumb believe in it, maybe, as a US citizen, everyone must protest against this kind of crap. If you want to know the truth about Islam, do not let anyone tell you ... QURAN IS PUBLIC! you can read it by yourself and decide whether to say it is true or false ... The video uses a lot of audiovisual strategies that direct to manipulate and associate things that are not even related. Music is used at some point in preparing the public to hate what they see, even if they do not really understand what's going on there. The default images are used from the original content. At the end of the comment I would like to make a reflection ... Do not you think you can make the same movie with every religion in the world?
