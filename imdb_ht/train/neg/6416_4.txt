PA-SO-SPOILY BEHAVIOR AHEAD <br /> Why do people, when they are disoriented or sick or scared of a club, cut off the crowded dirt floor crowded on their way to the bathroom? <br /> Who's the right idea to hide under a bed when someone breaks into the rooms? <br /> How many times do you knock on a foreigner's door and do not IMMEDIATELY answer, you open the door, walk through, call a few hello and then start going to things? <br /> If you were persecuted by someone you just discovered was a murderer, what would you do? Very sneaking off and hiding under a wooden platform or middle metal applied? Running, slowly of course, in an old hunger style or other decadent structure? I could talk about almost any gossip that came out in the past few years, but since this is the "Return to" page, obviously I'm talking about "The Return." I saw it free because I worked in a movie theater, and made a point of screening all the "scary" films. I thought that this one was tolerated ... aside from the clubs well torn. Sarah Michelle Gellar is really drab and looks like "Huh?" in most of the movie. The details of the plot are slowly given out as the movie is progressing and it's almost enough to make it interesting except there was enough explanation as it moved on and so I was almost lost until 2/3 the last of it. > <br /> If you're a fan-dead fan, it's worth seeing at least once. If there is nothing better in the theater and you really want to watch a movie, eh, I guess it's worth a ticket ticketed. If you thought the trailer made it look like an exciting movie and you can not wait ... wait.
