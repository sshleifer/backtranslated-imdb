This is a really stupid movie of genre typically 80s: comedy action. Its design resembles Rush But hands completely miss the action, laughter and chemistry between the main characters in that movie. Let him know that I enjoy Jay Leno as a stand-up and as a host of talk show, but she just can not act. It is terrible when it tries to act hard - it barely managed to keep that trademark smirk on his face while saying one-materio that, by the way, are not very funny. And seeing him run (even back then) is not a nice sight. In addition, I have a feeling that Pat Morita - at least by today's standards - does not give a very politically correct impression to the Japanese. Not even finding I started on the story. I give it a 2 out of 10.
