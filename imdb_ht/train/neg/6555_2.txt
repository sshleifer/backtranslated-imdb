So the other night I decided to watch Tales from the Hollywood Hills: Natica Jackson. Or Power, Passion, Murder As It Calls In Holland. When I bought the movie I noticed that Michelle Pfeiffer started to read and I thought they were saying something about the quality. Unfortunately, it was not. <br /> 1) The plot of the movie is really confusing. There are two story lines running together during the movie. Only they have nothing in common. Throughout the movie I was waiting for the moment this line of lines would come together so the scheme would be clear to me. But it still does not have. <br /> 2) The title of the movie tells the movie going on Natica Jackson. Well it is, sometimes. Like telling the movie of two different stories and the party on Natica Jackson is the shortest. So another title for this movie would not be a wrong choice. To conclude my story, I really recommend leaving this movie where it belongs, on the shelf at the store in a place nobody can see it. By doing this you will not waste 90 minutes of your life, as I did.
