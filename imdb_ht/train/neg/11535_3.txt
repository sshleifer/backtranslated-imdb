Gillian Anderson is an arrogant, driving, career woman who picks up Danny Dyer's oak class for a night of fun. After a stupid accident in the country, they are brutally attacked. After recovering, and after a lucky meeting with one of the attackers, thinking of turning into those of revenge ... <br /> I think "Straight" was awful. Violent, brutal, misogynist and unpleasant. If I did not hit the phrase a great deal I would call "Straightheads" a nasty video. Certainly it was kind of movie that could have a budget release no straight in video during the dark days of the 1980s. Frankly I do not know how "Straightheads" got a movie release. <br /> I'm not proud. I do not mind sex and violence in the movies, but they must be married to a movie and a) a good scheme or b) good characterization or c) preferably both. "Straightheads" was not. There is no progress in the plot or the characters and excesses left unreasonably and unsaid. Chances "Straightheads" have gone fast now. It was only 80 minutes long. <br /> It was a shame, because there was the germ in an interesting movie here, with an especially interesting turn of the plot of the last third. How often I said that, but it could be good if he did well. What a shame. I really love Gillian Anderson and Danny Dyer, but they were on a hidden nothing with this movie. He, especially, is very underrated (and still particularly fit). If you want to see a good movie British revenge, rent or buy shoes "Dead Man's Shane Meadows". It's a little prince. Last weekend I should see it "This is England" instead. Se sera sera ...
