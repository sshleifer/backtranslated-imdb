It's sad so that Audience Reds are still populated with vulnerable and unhealthy people who relinquish this kind of cheap shows and demonstrations, as superficial and brutal as the series "Garcea" or "Vacanta Mare" children play. The difference is that Mugur Mihäescu, Doru Octavian Dumitru and other sub-craftsmen are supposed to claim their show as "art". Pintilie, who 40 years ago made a very good film ("Duminicä la saase") followed by another, beautiful enough ("Reconstituirea"), trying to declare his film "lenghts" work art - but , unfortunately, its master in a way too limited level denotes specific cinematographic expression. As such, "Niki Ardelean" offers yet a sample of "HOW" - this was about its only merit.
