The special effects of this film, especially for its time, are mockable and used in such an on-the-counter way that you can not deny their exotic existence. <br /> <br /> The act of redefining the term "terrible overacting" in the hands of Meg Foster and Richard Joseph Paul, where julie Newman and Andrew Divoff just redefined "bad". <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The charm of this movie can be found in two things: The first is the excellent cast of Carel "Lurch" Struycken as a gossip mysterious psychic, who can sense where and when people die and are still there. Originally found, the SF-Western combination is obviously original, though terrible, but other findings are more original, such as Zack Stone's gun being able to sense the pain of the people he shoots (though his act falls short here)> <br /> In general ... do not see this movie, except you like that hunk-o-brital Carel Struycken, as any self-respecting Dutchman should.
