The plot was very thin, although the idea of ​​naked, sexy, male mermaid is good. The movie just seemed to meander from a meaningless scene to another and far too few nuddie / splatter / lips lesbian licking vaccine between. <br /> <br /> Characters were wooden and one dimension. <br /> <br /> The finish has no sense. <br /> <br /> Considering having Tom Savini and Shaun Hutson in it, you would expect a decent draw and decent special effects. Some of the effects were quite good but there were just too few of them. <br /> <br /> Brownie points away for incidental flash of tits and bushes, of course, and of course lesbian moments. I also thought that the scene and bathing the mermaids in the pool under the waterfall can be seen as an innovation on the 'scene scene' <br /> <br /> The movie has lots of elements that go to make a first movie horror movie but was wrongly executed or used too fainly. If I watched this alone and aged 15, I would really enjoy it for about 10 minutes (and 1 hand in the remote control), then lose interest suddenly and need a pizza.
