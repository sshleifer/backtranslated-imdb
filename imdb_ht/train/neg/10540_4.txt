Patrick Channing (Jeff Kober) is a disciple of Satan / serious assassin who owns the "First Power": even after being captured by Russell Logan (Lou Diamond Phillips) detective and executing in the gas chamber, he is able to move his spirits, from body to body and continue to murder in will. With the help of psychic psychic Tess Seaton (Tracy Griffith, Melanie G.'s half-sister) she tries to stop Channing. This concept probably has some options, I think, but finally "The First Power" suffers from routine and movie-making scripting. This is nothing we have not seen before, sometimes doing better. There is nothing about this movie to distinguish it from other supernatural horror therapy. More to the point, it's not very thrilling and it certainly is not scary. Phillips is a hard soldier as a hard-like-nail, cynical stereotype cop, and Griffith does not seem to be trying very hard; Best cast member is probably the distinction Kober, making it better to be very creepy. <br /> <br /> The highest score is rather funny and the finish is very weak. <br /> <br /> Not really even acceptable enough rate as an average movie of its kind, therefore: <br /> <br /> 4/10
