Mighty Morphin Power Rangers from 1993, supposedly based on the Japanese TV show sentai that began back in the 1970s. Now, as a fan of Japanese action films and series, you'd think I'd get a kick out of this show. <br /> <br /> You might not worry. What worked in the Japanese version became a complete abomination on television and guard powered lean Rangers. <br /> MMPR is based on five adolescents who get power to become superheroes costumes and robotic dinosaurs that form an even bigger robot. <br /> <br /> Now this quotation is far distant and more ridiculous than anything in either movie Transformers, again, the ridicule of this show is often neglected. <br /> It was followed by two really bad, and I mean, really bad movie hit compromise, and the actors start in this series, completely disappearing from the scene. <br /> <br /> If you have to choose, try watching Japan's Zyuranger series instead. > <br /> Also, what's up with the awful fantastic 1990s and all the rings on the guys? It makes them all look feminine!
