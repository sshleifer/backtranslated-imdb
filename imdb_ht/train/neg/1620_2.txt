This movie has a little recommend it, though that little was the breathtaking spectacle, cinematography and the wildlife direction, it's hard to bring up its weakest point in the company in the revenge reviews. It is precisely these things, however, that make the lack of a satisfactory plot and its execution so irritating. <br /> I watch this with my kids and none of us was too impressed at the end. Yes, the pictures were great, the big landscapes across the forests and magnificent mountains, but what went on in the foreground? The rather dummy sort of sort of an insupid girl who learns all too slowly a very basic lesson about befriending wildlife - and gets off easily giving the track record of the kind of stuff. It is certainly not a new story, in fact there is nothing remotely novel on the road he says, and we've all seen this before and, indeed, much more eloquent by Antoine de Saint-ExupÃ©ry. /> The only thing really gleaned out of this movie is a sense of how to work with these wonderful lens and forest lighting; The rest is a waste of time.
