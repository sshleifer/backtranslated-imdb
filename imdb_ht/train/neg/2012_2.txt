Life in some fascist or near fascist fears of severe personal freedom restrictions is a recurring theme both in modern literature and for movie makers. These jobs are posting us warning about unwanted trends in our society to watch for; but to be effective to be fun too. Unfortunately most of the books are probably more effective in posting the warnings than in our fun enough to become really broader; Also with the movie the problem is usually the other way round. These first works have become really widely known to George Orwell's "1984" (first published in 1948), and this is still available both in the form of a book and as a movie. or read it: then when you feel a little depressed by the human being of the man, arrives for Cinderella 2000. This is a low-budget movie comedy film based on the same theme that gives easy look unrewarding; and as of 1984, the calendar has now gone beyond its temporary period. Most of the comedy is set on with a laugh although there are just a few really funny moments. Exercise your mind through interval time between these you can focus on the question whether or not this movie will find a new extension in life being released as a DVD or if it will eventually disappear from oblivion as copy existing tapes deteriorate past redemption. There are so many movies that appear as DVDs in those days, and honestly I do not care much about what's going on. <br /> So far the best of the genre movies was probably the "Handmaiden's story", but I would very happily swap them all for a well-made movie of Jack London's immense Roman "Talon and Iron ". Ambitious as it should, it still seems incredible that no modern movie maker again dared to try it (IMDb only lists a B / W silent version made in Russia in 1919).
