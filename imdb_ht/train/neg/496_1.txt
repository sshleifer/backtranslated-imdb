Imagine you are a high school boy, in the back of a dark, uncrowded theater with your girlfriend. How bad would a movie be, in order that you would feel forced to leave the theater and roof before it ended? This movie is that bad. Really. Movies often become so bad that they're good; This movie is beyond this stage of bad-ness. It is painful. Orywar, terribly, crime-against-mankind bad.
