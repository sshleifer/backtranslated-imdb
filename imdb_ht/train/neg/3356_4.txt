Shirley Jackson's novel 'Haunt House Hill' is an atmospheric story of horror, which translates supernatural phenomena into an old castle. The atmosphere is well laid out, and the thrill is well-tuned. A haunted song. <br /> <br /> The 1963 Chiller 'Haunt' stays in the book, but also adds its own details to the plot. Fortunately, these are very few, and so the fear of the book and the thrill is executed even better on the screen. Black and white pictures only add to creepiness in the movie. Excellent! <br /> <br /> Then John Bont did this. In 1999, the rumor of the haunting hit the movies - if you could call this a remake. Why did a remake of the movie in 1963 is a mystery of itself, but for the moment, allowing the movie to look at itself. <br /> It starts in averagely, like most movies do. The series used for Hill House is beautiful, with mysterious mysterious, and for a few minutes, it looks as if the movie is actually going to be quite a just re-telling. Then the scary first comes: a loose wire is locked in a woman's face (Assistant Dr. Marrow). This is hilarious, and truths have said, it almost had me in tears. Since then, the movie just spiral downturn. The act seems to be a bit wild as the movie goes on, and Owen Wilson's character has been particularly disappointing (so it's like a rescue when it's decapitated by the leak). The special effects practically make this film, which is a shame, because most of them are incredibly cheese and look very dated. Examples of these are so many, so I will not disturb the lists. So, all in all, I, along with hundreds of others, recommend that you look at the original chiller, or, as an alternative, buy the novel by Shirley Jackson. But please stay away from this. And, if you decide to watch this, watch it on the TV (like a lot of channels like this movie screen, and not the original) or rent it cheap, but please do not buy it, whatever you do . Do not waste your money! <br /> Final rating: 4/10
