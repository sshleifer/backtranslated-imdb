Actually, this flicker film, made in 1999, has good value production good. The actors are attractive, with reasonable talent. There is a bunch of clowns running around explosives away, spending hundreds of judges, but never striking their bodies. Nor have chassis / crash chassis where thousands of dollars worth of beautiful cars are unusually trashed. The interiors look respectable to modern, architectural, and the equipment looks up to snuff. Well, there are high-tech computer rooms furnished with similar residual foods from an '50s electronic laboratory. And the make-up pellet on the bodies split me up. Do not pear make-up in the conventional sense, but that looks like dry dried jars slathered on exposed pots. This is supposed to support the body's thoughts that have been calcified - even though how the virus would accomplish this transmutation is a leftover exercise for the student (viewer). Ah yes, the virus. I would like to tell you that this is not the absolute quote worse for a sci-fi, horror movie I know, but I can not. A computer virus transmitted through a TV (or computer controlled) screen and becomes a biological lethal pathogens? Gimme a break. Chain of a "Star Trek" is one thing, but does porn become viruses? This is so funny to the "frightening factor" just is not realizable. The cops used one of the terrible dream sequences where the dead come alive, or there is a cat to jump out of the closet, or something, because this viral disease does not do it. One president Robert Wagner has the same excuse for playing in this unanimity that Lord Oliver has provided for some of his later avenues. He needed the money. No comparison between the two should be interpreted, however.
