She is so sad. Even if this shot and movie I think it feels a bit more flickering like Blood Lake, there's nothing out there &. The music to play in this is the funniest thing I've ever heard. I love the brother and sister of this movie. They both do not try very hard to sound sarcasm when saying things like "My friends are going to be so jealous!" Hey, what with the killer just wearing his mask at the start? Sa reta! I practice ignoring the second half of this. My favorite part of this film is the sound effect used when the assassin is using the ax. The same exact same for every cut!
