I decided to watch this series after seeing the endless ads for it on the BBC in the weeks before it started. I look at it despite the fact that I do not like the kind of pretense of things that Alan Hollinghurst writes (regret his fans but I think we have a case in the new Emperor's clothing and this author's work). I admit that the act is excellent, it's nice shot and I was reasonably entertained by it - however- I found that the scenario was very thin and after watching all three episodes feel very dissatisfied with this rather empty output. 'Explicit' gay sex in which the media was down on all done before on TV - several times - so it was nothing very shocking I'm scared. Full Mark for production value but are low for scenario / content I'm scared.
