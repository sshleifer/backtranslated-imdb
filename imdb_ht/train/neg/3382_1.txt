This is one of the worst movie adaptations of a never-made music. The version of the Chorus Line is wonderful. This movie lacks the mark in almost every way. Even the casting is unforgettable. Take Audrey Landers as Val. "Dance 10 Watch 3" is song Val. Val's story is that it's a great dancer but a 3 in the department looks like. Yes, he finds a solution, but finally he's a great dancer. What makes the filmmakers glossy to do? They hire an actress who can not dance and is famous for looking great. Ways to miss the boat. <br /> Then there's choreography. I'm sure Michael Bennett turned to his cell. Why did not use its choreography? It really can not be improved on.
