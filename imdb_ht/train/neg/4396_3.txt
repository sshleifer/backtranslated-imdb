My complaint here concerns the film's rhythm and material at hand. While using archival films and borrowing movies in a cool and interesting perspective, too often the material chosen to emphasize simply is not very interesting (such as when Goebbels complains about this or that disease, & tc., Or nauseam footage in his small German town). Also, the movie pulls together to cover c. 1920-1939 and then vapor in the war years. In sum, the movie is slightly better than a History Channel documentary, with the exception that the cinema has a slightly greater sensitivity than your editors editor of the Medium Document and thus can be more skillfully arrange the details of life Goebbels. Still, I found he wants.
