OK, a movie slasher. a very, very stupid movie slasher. <br /> We got your stereotype adolescent in a home stuff going. We received an FBI agent who saw Harry's room once too many. "So what's secret .... punish?" We got about 4 different camera shots and scenes that make no sense at all. "Hey, I'm repairing the plumber" ((That guy was my favorite part of the film)) Even when a prank was tied up on a couch watching his movie theater, he died. Follow the killer in the middle of nowhere, with no cops. Suddenly she's in a church, wearing a wedding dress. I swear this is the stupid slasher movie I've ever seen.
