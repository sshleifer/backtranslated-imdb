Look, I read and read the comments and have a lot of it that I mean but I will try to make it short, but clean ... <br /> <br /> First of all, letting forget all things how bad this movie did ... How did he not show anything to Notorious and I agree with the most here saying he was "Hollywood", I mean, what you expected a story real life? When people will wake up and see that you will never find the real truth about 2pac and Biggie ... It's all covered up and buried deep down. <br /> Second, I do not mind either 2pac or Biggie I love them both hands 2pac and Lil Kim got embarrassed in this movie for sure ... <br /> And for all of that saying The movie is awesome and can not see the truth, either u are too blind to see it because u think u know something about BIG or you do not know anything about it at all and u like this Hollywood genre movie. Use yourself and see if the clouds ... There are a lot of it you can tell when it comes to the topic, I did not say 60% of what I said because it is a very wide issue, but for films In I can only say that it could be a little, I mean a better do. But anyways I'm just a few people giving her opinion .... No tough feelings ... <br /> Look, I love hip hop and I live for it, but after seeing this movie everybody which has little intelligence could see that this is not how one is supposed to live. With all respect for 2pac and BIG, like all other artists who are doing for a living like this should turn the other page because you're damaging the youth .... Bring the message wrong to the kids and that is : Will not be in school, but living on the streets, hustle and just grabbing the paper .... <br /> <br /> Hop in hip true is supposed to be about love and intelligence, be smart and all. OK <br /> I know that many of you will think I'm crazy, but this is just my point of view. Look at me maybe wrong about something and I'm not saying this is a completely bad movie because even if I'm hoping for hip for 17, 18 years I still do not know anything bout 2pac or Biggie does not matter how many articles I read or how much do I support and listen to the music ... Like most of us all out. Only those who really close at them and the killer know the truth behind all this. <br /> And for the end I just meant for all Biggie and Tupac fans and relatives, these two men were and will be greatest ever, no matter how they lived their lives, but PLEASE IN THE FUTURE is to get better, learn and love each other, thinking of other things for the ONES that you do not like, because at the end .. DO NOT ABOUT YOUR MONEY OR YOUR FAMILY YOU CAN GET AND FILE YOU THE BEST OF THE WORLD, YOU MAKE SELF TO FULLEST AND MAKE IN YOUR SOUL, CODE WITH YOU ... QUESTION IF YOU HAVE EAT TO DO, YOU WANT A LIFE LIFE AFTER MOSES ... FRIES AND LOVE ALL ALL !! !! RIP BIGGIE, 2PAC, AALIYAH, EYE GLIND, JAM MASTER JAY AND OTHER PEOPLE CHANGED IN THE WORLD !!!!
