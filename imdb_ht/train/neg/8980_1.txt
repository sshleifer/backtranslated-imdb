I will never forget the night I saw this film. We were on a submarine on the patrol in the North Atlantic and this film was scheduled in the evening. We were all given after the second coil. They did not even try to show it to the night show. Option for a rays instead ...... This is all I really have to say but this rule is stupid that my comment must have ten lines. I'm not supposed to pad the comment with random words so I'll just continue to ramble until I get my ten BS in my line. I could not find George Goble listed in the credits but I remember him in the movie. The sin was terrible and the songs even worse.
