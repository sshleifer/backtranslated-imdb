This movie is just a kid against evil genre. Thunderbirds are just the hook to find people to see it, but they are almost incidental in use. The fact that the action takes place on Tracy Island is just a pull-out scheme to the public. It was interesting to note what the movie makers see in future London will be and how the World All fits together. The best part of this movie are some of the lines delivered by Lady Penelope who are very funny. These provide some light relief for those waiting for a rays on the TV set. <br /> <br /> Having said that it's been over 90 or so minutes in a 'fun' manner and what can just be worth watching.
