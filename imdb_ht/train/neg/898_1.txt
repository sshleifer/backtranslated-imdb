Eddie Murphy's "Delirious" is completely and totally rude, tiny, crab and lud. This is indeed the only way to describe this appalling, trashy piece of stand-up. Eddie Murphy goes for shock values ​​rather than laughs to try and win the following. She manages to be funny occasionally, but mostly loses the plot with obscene language and unhealthy sex jokes. <br /> <br /> Forget it! Unless you come to enjoy Eddie's bad style. I do not think I'll bother with "Eddie Murphy Raw". I prefer Eddie to the limit of a movie script. <br /> <br /> Saturday, January 17, 1998 - Video
