There's a big difference between releasing an original, intense, corner-of-your-seat, scary, gore-fest, and performing such as cinema Eli Roth and his team made with "Fever Cabinets" and simply acting like it. The film follows five college graduates in a cabin in the woods that begin to prove fatal as one another succumbs to this mysterious, fast-acting, disease-eating food. It's not long before friends turn to one another, and they can barely stand in front of each other, much less willing to be in the same neighborhood. As gross as it all sounds, there is a certain spark behind the core base of this movie that might have worked, in the hands of a cocky cocky ministries. Unfortunately, we end up with a badly drawn character whose only purpose seems to be beautiful at the beginning of the inevitable decomposition of the more controversial, a hackneyed script so profanity-packed as to let the viewer accurately out the dialogue, and several incomprehensible subplots motivate little more than (in one example) an appearance on screen by director Roth. This is sloppy movie-making in many ways! Avoid this devouring time.
