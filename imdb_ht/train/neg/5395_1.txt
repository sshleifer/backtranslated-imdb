Kenneth Branagh is trying to turn William Shakespeare's comedy, rarely produced in a 1930-era-year era, and the result of being both bad Shakespeare and bad music comedy as actors are rarely adept at one or the other in two styles and in some cases Flounder seriously in both. Particularly painful is Nathan Lane, which seems to be under the impression that he is absolutely hysterical as Costard, but is seriously mistaken, and Alicia Silverstone who manages the Shakespearean language with all the authority of a young Valley Girl who reads the script aloud in read Middle School English classes. The musical numbers are with the expertise of a high school production of "Dame at Sea," leaving the left and amateur cast while singing and dancing, with the exception of Lone Adrian Lester who proved himself a splendid and dense singing. Only other favors of the movie are Natascha McElhone and Emily Mortimer's contribution as eye candy, but were given better performance than in this movie and you would have the wisdom to check out some of the other titles in the films and he gives this chaos mess a pass.
