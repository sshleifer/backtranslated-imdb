How did the hell do this? Presenting himself as a comedian comedian, the misbegotten "$" is essentially two hours of mumbling phrase fragments. Generally dependent Warren Beatty seems to drink, and usually hilarious Goldie Hawn acts as it is about antidepressants. As for Gert Frobe, his most popular role - Goldfinger - was infinitely more admirable than his character here. Not even the guy and champagne bottles of LSD can save this litany from worthlessness. Can I compare this movie to "Plan 9 Out of Space"? I would not do such a thing even if someone paid me. "P9FOS" was idiotically done but ended hilarious; This has been idiotically made and causes you to feel like your brain just melts out of your ear. Warren Beatty and Goldie Hawn did so when they co-starred in "Shampoo", but then they co-starred in the "Town & Country". Perhaps they just would not be co-stars in movies. All in all, I'd rather have my skin torn off than having to look this again. Mad. <br /> Maybe it should be noted with Jackie Chan. Then I would pay to see it.
