This movie deals with two former football players who are Fred Williamson (Mack Derringer) and Gary Busey (Lenny) who work as a private eye and meet all kinds of ladies and men and some bad origins. Mack Derringer approached by her ex-wife Vanity (Jennifer Derringer) who works in talking about sex on the phone. Jennifer is being threatened by one caller who wants to do his terrible things and asks for his help with several other ladies. Mack & Lenny have more time on their hands and often go to Miami, FL. Golf course or hang out at a Sports Bar where all sorts of things in the city go on. There are many punches, killings and many double meaning words that carry this movie completely down to a great zero. Do not waste your time, this movie cost me only 50 cents and it was too much.
