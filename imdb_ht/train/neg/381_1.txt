This film is the traditional bollywood costume as far as the star power, sentimentality and love of emotional triangles. What really harassed me about this movie was the notion of the musicians replacing the mothers. A prostitute who is pregnant with a child after having sex with the man (in the family who wants a child) is not a substitute mother. Nor it is a good candidate for a surrogate mother. I saw Indian cinema and television shows that made 10 to 15 years ago that faced this issue more intelligently. The whole concept of the film is ridiculous and absolutely implausible. I realize that most Bollywood movies are not meant to be possible, but they do not pretend to be either. This movie wants us to empathize with the characters, but this can not be done with such a ridiculous, conflicting conflict. I would expect better from Abbas and Mustan.
