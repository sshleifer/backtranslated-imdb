This is just the second time I stopped a video / DVD party way. I wanted to give this movie the benefit of the first doubt, though he managed to be both deep, scary and stupid. AK happy, plodding and firefighters. <br /> It was like a Special After School directed by the usual nine-kid class who thinks nobody understands him ... creepy and sad, and voice-over narratives that only the most adolescent teen would consider poetry. .. with some songs, and ... no, really, suffering the poor child ... Enough, already, especially when it morphed into a bronze, clumsy, and insulting orange ripoff mechanisms. And I mentioned the song? <br /> This is not the worst movie I've ever seen, but certainly the one I felt was less forced to sit down. I do not recommend it to anyone.
