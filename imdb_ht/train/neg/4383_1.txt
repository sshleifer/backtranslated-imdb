Worst Bob Hope comedy ever (and includes some heavy competition). Hope, on an island and sailor, dreaming of being in a bathtub and a girl geisha "steal her boat". Someone certainly directs this hack-hope on the cliff, as it features Phyllis Diller and Gina Lollobrigida and still can not work up any laugh or excitement. Where is Bing Crosby when you really need it?
