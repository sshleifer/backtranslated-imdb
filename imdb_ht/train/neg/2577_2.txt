This story has a different angle that has intrigued me, enough to buy an already-sighted VHS-sight. That was a mistake. In what could be a very nice story - about seriously disabled people in a hospital, with their various personality - they quickly turned into a very profitable soap opera and unlikeable characters. /> <br /> We have "Bloss" (William Forsythe) stereotypes of white racist people, who say f-words every other sentence and so empicable they did not give him a first name in the movie. It's a lot of fun to be around. Then there is "Raymond Hill" (Wesley Snipes), a womanizer speaking. Snipes must have liked those quick-talking "hip" rolling roles because he plays in a number of them, as in "White Men Can not Go." Then there is plenty of fun Helen Hunt playing "Anna" that is wonderful caretaker, loves those who have an adult affair with the main character in the film, "Joel Garcia" (Eric Stoltz). is heart, feelings feel-good. It just makes my heart melt look so nice. But if you are one of those who love character slots featuring the slogan of this movie slut ..... you might really like this!
