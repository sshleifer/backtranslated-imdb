Well, what can I say about this movie. I'm words. I could go on about how stupid this film is forever though the one thing that's really the most * sed me was the music. And in itself it all cut someone commenting on how much they loved it. For all I have said is that it has been torn off from one of the best martial arts films in Fistsof time fury that begins Bruce Lee. IF she was still alive and ever came across this movie she should be frightened. The rest of the movie is absolutely ridiculous with a tape of tape. I say cassette because a movie like this could not possibly be shot on film.I now feel more stupid to waste 30 minutes in my life watching it. The only reason why I even saw it was because my roommate downloaded it from morbid curiosity. What this world comes in.
