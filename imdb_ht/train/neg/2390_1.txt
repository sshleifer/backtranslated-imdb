I absolutely love all Tom Robbins books, so I was very excited and interested to see a movie that was born after one of his books. I knew that there would be no way that the movie would take even half of Robbins's magic, but after seeing the movie, he made me never want to read the book again. The Same Cowgirls Movie Finding Blues does not include an eighth of the content of the book, and it seems to focus more on the love connection between Bonanza Jellybean and Sissy than anything else. Along with incredibly weak draw lines in the movie, I think that best actor could definitely have been chosen to play the characters. The only actors in the movie that I thought played their role in Robbins' description of the book were Julian's friends, in the five minute clip at the start of the movie. Those who do not read the book might enjoy the movie, but as a great Tom Robbins fan, this movie was nothing but a deception.
