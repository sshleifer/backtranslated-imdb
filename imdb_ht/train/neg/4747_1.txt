I thought this film was awful. I'm Chinese, so I thought everything was totally wrong. Many of the facts were incorrect. The only right thing about Chinese history in the movie was when Mom Wendy explained her husband about the statues that guarded ShiHuangDi. I also thought the scene of the fighting was very cheesy and fake. Many of the actors and actresses did not have much. Some of the jokes that were supposedly "funny" were really stupid. I think this movie should receive the worst possible rating it can get. Disney has really gained more information about Chinese history if they want to create a morning movie. Mulan was quite accurate. Watch this movie if you want to waste some time.
