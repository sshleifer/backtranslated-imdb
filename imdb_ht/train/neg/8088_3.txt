To make a good movie you either need excellent actors or an excellent director. You need at least one of the two. At the sight of the needle we have no. <br /> I do not even remember the name of the director. He does not have to do much in his career. My dear Donald Sutherland but he absolutely can not be the main actor in a movie. It falls short. Sutherland is excellent in a movie when it looks for no more than 15 minutes. I would say for example Sutherland was excellent at JFK at Oliver Stone when he talked with Kevin Costner about the bench in a 10-minute park that did not stop without even taking a breath. Wonderful thing. But Sutherland being the principal actor in a movie is not good. Kate Nelligan? It is probably good for TV series. The DVD is awful. Terrible color. Terrible light. I did not even appreciate the scenery of Storm Island for how bad the photography was. <br /> <br /> Ken Follett's story was good but it's a pity being turned into a refreshing movie.
