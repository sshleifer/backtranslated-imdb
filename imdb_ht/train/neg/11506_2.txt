This film's story is bad enough, this can happen in real life. I can not really understand when we show that this movie is bad. I say it was bad because there are some reasons. 1. If Madonna was rich and can do everything she wants, then why she fell in love with the bad man. 2. How does the script script be weak? She was so rich, she can do everything she wants, but it does not dare her husband divorce which is very impossible. <br /> <br /> The words I love you, it does not mean anything in this movie.
