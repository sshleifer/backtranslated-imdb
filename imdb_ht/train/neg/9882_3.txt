There are exactly 2 good things to be said about "Fantasies" (both mentioned by a previous review as well): <br />) Kiss Derek's extraordinary, poetry-inspired beauty. She had vaccines in this movie where she gave the same Catherine Zeta-Jones a run for her money, and that's a great compliment. Nidite it is short and secret, but just look at her face enough. <br /> b) setting Greek islands, and its sun and crystal-clear blue waters. There is no history, the dialogue is abysmal and at times unintentionally funny ("It touches you where you are a woman!"), and Peter Hooten's character is a thin jerk. Bo overplays the naivete of her character, but then again when you have to work with this malicious dialogue to dishonestly blame the actors (the fact that she keeps saying the name "Damir" in almost every sentence is an irritation bigger). Oh, and although the film is placed on a Greek island, there is hardly a Greek word to be heard - apparently everyone has, from the old children, speaking English the whole time. (*)
