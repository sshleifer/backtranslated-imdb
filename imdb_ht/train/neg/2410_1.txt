The dead living dead and all the movies other guys looked like they were together with this films and their friends with zero talent an afternoon when they were bored (lines are completely unrehearsed and compelling). I find that 95% of amateur movies and 90% of foot video footage are better than this movie (although the similarities between the terms of the comparison). "Hey let's see if someone is mute enough to buy our movies!". Hope nobody was ELSE. My apology for people involved in the cops as this review is somewhat harsh but I was the drug that he reviewed your fake and bought the movie.
