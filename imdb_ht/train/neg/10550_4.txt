After being a big fan of the ten minutes TV episodes of 'Stella Street', I am letting this film and excitement and anticipation. Unfortunately I left feeling so happy. <br /> I was frightened by the way that almost all the gags and a covering material were directly raised from the TV episodes, and delivered with much less enthusiasm and comic distributions, as if the actors were told once, and can not be bothered to say again. I bought my copy on DVD and I was feeling cheated that I was separating my cash I had to watch for the jokes themselves over again. <br /> <br /> * COVER * The plot of the movie begins with Stella Street (a typical English street in Surrey), gradually being populated by 'some of the most popular people in stage and screen in the past ten years , including Michael Caine, Al Pacino, Jack Nicholson and the Rolling Stones. All the celebrities on the street end up being knowledgeable from all the fortunes are not a local fraudster, and they are forced to live like tramp and common classmates. There are some nice moments, but on the whole, the writers manage to take an interesting idea and make it pretty boring. * At the end of the episodes, all characters are made by John Sessions and Phil Cornwell (including brunette), but in the movie Ronni Ancona is added to the cast. I think this was a mistake. His imagination was not funny, and he felt like his characters were included in the story just to give something he did. <br /> <br /> If you were not a fan of the episodes of Stella Street, you can get this fun movie. But if you were a fan, I think you can go out feeling a bit cheated. 4/10
