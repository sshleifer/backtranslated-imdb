Mary Pickford becomes chief of a Scottish family after her father's death, and then there is a romance. As fellow snow Leopard commented, the film is rather episodic to begin. Some of it is fun, such as Pickford whipping her Clansmen to the church, while some of it is just there. All in all, the story is weak, especially recyclable, convincing the romance of the draw-line and its climax. The transfer is so dark it is difficult to appreciate the landscape, but even accounting for this, does not appear to be Maurice Tourneur's best work. Pickford and Tourer cooperate once more into a bit more accessible to Little Rich's poor, Pickcast Pickcast as a child character.
