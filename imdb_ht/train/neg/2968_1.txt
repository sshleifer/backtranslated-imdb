Ignoring (if possible) smoking the tediously gratuitous marijuana (which seems to be mandatory in the Australian-funded movie) to cast this movie to a reasonably priceless performance. That's a far as it goes. The rest is simply awful. The plot is packed with "wow" symbol which means they look good on movie but go somewhere. A gross example is the float of giant peach, obviously leaving from a city parade and donors by the local canning factory. It was just too tempting to waste what was hoping for a free, but nevertheless irrelevant, prop! The fishing is given a race, unreasonably wash-down in one step, but that's where it ends. Likewise, appearing the "sign of signs" road where Steph's parents died, is intended to eventually symbolize escape from his past, but escape from it? She had a very good deal where she was, especially considering her visual impairment with the independent patient, the love and care of her understanding of female gangsters. Guinness's Price for Melodrama Corny, however, goes to Alan's characterization. Alan successfully expects the noble role of union trade unions but "rat" on his fellow workers does not become a supervisor for a multi-national cruel - he! ous! As a supervisor, Alan does the gay work of dirty work. It applies redundancy until, surprise, surprise, the whole plant is closed and Alan himself leaves as a damaging, unemployed failure. There is no free cliche area, here, mate! Not only that, but Alan also lost Steph's seduction in the easiest relationship you would encounter. If you think the draw is melodramatic and pedagogical, do not ask about details. What's the significance of the cream cut on Steph's seductive legs? Why is not the hotel, where the couple makes love, eventually observing that someone takes entrance into one of his grandest rooms, and, among other pandemoniums, the leaves are regularly dirty - quite spectacularly on an occasion. Add this movie up to one word: Avoid, Avoid, Avoid.
