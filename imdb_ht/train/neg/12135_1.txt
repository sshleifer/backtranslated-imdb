Although it was 2 years, I still remember the complete garbage that understands the entire plot of the movie. Unfortunately, I came across this movie after my friends and I chose it while browsing through the new releases of Blockbuster. We decided to choose the movie because it was the only one we had not seen and sounded as it might be enjoyable. Although it was quite some time since I saw the movie, I still remember the lack of draw (badly, there is no real plot), and garbage fill in the time spent spending watching the movie. If you are in the video store and this film catches your eyes, walk on and find a better movie. If you've finished seeing this movie, I understand your pain :)
