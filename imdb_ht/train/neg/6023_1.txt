This reminds me of when I was a born-again believer who was going to be a minister. I never actually thought I would be a minister or even graduate in high school because I was almost positive I would have to look into the sky before that would ever happen. That was before I discovered that Christianity was a batch of waste. I am now an atheist, and that just proves that "once saved ever saved" the doctor that Christians say we are not really real than elves. If it were true, why did I leave after years of being a believer yet believing? Yes, I really was saved. I have prayed that prayer prays with all my heart. If Christians read the Bible they would discover that their gods think like rape, genocide, abortion, and many other atrocities. They may be surprised to learn that no matter where the word "rapture" is mentioned.
