OK, first of all, Steve Irwin, rest in peace. You loved by many fans. Now ... this movie was not a movie at all. It was "Crocodile TV" program with bad actions, bad scripts, and bad guides in between capturing Steve or teaching us about animals. He was fun as an animal / specialist, and millions will miss him, The whole movie idea was a big mistake, the plot was so broken, it was almost non-existent. The casting was terrible. The act was not even the elementary school-level elementary. Can find a half-decent way to perform performance from your actor, no matter how bad the script is, you should not be good in the first place.I could write a better script I wish I had never seen this movie Of course, I watched him for $ 3 ($ 1.50 for me, $ 1.50 for my son.) While out with friends who insisted on seeing this instead of Scooby Doo Live Action. Me, who is not so discriminating, liked the film well, but she never asked to see her again. If you want to memorize fans of Steve Irwin, buy his series on DV D. Avoid this movie as the epidemic. If I was Steve, I know I do not want to be remembered for this movie. Hope it: avoid this movie!
