Originally revealed as an ABC film in the week. This involves two innocent young university girls who are dragged into a prison camp in a small South city. Telephone calls are not allowed and nobody knows they're there. What follows is rape, torture, beat, humiliation and degradation that leads to a very disturbing conclusion. The TV version was (for its time) gloomy. No stripping and beatings were very tame but the overall feeling of sleaziness was one down. The unified version is even worse - there is abundant nudity, the violence is extreme, and, in one particularly disgusting sequence, we see a woman prisoner crying forced to strip while a lesbian guard uses her. YUCK! There is nothing wrong with film exploitation but this one just goes on the brink. You get to know that the movies enjoy having these poor women being tortured and degraded - all this is pushing into your face as you're supposed to enjoy it. Finally downbeat finish does not help. <br /> I give it a 3 because the good act - but that actually makes the film harder to look. A sick, movie film. Not recommended.
