It makes sense for me that this film is getting wavers from Hollywood because often in Hollywood it's all just a competition of popularity. It also makes sense when you think that people who liking the movie may just be reacting to the counting songs being spit out of you rather than story content. But this movie is covered and blocked. Eddie Murphy looks just ridiculous. There is no way to make Jeniffer Hudson and Beyonce Knowles to Oscar rated the many performances raved on before the movie was even out. I can not even believe that the Condon was set to be nominated for a direct Oscar when all of this was put together by an album. Glitz does not replace a nothing scenario. A lot of songs do not make a movie.
