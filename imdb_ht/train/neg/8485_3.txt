From the terrible death scenes of fire that fire without sounding in a character called the Fiend. It's all tedious, slow moving, unimaginative drivel. It was OK to see the guy with the Cape and the crook hiding around. Visually it was creepy and probably busy movies in the allotted time, but even in 1936 one would think there would be a little more imagination and verisimilitude even a movie like this. I just kept waiting for something to happen to any importance as people stood around making speeches and acting as they were posing at an office picnic. Then there are those bullets as a previous commentator. Perhaps the best ideas were to search for a spot on a pocket pocket.
