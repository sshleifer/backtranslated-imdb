Another violent, angry fantasy of Paul Verhoeven. Verhoeven is a puzzle: it's hard to say if it seriously affects its serious impulse, with sardonic intent or operating in full compliance. It also seems completely ignorant of the fact that all the brilliant visuals of the world (and this are some exceptional people) can not hide a negligence of history, dialogue and performance. Kevin Bacon plays a corrupt scientist who discovered invisibility and used it to drive himself to morality. Bacon is usually a likable actor who occasionally shows his dark side (the `Wild 'River) in an attempt to compensate his youthful looks; Given the material, however, Bacon is not almost enough enough to force. The other directors are Elizabeth Shue and Josh Brolin, and those who have enough money to make a solid impression and that, when forced to deliver unreliable dialogue, embarrass themselves. The highest point is a study of preponderance and disbelief to be truly suspended.
