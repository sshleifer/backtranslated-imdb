In what could be an otherwise run at the factory, mediocre films about infidelity in the sixties (the subtle "free-love" period), the creators of this movie pile on ridiculous scenarios after ridiculous scenarios and head all off with a little cherry on top, happily ever after finishing. No time I ever felt sympathy for Diane Lane or Anna Paquin in the trivial center of the free classroom, or I felt like Shrieber's linked. The storytelling story line slowly concludes her predictable, and consciousness only interesting things and watch on this movie is the stunning Diane Lane topless. Here's a hint, it's about 30 minutes in the movie. Fast forward to this party and jump over the rest.
