I'm sorry, I know Fa√übinder always calls one of the greatest directors in post-war Germany and most of his films are considered "master-pieces", but when I see "Lili Marleen" today, in 2004 , I wonder what everyone is up and far on this movie! The act is simply awful - Hanna Schygulla is all smiling at such a fool! - The change between Nazi glamor and the ridiculous battles, the whole movie looks as if it was done within two days in an attic. Probably it was exactly this way and many people seem to take this for "real art," but for me this film is simply bad & cheap. Compare this Viscontis "La Caduta degli dei" and tell me that "Lili Marleen" is a good movie.
