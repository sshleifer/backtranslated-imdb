For my life I can not understand the good reviews about this piece of crap. It was pointless. Matthew Modine was horribly miscast as a leading man. Gina Gershon, well, others have said it, but I'll repeat, why is the stupid accent? Totally unnecessary. And acting it was just bad. I do not know if it was thrown by the accent, or what. There was no chemistry between these two. <br /> <br /> And the girl modine was in love with, suddenly she's burning half a lithol head in her mouth and acting in a jumping way? Where did this come from? I think we were supposed to feel sorry for her as we saw her marriage in a workaholic beginning to confuse, but honestly, I could not care less about any of these people.
