Humphrey Bogart clearly did not want to be in this movie, and must be forced to play a Mexican party or he would stop. Believe me, he made the wrong choice! Obviously, after the success of Dodge City, Warners has tried a follow-up with Errol Flynn and his usual list of buddies, such as Alan Hale, Big Boy Williams, Frank Mc Hugh and the ever-present John Litel , but they made great mistakes in trying to present Miriam Hopkins as a love interest for Flynn v. Randolph Scott, and as a singer really do bad things, because he proved one thing, and that he can not sing. The story was not too bad, but with Bogie clearly muscle also, it turned out to be a poor West who was overlong, and on a low budget, but in justice, color would not have helped.
