This movie was absolutely ... ugh I can not find the word oh wait ... crap! I mean when it started I was like that yeah looks good and then after it was so boring. I almost fell asleep and she had nothing to do with the fact that I kept a show late because it was utterly wrong. Ram Gopal Varma tried his best, but the cast could never live up to the original sholay I mean what he thought to make a rumor. What did he try to do? Do Sanjay Leeli Bhansani and win all the awards next year as she did for Black? Ajay and other guys were especially good to the other guy who played rage because from all of them he was one of the look. What was Amitabh doing? He has destroyed his own dignity by making all the films. First Nishabd then Cheeni Kum then Jhoom Barabar Jhoom and now that I mean hes has picked up a bit of his money and moves as far as possible Bollywood before he lost all his respect, I tell you he's been past halfway his way. I mean all this is really good for the other actors like Shah Rukh Khan who are getting a really good name right now because they are the last to fall in Amitabh. I never really love her because she thinks she is God and I just knew Abhishek was going to do that movie. <br /> If you want to save your Â£ 17.75 and spend it on a good go goes look Heyy Babyy because it's just the funniest movie ever and it's number one of the charts!
