I ordered the movie in Korea because I was an extra of it and was interested to see how it turned out. <br /> <br /> Having looked at it I can say I'm ashamed to have any part of it. I feel embarrassed not only for myself but for all others who had no part in doing this lipocrity in the British "comedy". <br /> At the start of the film's end is predictable, tedious, dull, monotonous and rewarding-worthy of the point that on several occasions I actually look away from the screen of ten-beliefs. Until you actually see the film it's hard to conceive how un-romantic and un-comedic a romantic comedy case. <br /> It's not just a bad story, but a movie is badly done. In one scene, you can actually see a runner or assistant director showing S.A. by wiping through. I'll post details about this in the 'Goofs' section. <br /> <br /> On the side, it filled me with emotions (deception, rage, embarrassment ??)
