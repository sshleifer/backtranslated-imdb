Christopher Durang must be taught by an amazing memorable wonder, because he just can not let go of the concept. The game, "Sister Mary Ignatius explains it all for you," was presented - at least in Hollywood - at precisely the same tone as Diane Keaton's conference scene here. Sister Mary was an exaggeration, a lamp, a bitter satire in a serenely confident, doctrinal and very judgmental now - and as played by Lynn Redgrave, she was hilarious. But the film insists that we take this exaggeration absolutely seriously - while, as mentioned, holds the same tone of "explaining it all" to the scenes. Two approaches to top and twenty minutes ago, the movie went on the track, diving into the passage, and explosions. There is no survivor. He might have worked, if the tone of the scenes and four ex-students, and meet with Sister Mary, were cooked just like Sister Mari Scene. Or if Sister Mary scenes were presented more realistically. This way simply does not work at all.
