Twin brothers separated from birth (Due to the deaths of their parents) encounter twenty-five years later to avenge their parents and take back the million dollar tunnels. Double Impact runs in two hours long and basically adds no real approach to the Corsican gear scheme and Jean-Claude Van Damme while adequately as the twin brother of the evil is just embarrassing as good twin brother. Also the action sections are not as exciting this time and Jean-Claude relies more on the bullet then on his martial arts. Also the support throw is wasted and within two hours the film is just plain dull. <br /> <br /> * from 4 (bad)
