I only watched DVD 1. The proper program can have 10 minutes of good information; otherwise it's snotty disturbing of religious peoples. It's as if Brian Flemming's director recently discovered both atheism and sarcasm, and feels that these tools can easily bludgeon his opposition. <br /> <br /> Also, Flemming stays so much of her personal problems, and takes on film. He never came back to the topic. <br /> <br /> Religious people are prone to skeptic discipline when the objections of religion are obviously rooted in abusive breakout. Arguments from these victims are seemingly irrational, and therefore unconvincing. <br /> <br /> Anti-religious people will want more data. We do not need to say that religious people are nutty, any more than Jewish Americans should be told how harassing Christmas music gets in the middle of December. <br /> <br /> In the best scene, the Superintendent of Fleming's Christian school children rather insightfully meets the director on his motivation. It looks like the most honest part of the film, and it was too short. <br /> <br /> If Fleming was a bit more self-aware, it might have a good history of her on her own (past & current) relationships with Christianity, and abusive institutions that endorse her in her teens, . <br /> <br /> And maybe he could have borrowed "Christ never walked the material" material in a more serious documentary. I do not study the scriptures in Saul / Paul to find out how this time is saved, but a quick look at Wikipedia suggests most of these discussions are criticized. <br /> <br /> The bonus interviews are very good, these do not strengthen the Fleming thesis much. Sam Harris is a good spokesman for the anti-religious POV, and it does not go light on other non-Christian religions. Harris also has some good (and easy Google'd) interviews on Salon.com, Amazon.com, and Samharris.org.
