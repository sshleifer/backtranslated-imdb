This is absolute waste based on Friday's Friday 13th series that is practically a carbon copy, accepting it being an Australian film and those who can not act. <br /> Once upon a time a young boy was burning accidentally during the filming of a music video at Lake Eildon. Now, a number of years later, the boy is all grown and revenge on anybody who comes to the movie movie a music video. It is cliche-dog food and a waste of time and money, seeing it only from curiosity, or whether you are an aspiring actor trying to learn how the PA (can not) act. Take the role of Alan Dale using the TV star in the neighboring soap operas, but ended up in the X Records - how did this happen?
