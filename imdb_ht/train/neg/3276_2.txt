The 1980 TV show, updated with fresh girl meat, and raunchy language. "The Dukes of Hazzard" passed me by; he was not repeated every time I was in front of the television in either New York or California; Or, I probably would look. Still, from somewhere (such as the accompanying clip clips updated 2005 release), I knew it was about a fast, timer Dodge Charger - and, the "Lee Lee" always good to go. Cunning Hunky Seann William Scott and Johnny Knoxville (as Bo and Luke Duke) are the new riders of the Orange Sage. Beautiful Jessica Simpson (as Daisy) fills her skimpy shortly well - but even excited pink bikini she can not beat in the competition from a full dorm of bouncing, topless couples. The plot is too stupid to involve a Burt Reynolds fertilizer (as "Boss" Hogg) threatens to turn Hazzard County into a bit of strip. <br /> <br /> ** The Chiefs of Hazzard (7/2/05/05) Jay Chandrasekhar ~ Seann William Scott, Johnny Knoxville, Jessica Simpson, Burt Reynolds
