A recent post here is not a woman claiming a military background, which has the comment "a woman's life is no more valuable than a man". This mantra in politically correct is not true as history as well as biology shows. Society has managed to recover from heavy loss of male populations, sometimes with amazing speeds. Germany was ready to fight another war in 1939 despite 1914- 1918 wars more than two million men died. In the South South America (1865), Paraguay was taken in three countries to the extent that virtually all men's population had wiped out but fought for a blockade in 1932 Chaco War against Bolivia. No society, however there or never can survive the loss of its female population. Only when the very life of the country is at the poles is women sent to fight. Israel faced this situation in 1948, but since then never considered combat units for its defense forces despite the popular image of the Israeli girl soldier. "G.I.Ja" is Hollywood duve.
