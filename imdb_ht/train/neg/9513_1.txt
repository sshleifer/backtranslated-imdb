I tried to watch this movie three times separately. That night I rented it. Got about 20 minutes to expect it would be best if I had one night rest. See 15 more days next, almost vomiting of how stupid it was ... It's not even funny stupid that is sometimes a fun movie to look but this movie was just crap with a capital S (if you know what I want say in the censored world we live in). And finally on the third day I looked around an hour in the mute stuff and I did not enjoy one moment! Not even one. How does this script get greenlighted. Oh boy! <br /> <br /> 1/10 - the one is for cheerleaders ... they deserve at least one thing for their hard work.
