"Fever fever" is not a bad movie; it is a terrible movie. <br /> Is it possible to watch American films and criticisms, so anumbed and lobotomized by the extension that Hollywood churns out that they will praise the sky even a mediocre film and barely any laugh? That's the only reason I can think about why this comedy is awesome romantic (and I use this term theme because there's nothing funny in this movie) getting good reviews. <br /> I'm sitting in this stained film that the Lowell All Screen and Babeloo Mandel would even for an instant to think the script was funny. <br /> <br /> The brilliant Nick Hornby usually translates well into films. He adapted "Catch Fever" to a British film starring Colin Firth and Ruth Gemmell in 1997; Peter Hedges found Hornby's voice for "About a Boy" (2002) and when "High Fidelity" was American for a movie in 2000, D.V. writer. DeVincentis, Steve Pink, John Cusack and Scott Rosenberg did not go wrong because they kept the sense of the hornby understood and humorous. They made one of the best films this year. So why did the American version of "Smoking Fumes" go so tired to indulge? The British version was not a masterpiece, but it was good, funny, unexpected and gave us two characters we could love, respect and understanding. <br /> But all with Mandel has excited all the funny stuff at Hornby's work. In the Americas, he was killed, removing all that was good and unique on Hornby's work and replacing it with conventional conventional. They have transformed a comic story into a romantic romantic comedy, never once veering out of the terrible formula. Lindsey (Drew Barrymore) has three girlfriends, each of them having a different function. One is overweight, the second cynical and ambitious, and the third is a romantic. Want to guess how many boyfriend Ben (Jimmy Fallon) friends are there? <br /> <br /> What made these "high fidelity" fun were not just a good man with ladies, but engaging characters to support. In this "Fever film," six friends support or say nothing specifically funny. They are so insignificant, they are not even decorative. The only reason they're in the movie is because the formula requires it. Poignant Ione Skye winds up like one Lindsey in the pale of an unbearable role. Perhaps Skye wanted Lloyd Dobler to dive into and take him away. Come to think of it, Cusack would have made an excellent Ben. Of course, Cusack is too smart to attach itself to such a completely tedious script. <br /> <br /> There is not one, solitary moment in this movie that looks original or unforced. Each draw trail is predictable, each blame to blame telechifiers. Everything with Mandel works for laughing. The first 45 minutes are so slowly interrupted, asking if these are realizing that they have written a comedy. You can mark the trace of this movie by watching you. It's almost as if all with Mandel has punched this with some scroll formulas written by the guru stuck on the wall. When they got to a certain page, they looked up at the formula and said, "OK, the Guru said this happened right now." And, presto! <br /> <br /> Director Bobby and Peter Farrelly do not help film at any. They have no concept of presenting their stories and characters (but they are not the protagonist on the narration V.OO, but in another guy sitting behind Ben in Fenway Park). Thanks to some very clunky writings, we have to watch Barrymore and Fallon sting at his initial meeting. <br /> <br /> Barrymore makes beautiful and adorable better than most. It's as good at her as Goldie Hawn in her great day of glory. But even woven her can not save this extraordinary horrible movie. It tries hard to break some energy and humor from this story. About 30 minutes in the movie, Lindsey said Ben, "You're funny." The only explanation for her is that she was in the script. For Ben Fallon never said anything even remotely funny. Fallon is neither witty nor comical; when it does comedy, it overacts. <br /> <br /> Fallon has never been any good on "Saturday Night Live." It was quite possibly the least funny person on that show. Remember that the trams on a radio DJ made all the voices? The only reason "Weekend Update" worked occasionally was because Fallon's Kona, Tina Fey, knew something or two about comedy. <br /> <br /> Actors who think they're funny and behave that way this rarely, if ever actually funny. That's true at Fallon. He thinks it's funny to be funny when it's barely raising a chuckle. His stuttering, no-in-itself shtick did not work on the small screen; it's louder on the big screen. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately for Fallon, her role in this picture requires some dramatic moments. If you thought his comedy was bad, wait until you get a load of his dramatic stuff. Two particular scenes - the first in a park, the second in front of the Ben - they hurt to look. The scenes require an actor and a smidgen of dramatic abilities, but Fallon is neither the knowledge nor the ability to make them work. Fix it into emotions by even running the gamut from A to B. <br /> <br /> Ben has no personality or depth. Often, it comes across as an oasis. And it's not a nice one. She boggles the idea that Lindsey would get attracted to her. Compare Fallon's performance in the Firth in the British version, and you'll understand how terribly flat, unfunny and forcing the Ben Fallon is and how wrong he is for this role. Watching Fallon's "Correct Fixing" has one time for the dramatic and comedy nuance of Ashton Kutcher! Similar to "High Fidelity", an American "Fitch Fever" could have been working brilliantly. It just needs better writers, more competent directors, and, most definitely, a stronger, funnier, smarter leader. Make yourself a great favor: Avoid this rotten movie; rented the 1997 British version and read the Hornby Book, instead.
