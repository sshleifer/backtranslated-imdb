Judging by some of the comments of IMDB, I was expecting a movie action - perhaps one dramatic or one stupid or single simple or funny one, but essentially an action movie. Whatever it is that I look, it certainly did not feel like a movie. The story is simple and straightforward (though the prologue is trying to make it seem complicated). Take three group interests: 1) the government 2) the rebels 3) a group of assassins. Now subtract the first (they never appeared in the movie). Then simply leave one of the killers, the princess, become a rogue on a vengeance journey. Add to a rebel love-interest and a guilty conscience. And you had the ingredients. <br /> But they did not manage to turn it into a story or movie. Between some random actions and some odd visuals trying sci-fi on a low budget, what you are leaving with is a feeling of emptiness. The movie just does not feel like a movie, but a strange, incoherent, boring dream. <br /> <br /> Avoid.
