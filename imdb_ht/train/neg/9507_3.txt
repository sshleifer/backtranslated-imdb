I always get frustrated by films that were obviously written by one sex. Especially when they obviously do not do enough research to find out when something is not just not true rings but fake typing rings. <br /> <br /> The scene I remember is one of the bathrooms where Jack tells her soccer ball that she got pregnant Diane. In no way, shape, or form would be a guy ever rush another guy will receive a pregnant girl in high school. They could cheer on the sex guy and the cheerleader warm, but I can also guarantee that the first football team heard about it would not be in a urine. <br /> It was obvious that this movie didn't take itself so badly, and it did not hide wrong, but come on!
