For the month I heard about this little movie and now I've seen it. I find it nice, beautiful how many young directors make movies where they combine creative ideas in order to make their own one-joke quotes in a movie. Troupe, Swingblade, any of the millionaire wig spoilers Witch comes to mind. If all such directors want to be a foot inside Hollywood's door, they're doing the right thing and should keep it because combined planet plan is how Hollywood does the movie. How often did you hear the phrase, "Animal House is satisfied in the future"; "It's Wall Street to Meet The Poet Death Society"; or "Shakespeare in love meets Star Wars"? I remember when independent films are original and daring films are not safe and predictable.
