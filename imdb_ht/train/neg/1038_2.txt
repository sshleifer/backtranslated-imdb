Increasing Vargas victory is just a bad movie. No amount of refusal or ad dollars supports advertising and changes to this sad reality. Perhaps Peter Sollett saw he did not have the money to make the movie he wanted to do and decided to take the easy road from making a movie that cynically copes with the principles of the current "movie-making movie". Perhaps it just does not know any better. It's hard to say. <br /> What is not hard to say is the result. Except for a few viewers who will intellectually bad movie-making in an attempt to pseudo-realism, some will enjoy it. <br /> I know I did not. <br /> Give us a favor and pass on this movie.
