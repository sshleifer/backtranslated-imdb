Just do not bother. I thought I would see a movie with great suppense and action. But it is growing boring and terribly predictable after the start of the exciting. In the middle of the movie you have a little social drama and all the tense loss because it slows down the speed. By the end it gets better but it's not really great. I think the director took this movie just too seriously. In such a kind of movie even if you do not care about the draw at least you want some nice action. I almost destroyed in the middle part / main of it. Rating 3/10. <br /> <br /> Derboiler.
