I'm Irish and I've been living in Denmark for a while so I was looking forward to going home last week so I could see intermediate. And I'll go to record as saying: <br /> <br /> This movie is true. <br /> It is not quite such a thing as "The most lush man in Ireland" but it definitely does not stop with other Irish films like their engagements, I've gone down or Michael Collins. Some aspects of the movie are actually quite funny, such as Colma Meaneys American style garda. But the movie itself is completely wrong shot. The rush of the camera with the constant zoom, zoom-out trying to give the film a noble look as if it was a frustrating drama. But it's not. This is an Irish Lock, Stock and Smoking Barrel and it should be shot like this. It should have smooth motion from one shot to the next. The movie just looks sloppy and dropping together. Their performance is okay, given the terrible script. A friend told me how it was like they just followed Colin Farrell around Dublin for a week. It provides a decent display as a Dublin Dirtbag, but it has no way to compare its performance in Minority, Tigerland or Booth Phones. The best performance came from Dierdre O'Kane who plays a sexually frustrated womanhood center that has just been thrown by her husband's bank manager for a younger woman. I think he should leave his God-awful stand-up and focus more on his acting. <br /> <br /> All in all, it does in no way live up to expectations placed on it by the Irish press or deserve to be even considered as one of the best Irish films ever. <br /> I expect a backlash from these comments because most people I said they said it was great. But before answering, ask yourself: Would you think that much of this movie if it was put in England or America?
