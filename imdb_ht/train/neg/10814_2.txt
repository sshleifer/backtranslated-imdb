As a "Jane Eyre" fan I was excited when this movie came out. "At last," I thought, "someone will make this book in a movie after the story is actually written by the author." Move !!! If the casting director had intended to throw a "Jane" that had been plummeting it certainly succeeded. However, surely he could find one that might also act. Where was the tension between Jane and Rochester? Where were spooky suspicions in the novel when the laughing float into the night out of nowhere? Where was the brightness of the child who flirted and danced like her mother? Finally, why was the scheme changed in the end? One wonder whether the screen was actually reading the book. What a disappointment
