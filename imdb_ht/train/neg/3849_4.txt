Debbie Reynolds toes-taps, tangos and, yes, tap-dancing its way to this ordinary comedy that has a brightly fabricated '30s atmosphere. Two ladies, brought together when their son commits a murder, tries to start their lives on not running a pipe-dance school for tots in Hollywood. Problem is, one of them is plagued by neuroses. Can you imagine this stuff 10 years earlier with Robert Aldrich directing Bette Davis and Joan Crawford ...? Nahh, Bette would never allow Joan many screen-time to cross his stuff, and I can not imagine Bette Davis in another role, tap-dance his heart. This is a gruesome file, written by a Henry Farrell slumming (whose idea of ​​a good "shock" is at the mass-murder stage in a rabbit group!). Not an ounce of honesty in the whole teak package. * 1/2 from ****
