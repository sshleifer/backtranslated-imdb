Wow ... what would you do with $ 33m? Let me give you a choice; you can either a) tear it and pull it down the toilet or b) make a movie based on the quotation of Whoopi Goldberg as a tough joint futurist cop cooperate with a rubber dinosaur that uses term like "I did not blow the trumpet" and raspberries on the basis that this is funny. That's right, you'd choose the options that have more merit - flushing down the toilet. This <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This must have been seen to be believed. I can not even find the words to describe how bad this film is. It does not even fit into "so bad - it's good" category. I actually have it on the TV as I write - and also watched I felt the need to come up with IMDb and register my disgust. <br /> <br /> When you consider Jurassic Park did a couple of years before, how did the world think that hearers would any tolerate a man dressed in a rubber suit? The WG should simply have to blame and damn the consequences. Everyone concerned will go to hell for this criminal waste of money. <br /> I have to stop writing - I am about to impload.
