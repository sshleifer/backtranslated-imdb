Oh this was a really bad movie. The girl who plays Jennifer is OK, but I think she acts bitchy in the movie, not because she has her orgies ripped from a raven at night, but because she thinks to shoot her agent for putting her in this piece of crap. Faye Dunaway acts like she is remaking Mommy Dearest and the finish is completely unusual. I really can not recommend this movie all but as a fan of Edgar Allen Poe, I was intrigued by the references of his work (Ravens, House of Usher-like family curses, and buried alive) - still he would probably turn over to his cell if he knew about this movie.
