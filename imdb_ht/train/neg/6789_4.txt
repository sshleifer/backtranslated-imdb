The plot of this movie hangs on an important point: that this murderer was also a responsible, loving, caring father. Not being a father and a murderer is impossible. But this man will show to kill a young girl without provocation or reason and without emotion. This girl was the daughter of a man. I do not think a father who cared so much about his own daughter could have been cold-blooded to other's daughters. Or, alternately, could be so cold and stunned and worried about and caring for his own daughter. And the idea that a convicted criminal would actually ask his victim's parents to take in and care for his daughter is beyond belief. <br /> <br /> That said, the characters act with conviction by the actors. I thought changing the eyes of Scott Bakula made her look colder and menacing than she usually is. You could not see in his eyes at all.
