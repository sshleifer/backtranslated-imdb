This movie has an IMDB rating of 8.1 so I hope more out of it. It starts out funny and endearing with an energy that feels spontaneous. But before the movie is halfway through, it starts to drag and everything becomes sickly predictable. The characters in the office were succulent in the first part of the film, but we get to know them a little too well; they become caricatures, not real people at all. This is the same story I've seen hundreds of times, only said here with a little different circumstances. The thing is, I was able to buy another predictive love story if only the dialogue was not so stubborn! <br /> <br /> The only thing that could be worse is if the characters had consistent and incredible motivations, and unfortunately that was also the case with the Death Letter Office. Hopefully this movie will end up at the Dead Movie Office soon.
