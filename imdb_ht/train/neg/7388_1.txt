Drss1942 really took the right words out of my mouth. I liked her earlier Segal films and I feel like the only one who is always faithful to her. I just saw this movie (ok, falling asleep on the 90%, so I did not see the end). When I got up and saw I was in the DVD menu, I was grateful I was not subject myself to any more in that movie and did not dare to find out what was happening at the end. There was something weird about the voice of Segal and others. Kinda recalled me to the original Mad Max where the voice was armed, but in the same language (Australlian is English, right? :) Anyway, if I had 10 thumbs, they would all point down now for Sally's injustice that.
