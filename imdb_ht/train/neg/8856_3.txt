Lee has hosted 100 years of film for Ted Newsom and has talked about femic werewolves. He said something in the effect that his only brush and likanthropy was Irish II, then he quipped, "The less was told about the best." Indeed it was right that this movie can very well be the worst of its entire catalog of screen performance. The first screams by Joe Dante was an unforgettable and unbelievable movie showcase of its special effects and its essence of genres and subjects. It was a movie that must be taken seriously. Like other good movie films, filmmakers for some unusual reasons thought they needed more cash than just that that worked the first time (See CHUD then CHUD II to illustrate this point). This movie is miles and miles away from the first on each front. There is absolutely nothing to fear about it. It looks cheap and is the most black of the biggest scene. Lee is the only actor in the movie worth mentioning (okay, I'll give Ferdy Mayne too). Lee seems to be annoyed as he says dialogue dialogue and ridiculous things (check out that ends with him and Stirba). Lee looks incredibly tired and knows what's too much that is a tad more perspicacious than the two driving leads from America to go to Romania. The story is not really worth examining here, and you can bet there are very few worth mentioning stories when you have to have Stephen Parsons and his band Babel play in many of the films from the beginning and end with that obnoxious noise. Sybil Danning is here and, yes, it is unobtrusive once and then we find that scene has been shown again and again - yet one review said 17 times (I counted ten - but would have been so bored out of my mind by this point). I gave the movie three stars, but it really deserves a zero - three I gave it to Lee for two and for contributions Ms. Danning a. Yuck!
