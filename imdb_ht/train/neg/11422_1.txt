I saw it in the theater when it came out, and just yesterday I saw it again on cable. This I could react to myself and the feeling of just how this movie riot is. The whole bunch of the self-absorbed characters Narcisstic. Worst of all, it strengthens every negative stereotype about 20-something dating, as it claims to celebrate the "find themselves". The lovely men finish the last, the foolish guys make out big, the jerkiest guys do better. Girls are all boys pushovers games. Only one character ("Wendy") has seen anything useful remotely in society, and it dispenses with her little salvation for a long time in a stand-alone stand with a scumbag, in a lushly filmed scene. is supposed to be romantic. What this really is Hollywood's concept of young America: permissive, detached, promiscuous, harassed.
