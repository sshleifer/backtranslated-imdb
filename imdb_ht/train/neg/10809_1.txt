This is the worst movie I've ever seen. I watched this movie with some friends and after 40 minutes we had enough. The draw was bad and was not a single character. I was able to find more entertainment watching static. I gave this movie one only because the scale did not go into negative numbers. Avoid this movie at all costs.
