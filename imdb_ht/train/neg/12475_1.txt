I do not remember walking out of a movie theater except this once. Not only that, but I was with 7 friends, and we all wanted to go. A worthwhile conspiracy, characters made of clay, violence with no point. I did not care when the good guys were dying; I did not care when the bad guys got it. The fantasy and magic were placed on thick as pudding times and there was no coherency. In short, fine entertainment if you happen to be spending an eternity in hell.
