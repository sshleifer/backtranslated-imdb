Oh God. I bought this movie ... I ... look ... ... ... all ... the stuff. . . Well, it will be well ... I know I'll be okay in a month or two. Some time soon I hope to get rid of the flash backs. I was going to eat something after the movie but I just can not seem to lift the courage to try and keep any food down at the moment. Move? Yes bad. Very BAD. BAD BAD BAD BAD BAD. Waiting, bad does not seem to get the message across in the right way. Hmm ... No word for describing just how awful .... not terrible ... Hmm disgustingly horribly cast / act / filmed / directed / writing. Now I do not know what to do, but throw it out. Perhaps burning it I would not want it at the bottom of the bottom of an architectural dig one thousand years from now. The worst movie ever since "Hey Happy"
