"Sieger Die" was highly recommended to be one of the few good movies made in Germany. I watch it last night and I must admit, that I'm deeply disappointed. If that is the "last hope" for fun and challenging German action movies, well then there is not much left. <br /> <br /> "Die Sieger" is trying to be sexy, daring and angry but it is nothing of that kind. The characters are wild and stereotyped and each time they do something unexpected (that does not happen too much) the act against nature. Which makes it difficult - so I'm almost impossible - to follow them or even identify with them. Most of all I think the movie is very bad thrown. There is no character in which I believe. Perhaps the superior officer of SWAT unit - but that's about it. Those who try to look like or act like special units, like elite cops - I do not believe them. Not for the second. The story is not so bad after all. But I think it was wrong said. You do not get to know the bad guy at all - for example. But when after a "very dark" show Karl Simon (good guy) asked opponents already dead "why? ... what for?" I asked myself that the same question, knowing that Dominik Graf would not have the answer. <br /> I sincerely hope - no - I believe that Germany can do better, even with action films.
