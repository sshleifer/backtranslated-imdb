Army conspiracy and two-dimensional script made characters such as cut-outs. Needless to say, this made it difficult to feel sympathy for any of the characters, especially the fiancee; He looked and acted more like a cartoon. In summary, I guess you might say it was on par with the typical ones you did for TV drama. It uses just about every cliche in the book. Twist classic musicians who want to break-out and play salsa. The Free-Dynamic Hostel engaged in a personality "Bean counter" personality he does not like. I will not list them or else it would be a shingle because I should give away the whole plot. The dance was OK, but nothing special. I saw worse. 3 stars for good music. The band was really tight. I saw it on YouTube. Fortunately, I did not pay any money to see it in a theater. I'm still a little shocked by how big this movie was garnished.
