Do not watch this photo if you like the classic like TOM WOPAT, JOHN SCHNEIDER, CATHERINE BACH, SORRELL BOOKE, JAMES BEST, DENVER PYLE, SONNY SHROYER, and BEN JONES! THIS PICTURE WILL GIVE YOUR ARROW! First of all, this film begins with Bo and Luke running moonshine for Jesse. Bo and Luke would not do that ever on the real series! This film shows unimaginable characters doing things that never happened in the series. In the series, Uncle Jesse was honest and respectful. In this film, he is a criminal who is doing moonshine and smoking weeds and governors of Georgia. Plus, if this was an extension added to the rulers of Reunion Hazzard! and the Dukes of Hazzard in Hollywood, I have a question: WHAT IS A JESSE TAKE MONEY when it was judged before the DUKES DUWES in Hollywood Hollywood movie? AND WHO HAS SURROUNDED HOGG ALIVE IN THE PUBLIC OPINION IN 1997! MOVIE AND ROSCO RAN HAZZARD? He suggests that these characters have changed life, when they died for 11 and 8 years? If Hollywood really wanted to make a good movie, they should have brought back James Best, Jan Schneider, Tom Wopat, Ben Jones, and Catherine Bach as they did in 1997 and 2000 and made a family friendly movie with characters the original living who showed the show what it was and still compared to this lousy film, movie! If you want to see good movie cinema, either buy the original set, or go out of walmart.com and buy the DVD set of 2 including the Reunion, and CEO of Hazzard in Hollywood movies! They both throw the original stars, and they are family friendly! Do not waste your time on a movie that is not worth the CD she writes on!
