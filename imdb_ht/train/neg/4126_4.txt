Absolutely nothing happens in this sloooow, annoying, thrill-less thriller that is directed by the usual collaborator of Amenabar Mateo Gil. The movie, which in some ways deals with the effect of boredom with the quest for emotion, actually delivers no, and it looks like an exercise in boredom. Only the momentously suspenseful moment is the film's largest film, which takes about 30 seconds to the 100-plus whole-agonizing minister, and it solves too simply. The plot misses sophistication or credibility, and while the idea is original, the way the unfolding story is arbitrary and any tracing or twisting device is a result of outward interference (deus-ex-machina). The hero is still passive, everything happens to him without force to show any initiatives or resourcefulness. If you're fond of the genre, see "Tesis" instead.
