This star british British / Spanish co-production looks great, what you can see in it. I have three versions, two VHS, one DVD, and all are terribly off, so seriously it looks as if the buildings have conversations with each other. Some films suffer such seriously from pan and scan as this one, as Robert Parrish's director seems to have been so romantic with the widescreen process that he tends to use both sides of the screen at once, neglecting the middle. Another user comments that we see the inhabitants of a massacre church at the start; not in any of the copies I have. Some cuts off the peasants to shoot the rifles, one Mexican officer shot, Shaw and Landau celebrate, and that's it. We never find out why Shaw became a priest (if he really is), we never find out what happens to Don Carlos (Savalas) although I suspect he's called home star in Kojak, as his departure seems arbitrary . And there is a strange flashback sequence where Michael Craig (Mysterious Island) is dancing around in a bowler hat and bad suits in the traditional traditional British English 1960's hit BATTLE in NEW ORLEANS by singing by Johnny Horton here, but with some lyrics I never heard before. On the plus side, the place is great, a great old ruined staircase with Escher-style staircase leading nowhere, some beautiful landscape-mills by Robert Shaw, and good performances by Stevens, Landau, Lettieri, and Telly Savalas as Telly Savalas. I did not really like this movie, but I did not exactly see it. I will look for the widescreen version and make my decision then.
