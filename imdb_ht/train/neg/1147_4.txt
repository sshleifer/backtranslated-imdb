This film is in F.B.I. as Berry Knott's Farm is in the old west. Sanitation Federal Federal version of Investigation Fight Against Crime. The Big Hand Hoover (he had any other kind?) Show off all and teevee quality script-reading actors, cheesy sets, cheap sound effects and lighting 101. With Jimmy Stewart of 20% of dramatic abilities, Vera Miles The mill's landscape, the film features every c-lister known among fifty soldiers and nary a hint of irony or humor, from the 'Amazon Forest' to the 'backyard barbecue back', everything reeks in stages and many back. Even gunshots are in boxes and accustomed. I imagine Mervyn Leroy drank every night. Except for a few (very few) exciting exterior established vaccines, there is nothing here to score beyond a Curio.
