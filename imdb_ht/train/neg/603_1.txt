Absolutely lust movie. I live in London and the plot is so ill-researched in ridiculous. No one was able to terrorize the London Underground. In a short time, it's not in service every night there are teams of maintenance workers have to check the tracks and make repairs, etc. That there are people living down there is equally easy. Or that it even possible to get close to and not have access to a mobile phone to this day and age ... The worst that's likely to happen if someone found themselves after the last train is they might get graffiti spray on them. Although this came under control due to massive quantities of security cameras on the network, another thorn in the side of the story. (Remember in London as a whole we have more security cameras than any other city in the world.) <br /> If it was put in a city I'm not familiar with maybe I could have enjoyed it in ignorance, but it's not a high quality film so I just could not bring myself back to my incredible stop and try and enjoy it for the banal tale story that it is. <br /> I would give it 0/10 if such a rating exists! Possibly the most irritating movie I've ever thought I would like.
