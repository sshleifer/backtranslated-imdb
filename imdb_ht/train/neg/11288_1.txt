In recent times I've been subjected to both this film and "King Arthur", on DVD choosing from others for an evening's "entertainment" and together they realize nothing more than carrying out a growing notion I have that movie In modern-looking publicity totally lacking discrimination, and content while finding "action". Both movies were absolute trash. <br /> Whatever happened to character development? Whatever happened in meaningful dialogue? Whatever happened ACTING? And when looking at something that vaguely pretends to be "historic," all that has come to try some precision measurements, some realistic ideas of the "map" at the moment, even some slight flavors of the era, especially in its social attitude. Why are they all showing the value set in 21st Century America? I read on the message boards of warning that "little was known" in the dark ages. Not so. Many amounts of money are recognized, and many scholars have learned from the era, but these joker simply would not be able to do any homework. <br /> I only wish I could vote 0/10
