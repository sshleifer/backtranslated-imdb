This is some of the worst acts I have ever seen. I love Nadja Almereyda, but this is just absolute dreck. Aside from a moment of interesting movies and music this movie is just safe to act with mute material. Jared Harris is particularly bad, but no one in this is remotely good. The plot is a joke, but not the haha ​​type. I do not even know if you can forgive the bad movies. Please delete the last hour and a half of my life. How does this director make Nadja and another girl another planet?
