Only the most daring DORIS fan was able to find this same enthusiastic look. When a person thinks about material wealth available for a story about New York City's most popular outlook, a film that can cope with many real-life stories in which people have to deal with, this scratching the bottom of the barrel for lack of history-tell originality. <br /> Again Doris is unhappy even because he suspects he may have been compromised in the night of the blackout when he turned his Connecticut lodgings, took a sleeping portion and got up in the morning with a man who Do the same, wandering around the house by mistake. No one can rescue this mess - by Doris, by ROBERT MORSE, TERRY-THOMAS, PATRICK O'NEAL or LOLA ALBRIGHT. As it was directed by Hy Averback, it's the weakest day car find himself in, committed to making the movie because of his husband's car and unable to get out of it. Too bad.
