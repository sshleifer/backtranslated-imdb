This was probably the worst film ever, seriously. I could actually do better myself, and did not even set up well. It's like this movie had a $ 5 budget and left with change. Do not look at it. I did not even find all the way to this movie, had to turn it off. I gave this a 1/10 because it was hilarious how the producer of this movie wanted it to be a horror movie, but actually turned into a really bad comedy. Basically, a bunch of girls crashed into a car, broke a headlight, and the owner of this car went behind them. Small as I saw was a woman and a gun telling a load of girls to take their clothes, what the hell? It must also be some kind of porn movie.
