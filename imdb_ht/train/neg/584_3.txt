This movie, like the first one ("The Man from the River Snowy") has the same characteristics as the good and bad, maybe even more so than the original. Unfortunately, overstepping the good good. <br /> <br /> The good - beautiful scenery, better than the first movie. I love these high country vaccines in Australia. Tom Burlinson is still a likable guy, like "Jim Craig." Bruce Rowland has done a great job with the music, too. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />! In this film, we also find a great upgrade to pay the father. Previously it was Kirk Douglas, now replaced by Brian Dennehy's still-profane. Speaking of it, it is a shame that a Walt Disney movie would include the use of Lord's name in vain. That was a reason that was almost totally down the tubes in the 1980s. This movie, like the first one
