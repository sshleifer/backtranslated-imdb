OK I keep this movie halfway, but.oh.dear.god.it.sounds.like.they're.all.reading.from.scripts. <br /> <br /> Especially that guy who is now in Teacher and Book Class, although at least he proves he can act if he wants to! (The part where a person has a heart attack means out as a bastion of bad movie doing both in terms of acting, scripting and general plausibility) It's very clearly seen a cash on Human Trafficking, but everything is Not the best film ever, it is at least original and there have been delivery actors did not look like those of GCSE-serious-again-hopeless students trying to get a passing score. Not so much human traffic as a bit of a car crash!
