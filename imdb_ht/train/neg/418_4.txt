Someone might want that an idea as good as the "invisible man" would work better and be more careful at the age of fantastic special effects, but this is not the case. The story, the characters and, ultimately all the last 20 minutes of the movie is over as cool as a crazy croak-scientist from the early 50's. There are some great moments, especially due to the amazing special effects and the very idea of ​​an invisible man to follow the streets. But, soon, we'll be back to the restrained incubation of the underground laboratory, which means that the rest of the film is not only predictable, but it resumed. <br /> There was a very large remax in old movie or TV shows over the past 10 years, and some of them have the charms. But it becomes clearer and clearer for each film that the idea of ​​putting classic ones under the nose of foolish cravings like Verhoeven (whose moments) is a very bad one. It is obvious that the money is the key problem here: the time and energy set in the script is nowhere near enough, and as a result, "Hollow Man" is seriously weakened and clever, sappy characters, predictability and lack of any depth whatever. However, one thing that actually impressed me, besides the special effects, had sworn. When doing this kind of movie, modern producers are very keen on allowing kids to see them. Therefore, the language (and, sometimes, the violence and sex) is very tone down. When the whole world blows, the good guys go "Oh daring!" and "Oh My God". "Hollow Man" gratefully denies the type of hypocrisy and the characters of freedom to say what is most natural. I do not say that the most natural answer to something goes wrong is swear - but it makes it more credible if someone actually swears. I think we can thank Verhoeven for that.
