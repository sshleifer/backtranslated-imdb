I stumbled upon Nine Dead recently and reviewed the current thought I was able to cope with an average movie. This movie however was slightly lower than average, but look. The script was written wrongly and the act was average for a B-movie movie with a couple standing out as pretty good. The boundary plot on those of Saw, teaching people to do wrong in a situation and trying to appreciate more life, but that's really where the comparison ends. Nine dead trying to have the heart and purpose behind simple ideas that are not new. The main fault that I found in Nine Die, the slap in the face of the viewer of flashback occurred 3 minutes before the movie and was completely unnecessary and a completely complete finish that people will not see come, in a bad way. Prevent any crowd I've seen the worst of bad movies and even they did not end this wrong. Dentic flicker, bad acting and ending though ...
