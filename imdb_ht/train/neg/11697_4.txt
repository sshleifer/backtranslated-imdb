I'm not one of those who think King is a great writer, his book is fine distractions for a few hours, and often there are interesting properties, however, in my opinion, falls a very good way if you give them any serious thought . br /> <br /> This movie suffers from a very accurate re-tell in King's story. If you have read the book, there are zero surprises, there is no change, no change in scene or character. This is a movie made by King fans for King fans. <br /> <br /> For the rest of us, there is nothing terrible about the movie, it's a horror 'gypsy horror, and its twist being the curse being something that many people want to , they become thin. The third final has some serious structural problems, and the end a little forced to seem to break the rules of this genre a little. There are worst ways to spend 90 minutes in your life, but you might as well read the book, because there is nothing new here ... <br /> <br />
