This is a good example of how NOT to make a movie. <br /> <br /> There are many meaningful dialogues, no context for events, and constant breakdowns between seemingly unrelated scenes. The result is a violent, vicious confusion; The plot is absolutely impossible to follow and the ideas are presented meaningless without listening to the director's director. <br /> <br /> This movie has a lot to do with human atrocities and try to show how bad it is, with an emphasis on child abuse. It includes some real stock footage, horrendous acts of violence, including execution time wars. Although it works in the context of the film, I feel that the ideas behind the movie could be introduced without resorting to these extreme content. This film is absolutely NOT for weak or easy to run stomach, and should not be under any circumstances to show minor. <br /> <br /> The highest score is anti-climatic compared to the content of the rest of the movie. If you do not listen to the comment while it comes to you will probably miss it. <br /> <br /> The next director was one-shot, "sitting down the guy and let him talk, no cut" kind of comment. While this is not necessarily bad, the director ends up rambling a lot and often spends minutes at a time when he's about his college, manure requirements, producers, movie films, and dozens of other things. The constant negativity of what otherwise is an essential tool for understanding the movie. The film was shot many years ago about 16mm and Super8 films over a four-year period on a very low budget. Therefore, quality video and audio is poor. That alone does not make it a bad movie, but it makes a bad movie worse.
