The film is about two stories: one is a political murders of a girl called, the other a top-class party. The crossing point is the public relations character played by Al Paccino, as it witnessed the crime and the incredible in the evening. <br /> <br /> If the script is awful without any decent dialogue and the direct void in any sense of drama, the performance Al is memorable: how many friends can be as much convinced as a powerful and fear person ( as the "Godfather") as here as a little servant (see also "Donnie Brasco"). /> <br /> Actually, the great young lion gets a tired old one. That's happening at the very age, because it makes the audience meditate on getting old too. <br /> But his riot is only a make-up because he can get his energy back into the Church scene. > <br /> Perhaps it is good that the film is so awful because it puts the star on the talent Al!
