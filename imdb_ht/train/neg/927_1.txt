I mean really, how Charles Band head in Full Moon leaves a member of Stink-Ball like DEMONICUS out. I mean it should never have the green light to begin with. The story is repetition, the weak characters at best, there is no real story about Tyranus other then it is a bad dude. Then the writer or director goes out of his way for a finishing end. This is a good finish, Demonicus woke up. The last survivor saves a deadly cave, then a picture of Chimera comes to life, cheaply I might add and chases him out. Then, as she is walking home FUNHOUSE. A statue that destroyed centuries ago reappears for no reason just fell on his head. I mean, that makes no sense. What the hell thought Charles allowed this pile of puke to be made, and four different film companies were desperate for movies. They could ask me, I had better idea then DEMONICUS. THAN TURKEY.
