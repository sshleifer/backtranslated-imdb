I understand this movie has made a very low budget but is not an excuse for the monstrosity that is Grendel. Deathstalker, The Thrower, Barbarian Queen, Conquest, Barbarian Invincible are all made on budget shoestring and poor special effects yet they still managed to create classic kines by adding some cladri women warrior squad with a good sense of humor. The primitive costumes, black castles and beautiful landscape Bulgaria gave Grendel the potential to be a very good budget low swords and sorcery films, but the musicians completely ruined this opportunity using extremely poor CGI effects and colorless characters . Compare this movie for Beowulf (1999). It can not be Kane Citizens but it is a good example of how a budget sci-fi budget / entertainment budget can be done by using credible special effects and appealing characters.
