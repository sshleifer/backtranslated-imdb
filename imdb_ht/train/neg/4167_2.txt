I longed to see "Mr. Fix" because I'm a big fan of David Boreanaz. What I got, though, was a 1-1 / 2 hour nap. The first seemed to be enjoyable: Boreanaz is Lance Valenteen, the proprietor of a business called "Mr. Fix It", where people are thrown to engage his help to find their girlfriends take them back. <br /> <br /> Among these issues and this movie are editing, scripting, and acting. Although I found Boreanaz delightful in the role of his other film (with the exception of his movie "Crow"), this was disappointing. Sometimes, his character was interesting to others, flat. Throw in support to remind me of soap operas day guys. I realized it was not a big-budget film, but some of the scene cuts and music just did not seem right. <br /> <br /> My advice: look at your own risk.
