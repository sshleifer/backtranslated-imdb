House of the Dead was the worst movie I ever saw, between the 'matrix' attempts 360 camera angles and the cheesy act I fell asleep. I do not think that the director and manager can decide whether it was raining or not, because there would be rain on one side of the boat and not the other. I would miss this movie a 1 out of 10, (10 were the best, 1 being the worst). Also scrolling scenes from the movie the game was really annoying, it makes you wonder if they just made up for lost time. I ask anyone who reads this, NOT to see it. It is not worth the time.
