This movie should call Need for speed: the movie. For those who have not played the games Need for speed is mostly on hot cars and beautiful women and almost no plots. This applies perfectly to Redline. The only thing about this movie was One-level were cars. The act seemed forced and scripted, the premise was flimsy at best, and the plot was almost nonexistent. I only really watch this movie to see how bad it was, and, while it was very bad, it could get worse. And at least it was fun. I just wanted to have shown Eddie Griffin crashing Enzo somewhere in the movie. All in all, do not pay for it, do not go out of your way to see it, but if it's Showtime or HBO and nothing else about, it's a decent distraction.
