I hope this to be a lot better. I love Tim Burton's work, so I was really excited to see these short film online. Well, they were not at all what I expected. <br /> I do not really know what exactly it is I do not like. I guess they're just sort of dull. The sound was bothering me, and most of the characters, although I liked Roy Boy toxic, and Stainboy. <br /> <br /> The Match Girl Episode Probably probably listened to me the most, although it was very funny. <br /> I also do not like the way some of the characters die. Like how Girl Girl basically puts the gas station on fire, or how the girl stares died, in general. Roy's death was fun, amazing. Death by a freshener machine. Very original ;-) That makes me laugh so hard ... <br /> There are some things that are not suitable for kids. Just some language and gore. That's all I have to say! 3/10
