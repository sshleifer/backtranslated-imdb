STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning <br /> <br /> Marshall Lawson (Steven Seagal) is assigned to France on a Recovery Mission along with three new strike-recruiting teams after disobeying a direct order from above. However the previous night will be due to strike, they have all been found grosomely killed by an assassin with seemingly insignificant force. With the French police around and their own investigation, he goes in search of the guardian himself, only uncovering a corruption function in the military to cope in a deadly new drug that transforms someone's DNA and gives them new stress. > <br /> Bad Cover. Bad titles. Bad post-production falsification. And bad trailer. Pretty bad movie. But I had to say, I do not think force attack is quite his worst. I know this will make me popular with most of the other reviews here (maybe by Steveday!) But I think a lot of criticism has stemmed from all the bad news that has gone before the movie rather than good the actual type of it itself. br> <br /> I must say that there was nowhere near as much duplication or ropey correction as I would have led to believe. The double was (made him sound like Martin Sheen and a wool problem!) Was very awful and quite often, but not in use for a great segment of the movie as I would think. The flow scheme is very smoothly as well as considering all the mercy on and the original movie finish called Harvester who went on. Also as another review noted, the movie has a nice gothic look at it, a new touch for a Seagal movie. But Absolute Killer low points, though, was the total lack and total of any exciting action, and only a few battles scene badly filmed for any fun. <br /> I have to be honest, though, I would rather watch this again than the anger of anger, Today you die or out for a killing. **
