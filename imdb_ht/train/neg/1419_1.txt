This is a terrible little movie - and unfortunately, the company that made this short did many others. The short is essentially a single-joke idea that was not funny to start with and may also offend you. She certainly makes me comfortable watching toddlers (most appearing over 2 years old) cavorting over and pretending to be adult - in this case, a dancehall girl and client room bar. It sort of humor that you might be forced to laugh at from your own children if they pretend to be adult, but I can not see anyone who wants to see this - especially when a very young Shirley storm is dressed in a rather Slinky equipped with acts like a vamp! Then other children act as adults in some situations rather than adults. At that moment, I'm sure they were not trying to appeal to pedophilia, but when you look at it today, that's what comes immediately to mind! That's why this boring film has touched me out and I hope never see it again !! Pretty unusual and beautifully awesome.
