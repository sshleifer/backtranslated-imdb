OK .... I just have 3 words - cheesy, cheesy and cheeses! This only feature of this film is Dean Cain. In addition - it's CHEESEBALL SUPREME !!!! The movie does have some promises of the concept - an underground laboratory creates a real live fire breathing dragon - basically giving us more of "Jurassic Park" meets "Reign of Fire" ... There are some great possibilities, but they just do not follow in ... The special effects are decent - even if you know the dragon is CGI, it is not horizontally LOOK like CGI .... <br /> I would not put the blame on Dean Cain (although it is one of the producers), I would lie more of the fault on Phillip Roth - the director and writer. It's his job to make that movie .... and, unfortunately, it has failed.
