I have read every book from the left side of the back, and the movie hardly does any of them. Sure, I've seen worse movies, but this was incredibly disappointing. This movie would make a good MST3K episode. The script was a terrible adaptation of the book, and it felt like the actors had read the lines, instead of actually telling them. Characters were stiff and unlikeable. The effects were cheesy, and they looked very frightening. The finish was awful. First of all, he did not even go all the way in the first book. Secondly, it made no sense. If you did not read the book, you would have no idea what was going on. She had the most cheesy, films-like films I've ever seen in a movie. I'm upset that I actually pay money for this movie. If not some miracles, he finds wide release, should be totally overhauled and let Hollywood take over. Those two wannabe movie producers, and the wannabe director should leave their film professionally.
