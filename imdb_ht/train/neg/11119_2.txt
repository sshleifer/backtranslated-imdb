Woody Harrelson and Wesley Snipe team up as hustlers on the basketball court. Well, that sounds all right there. She leaves lots of room for good comedy and a good story. But no such event took place in these very few minutes so boring in this pathetic attempt at a movie. This film has become redundant, delayed, and ridiculous after the first few seconds gone by. Woody Harrelson has played one of t.v. my favorite. Character, Woody from Cheers, and I was looking forward to seeing him in this movie. But after seeing his "acting performance" I came to the conclusion that he should stay playing hummel dick hart that Bart. His acting was as dull and poor as the movie. Another actor in this real movie was Rosie Perez. I loved cinema and Perez before, but I decided that the reason I enjoyed other work in his career was that he was not a main character and did not have many lines to talk (doing things right). But now in White Men can not jump it has made a central character and many lines, thus the audience has set up with extremely annoying and vulnerable voices. So, after seeing this movie (term use wounds) and hearing Rosie Perez for more than appreciating I can now say that I'm a white man and I'm getting ready to jump. . . cut a twenty-story apartment building.
