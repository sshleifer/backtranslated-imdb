This production has absolutely no scenario. The act is embarrassing. The Dutch promising Dutch Sophie Hilbrand star should not add this movie to her CV. His act is far flaw and personally I think he has crossed into professional descent; related to the way he expelled himself in this movie. This film has too much nudity, vulgar sex and rude language. It also shows a wrong image in the Netherlands (as most movies do). Do not worry to watch this movie: a waste of time, a waste of money and a nasty file for Hilbrand, who has proven to be best and close it off on the screen.
