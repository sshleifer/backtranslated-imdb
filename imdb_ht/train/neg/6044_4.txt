A well put together into the genre of serious series that unfortunately gets cramped down to its own pretense to be really satisfied. William Dafoe is superb as a NYC detective trying to track down what appears to be a copycat using the same Renaissance art related to killing techniques used in a series of killings he resolved earlier years. Scott Speedman is Dafoe's Jewish partner and has very good chemistry (at least for a while). Other characters pop up to a good tie of the cases together. Clea Duval is a friend of an earlier victim and Peter Stormare is some sort of art broker / adviser Dafoe ... that's a bit hard to take, although Stormare is, of course, never dull. The film's end is particularly disappointing. Look quickly to Deborah Harry as Dafoe less than the next neighbors.
