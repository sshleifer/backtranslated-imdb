Strange? Yes! <br /> <br /> Normal topic, four sisters and their relationship with US soldiers, from one bringing the illegitimate child to a son of a Senator, to another living with seven Marines (one at a time) before being murdered by she returned to New Pope New Zealander husband. Unusual to see Paul Newman rescued as a poor performance so soon after his unforgettable role as Rocky Graziano in the brilliant "A Man Up My Love". Unlike two fine "stars" Joan Fontaine and Jean Simmons, they left little in their head on a movie. /> <br /> Strange that I might be bothered to write a review of such a poor movie, give it a miss!
