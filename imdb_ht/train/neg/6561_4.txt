Sequence of the opening was supposed to show the Legion arrived in Paris on 13 Nov 1918. The troop troupes of the train - wearing the uniform in which the French Army, including the Legion, walked into war in 1914! That's a sure sign that the cops your war is about to see will be a turkey. (The French army achieved by 1915 in wars in black pants and dark black armor did not work. Metropolitan troops were set to "blue origins" and colonial troops put into khaki.) Claude Van Damme (Sp? ) Notice at least got their uniforms more or less right. Really is too bad when the directors make these kind of errors when they then go through all the effort to find other things right.
