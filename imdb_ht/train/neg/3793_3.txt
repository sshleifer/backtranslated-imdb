The Nutcracker was always a bit of a ballet problem. It brings a bit of resemblance to the original story of ETA Hoffman. At the ballet, the story is essentially about the second half when Clara (or Marie in this version) travels to the kingdom of sweets to watch a series of dance characters. <br /> There is an infinite variety of stage productions that re-interpret the story of how touching (not always successfully) to compensate for the weakness of the ballet. > <br /> The Balanchine version does not really have any sense of drama or story at all (despite the fact that there are plenty of drama and mystery of the wonderful Tchaikovsky's first Tasha music). The result is a completely disassociable part of the first half Christmas place unprecedented anything happens and where even the dancing (little bit of it) is not particularly memorable. The <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />! <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, things are not best when we reach the kingdom of sweets (Act II in the version step). Although there are some choreography, most of the choreography is bland and uninspiring. This is certainly not ancient Balanchine. <br /> <br /> Balanchine is widely regarded as a master of abstract dance, but I still felt it was less successful as a creator of narrative ballet. Watching this movie version of its stage production at Nutcracker has only re-confirmed this view.
