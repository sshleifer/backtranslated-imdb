Oh love ... like an Englishman, and a small Welsh party, a fan of Anthony Hopkins' work in the industry ..... to date, I'm really disappointed. <br /> You see I'm a nobody, hoping for better. So my comments are as 'straw in the wind'. But what is the point is not it? - I have no ax to grind on the commercial value of a job. I am a full member of the blood without the water, going to see a movie to be transported to another location. Yes, stop believing for a short period. But do not enter into a state of total disbelief. <br /> <br /> If this was not an unknown author and director, I would guess that this 'production' would be castigated in oblivion. Unfortunately, it's not, and I've left wide eyed and confused. Will you see some of the rhetorical reactions to this work I'm sick to worry .... <br /> Maybe it's that I try without prejudice to see each movie on its own base. Regardless of the author, director, studio or even notoriety of the content. <br /> <br /> My advice, as much before me: Do not write and direct the same output. It is full of dangers. Movies need to be moderate to maintain a semblance of credibility. As they say in the school report "could and can do better ..."
