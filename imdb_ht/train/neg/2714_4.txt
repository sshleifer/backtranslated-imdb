The 60s (1999) D: Mak Piznarski. Josh Hamilton, Julia Stiles, Jerry O'Connell, Jeremy Sisto, Jordan Brewster, Leonard Roberts, Bill Smitrovich, Annie Corley, Charles S. Dutton. NBC mini-series (later released in video / DVD as full-length feature film) on the 1960 treble, as seen in the eyes of both a white family and a black family. The first half film is driven by the excellent performance of Dutton as Reverend Willie Taylor and evenly spread the storyline between families. However, Dutton's character dies half with the black family is completely forgotten in a dull, incoherent, and downright terrible 2nd half. RATING: 4 out of 10. Not rated (later rated PG-13 for video / DVD release).
