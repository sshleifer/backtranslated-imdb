I watched the DVD (called WIDOW BLACK in USA) and felt after it was, indeed, a really awful movie. But they must have cut quite a bit from the original movie, or I miss a lot. The sex scenes were very small vulgare and no stripping (not even a breast), but I read several other comments on IMDb.com to mention the vulgarite and something on a tap. I did not see anything like that, just a bad, boring film and inaccurate character with a trite, sophomoric plot. Giada Colagrande is either paralyzed from the mouth lift or the botox the gills, and nary a touching touch to her face. And her name makes me think of super-sizing a beverage in Taco Bell: "I'll have the Grande Cola!" It was actually kind of fun it was so bad, I got to play like I was in my own Mystery Science Theater 3000, anything like the fact that Dafoe's skin was too big for her face. It's really like putty funny!
