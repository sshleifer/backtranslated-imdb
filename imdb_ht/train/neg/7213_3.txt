While I certainly regard the Exorcist to be a classic horror, I must admit that I do not keep it in quite as great consideration as many other horror fans do. As a consequence, I have not seen much of their rip-off executiveism, and if Exorcismo is nothing to go through, I'll have to say that it's a good thing like this movie is boring as hell and certainly not worth eighty spending minute on it! In the justice of other rip-offs, this is often considered one of the worst, and so maybe it was not the best place to start. It's not hard to guess what the plot will be: basically it's the same as the one of the exorcist and seeing a girl get owned by a demonic spirit (which happens to the spirit of his dying dad). The village priest is then called to perform the exorcism. Like many Hispanic horror films, this one star Paul Naschy, who is pretty much the best thing about the movie. Exorcismo led by Juan Bosch, who has already led the Spanish gallo 's gloves to the glove. I have not seen any of her other films, but on the basis of these two: I believe that originality was not one of his strong points. There's not a lot of good things I can say about the movie itself; It's just just plod along with the exorcism scene is not worth waiting for. I certainly do not recommend it!
