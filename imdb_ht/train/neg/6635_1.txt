Four years after its first basic and snoozer art-house "Welcome to L.A.", Alan Rudolph shows us what he really wanted from Hollywood was to be one of the guys. "Roadie" is a frat-boy phrase filled with barroom bravls, horny harpies, Carney Art in a souped-up wheelchair ... and meat roll at the steering wheel. Bread meat (playing Travis W. Redfish!) It's actually a rather good presence on the screen, and perhaps in a smaller role (in a better movie) it might be really ingratiating, but the King's Zanman script is full of stereotypes Rednecked Humor and Stomach Bread Meat is kept wide-eyed and moronic. Alice Cooper, Roy Orbison, Hank Williams, Jr., and Blondie all make appearances - and all embarrassing look. They should certainly be, "Roadie" is one bad trip. NO STARS from ****
