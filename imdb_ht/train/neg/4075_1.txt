I'm a movie horror movie / gore and this movie was so bad, I felt embarrassed for not only the "actors", but also the director and poor of a producer who actually put his money up for this slip. /> <br /> From the title, you would expect some big carnage, a bit of a storyline and LEAST some direction or dialogue. Instead, you get what looks a little more violent and sexual episode Three stoog. At least I laughed at the three stooges. While watching this crap, I turned another TV off and started watching Howard Stern until something interesting happened. <br /> <br /> Needless to say, I kept watching Stern. I realized that I could produce a movie with three monkeys, 2 DV cameras, $ 50 dollars in loose change and a broken PC. This film is my inspiration for the film to have no budget. Watch this movie if you are dumb, but you must warn ... there is a lot of anything in here but a whole lot of talk and lots of action. This makes "KaZaam" look like a movie by Meryl Streep. I am sure that Germany has not banned it due to gender or violence. Other countries need to be careful.
