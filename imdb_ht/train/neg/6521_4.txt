I probably do not give this movie a shaking just, as I could watch all of it. Perhaps if I would see him in a theater, in his original presentation, I could appreciate it, but it's too slow-moving for me. <br /> I read the book 25 years ago and detail about the plot was faded from memory. This did not help the movie, as it's something less than vivid and clear in its presentation of events. This is really four-linked movie, or a movie of four parts, and it was, I believe, intended to be seen on four nights in a theater presentation. I found Part I to be enjoyable enough, but it was all I could do to sit in Part II, which was unmatched. Tolstoy's philosophical reading is one thing. If you get a good translation or you can read it in the original, write her brilliantly far beyond any one's problem with the pace of the story. On film, however, it is difficult to reproduce without being ponderous. <br /> I have other issues with the movie parts that I've seen. It's pretty splashy, and a lot of hey-ma-look-in-this camera work that requires the attention itself, instead of pre-use the story. <br /> <br /> Clearly, I miss something, but I just could not summon the crank enthusiasm up parts III and IV.
