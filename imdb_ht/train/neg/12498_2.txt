This movie has the look of a really good story. The work of men and women in the Coast Guard, especially in the North Pacific, is the thing of heroes and legends. This film blows up a good story with three sequels (without meeting), a couple of battles without anything and useless bar and two alleged "romantic" relationships that have as many glamor as campfire. The rescue scenes are great - though the computer generation is hokey and the scenarios are very real - but the backstory is lame and irritating. Costner is a good thing - especially his acting (look for it). Ashton Kutcher is flat, but not terrible. The main female characters are one dimension. The best female is one of the Gad Guard Gadgets in the rescue center and is on camera for about two minutes in the entire movie. It could be an excellent movie - and Costner needs one!
