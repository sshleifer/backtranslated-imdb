I anticipate release the movie as much as any fan of Broadway play. I waited and reviewed for months on performance winning awards. I mean and maybe starring Eddie Murphy, Jamie Foxx, Beyonce Knowles, Danny Glover ... the movie might not be less than 4 out of 4 stars, right? WON! I was definitely disappointed by the finished product. The film did not match up to the hype of advertising it provided with the saving pills only being Eddie Murphy, Anika Noi Rose and Jennifer Hudson. Eddie Murphy's James Brownesque performance saved the movie just when it hit her multiple multiple and Jennifer Hudson's performance forced you to pay attention every time she's off the screen. His performance in "And I told you" was the only time that I felt the hype deserved. You cringed as he asked him no good man left him staying in the group and in his life. As many reporters have stated, he steals the movie of the most experienced actors and deserves all the hugs he is receiving for this performance. Anika Noni Rose was also a strong presence with a great voice and comedy talent. Jamie Foxx and Beyonce Knowles, on the other hand, cruise through their performance. Foxx's acting skills for this movie seemed to predict his extraordinary "Ray" performance and Beyonce Knowles were on a photo shoot extending photo or taping video, posing and shimmying his way into the movie. Her performance was not strong enough to make you care about her character at any point in the movie. The movie was too hyped, 30 minutes and 1 song (Beyonce's "tender" solo Jamie Foxx) too long. <br /> DH - Vancouver, WA
