When I got this movie free of my work, along with three other similar movies .. I looked at then with very low expectations. Now this movie is not bad for each. You get what you pay for. It's a story of love, betrayal, lies, sex, scandal, all you want in a movie. Definitely not a Hollywood blockbuster, but for cheap emotions it is not that bad. I would probably never watch this movie again. In a nutshell this is the kind of movie that you would see either very late at night on a local TV station that is just willing to take some time, or would you see it on a Sunday afternoon on a local TV station that tries to take some time. Despite bad deeds, cliche lines, and sub par camera work. I did not have the desire to close the movie and pretend it never popped into my DVD player. The story has been performed many times in many films. This one does not differ, no better, does not get worse. <br /> Just your average movie.
