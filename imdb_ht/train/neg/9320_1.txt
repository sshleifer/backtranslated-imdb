If this movie was a comedy, I would give it a 10. Oh, where am I starting? Put it in this way - I've seen lots of horrible horror movies, but this one does trol 2 look like Freakin 'Saving Private Ryan. It as if a group of porn movies decided to make a horror movie, change their minds to midproduction and decided to make a comedy, then go back to horror, and then decided that they should only stick to pornography (softcore in that). Everything about this movie is simply awful: music notes (someone shot the guy who invented the keyboard Yamaha), the script, the led, the cinematography, act. Simply there is no word for describing this. Oh wait, yes, they are: Holy $ *%.
