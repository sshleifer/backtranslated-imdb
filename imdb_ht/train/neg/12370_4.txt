They probably should call this movie because the majority of the entire movie is turned on a map of a cemetery. Not to mention how many of the same bottles of the card have. The only thing to show over the card itself is the shades of sweat which is constantly built on the forehead of our main character. This of course was the movie maker movie to show us how these incredibly turbulent things are getting up on the Imperial Hills cemetery. Come on, could not have shown us just one of the death scenes? We hear a lot about how all the people listed in the card are cast like flies but we do not get to see anything. Some how I bury the living manged to keep my attention so I was fairly generous and the rating I gave it but I will not recommend this movie to anyone. Unless you have a deep passion with four or sweat I recommend renting my best movie, as I spit on your tone or I drink your blood.
