Richard Dreyfus is not the star here. He has about three 20 second cameras and what is Gene Barry doing all over this film? No idea, the director was probably his brother! This is a movie that does not make any sense too. The inept writer / director (same dude) hit up everyone's talent and u him en ... work. I got the DVD for a penny so can not complain! But it is strange! And it makes you feel weirded out and in not a good way. This was the 70's and looks like the director was on a bad acid trip and wanted everyone to experience what he's like to be inside himself. It has a somewhat interesting and controversial concept, but as a scratched file, it quickly plays bad. He has that "Manson family on acid" vibes in it. <br /> I have no idea how the other criticism got all that they did from this movie? Maybe they worked in it back when? At any speed, getting ready to lose 80 min in your life will never get back. Yes, it's so awful!
