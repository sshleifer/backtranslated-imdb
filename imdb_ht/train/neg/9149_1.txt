There is absolutely nothing in this film that shows even the least draft of talent. No one has ever tried to act before, even the extras in view of coffee as if they've been stuck in place. There is nothing to reproduce. Movie quality is terrible. Most of the 'action' take place in narrow corridors or apartments with the cameraman stacked in as a reflection, balancing some cheapo backward cameras and forwards 'actors' as they deliver their lines. There is no tripod and no proper microphone either, sound quality is terrible. Even the 'Manos' fares are much better than this, at least they have proper equipment. That draw has simply become lost in the production chaos. <br /> <br /> Sticks in home video, preferably made by some 5 year-olds trying out the video feature on the new father's camera phone. You will be in for a long search to find a movie more stupid than this.
