I guess it's great Jack's great ability to make him the powerful scene that he is, but sympathy comes at a price like all of this-when he's surrounded by his instinctively lowering the standard and becoming one with it. It's a joke as a mafia-striking-man (also because the party does not suit him one bit, his being was so extroverted) and just enclosure avoids making a fool of himself in this. Kathleen Turner has a lot of career too long just by being high and blonde, because she acts abruptly with what she does with her eyes, when she opens wide that she is convinced is sexy sexy sooooo and Anjelica Huston is absolute the same thing There is also (interestingly granted) everything, like Robert Loggia. This film is a blame that blames (and this will be the only mention of shabby called script) in a gangster movie, with a cast that was probably only interested to get to the after-party faster (they certainly looks like the elite party-go to this). What, was it fired in 1 day? -Cause that would be the only explanation.
