This movie is a terrible deformation of lies and exaggeration that has put together the most cynical crazy ever to work on a TV movie. The story is wrong with a complete lie. Nothing in this film is well-shown by Senator McCarthy. It's just a terrible scam and it surprised me that anyone associated with this production has ever had another job in the industry. The Marxist-Leninist who writes this waste has done so to attack a man who has been vindicated by stories and scares that anyone would dare to destroy communism. Unfortunately for these communist military work, Ronald Reagan took the place where McCarthy was left and could not stop him, so at the end of the Soviet Union and his coordinates. <br /> Never, never watch this movie if you are seeking truth about Saint McCarthy. Read Ann Ann Coulter's book, "Treason" for a better look at the Truth on Saints. McCarthy. It will also help you read about what really happened to Senator McCarthy by reading it http: // www. thenewamerican.com/tna/1996/vo12no18/vo12no18_mccarthy.htm
