Where to start? This is probably one of the worst movies I've ever seen. The correction is the worst ever, the sound effects being awful and the sound corrected whacked. Most of the movie one could here is the scary kicking effect, and jokes talk in the background. I had to turn my volume on full blast just to read what was going on .... and what were I to hear exactly? Probably one of the worst scripts ever made. I can not believe people actually put some green for this movie. It made me think I could take a crap in a box, send it to the producers, and then have to finance a movie for me. <br /> Dolph, it was a usual, Dolph. There is nothing else to be said. The banners were bad, the protagonists were bad, and the film was a stinker. If you really want to know what does NOT do when writing, directing or editing a movie, look at this!
