It's difficult to precisely put in the sheer terrible word of this movie. A totally new vocabulary will be devised to describe the complete absence of anything even remotely recognized as 'humor' or even 'entertainment' in "Rabbit Tests." So, as a small contribution to this future effort, I would like to suggest that: <br /> <br /> "Hubiriffic" (adj.) A combination of 'hubristic' and 'terrific'; used to describe ambitious disorders such as the movie "Rabbit Tests." Joan Rivers and "Hollywood Square" producer Jay Redack were seriously over-reaching in the leaner capacity to entertain in this minute festival of minors. Try to put together an airplane! style comedy and a collection of gills in gags, (Note Joan: The German Doctors were not funny since Vaudeville) disinterred from the graves of the Catskills - this is bad enough. But this cinematic crime compilation is the River's direct style, which can best be described as 'ugly', and a once-in-the-cast cast of gen-beens so eager to please overplay the even weaker in moving gags . <br /> <Direct from Sargasso to this sea of ​​SAP is a hapless Billy Crystal in his first film role as Lionel's officinal army officer. Watching Crystal in this pic is very much like watching a blind person take a stroll through a trap; Eventually the creative reflex becomes a semi-permanent condition as cheap jokes after cheap jokes up in his face. <br /> I can only speculate about the sort of audience that might actually be like rabbit testing. Cabbage, mosquitoes and leases that slowly lend to all candidates are likely. But for self-esteem, people thinking - I would highly recommend bleaching your eyes before I would recommend "Rabbit Tests."
