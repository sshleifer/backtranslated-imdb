I was excited to see a Catalu√±a movie in Berlin's competition. But after the presentation I was totally disappointed with anger. Too much blood, too much time, too much term for anything. The Hispanic Civil War, like every war, was terrible. The revenge, a very human behavior, not all beautiful, is shown in countless films and plays, as well as the relationship between homosexual and doubt in Spain on Catholicism. But what Mr. Villaronga tries to be is a pseudo tragedy that can be part of the worst movie story. It is really a pity to see Angela Molina in this movie. I advise nobody has any circumstances to go to see this movie.
