<br /> <br /> Find your brewskies out and enjoy this flicky action flick. The peculiar spectacle of the peculiar spectacle (kickbacks turn turning, decent and stick - poor couch!) Only the redeemindable quality of a movie is just crying bad acting. The plot is not half bad; just execute very badly. But if you see this film for anything other than martial arts, you will miss the ship completely. And for a movie that should take place in Koreatown, way way too few Korean actors (even extra costs).
