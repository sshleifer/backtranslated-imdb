The end of the violence and certainly the dollar million dollar hint of ideas Wenders had lost his vision, his ability to tell compelling stories in a map of the moving picture. The ground in the sealed coffin, I'm scared, not being an unimaginably really inimaginative, obviously sentimental and film-loving movie. Characters are entirely flat and stereotyped, written, the plot and directions are unprofessional, at best. For the first time in quite a while, I was impatient for the end movie so I could get on with my life. The war-torn delirium of the uncle, the patriot's heavenly shelter in the conclusion ... it all just struck me as being so simple and pathetic, hardly the work of a cinematographer who had once made some compelling magic on screen. What happened? The days of experimentation, writing acceptable and interesting filming opportunities are long after him, I'm scared. Let's hope he finds inspiration again ... At the Toronto film festival, which is where I saw the movie, Wenders had presented it. Completely lacking in humility, she offers us the following: "I hope ... no, wait ... I know you will enjoy the next two hours." I'm afraid it could not be more wrong ...
