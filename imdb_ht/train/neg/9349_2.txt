This movie was awful. I gave him the high score of 2 as I saw worse, but very few. <br /> From the start of Clich√©d ending in the movie at the beginning and going back to the beginning of the movie This movie has used everything in the box of tricks used in films to make just for the sake of , like a kid and too many toys. There was endless, boring narration of repetition, slow motion, freeze boards, recovered and merging images etc. - none of which made a dull movie anymore. It is called "16 years of alcohol", but there was little drink or drunkeness and no illustrations of withdrawal and the movie jumped all over the place with no coherent sense. The story was written wrongly and very firefighted and the direction was equally poor and it is a shame that people have been putting more money for more films by Mr Jobson, previously known for being in a garbage group and on television making sense many of this movie does. <br /> I found it a great fight to see this in the end but in the hope it found best I was wearing over in the bitter but it really was a waste of time and I would have been better Do not bother.
