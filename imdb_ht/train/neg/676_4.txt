I wanted to see it because of two reasons. One, he noticed in Sierra High and Bogart, two parts of Bogart were played by Jack Palance, who can play dramatic roles and some subtlety, as in the Big Cutter. But now I wonder why they decided to shoot this renewal. The movie follows the same scheme as Hig Sierra; Only here, the actors do not care, the director is lost in his thoughts, and knows what the producer thought. Jack Palance is getting bored of Shelley Winters and Shelley Winters looking for what he's doing in this movie. I do not even want to compare it to Ida Lupino in the same role. And of course, they used the dog story again! They probably could have come up with some different ideas. Perhaps the color makes it nice to see the place where the high Sierra shoots, but that definitely does not add any kind of movie. <br /> It's a waste of time if you've seen High Sierra before. Otherwise, why not see a pseudo-movie noir. As for me, I'd rather die than see it one more time ...
