I saw this for free, fortunately, and wanting it was much better than it was, but it's really the same old movie studio that seems to fit on us in the last ten years. <br /> <br /> Ben Stiller and Jennifer Anniston play a couple of opposites - and yet to attract each other. <br /> <br /> If this line does not take you to surprise with your thrill, the movie will not be either. > <br /> Many gags and fart jokes. Half of the movie I started to realize that Ben Stiller really is not funny, but he tries very hard. And Jennifer Anniston really is not that nice, but her hair looks great. And Hank Azaria and Phillip Seymore Hoffman must have paid a great deal of money to be in this type of average film ho-hum, I've come to expect more from them. What was interesting was that I saw this after I saw American Splendor, which is a really funny and original movie - and I compared the two in myself, and found myself wanting that the movie executives would be Forced to sit in these two movies back to back - maybe that would hit some sense of them and <br /> would begin to make better movies and unknowns rather than this formulaic formula that plays best on airplanes.
