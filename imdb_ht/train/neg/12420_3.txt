There is just not enough here. There are a few funny spots, but not really enough. I was very disappointed because I love stupid movies. I was hoping this to be a hidden gem. It was not. It was a hidden chard. <br /> <br /> The whole time I watched I thought, "Geez, I could do better than that and I'm a moron." Do not believe some good reviews. I was sacked in them. There was no point I was laughing loudly. Maybe this was funny or cut edge in 1987 but people, it fell flat today. This movie promised, it just did not deliver it. Maybe if they are rewritten a few times more. I cant the actors. They were not the best, but they just did not have much and worked. This movie has failed because it writes filial. SORELY was disappointed.
