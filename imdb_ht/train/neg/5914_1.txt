This movie is really boring. It was banned from Chinese cinema and I can see why. It's not because it's critical of the communist regime, but simply because the film is of the kind low. I would never want to pay the money to watch this. I love movies from Chen Kaige and Zhang Yimou and I am ashamed of being a poor movie could come from China. It totally seems to ignore the audience and the director seems to have made the movie for himself. The shots of a person stop doing for up to a minute are hilarious and have lots of them. The building and video quality are unbelievably bad. I watch this movie up on the Net and it looks like people actually like this movie. The only explanation I have for this is that some movie smokers think that if a movie is not in English it is automatically good. I can not see any reason why people would like that. This is not an art film in the celluloid garbage. (This if they actually shoot it on film, which they did not)
