Swayze does not make a very compelling Alan Quatermain. Compared with Stewart Granger; Growing up was my ultimate hero in films such as the 1952 "Scaramouche", 1952 "The Prisoner of Zenda" and the 1950's "Salomon's Room"; Patrick Swayze fails completely. Even the painting of a larger Alan Quatermain by Sean Connery in "League of Extraordinary Mr." was very good at a great otherwise flop. Also, Alison Doody lacks the favor of Deborah Kerr in the role of the leading lady, and last but not least the impressive Sirianque in the role of Umbopa makes it very difficult for anyone to fill him (shoes) !!! For someone who was disappointed by Richard Chamberlain's version of 1985, I now highly recommend it if you can not get your hands on the Granger version.
