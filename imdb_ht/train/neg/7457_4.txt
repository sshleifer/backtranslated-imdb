Chris Kattan is a big draw actor on Saturday night Live ... but he should probably leave the movie industry alone unless he gets some sort of creative control. It plays an annoyingly peppy character that basically comes on as glazed delay and speed. Want to know the only funny parts? The thing was shown in the forecasts. Yes, pronouncing it over me is funny. There is nothing else. SPECIAL when you can say it is trying very hard to be a physical comedy, which it should not have to try in because it is one. And yet, it 'demolish the veterinary office' bit come as cringingly bad. This movie made me develop an eye shrinkage. Avoid it at all costs, and keep watching SNL.
