I was really looking forward to this movie based on the forecasts and press it received, but after watching it I was terribly disappointed. Slums is a totally unfunny movie mixed with a kind of Todd Solondz in the disturbing family reality of Todd's humorous humor. The storytelling shooter along with each scene is worse than the last. Perhaps I miss the point, but if this movie is an example of experience the whole girl grows happy to be someone.
