The reasons for releasing DVD in this film are in black and white is because nobody can get their hands on a color printing in this public domain movie, a modest sea story at best. <br /> Distributed for TV to the Allied Artists, the DVD (or VHS) market at the moment for this title all comes from the same 16MM TV printed. Films distributed for television before 1963 were often distributed in b / w imagery, because the bulk of viewers did not have to color anyway. Hit b / w imagery for TV was also cheaper, as it often involves quite a few imagery to cover all stations running a movie on a symbolic basis.
