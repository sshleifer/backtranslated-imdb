First of all let me say that I thought so much about writing a comment for this movie. The best revision for this kind of cinema can be just the silence. Movies addressed to Menager and Grandmothers. This movie tries to look "genuine" and the characters should be "real people". An Italian can never think that the characters might be "real": they are just "low-profile" stereotypes. It gives a very misguised vision of what life is in the Italian country. The weak conspiracy (draw? Which draws?) And the humor does not make anyone laugh more than 12.
