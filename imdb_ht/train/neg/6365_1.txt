Wow, I knew this movie was going to be bad but not bad. Spoilerific reviews mean. Roddy Roddy Piper is slowly retired cop (cliché!), Helping everyone - smile as a lobotomy post-op-patient lobotomy patient and lamenting about his dead offspring. His adopted child came from the Armed Forces "Special Ops" and because he "saw things" - presented by spitting his teeth if someone mentioned anything about the past. Time to clear the streets from another guy who once knew Piper and his dead son (which the bad boy killed) and his adopted son. <br /> Oh, the love interest is a beautiful young lady who decides that there is no reason to want to skip the bones of the former-Army block. This occurs within 2 minutes of 1 stage. <br /> <br /> The action could save this movie, but it's even worse than the storyline and act. It all was done before, it was all done much better (Ong-Bak is an example first). This is the worst movie I've ever seen - and I've seen Waterworld, twice. <br /> <br /> Erm, the movie is called HONOR (Spell bad for the Americans) and the tag line has "musicians of Bloodsport and Kickboxer" - check out David Worths director of other films and you'll soon realize why Put these 2 films on, even if they are over 10 years old. These classic acts as "Assault 3: Megalodon" - tell it all really. <br /> I'll give you £ 10 if you do not go to see this movie. <br /> <br /> PS - Make excuses for not knowing the character, tell you something though.
