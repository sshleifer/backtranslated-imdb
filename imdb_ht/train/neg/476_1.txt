When converting a movie book, it is generally a good idea to hold at least some of the author's intended concept or concept, rather than ignoring the author altogether. While it was clear that the director had access to it, she went on the advice of Elinore Stewart's kids, it is the key to remembering that the children believed their mothers to be a complete liar to consider good, enriching, strengthening the country's homesteading experience li. The book details her life on her and her homesteads adjoining her husband in the vast Wyoming vast; It reads daily adventures with many friends and acquaintances, though they lived dozens of miles apart. The film, however, takes a standard position for the time it has made, shows this woman's experience as harsh, unforgiving, and almost pointless. Maybe the director carried some of his Vietnam War experience with him in this movie (as some movie directors said), but it seems to be a disgusting excuse to take all the joy and beauty of the book and twist it into a weak, detective landscape devoid of friends or hope. Do not waste your time with this movie; read the book instead.
