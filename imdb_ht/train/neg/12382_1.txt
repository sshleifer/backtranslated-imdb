Spencer Tracy and Katherine Hepburn would roll over to their graves if they knew this guess who came to Dine Rip Off was actually in the theater. Together with Sidney Poitier and Katherine Houghton these brilliant four actors made a great cultural statement with the 1967 Master Stanley Kramer. This present day rip off is a joke. So a white guy comes from a terrible Italian stereotype in Rhode Island to bring home his African American girlfriend (Enter GASP here) finerly old father. Reaction to her family members was of course .... predictable. This film was so painstaking telegraph from start to finish my girlfriend actually started fraying for my signal that she wanted to leave. Make yourself a favor and the original rent. Take a Pass on Wake.
