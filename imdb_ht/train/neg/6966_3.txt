This film is a mess, but at least it's not pretentious. The art of boxing for the video markets as a "throwback fun" in the 1950s giant insect movies. In fact, it is a transparent bargain basement ripoff of "Foreign". Producers are clearly willing to make a "ALIEN" photo, but they should not have much money. In fact, it does not seem to have had any money, really. I hope everyone pays who worked on this stuff. <br /> <br /> Draw the dual core - group of isolated individuals and animals insectoid killers - and a landbound place is element for budgetary purposes, I assume. Instead of putting the movie in space, where no one can hear you cry, they put the movie in a hospital, where everyone can see the budget you wear. The fun thing about "Blue Monkey" (and there is only one thing that's fun about) is, the filmmakers did not abandon the "foreign" aesthetics. Even though we are in a hospital, we still have an incredible cavernous app where science fiction experiments are conducted, in this case the revered "hormone growth" tracing device. The attachment also doubles as a heating room (or something), so we can have an explanation for the monster looking for the heat. The pan's boiler is so great that it is lined with reduced multi-bearing steel, perfect for allowing the slip slides down between the slats. The idea is that a man working in a greenhouse is attacked by a crumbling flower from a rare import plant that grows in an exotic place. He touched it and said "Ow", so we know he was hurt. The cut on her fingers caused her to err in the knowledge of a matter of minutes, and at the hospital she gave birth to a white worm in her mouth (I guess in a photo "ALIEN" this would call the "mouthburster"?). The isolated worm, but some naughty little children (leukemia patients) sneak up and "accidentally" give it some experimental growth hormone. You know everyone in trouble when some hospital staff workers are attacked by a camera on a technique, and very soon a maintenance person finds some required cocoon, right before it was taken by a pair of semi to persuade insectoid arms. The rest of the film dominated by the semi-offscreen monster, semi-hidden in the semi-darkness. <br /> <br /> Which brings us back to "alien". How, do you ask, can a movie put in a hospital incorporate all those flashing light Strobe that are still in the "Alien" movies? No matter ... a blackout (or something) causes the electrical system to go awaken, apparently causing light Strobe flowers in every room in the hospital and constantly quivers across the movie. This duplicates as a practical dress for the less-than-special effects (although the bugs are very clean looking, they do not move too well, and the small bug looks charmingly like a cootie toy). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Check ... we will divide the massive hospital in two parts, then send some of the characters in the wet, drippy basement to get to the other side. Problems have been solved, now we have the opportunity for many "foreboding tunnels" vaccine. And do not forget to fog ... well, did you never really need an excuse for this in your horror movies, or you? OK, maybe inside a hospital you do, so we will create smoke there are not many things to burn and burn. <br /> I have not said anything about the negligible act, not that the actors are giving any kind of script to follow. I took it "Blue Monkey" was supposed to be frustrating and fun, and if so then it is a nice try, but the pieces do not come along with the movie to finish up being a real drag. See a movie called "The Return of the Aliens: The Deadly Spawn" if you want to see a movie of this kind that gets it right, with even less money and even more marginal acting talent. This one falls flat on its Alien.
