After reading the reviews, it became evident that everyone intellectualized this work. How completely boring. Oh how about ol 's days are good and there was nothing like it. In all the comments no one expresses any emotions in this work or any other. <br /> I grew up just after the end of the steam age and this gem cinema along with Dan'l Boone honored the afternoon Saturday morning. This was an annual film that made the rounds with full chairs and gabbing, yapping, farting, giggling, snotty monsters like myself or tea-self. And it was a movie theater filler at the time. Almost big as the Oz Wizard. <br /> <br /> IMDb insists that all critics have something about the draw. The problem was that it was rather a model. Here's gone. Randolph Scott (cowboy / hero) gathers friends and goes to beat people wrong. Hooray! <br /> <br /> All of us kids calculated that plot before we plunk our quarter down to look at it. That was just the line drawn to each Scott, John Wayne, Roy Rogers movie ever made. If you take time to return and review each movie - just do not ask for surprises. <br /> One must remember the context of the times. There was no TV or little. None for kids. There were schools. There were great outdoors. There were guns games. No Cyber ​​Time. And the steam age was just collapsed. But movies like this give the entertainment and full of fantasies of young whippersnappers. Even the girls went into it. <br /> <br /> This movie was the entertainment. And it's just as mindless as anything that produces today. He had an original purpose for propaganda. But soon became movie theater. <br /> <br /> Our ancestors have experienced the real thing. And it should not be until Sam Peckinpah a decade later that ultimately pretend to fly the red blood in imitation of realistic and opulent numbers. Not until his direction made anyone dead slowly, with great pain and pity. Until Peckinpah wars and battle weapons were a matter of blood blood. Thanks Sam. <br /> To see a movie there was little blood or no blood, the adults did not mind. They would not tolerate it I think. No guts spray the broken life. So, this movie was all in the glory and none of the gory. Gung Ho would be appropriate for kids then. <br /> You will see that I assigned a card to this rating. Why would I do that? Well. It's a terrible movie. No matter how I love it. I love this movie because it has brought back one of the happiest moments in my childhood. But not all that is good in a movie of quality terms. Basically Gung Ho transmitted to become a novel romance for children. <br /> <br /> Should people look at it. Of course. I do not say far away. Realization however. The plot is simple. Character fonts? they are shoals. You can love a bad movie.
