I rarely write comments for IMDb.com, but I feel obligated to warn potential viewers that this film is awful. Just awful. I love Shaw Bros. Movies (I'm not a hater.), And I had great hope for this one since I found it listed on many "10 Best Koun Fu / Martial Arts Movies" websites. (I'm now convinced that these 10 Best Lists are all off-and-paste jobs.) First of all, there's barely any action in the movie. Most of the movie consists of talking about the plot, which is an amazing feat because it's the best thinner. And the action itself may have been impressive back in 1978, but it's routine by today's standards. A special Netflix user warning: The pirate DVD is terrible; The picture is horrendous and does not even 16: 9 reinforce.
