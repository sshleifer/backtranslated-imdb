Some friends-recommended "Live Feed" me, and basically I can not really complain as the movie certainly delivers grossly copious amounts and buckets full of sleaze, but it is of course not a very good movie. More than obviously cashing on the latest trend in horror movies, the so-called Porn Porn, Ryan Nicholson tries to surpass every other film in this genre sub (and includes the role models "Hostel" and "Saw") and His illness and tightness make-up and well-off shots in all co-eds have tried to lift, suffering and begging for their lives. There is no real scheme to describe. Five absolutely brains twenty-something friends take a trip to Asia. One of them has Asian roots, but other than what I do not really know why they are traveling there is instead of Cancun. They are clearly not interested in the continent culture and even cause a hustle scene by witnessing a local butcher's dog puppy on the market. Quintet immediately immersed in the lurid night life and one of them accidentally insulted the leader of a criminal family. An apology is simply not enough, as the gangster follows them in an adult theater and gradually subjects all of them vicious torture. A girl has breastfed her and another poor pig even has a poisonous snake pushing her throat; yikes. "Live Live" is surprisingly boring despite the bloodshed and amateur production values ​​are quite difficult to neglect, even though you're used to watch independent film-boy movie movies like this. The wet fat show on the cover, a S & M executive bra, is quite cool and it's also the most talented of the whole bunch, because it at least keeps its mouth closed all the time. I would not exactly recommend this pile of scratch, but hey, if you love loud & horrible metal music, nauseating tortoise feet and dim-fitted losers, go right ahead and watch!
