This film has a great cast for her: Christopher Lee, Dean Jagger, Macdonald Carey, Lew Ayres - solid actor b-movie all. But this Downer in a movie did not use any of them to any sort of advantage, and none of the same characters on screen (though Christopher Lee found to play opposite himself in several scenes). The motivations for the aliens in this movie seem to change in the drop of a hat. First, they just want to repair their ships and leave, then they turn on the main character does not kill most of his friends and does not leave his wife after he gets to the crucial part of the need. Then, from nowhere, this "peaceful" race decided to destroy the planet because it caused too much "illness" (even if the main character and his wife offered a place in society). /> Most of the movie spent watching the man and wife driving or walking or standing in or sitting at the office that did nothing. You almost want to be taken out and the rest of the planet in the end, just to revenge for our boring to death. <br /> <br /> Unless you really love Chris Lee or sixty little-budget Sci-Fi, I would give this one a miss. It falls in this series of narrow cellulose wasted between Star Odyssey and UFO: Earth Target.
