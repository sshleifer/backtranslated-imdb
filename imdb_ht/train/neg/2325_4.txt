The scanners at first could not have been a big movie, but at least it was original.there no this one gift. The acting act worse, in my opinion, and the story is slower and nothing special .and also did not like the dialogue.Help the special effects are not better than the original. This film is inferior to the first one in every way. The only different purpose on it is that it is loud and chaotic at times.but did not make a good movie.if they did something better with the story and it made it interesting, this could be a movie.i decent actually could not get into it all without they are not fast transmitted through it.to me, this is a forgettable movie, and no more. In all, there is worse sinema.being in a generous mood, I'll give scan 2 a 4/10.
