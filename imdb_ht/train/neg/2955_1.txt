Poor Whoopi Goldberg. Imagine him at a party's dinner party, and adds a comment to in-depth discussion of politics going on. People just look at it and say, "Oh what you would know, you were the star of 'Theodore Rex'". How could someone take it seriously after falling down to be the star of this awesome piece of crap? Even small children should cringing into the horror of this stuff. He reminds me of a particularly bad episode of 'Sigmund and the Sea Monsters'. Actually, come to think of it, 'Sigmund' was largely superior. <br /> But, however, did he get made? Do not bend the producer with an illegal substance before saying it to him? Look at this horrible abomination of your own dangers.
