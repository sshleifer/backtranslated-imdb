I saw this movie back when it premiered. <br /> It's based on the notion that autism kids can communicate with typing-out messages and someone else simply help them and guide their hands. <br /> </ p> <p> At this time, many of them did not even observe the keyboard or screen when messages were typed out (they could stand up to the ceiling in some cases), but the keynote eyes stuck on the keyboard, started typing abuse messages from parents and others, sending parents and child welfare agencies to a tizzy puzzle, left and right. <br /> <br /> This all has proved an illusion when a third person introduced a folder and opened it to the child, saying 'the type of photo you see', then as presenter To turn the keypad folder, a fold might fall down, revealing another different picture. Children can see a dog, the keynote saw something like a pirate. <br /> Each time, every time bloom, the name of the taped picture is that the keynote was observed, never what the child was shown. <br /> So who did the typo? Never the child. <br /> This film further took a disaster turn and, as Australia's poster states, people who molested the child in the movie were in the situation trying to help the child. <br /> There was Melissa Gilbert never put his son in this place, he would not molest, the movie says. He was best under his supervision. If I turn my kid to your organization for help and it gets me instead, do you think I'll be keen to listen to anything you have to say afterwards? Not Likely! I think it's a safe bet that all of these messages allegations that these kids have been typing out, which was based on this movie, have never accused anyone of their operations as being taken place here. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, I remember that the movie gave a very good performance to Gilbert as the mother in an autism, but other than that, the movie really did not do much. <br /> <br /> The worst by far the child was thrilling at the end of Patty Duke, and we heard the mechanical voice it turned out. . . . . "We won!" This child was sick. If you cut my leg and I take you to court, and you are found guilty of damaging me, assault, whatever, then that is legal justice, but it does not bring my legs back. Best, in my condition, I'll see it as a hollow victory. <br /> Regardless of the likelihood of this child was in what is perceived as the autonomy and autonomy alone is more damaging to the molestation. <br /> <A normal childhood is enough to support such an experience. It is absolutely superficial to think that you must look at any situation and go 'we won' if this person is found guilty in the court. <br /> Just a bad touch of a situation and circumstances all the way around here.
