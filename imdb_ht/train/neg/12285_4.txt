The scenario is absurd and lame, also sucks their performance with the dialogue, is hard to keep your eyes open. I advise you have a caffeine-launched handy friend to wake you in time for a gore-effect couple.Why to bring the Alcatraz? In this case, becoming increasingly difficult to swallow. All the time I wonder which movie is aiming for? Chock full of lame subplots (like the US Army-Captain Cannibalism) This is low-grade in all aspects. This is the film prohibited in Germany!
