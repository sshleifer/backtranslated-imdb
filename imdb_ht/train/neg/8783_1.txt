I do not think I've ever been so thrown on by the sheer absurdity of a movie of my whole life as I was when I walked out of this piece of crap. NO in it makes any sense. None of it is smart or well thought out. From the moment of the really suspended moment they repeatedly use the total de-out trick where you build the music before the character does something like opening a door or pushing aside a curtain and then there's nothing there. That OK wants to do once, maybe, but I count three times. there are things thrown in for no reason, characters, half lines formed line .... the characters were not well developed at all. The end was bad .. bad, bad, bad, everything, every element, in this movie is terrible. and I'm just here to tell you all that.
