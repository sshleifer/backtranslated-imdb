This film is interested in me as the DVD rental lecture. However, the resulting film is absolutely terrifying! Admittedly, this is not the worst movie ever made, or the worst film this year, but it has become damn shut! <br /> <br /> The main problem is the movie does not know what he wants to be: comedy, adult drama, thriller, teen porn? The story is interesting, as it deals with the pitfalls of mail-bride orders, but the movie is a mess. What starts as an interesting "comedy" (one word I use in the loosest possible terms), then goes totally in reverse, and degenerates into a dark and unpleasant misogynistic thriller. Nicole Kidman should know better, and Ben Chaplin is wasting! As they are Matthieu Kassovitz and Vincent Cassel, whom I can only assume for the money. <br /> This is a bad movie of pretty much every single aspect. It's not funny, it's almost sexist that you could almost forgive Benny Hill for everything he did, and the dramatic elements are just outright embarrassing. A movie should be avoided, unless you absolutely have to see Kidman or Chaplin in each one of their films!
