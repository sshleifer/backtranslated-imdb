I usually support independent art and I try to be very comprehensive and tolerant ... I tend to support everyone, because efforts are worth ... but this movie just moves away from all understanding and tolerance limits! <br /> Imagine this situation: <br /> <br /> 1. Think about the movie movie movie you've ever seen in your life so far. <br /> 2. Think about some great, attractive ART for this DVD movie box ... with a promising scheme ... <br /> 3. Voil√†! you got ZOMBIE NATION. <br /> <br /> See it only if you really have nothing else to do. ANYONE is best.
