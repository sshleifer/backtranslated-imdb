It's incredible that it succeeds in being awful on many levels. The script, acting, directing and choosing to throw them all upright. The costumes, lying down and pseudo-medieval languages ​​are also quite awful. In an odd way I actually liked this movie, once I had accepted that he was not going to do any good. It seems a shame that people would spend a lot of time and effort producing something so poor, when really they could do something very decent from the quotation (albeit not very credible!), But instead we are treated to a rather tense and cheesy stories of dragons and riders, missing any of the charms to be found in other such fantasy films. Let's just hope that the Lord of the Rings is a bit better! Oh, and David Thewolf 'head she looks like He-Man. It does!
