For the great thinkers among us, the "Intruder" is a maddeningly incoherent film from France that gives so-called "movie art" a bad name. The story is something about a bitter bit, Louis Trebor (Michel Subor), who goes to Tahiti for a heart transplant, but beyond that, I have no idea that any of the people in the movie of being or why they did what they did. With no coherent storyline to boast, the movie loses early, though I'm gonna want to admit that SOMEBODY might be out there that actually gets some deepest messages from this movie. This muddled, snail-rhythm drama runs a full two-hour and five minutes - though I seriously doubt anyone and any kind of life is still hanging around by the closed credit.
