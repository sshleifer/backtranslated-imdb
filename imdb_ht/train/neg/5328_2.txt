Susan Seidelman seems to have had a decent career with a few top creditors under her belt. I certainly glad she bounced back from this movie that seems to have its admirers. I'm not one of them. <br /> I've seen better acting in high school than I did in Smithereens. The plot as it involves young Susan Berman is ambitious to make it into the world of music and is willing to do just about anything to get there. He even rejects the sincere gains of a young artist who lives out of his wind on the East River played by Brad Rijn. <br /> <br /> Young Mr. Rijn contributes the worst performance of the movie, in fact one of the worst acts I've seen in a long time. No wonder he did not go anywhere. <br /> I'm going to say that Seidelman's eyes for the camera are a good thing to capture places that are accustomed to East Village where the film was mostly shot. But his work and live performers did not measure. I'm not sure he's got raw materials to work with. <br /> Look fast and you will see a very young Christopher Nose before the Law and Order and Sex in the City as a street hustler. br /> <br /> If you like Rock Punk, you can sit in this for the band. I'm going to stick to Bing Crosby.
