I do not know what this film is about, really. It's like the student's art school project. They never tell why the world is black, but it's still dark except for a day. There are long, interrupting insect bites of all kinds for no reason. What little dialogue there is in the movie is as insane and idle as the images. A black woman enters the apartment to the main character. Somehow she gets pregnant overnight, then gets shot in the head. The main character cares for the body until it gets a cocoon after a white naked woman results. I've never been so blown away by how bad and pointless a movie can be. Honestly, I would like someone to look at him so they can tell me what they think it's about. But I would not want this level of hell on anybody else.
