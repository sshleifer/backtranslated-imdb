I did not feel as though I would have been violated as I did with CHRISTMAS ENCHANTED, but the MAGIC BELLE world is always the antithesis of BEAUTY AND THE BEAUTY. Like CHRISTMAS, BMW hates its audience, although not as an extreme degree. It's ugly, uncanonical, idiotic, and the writing is terrible bad.One of the work history. These are not the characters we loved from BATB at all, they are a bunch of pods. I wanted to dissect it, but after a few minutes, I gave up, because no one in right mind would take this claptrap seriously. What we have here are three stories. "The perfect word" is a ponderous study of forgiveness. "The Folly Fifi" works only if you can accept the name of Babette's actually Fifi and that she's a James Bond villainess and that Lumiere is a fool person about women. "Broken Wings" (or "Broken Van" as I like to call it) is probably the most passionate of the bunch. Animals Hated Birds? For how long? Do not watch this crap-each copy of this video deserves to be creamy. BEAUTY AND THE BEAST is still a classic cinemas, a transcendental celebration of love, art, intelligence and the human soul.
