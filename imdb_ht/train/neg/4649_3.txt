A 1957 (yes, is the correct date) J. Arthur Rank production with James Robertson Justice, Margaret Rutherford, Wilfred Hyde White; Does it have to be a comedy break, right? Oh, it's just awful. It's a gay movie one: watching people be shocked at the sight of a little cayman. The music is thrown in, worst and forgettably. Jeannie Carson is a lively and competing singer. But what did he do in this movie? Diana Dors is here too, giving oh-so-nana shots for use in the forecasts. Level acting it is not bad, but it's in the movie to give someone a puppy. Well, one must do something around the scenes during this movie. This film was sold on VHS now by people on and off. Spend your spending and waste time. A comedy without a laugh. A music without a memorable or dance song.
