This film comes as the final disappointment of Tsai Ming-Liang for me. It oozes laziness from its every frame. So I will not analyze it properly either. But some observations: <br /> <br /> 1. If the site is drought, why do we get to see the city's landscapes and blooming green trees? I wonder if this was supposed to mean something in the metaphorical context of the film (in which thirsty notified the craving for intimacy, and trivial substitute melons, sex). Or it's just a matter of disgusting film-making, not giving a damn about being coherent. <br /> 2. We do not find out what happened to porn actress, why it is unconscious or, presumably, dead. It looks like a question that does not matter as long as the message of Supreme alienation is successfully (= boldly) delivered, but in retrospect, its latent body proves a cheap dramaturgical GIMMIK, an excuse? just as freeware and exploitation as the activity it is working in. There is nothing expressed in this film that Antonioni has not expressed best 40 years ago ?? and without useless humiliating actor. <br /> 4. The music numbers (reclamated from the 'hole') felt like a high school idea of ​​artistic controversy, executing on the very high-school levels of competence. If so, the point was sucked.
