If John Waters had written and directed "House of 1000 Corpses" after being hit on the head repeatedly with a heavy object, the result would probably be something like "blood flow." It's mildly fun for the first half hour, but then it slips into a sort of glow featureless at constant screaming with people doing things each genitalia other with crazy electric knives, cutters and skins. Susan Adriensen (Sno Cakes) is extremely aggressive and Terry West (Elvis Bullion) is almost as bad as it is done in the front of the camera. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the best thing about the "blood flow" is that it will not take most viewers very long to forget about it.
