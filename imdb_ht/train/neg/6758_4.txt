Well possibly the beautiful woman in show business, with the sexiest, Debbie gives another fine performance here. Although his work in Indian nightmare was far superior, it is still worth watching in this movie. <br /> <br /> The cast is filled with type of Melrose type, features chicken and seduction curves, which I have never seen before. Other than Debbie, Laura Nativo was the only actress I've seen before, the same Delta Delta dies. <br /> <br /> Draw the centers around a group of expansive California that starts poor Naughif Debbie Rochon in the clicks. They say that they have a murder club, and that he must kill someone to be accepted. Debbie wants nothing more, but must be accepted by these cool people, so he quickly kills someone, and now the group must decide what to do with it, after it's dropped to jokes. $$$$ (abundant! Debbie Rochon occasionally has blood splattered all over it and all the killers are doing in your face .. Gore Best will surely enjoy!) <br /> NODITY: $$$$$ (Debbie Rochon also has several nude scenes as many of the actresses and actors do not have their names.The pool party looks like an excuse to get all naked, male and female alike .. Julie Strain also has a topless cannon but the character goes away after the first five minutes) <br /> <br /> History: $$ (might receive a higher vote because the plot was very interesting and unique, but the plot served as filler between naked scenes. B-Rate film uses stripping frequently, but this is too much bordline). <br /> <br /> ACTING: $ (Acting is the sub standard to say at least the ... Rochon is still in Reyak, the easiest B-Rate actress in the business today, but her character at U.S. Nightmares Superior Danny Wolske does a good job as debbie objects in lust but other actors have nothing to write about).
