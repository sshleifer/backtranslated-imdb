To call a movie about a hamstring ghost to take revenge from beyond the tidal grave and the dead would be too ironic but this here is an undeniable combination of instability at GASLIGHT (1939 & 1944) via LES DIABOLIQUES (1954); While still alert to himself, it's so cliche-eating dog as to induce chuck instead of the thrills intended. However, thanks to the desert directions that the British film industry found itself in the late 1970s, even a script like this one could attract 10 star names - Cliff Robertson (like the husband combining), Jean Simmons (in title role), Jenny Agutter (as a half artist Robertson sister), Simon Ward (as Enigmatic Driver), Ron Moody (as a sick-sick doctor), Michael Jayston (as Robertson's business partner), Judy Geeson (as Simmons 'best friend and Jayston's wife), Flora Robson (like the Housekeeper), David Tomlinson (like Simmons' Reading Notary) and, most likely, Jack Warner (as a Sculptor Sculptor) - although most of them actually nothing does, I'm sorry to say!
