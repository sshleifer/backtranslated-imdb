I consider myself to be extremely saddened, especially when I watch a great and touching-earthquake movies. But not for this one (which surprised me!) And it is also really surprising to see how many people praise this movie very much. <br /> There are several disturbing facts in all the films: 1. Although sin - Ben's real intentions to save lives 7 to redeem last, I find it disturbing that the film seems to promote this type of action commit suicide. Some people can see this is a heroic action and some people think it behaves well, at the end of this was a disturbing act for me. The film story line is over-dramatized, but the logic is over-simplified. Medically, matching blood type is an organ organ. At the end of the film we learned that Emily was the kind of blood behind that limiting her luck to give the donor in short periods of time. But it seemed that Ben had some unusual blood type, as he allowed him to be his donor with a good, despite the rarity of Ben's blood type, he could donate not only his heart, but also his kidney, corn and bone marrow, which in all cases require not only matching blood type, but also antigen tissue. Why did the doctors allow Ben's organs to be administered despite the fossils used to kill themselves? I could pass-analyze the whole story as after all this is just a movie. However, some disturbing facts described above hopefully will help you to reconsider your plan to go to this movie. If you go for a kind of soap opera movie, go for it. But it you are looking for a smart entertainment, give this one a miss!
