When you go to an open air movie night in Greek summer you usually do not care what the movie is! Edison started really good with some good efforts of the musician-who-want-to-be-a-once and a great once again Morgan Freeman but ... (In a movie there is often a good start to catch audiences, a bit boring yet story to complete the middle of the movie which is more about characters and less about action, make, and the third part is something really good so that you can remember the movie ...) when you see 30 elite police officer (charged with weapons that can demolish a building) shot at a guy behind a car, fail to hit him even once he killed all (but 3) and then the guy took out a flame thrower (to kill the rest 3), you realize that the Greek sky summer filled with stars is way too good to be distracted by a movie like this!
