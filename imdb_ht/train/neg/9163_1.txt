Star-age years are some heavy drivers in the local and regional film and TV shows. And yet, they can not save this movie. He has a lot of things that will be against him - over acting, overly melodramatic, poor script, consistent direction; and too few things go for it - decent music, good movies. This comment is especially for anyone who launches all the local movies in one basket after watching this movie and tells all the local movie bad. Please do not judge the rest based on this one movie. This is a TV saturated TV saturated mask as a romantic romantic movie. Hope I was high when I bought my ticket and hoped I was five minutes in the movie shooter.
