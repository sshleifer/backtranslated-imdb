Earlier today I entered into an argument about why many people complain about modern films in which I encounter a curious statement: "The character development of the movie is far less than almost as good or interesting as it used to be." Depending on the movie (s) in question, this can be attributed to a number of things, sometimes generic special effects and draw-driven hollywood garbage like war in the world, but in the top-to-head case, Effective attempts at social sounds and a desperate struggle to put "art" back to movies, it's like movies that dog dogs are blaming. <br /> <br /> I normally have a very high tolerance for movies, no matter how dull or useless to find them (from good to those who have long been like Andrei Rublev and Dogville, to those whom I have considered hurt to sit in an Alfa dog and wild Wild West). I close this movie in 45 minutes, which is 30 minutes more than I actually should have. I was not interested in any of the characters any and found nothing remarkably beyond a thin veil of pessimism. In an attempt to say something about the dizings of society, this film is too easy to fall into being independent, frank, and exploited in a very sincere sense. Granted, I have seen many disturbing movies on the same subject, but there are many best films out there on depressions, pathetic people (Early, Gummy, Kids, Sounds, Storytelling, Irrevocable) that actually have characters of great emotional and personal depth. Dog day was no more than a graduate role in the Eighth for society, choosing ignoring any true intelligence on the way people actually are, and instead choosing to be a tantrum, awful, and hopelessly attempting attempt at a job at "art." This is not a characterization of the gender or a smart observation of the dialects of society, it's just boring and nothing worth caring about.
