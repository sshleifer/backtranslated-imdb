The Cowboys could leave you a little hurt in the device. Definitely not one of the best Johns movies. Do not get me wrong, and any Wayne move Wayne always has some good spots. And this one has it's just sharing. But all the pictures move slowly and just do not live up to the aspirations he could. Bruce Dern again does an outstanding job as the villain. Roscoe Lee Brown is another bright spot in the movie. Children in the movie were average but could be cast better. This would be a good movie for the eight to fifteen year old movie visitors. <br /> <br /> This should be a good family moving to watch with your kids. Just be aware, there are a couple of scenes that you may want to take a look before you let the teens see it. But most kids I know who saw the movie like it. Maybe it's because they get to see the kids age to make all the work grow.
