Show this not smart. That's basically what it nails down to. The "original humor" these writers try to pull down to avoid completely biting into the rest of the bashing boot world is just unfunny. In another comment, someone quotes a hilarious couple line. The superior for me was George H.W. Bush told the kids that they did not suppose watching TV in addition to Fox News. Wow. I thought the episodes I saw were bad. The fact that this line is a high point for the series is sad. <br /> My problem with drivel like this sad excuse for political satir is that as they get a second season. I am a liberal Republican and I know Bush was not a good president. We all do. But this does not have any excuse to expel this waste completely poopie in time. I put those writers on the same level as the genius behind 'Meet the Spartans'. The formulas, biting into as many jokes as already as you can and throw in material even worse actually actually can afford yourself writing credits. Again, just plain bad. Unfunny, and it just makes me more and more happy that crap like this is renewed, but amazing and original shows such as arresting their development in boxes after 3 solid season. Please do not watch this crap, unless you're one of those green scenes without hippie liberals who think that any phrases with the words Bush and Mute are comedy gold. <br /> Oh, and the voice of Bush sucks. All he does is slightly emulate a Texan accent, and exhale really hard at the end of his sentence. At least South Park admits that they are not accurate. If you want funny political satire, watch daily show / Colbert. Or look for any policy drawing on Robot Chicken, which is fun to watch, since the movement's activities stop face action is incredibly well done. Look for George Bush as a small Thursday on youtube.
