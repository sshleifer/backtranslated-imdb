As a spiritual and non-Christian. I thought I really was going to keep up my faith, but what a charge I seers. I thought the movie would have great argument, but only had one sided opinion of atheists and Jews ??? With that all those streets it's interviewing who does not know the back of the arms from their heads. Where the theological are appropriate and priestly and things he could have received argument from. No black retirees have written the books and have finished their studies in 1970. Personally, this DVD was a waste of time and not worth my time to check if the facts are good or wrong or I should or should not believe because an anti-Christ told me so. Please think that he came to the conclusion of not finding God because his own ego and evil spirits got the best of him. No im will not tell the stunning movie to help eat this reading feel better about themselves. But if you really want to show the world you care about us poor souls who believe in Jesus then entrust us with your worth, do not beat you on the drums.
