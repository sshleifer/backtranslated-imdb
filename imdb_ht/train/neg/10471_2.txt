Well honestly, the Omega Code is the worst movie I've seen in a very long time. During the first 30 minutes I was seated in my seat, trying to decide if I should ask for a refund. But since I was not paid to see it in the first place (last), I figured I might as well stay. And I did not think he could possibly get any worse. <br /> She did. I will quickly run at the low points (include some spoilers): The terrible museum at Casper Van Dien as Gillen Lane, a motivational speaker and two PhDs. The characterization was consistent; for example, Lane, despite his eligibility, is a complete succession. Then there is to be the proper sense of the fulfillment of the biblical prophecies; we see a bunch of sensational news outlets accompanied by ridiculous printing press rid of the Bible translation code. Also, awful "action" sequence: Lane escapes from difficult situations without explanation, and the lane once actually seems in danger, it seems to be a sequel to dreams! This is beautiful for grammar school writing, but it's an unplanned trace device in a motion picture. The rally was bad: after a long box, the first part of the movie changed the scene every 90 seconds. And the rhythm is improved, but there are still so far too much to jump around. And as someone else mentions, last year there is not one (not even young Lane) of age. That was discouraged. <br /> There are some good things, though. The quality of the film (such as lack of seeds) is high and very attractive. The outdoors vaccine was well done and shot in place added a touch of realism. Also, there is a moment in the last part of the movie when God asks God (finally) to help Him - this proved quite exhilarating - even for me, someone who does not accept Jesus as a personal Savior. But I loved this because it struck me as only the genuine scene of the movie. Unfortunately, it was followed by greater incomprehensibility. <br /> <br /> Characters, dialogues, directions and acts are ALL wrong done. Michael Ironside had nothing to do, and Michael York was just weird. I think the producers wanted to do too much; If the plot was tightened and more focused, with the characterization more fleshed out, the film would have been far better. <br /> <br /> In a nutshell, the omega code disappears. Definitely not paid to see this. I give it ** out of ten stars. <br /> <br />
