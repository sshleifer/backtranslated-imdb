First, give you some idea of ​​my taste in movies ... <br /> <br /> 2007 comedy I enjoyed: Superbad, knocking up, hot fuzz, blade of glory <br /> <br /> 2007 Comedy I Hated: Evan Almighty, Solomon's Saloon, Good Chuck Chuck <br /> I should have followed my first instinct and turned "Hot Rod" after I got over the 20 minute mark I knew at that point that this film would not make me laugh at once. The script is absolutely brutal - I have no idea how this monstrosity managed to crack 6 on IMDb. Any one over 10 years of enjoyment of this must have a kind of mental defect. This does not come near anything with Will Farrell and it is clear that Andy Samberg can not bring anything longer than a 5 to 10 minutes on YouTube or SNL. I do not know how to roped Ian McShane and Isla Fisher to make this film ... they must have been favored or something. I came to know that it would be a dumb movie, but I thought it would at least be funny. I did not much as smirk. <br /> I do not normally comment on movies in IMDb, but this was so awful, I just warned people. That's just the 4th film I've seen that I felt compelled to 1/10.
