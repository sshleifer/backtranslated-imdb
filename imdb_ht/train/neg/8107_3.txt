This film is quite boring. There are exercises throughout the body in an attempt to blame the viewer to wake but they do not succeed. <br /> <br /> The best thing about the movie is Lena Olin - it does a masterful task to touch her character, but Jou Lewis chooses most of his line. <br /> <br /> Kaufman clearly had no idea how to film this. The pitfalls of bouncing between domestic home / marriage issues and political crisis are seriously matched. Character attitudes change without explanation at all. Slowly.
