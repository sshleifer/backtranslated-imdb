Greetings, can all people hear me? I do not know why you got to this page, but if you're a fellow viewer in this movie: join the fanclub! This movie was so unbelievably bad I could not stop laughing when I saw it. I think it's a must see, it's bad in a nice way. Each cliche ever invented for a horror movie can be seen here. I'm afraid it's very difficult to get a copy of this movie, but it should be in the top 10 of the worst movie ever made.
