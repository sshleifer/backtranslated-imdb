Let's be honest here: the only reason anyone who bought this, the only reason anyone reviews this, and the only reason anyone can possibly claim to enjoy this is because David Lynch has done it and because you want to have the kids David Lynch. But guess what? Even David Lynch can produce a piece of crap. <br /> <br /> Perhaps Lynch wanted you to surpass the accuracy and experience of absurdity in itself as a pure topic. Perhaps atrocious, cacophonist sounds, and visual-visuals are supposed to mean something about the humanity's place in the world, about our relationship with the real estate, about the absurdity of it all. <br /> Rather, it just says one thing for me: I just lost $ 20. If I wanted offensive for offensive relief, I could acquire Hansen on high and leave my ears bleeding. If I wanted absurd for absurdity, I could just take a dump on a plate and look at that for 33 minutes. <br /> There is only one kind of royalty in Dumbland - it's meta, funny meta. That is, it is so bad that it is not even funny because it's so bad. This fact, however, is a little funny. <br /> If you hate yourself and hate your money, then buy Dumbland. If not, resolve yourself the agon.
