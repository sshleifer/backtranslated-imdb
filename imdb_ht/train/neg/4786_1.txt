I despise horror movies, not a secret. No scheme, bad acting and blood glucose are staples in the mistakes of movies, and this "film" is no exception. I can not believe that some cable stations actually run this garbage. (This particular garbage was released straight-to-video, as I remember.) As mentioned any other movie would be a great insult to other films, I say: All the phantasm movies, all of the movies Jason, Freddy Movies, Chucky Movies, and most of Michael Myers's movies can be summed up in one word: Terrible !!!! Rating Rating (Phantasm III): 0.5 / 10
