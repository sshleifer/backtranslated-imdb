Rob Schneider is a famous comedy act in his movements, facials and performances in "by people". This time it is the beast. Marvin is a loser who tries to have a hero and one day, nobody takes a call from a man who gets attacked, so Marvin has taken this case and rescues this man to attack. But on his way to the crime scene, he crashes with his car and gets really damaged. He does not remember what is happening and the next ordinary day, his life is not even when he finds he has animal instincts. Of course, we got our girls that our main character tries to arrive, but try it, they are useless. It plays by Collen Haskell. There is no negative character. The negative one is destined if I could use this metaphor. Marvin should find out, how to become a normal human being again. By the way-instincts its creatures, help it in some situations. Schneider's performance is something like that. The movie is so real that gets stupid at some moments but it is one of those movies, which calls the essence as I write above. So watch it for the style brand Rob Schneider but it is definitely not one of the best comedy ever or one of the best films that Schneider appears in. It's a great comedy but this is not the best movie his.
