After watching this film on DVD, I watched the trailer. The voice describes the movie as surreal. Well, there's surreal, and there's surreal. <br /> There was really only part of the movie that seemed surreal to me, but frankly, it was much more confusing than surreal. The other weird prints, particularly the lunchroom scene where everyone is on the floor, was so meaningless they had no meaning. I do not mind imagery that does not mean anything, but these scenes just seemed irrelevant. <br /> <br /> My impression is that the director tried to convey Logan's inner monologue. I do not know what else could explain what happened. Unfortunately, nothing I have seen has given me any signs that Logan thought about, what he was perspective, or even his emotional state. All I could say is that he is not particularly happy with his physical appearance, and that he has a crush on an older boy. <br /> <br /> I thought that the end was signed that the relationship between the boys had come, but not much else did. So, juxtapose ambiguous scenes and that were more straightforward seemed more like a cop out than an artistic decision. Still, as tiring and as the content-free movie was for me, it was a definite change in speed. I very much like Skin Madagascar, and I felt that this movie was sucking that narrative kind, and perhaps the same style. It did not even come close. For me there is no question about it: this movie deserves an A for effort, but a D for execution.
