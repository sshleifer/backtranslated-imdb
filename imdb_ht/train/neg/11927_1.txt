Without question, the worst movie I've seen for a long time. I endure in the end because surely there is something here, but no. The plot, when not faced in glowing, rambles to the point of non-existence; The assumed street dialogue is simply forbidden; Character never develops beyond drawing; Put-pieces are clear. Worse, consider its co-directors, photography is just so-so. <br /> Commenting elsewhere that elevates this along with Finding Carter, Long Friday or Kaspar Hauser are way ways in the brand; Life in the Saints misses their innovation alone with their depth and shadow. In short, the craft. An unpopular editor can probably trim it down to a 30-minute decline, but as it means it is a 6th film form project achieved on a million-pound scale; rambling and stuffing with its own pretense. He received funding (probably only because of the Rankin's) while other films for cash are depressing for the British film industry.
