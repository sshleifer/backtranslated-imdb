Worst movie ever made !!! Please see the Real Movie reviews from the pros toys on this movie.Check tomato rotten online for some good self-review on this movie. The comments made on this site are apparently in line with some financial interests of this film. I get positive comments are very misleading. I find it amazing how the negative comments are so bad against this movie and sounds as positive comments as a Speech Awards Academy. Do not waste money you've earned !!!!!! This movie is delayed !! I can not believe a movie like this would ever do. Why would Hollywood waste their time on these junkies? This movie is an attempt at nothing. I ask myself what looser would actually spend money to produce these garbage. I went to the blockbuster and the same assistant told us not to waste our time or money. I did not listen and I was wasting my time with cash. Please do not make the same mistake! It really is "the worst movie ever made!"
