This movie is terrible. TERRIBLE. One of the worst movies ever. I can not even imagine Gigli being worse than this. Preview has told us "NO", but then looking for something off the hole from the now, we decided to go ahead and give it a shot. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />. It is an image and can look good and explosion, but not the same type of Bruce Willis in "Hard Hard". If he strips his shirt, he runs to fight bad guys, it would be a comedy. The best part was Catherine O'Hara - it was always good. Gandolfini flops again (if not for the Sopranos, he should wash up) as he did in the "Mexican". <br /> <br /> Affleck pig every scene and as others have said - no character has any motivation whatsoever for their actions. <br /> <br /> AVOI PHOTOGRAPHS IN ALL MONEY.
