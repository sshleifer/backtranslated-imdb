After seeing the forecasts I felt that this movie was going to make a nice improvement on what fast & furious series. So, I'm already hoping he has a missing scenario, but at least this time he will not be packed with a bunch of civic force and fart boxes. Unfortunately, I was wrong. If you could only imagine a fast & furious movie with a story line worse than by all means this movie is for you. This is the worst worst movie I've ever seen (I was pretty - no I would not get my black baseball bat like that others said). Not only the scenario was non-existent, but the action was crap too. I guess the director thought they could just throw lots of female and exotic cars and then call it a movie. For example, there is a point in the movie where the guy pushes the nail button and his Lamborghini take in the air and flies on a McLaren SLR to win. After the bit where Eddy Griffin got into a fight with one of her "girls" (an Imus comment would work in that case) the girl asked to pull on and get out of the PLANE and the course is done in the middle of the desert. After this wonderful scene I could not take it again. So I've only seen half of this monstrosity. This is the first movie I ever walked out on. And I had to stop for some drinks to kill all cells in my brain. <br /> I was given a 1 because 0 is not an option. You are best to go to the local car show and stand in a striped joint on the way home. I will keep my viewers in my prayers.
