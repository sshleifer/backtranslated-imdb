First of all ..... <br /> <br /> What the Hell? Why in the world are trying to sell a low budget piece of crap on late night TV and the promise of disturbing, offensive rubbish sickness that any normal real people were with a soul could not watch. <br /> What is the crap is funny about a dog being wounded, a grandma gets herself hit by ... a guy getting his hand was bitten and two girls go to the bathroom? The hell of this world has come to get people to get comedy into something so completely sick. Anyone who thinks this kind of material is funny, should not even be able to market the earth. But in what I heard it was not even offensive ... So ... they promise comedies to request pile of sick garbage ... and they cant even pull that off.
