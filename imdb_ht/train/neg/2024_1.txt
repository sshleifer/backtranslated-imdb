Try The Success Of Deal Or Deal And 1 Versus 100 Coming To The Lame For Entertainment - Show Me The Money, in which 12 sexy dancers' Shimmy comes from bright red green adornments. A competitor gives the beginning of a sentence, such as "Which Team Lost .." with three choices, A, B, or C, each completing the sentence. The competitor has three chances to give an answer to one of these 3 choices. The Army - William Shatner, in his smarmiest man - ask the contestant if he wants to "close to the answer" and when the contestant says yes, he chooses a 'dancer', whom he yells "Show me the money! " He opens a roll of money, and if his answer is good, he adds that amount to his spread; If it was wrong, the amount was subtracted. (So, theoretically, it's possible for a competitor on this quiet fortune actually to wind up with Shatner money.) There is also a "Bloody Card" and if the competitor chooses the girl with rough old, but he Respond well, there is nothing happening. If it has responded incorrectly, the game goes to sudden death and has another question. If it gets that one wrong, it leaves with nothing. Before going into advertising, Shatner yells, "let's dance" and Shatner, the contestant and the 12 dancers shake loot. At the end of the show, Shatner asks the ladies for "a last dance" and they all shake it a bit more. <br /> I give this show 6 episodes to the most, in which time hopefully this pathetic excuse for a game will show the door. (It could be worse - they could somehow bribes Cuba Gooding Jr to be the host, although I bet it's a better dancer than 'Shat,' as they call it these days.) <Br / > 7/08: Guess what - I was wrong! It lasted for only 5 episodes. There is hope for the world.
