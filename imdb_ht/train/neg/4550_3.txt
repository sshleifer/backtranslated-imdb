My dear master, who is a movie! Let's talk about "special effects" first. Do not get me wrong here, I'm not one of those fanatic effects but I've really thought that superimposing was a practice in the past time, especially in the 60's. So for some time I thought they might have recorded this movie a long time ago and it took them forever to cut and release it. But as far as I know they did not have cell phones in the 60's ... <br /> <br /> What I'm looking for in movies is especially a good story with a really good message. Acting is high, the high effects, I do not even mind some little inconsistencies. However, in a movie like this evil acting, incredible, etc. adds up to making a bad movie even worse - that's what happened to me and the Celestial Prophecy. <br /> <br /> My wife said the book was actually really good and even though I'm not in all of these spiritual things I can somehow see that it can bring across in a credible way - the movie failed to do this. <br /> <br /> There could be only one reason to look this one though. If you really like movie movies it will be one of the right for you. If the IMDb stars were cheesiness instead of my quality must be rated this movie ten stars. <br /> <br /> By the way, three stars are for the fact that there are worst outdoor movies, such as "Mass Critical" (see the reviews on one - hilarious). The celestial prophecy is at least fun to some degree.
