Jason Lee does his best to bring pleasure into a funny situation, but the movie just fails to make a connection. <br /> <br /> Perhaps because Julia Stiles characters look awkward as the compelling and sexy soon to be cousin-in-law. <br /> <br /> Perhaps it is because he and Selma Blair characters should have cast the opposite way. (Selma Blair looks more convincing than Julia should). Either way this movie is yet another Hollywood trivialization in a really real world situation (being caught with your pants from your undergraduate party by stooping your cousin), which while having promises did not come to salvation. Some laughter must be insured and disposed of (even if miscast) does the best and grade materials that do not exceed its subject raunchy. So, instead of getting a successful raunch firm (ie Animal House or American Pie) we leave with a medium ground in humorous parts and idiotic (ala meatballs 2 or something).
