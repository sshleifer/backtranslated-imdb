It's a pity that you can not vote stars zero on IMDb, because I would not hesitate! In fact I would go so far as to say that this movie was in the negative stars. <br /> I, like many others, bought this movie to think that because it has Michael Madsen in it, it might be good ... No chance! This movie was shocking! Imagine a long film 'Bold and Beautiful', well, Primal instinct did not even come close to that which is good, and I've already thought that there would be nothing worse than a film 'Bold and Beautiful' film length. <br /> <br /> Michael Madsen, how could you do this to us? The worst part is, I was not fast forward a bit, I was hoping that in the end they would reveal that it was all some sort of sick jokes, thinking they would be funny to make us look like a horrible movie movie. <br /> Where do I start ...? - Zero Stars, Zero Stars, Zero Stars, Zero Stars, Digital Effects - Stars Zero, Production Design - Stars zero, Make-up Zero Stars, Casting - Stars zero, Editing - Stars zero, Trailers - Zero Stars, Half a Star, Graphic Design - Half a Star, DVD Menu - Half a Star. <br /> However I think it's very important to have seen bad films just so that you know what a really bad movie is, so that's why I'm happy that I've seen this movie, just so I have a Bad films are placed at the bottom of my list.
