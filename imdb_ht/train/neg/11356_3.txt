This is not a good movie. Too preachy in parts and story lines was sub par. The 3D was OK, but not superb. I almost fell asleep in this movie. <br /> <br /> The story is about 3 young flies who want to have adventure and follow up on it. The characters are missing, I really do not care about these characters and feel that there was nothing to keep an adult interested. This pixar is not. <br /> I would like to see more 3D special effects. Also I liked to see more jokes flying than the mother always says "Lord of the Flies" Pretty sexist in showing women as home and faint wife.
