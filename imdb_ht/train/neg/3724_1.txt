I saw this movie twice in a Pentecostal family church I went to Nanaimo BC in the 1970s. I was at the tender age of my brother 4, then again when I was 8 brothers 6. This movie scared my brother and me with shaped how we saw the world and challenged. It was not just the movie, but it was also the philosophy that engulfs many "Christians" about "marking the beast" and rapture. This movie, the church, and a negligence overlooking, leads to serious paranoia towards the future. For years, I lived under the affections of the Church and feared that they were forgotten by Christ. I'm now 40 years old. Was going to years of advice. I once explained to a movie psychiatrist and the belief system of the church and the family. I have been affiliated with a delusional illness. I actually started believing this, it was my brother who recalled me, that this culture philosophy actually happened. I am not afraid of the future, I have come to terms with the fear in injection of his membership in the church. I took this experience to meet a goal, I'm nearing my license as a psychologist who specializes in child trauma.
