MST 3000 should make this movie. It is the worst act I've ever seen. First of all, you find that the shooter has no bank account and no history since leaving the army in 1993 and paying his rent in cash. There is no way to hell that someone like that would ever allow to be close to a president not to mention a high profile job. Also, top security for the POTHUS is not so emotional that it would start to drink in a haze if the president shot. This movie sucks. I can not express the endorsement of this movie. Each single actor was awful. Even the chick in the trailer park. I crap on this garbage. What a waste of time.
