I'm an avid fan of lurid movies, anything cheesy and downright ridiculous is my game. So imagine my mind I went to the Local Renting Shop, and found vampires vs. zombies. The name is just too fun, you know that no one in the world could pull something like it, it just has to be bad. <br /> <br /> And boy, is it BAD. After looking at this horror-icing movie, I talked, literally. Me and my pals sit out without saying a word to each other for several minutes, both of us contemplating the future of our lives after watching this movie. I broke the depressive silence with the words, "... dude .... What?" Yes, I'm a fun person. <br /> Heres a 'blue street' review of the plot; No, at all, ever, always in fashion "WTF". Characters; No development, forgettable. The music; Worse than pornography. Vampires; The Vampire Turns? Zombies; They are in the zombies? <br /> <br /> At the end; Everyone should see this movie, honestly, it's so bad I want to see it again. So make yourself a favor, watch it and get depressed.
