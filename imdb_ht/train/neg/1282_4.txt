Here is one of those cinemas that are spoiled by the studio's insistence on a happy ending. The conflicts that have been stretched for years remain within a few minutes. It would be far more interesting to inject a ton of ambiguity. Barbara Stanwyck's talent is endangered by a sudden metamorphosis from independent and pregnant women in a compliant female of the kind he has put down all his life. Brent, as usual, is well on himself and then the funny situation of Young gurus plays a character named Gig Young. Someone mentions "Gig Young" and then appearing Gig Young, the actor! Worth to see if far below what he could.
