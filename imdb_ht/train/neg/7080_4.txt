This film was an interesting character study and could provide some insight on its subjects, but real issues with this movie is that it has no of this in it. It does not provide any insight, or solution to the problem. It's just painted in 'old' male addicted to sex with these problems that will create everyday life of their normal lives and their families. Why do you want to watch this? It's all so totally free and meaningless. It also really does not help that the main character is some clumsy 50+ year old men. You will have a hard time identifying yourself - and sympathizing for her. It just looks like an old playboy room, who is a constant hunt for women and gender. It has all kinds of sexual behaviors about 3 times a day and different women and not only with prostitutes. It also does not have a bad visual style, though it all feels somewhat forced. But, nevertheless, it's all best to spend most of the other direct-to-video productions. Who knows, if the movie-makers have provided better materials to work with, the film deserves a better faith. The story really becomes ridiculous at times. There are really some freeways drawn lines that are often more ridiculous than they were obviously supposed to be. I'm talking about the example of the All-Draw Draft-Line. Things get worse once the movie starts heading toward the finish. Also all the way is the story being said, cutting back and forth between the events that happened with the main character session and his psychiatrist felt a bit cheap and simple. But as far as bad movies are concerned, this just is not one of them. It's not really any better or worse than any other random straight-to-video flicker movie, with similar concepts. <br /> Still seem strange and quite amazing that they managed to throw Nastassja Kinski and Ed Begley Jr in such a simple little insignificant production as this is one. Guessing was really desperate for working with money. <br /> <br /> 4/10
