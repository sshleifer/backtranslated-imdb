How Grinch Stole Christmas was a pretty little Christmas cartoon that anyone can enjoy well, I have never seen the reason for a rumor. Not to mention a remake that was made with people, the cartoon was just perfect enough, what is the purpose of this movie? But he also seemed a little odd for Jim Carrey to be the Grinch. I mean he's a great comic actor, but he's like Grinch? It just did not make any sense to me. His performance was a little over the head and unexplored rid of the moment. Not to mention some of the dialogue added a little childhood and not enjoyable. The whole story of the Grinch and Cindy Lou-Who was about to do and was not needed. They actually just destroy the story, period. <br /> All in Whoville are getting ready for Christmas best season again where everything is intended to go perfectly. But Cindy Lou-who is curious and worried about the Grinch who lives above them and that he will not get as good at a Christmas as the other is there. He kicks him out and decides that he does not want Christmas this year and that in fact he should just steal Christmas all together to show who's what his version of Christmas is all about. But soon he realized that the person can know that it's a little more than that version of the materialized Christmas. <br /> How Grinch Stole Christmas was not needed and was a bit over the head. I really recommend that you stick with the cartoon just for the simple fact that this is a very disturbing version, at least in my opinion. The making and presentation of the movie all was just a bit about doing, not to mention that How the Grinch stole Christmas! was more meant to be as a cartoon rather than a version starting Jim Carry. But at least this version makes you grateful for the version of Boris Karloff who played every Christmas. <br /> <br /> 1/10
