The film is a crap total. We have two good actors who are wrong with a head of the actress Salman Khan just to attract the female audience. The story is a crap. Characters are wrongly undertaken. The story does not exist. There is no correction to talk about. Ajag Devgan as a Rock Star ... is a dream of herself. The movie dragged along to the point of decadence. The whole charade on Arjun brings her Manna to London, let him gruff his girlfriend and let her play in Wembley (Vimbley in the dubbing process) is absurd. Salman Khan on the head or faking act is too painful to look. I remember seeing some good movies from Vipul Shah producers but this is not one of them. It gathered all the good directors to fall prey to the Box Office mania. The Mumbai Media Morons people were created. This is yet another crap movie in the lines of "Wanted" and idiot actors like Salman Khan who have no place in a good Hindi Cinema. It is the good American cinema as Titanic was in the Winter Cruise business. On a positive note-I like Asin Character dancing Bharatnatyam when it changes to the Western style dance when the teacher is not looking.
