This movie is very poor. I've seen better movies. <br /> <br /> There was a bit of tension, but not much do you jump from your seat. It starts slowly with the building of tension. Which is not a success. At least if you ask me. Though at some point or moments I must say it was a bit funny when people shot and how they came down. <br /> They should have made it something like scary films, then it might be a better movie. Because I watch only pieces of the movie by jumping scenes and it's got boring in the movie out. I must say that I felt asleep watching this film so I could say it is not worth it. <br /> Do not waste time on the same thought to do something with this movie besides leaving it where it is already. Somewhere very dusty.
