Anyone who made this nonsense completely missed the point. Jane is a funny comic titilate strip without slaughter. <br /> <br /> This giant mess try to be funny and interesting, but it's just a shambles. There is not one decent performance in it. Similarly, Jasper Carrott is seriously unfunny. <br /> <br /> Blocking the American with my saved name is just as rubbiush as it was in flash Gordon. <br /> Maud Adams tries as a villianess but it's a bit long in the tooth for this type of thing. All of this would not matter if the girl was sexy or funny or likable.She is not. Kirsten Holmes faded in obscure afterwards and much better. <br /> I was watering more fun than this down the toilet.
