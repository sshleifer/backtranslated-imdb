* review can include crowd * <br /> <br /> predictable, farmers, bad effects. she has a TV-movie feeling about her. The idea of ​​the United Nations as being taken over by Satan is an exciting twist at the end of the world according to the Bible. The site is interesting, but its excitement falls short of waaaay. if you want to convert people to Christianity with a movie like this, at least make it a single quality! I was seriously checking my look while watching this piece of drak. can not say much more about this movie since I've seen it about a year ago, and there is not much to say about this movie other than ..... skipping it!
