... just look at the poor character Robert Webber (great performance, once again!) which attempts to fight a submachine gun into one of the terrorists. Everything in this movie seems to be a little wrong. The biggest mistake in my opinion is this effort to give the action a firm footing in the reality of the early 1980s (the fundamental difference between this creep and far more fantastic, the ironic and therefore timeless dead hard). The story comes in as a failed attempt to glorify the SAS commands. Thinking like when a crying commando Head down "all good guys do it and all bad guys do not can blast away from free ad (with a good conscience), which the main character does not get stirring down in the gas mask commander although it puts the same clothes and carries a The weapons of arsenal just seem to be easy and make it difficult to take the movie seriously. And it just happens that it tries to do more than just fun. Critical idea of ​​the Pacifist movement as a shield for the villain and the arguments between peace fans and remains, even ruled by representatives of powers in this film but the political commentary is rather lame and unenspired. This is because of the fact that the movie features an early performance of Judy Davies. Anyway, its performance is a tooth higher than that of others and somehow I feel the movie left it down.
