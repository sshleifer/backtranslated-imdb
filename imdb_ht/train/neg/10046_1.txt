I did not terribly impress with Dante's first seasonal offering of "Resident", it was not a lot of a horror story, but rather a clever political statement with the undead. Screwfly situation is the story of a virus triggering the world that causes male sexual drive to replace and tendency to kill towards women. The episode starts out all right and a short movie explains the way the flying screw was killed by scientists. Then there is a short scene where a person is arrested when the brutal body is discovered in his home. I suppose this is supposed to show the beginning of the epidemic, but it is clear because this is never reviewed. The episode goes off for a while to introduce blah blah blah character. It looks cool and mysterious, but the epic stars are getting worse and worse as it lurches forward until its sad and unsatisfactory end. The worst episode. Well, except for chocolate.
