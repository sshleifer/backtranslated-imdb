This movie has plenty of promise. I was very excited about this movie. In the end, he was mocking at the best, painful worst. The styles act to run the gamers from really, really, flat (angels, wives and daughters) of the on-anime (Casper's character). I felt that the dialogue was just an attempt to transfer information to the audience instead of real people trying to talk to each other. Pay special attention to the scene regarding the "bug". It's pretty much a curse of the audience's ability to figure things out. In defense of this scene, though, he got the biggest laugh in the entire movie. I have read that they have spent much of money traveling in various overseas locations. Too bad they did not use it. I do not feel like I was transported to exotic places. Anyone could insert foot stock into the Coliseum in Rome. However, by the end of a positive note, I thought the sets were pretty good. I really liked the graphics that appeared on the decoding computers. It is my opinion (and that's all it is) that if the SCHMALTZ factor would have been much lower and the ACTION factor would increase significantly, this film would be good.
