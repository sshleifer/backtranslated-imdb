OK, if you are looking for another Bastketball Journal, this is completely the wrong movie. <br /> I turn around my two brothers. Max, the youngest, has a great addiction to cocaine. Adam, the eldest, is a doctor. This film is supposed to show the plunge from the extreme reality to allow drugs to do. It does not, however. It shows that cocaine can be fun no matter what the situation happens to be. Most of the film focus is about Max and his separate way. Eventually Adam, unable to take the stress from his work and begins to use as well (prescription medication). This film has almost no major points. Not down to what cocaine really does, there are boring and low-budget scenes, and acting at the older brother, Adam, is terrible. <br /> I have no idea how this movie has managed to pass and receive awards, it is not a heart-humble. If you want a clear story and truth about the extreme world of drug-rent, if you do not buy the 'Basketball Basketball'. And notice the difference. <br /> Try to avoid this movie but if you think you will enjoy. Try and see for yourself ...
