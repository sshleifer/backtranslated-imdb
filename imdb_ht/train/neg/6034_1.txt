Oh, where to start ... this movie was just awful. The word was bad, acting bad, the special effects were bad. I think that only good thing about this film is that it made me laugh! I was in the mood for a scary film but certainly did not get that! I thought it would be decent enough since I'm not serious. I watched many bad horror movies. In fact, it is my goal to see all the horror movies, no matter how terrible they can be. At one point in the movie I made a comment on the "blood corn syrup" and of the special features they actually admitted that it was chewing syrup (brand corn syrup ...) the movie had everything needed for a horror movie (bloody, nudity, crazy killer, stupid movement) but it just completely misses anything really to make it good. The writer should either take some classes or just give up!
