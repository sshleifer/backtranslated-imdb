I do not know why this conduct has always been tolerated in business movies! This movie (short) is gross (they say at least)! It's a bunch of 5-7 year olds who bring diapers and big bobs Bob, acting like adults (and so much!). However, it's interesting because it's a good example of how the "good old days" can not have been so good after all! (Thank you to have laws against this kind of material now!) {This is one short from the "Shirley Temple Festival"}
