Well I just paid a dollar for a DVD in this movie, and it was not even that. It seems to come from a poor print and is in the public domain, I guess. <br /> <br /> Neagle - despite its glory, prize, and reputation - is a British gallery that can not sing or dance or act. <br /> Some of the old Hollywood actor actors in the show here must be thought to have made a classic. Herbert Wilcox (husband Neagle's) director still thinks Anna was the most attractive and talented woman on the screen. He made mistakes. It was improbably popular in Britain before and after WWII. His "serious" role is even more funny than his musical appearance here. Only a couple of the most popular songs are included and no one is well presented. Skip this one and find one star Doris Day. At least you get some real comedy and dancing professional style!
