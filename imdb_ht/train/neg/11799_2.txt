This could be a good episode but I simply had to turn it off. The British representation was terrible to watch. Have the musicians ever joined foot in England before filming? At least set foot in England ?? I do not think that any British person had such an accent apart from a comedy comedy of the Royal Family! Also with the English 2 boys ... well I do not think any English boy has acted, spoke or dressed like any English kid in the history of the British country since Prince William and Harry pretended to the public appearances. For American movie makers .. There are over 1 countries in the UK. England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland .. ie more than 1 culture! I can handle some stereotiping but that was so bad I could not watch it. Fire looks cool even!
