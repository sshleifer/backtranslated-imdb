I usually enjoy Loretta Young's early cinema: she acts back then light and breezes, and she sure knew how to wear clothes. But this one is just a loser from the word goes except for a funny turn-based support by Glenda Farrell. Young is a girl hatcheck who speaks to her husband's writer (Paul Lukas) in becoming a championship bridge player. It's not the most cinema of games, and the long part, is the middle of which the marriages fall apart just to kill the movie. There's a bit interesting though. As Lukas and Ferdinand Gottschalk start playing the climates, a series of quick shots shows airplanes, trains, football games, even a mid-air diver, frozen in an anticipation of the event. It's the earliest use of a frieze frame I've seen in an American movie. Wish the rest of it was inventive and funny.
