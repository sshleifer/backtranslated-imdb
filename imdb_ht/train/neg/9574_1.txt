This has to be one of the most idle idiots that I've ever seen throughout my life. Just when I think I've seen the stupid scene in history, simultaneously comes a even dumber and more rare scene. I think the poodles transvestites have made it for me, or better yet, to speak their language ... or maybe the guy getting the girl's statue to ride in a jeep steam caught in her throat. Decision, decision ...
