I basically picked up this movie because I saw the brilliant Kitano Takashi rumor at Zatoichi and was in the mood for another updated samurai story that also starred Asano Tadanobu. These two movies are separate worlds. Zatoichi added humor and depth to his character and subverted traditional samurai movie clips. Gojoe goes to the deep end of the other direction. <br /> <br /> The first, I hate movies with other characters to inform the audience that the main character is like instead of having the character developed over the course of the movie. "You can not decide whether you are a monk or a warrior" says almost every character in Benkei's presence, but this interior turmoil is barely transmitted to the character itself. Instead of character development, we find stuffy, boring, gory battle scenes. Asano's features are undeveloped and it seems that it is bored and does not know what it's doing. I know that it usually looks far and cool and is part of Asano's appeal, but this movie does not serve him. A lot of the camera motion is nauseating. There is a scene that goes on forever in which the camera turns around the main characters until my wife and I felt like vomiting. The finish is ridiculous and rather anti-climatic. <br /> <br /> Too bad its really good samurai cinema are not made in Japan nowadays with this type of budget. The colors, scenery, and costumes were great, but the rest is just a loooong waste in time. I'd rather see one of the kabuki versions of this myth.
