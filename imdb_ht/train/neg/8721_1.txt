I'm sorry but this is just plain pathetic. The little girl was a spit, they had no fun characters and the plot sucked. Besides it was not even a gator as the movie would like us to believe. If you check out any complete reptile guide you will find that it's really a crocodile, not a gator. Obviously they did not hire a real animal expert or they would know that the animal is a croc. It's a sad excuse for a movie. Especially the finish. I almost fell asleep with this one.
