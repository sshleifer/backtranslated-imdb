I'm really shocked that a great director like Chuck Jones started out doing some of the most incredibly boring designs I've ever seen. I did not laugh at all this short, and it's a bunny bug drawing, for Christ's sake! Bugs Bunny Cartoons are always funny, not boring! Alas, this short turn out to be Good Elmer night (another Jones incredible short breeze) with the addition of Bugs Bunny. Signs showing the first sign of a martial design is still no mulch. Good Night Elmer was boring because it dragged on the two gags even forever and productively predictable. This drawing, on the other hand, is afflicted with signs of second warning in a drawing: there are too many dialogues. The drawing at least has more than two gags up its sleeve, but most of them seem longer than they are thanks to the immense padding of the dialog. At one point, Elmer finished dinner, and commented, "That was awfully good at going to Wamb," possibly the most redundant dialogue I've ever heard of a cartoon (loud text characters in the later era Woody Woodpecker does not count in my book). Even though this cartoon is only 8 minutes long, it feels like 20 thanks to redundant dialogues like this. Elmer's pets were not a fun cartoon for me, but if you sold your soul to Chuck Jones and they could recognize that he led a few clunkers during his career , you might enjoy it.
