There is nothing I hate more than self-congratulating pretense. Kevin Smith deserves to be hanging by his nail to inspire every whane middle-class whiner to make a movie about why they can not get laid. I do not really mind inexperience and low-budget output but when writing is this obvious and cloying it really burns my potatoes. The money set in this could go to a real-world cinema that actually has a chance like John Gulager. If you look at Greenlight projects you will immediately recognize a talented visionary who is fighting against the system. Anyone might grab a camera and make a bavarite picture that does not manage to say anything really, at all. When will we escape from the Smithonites and Whedonettes of the world? The revolution can not come soon enough. Go look for a real effort first time by purchasing Desperado or looking for Friends and Benefits. Thanks and good days.
