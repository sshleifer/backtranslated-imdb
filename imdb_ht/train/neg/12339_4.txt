This comedy has some awful funny thing in it, surrounded by a lot of unfunny stuff. Just about every scene involving the servants of the castle and antique comics are a waste of time. And the plot is so sloppy that it makes you ask if they actually had a script ready before they started filming this, or they simply did it all up as they went along. (* 1/2)
