I watched this movie last night and was a little disappointed. A lot of "time realities" were there. In the beginning of the movie, the grandfather made a comment to this grandson and his friends about how they felt when 9-11 hit. This film was supposed to take place in 1994. Also, one of the seedlings friends brought a Eagles Donovan McNabb Jersey. He did not even shoot as in again. The story line was good, but the facts and facts of the time frame was so far as it did the movie looks like cheese. My companion is an avid reader of WWII books and memorabilia. I rent this movie hoping it would be good. Acting was so-so. The dog was beautiful. But the way that this film was carried out makes me happy that I only paid 4 dollars to rent it as opposed to the 50's that he would take me to watch it in a theater. I hope ever to read this understanding that I mean there is no discontent for those who fought the war, but their reality and time frames should be a little better to control.
