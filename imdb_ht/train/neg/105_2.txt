There are tons of good-looking women in this flick. But alas, this movie is stripping free. Grrrrrrrrrr strike one. <br /> <br /> Ahem. A story in this movie takes place in 1971. Then why the hell are the main characters driving a Kia Sportage? Hello? Continuity, Anyone? <br /> <br /> As you might know, this movie was released in 3D stereoscopic. And it is the most hideous effect I have ever seen. I'm not sure if someone botched the work on this, but there is no 3D, just bloons double-vision. I did not have the same problem with this 3D company, lung season and CAMP blood. Sure, the 3D of these people also sucked, but with them I could see a prank in the 3D effects. This is a great ball in nothing. Women have been playing the daughter in the Dame's ear-eyed, yum! I would like to see more of it. In movies, as well. Seems Janet Margolin at a young age. Rrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr <br /> <br />
