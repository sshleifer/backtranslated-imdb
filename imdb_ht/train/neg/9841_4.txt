I really, really wanted to like Julian Po. I think Slater is underrated as an actor, and that many of the players here are better than giving a chance to demonstrate in this movie. I realize this is based on a short story I do not read. So I do not know if what I see as the movie goes out with the story, or was imposed on it by the director / senarist. Mostly it is wonderful, and I liked the VoiceWhite, confessional tone to the narration phrases. But then ...? There is nothing! Several of the local stereotype characters asked Julian Pointblank to explain his intention to commit suicide. One could argue that he did not respond, because he's none of their business. But Julian is one of those who, under pressure only signs, blurted his intention publicly. Then neither Julian nor the director / writer, despite the fact that Julian's character holds a tape recorded journal for God's sake, they seem inclined to give anything beyond the initial initials of Julian's life. He said he was an accountant. He said his family moved around being a kid, due to his father's work. So, what? There are several interactions with the locals that seem to be designed to grow Julian's goals. But none of them go anywhere, because Julian seems to consider all those dopey locals as though they were foreigners from another planet, as if it were the ultimate (and only) unidentified one among them. This would work as a allegory, if Julian Po had any defined features or any wise approach to wisdom. The closer she came to reveal anything about herself is at the stage in which she intentionally outrages naive, religious wife of the mechanic. And this scene reveals nothing but inspiration for Julian. I can only see the Julian character - such as rendering - as selfish, petty, and totally conscious. Sort of matches the mood of the director of this half cooked, contrasting film. And poor Michael Parks, an actor who once promised so much, provided nothing to work with here.
