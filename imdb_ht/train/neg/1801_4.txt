Istanbul is another person in films that Errol Flynn has done in the last decade of his life trying to support his family and staying out of trouble with the IRS. It's a rumor of Fred MacMurray- Ava Gardner movie film from a decade ago. Contrary to this studio product, Istanbul has the advantages of the location where the movie is in the eye of the Golden Horn. But Errol Flynn, who was aging exponentially before the camera in every movie, was too old to be playing these kinds of action / adventure again. His scene with Cornell Borchers really lacks conviction. As for Cornell, she plays former boyfriend Errol in the trauma to be saved from a fire now having amnesia. He both does not remember Errol and is now married to Torin Thatcher. <br /> But the Errol got some nasty people led by Martin Benson and Werner Klemperer who after some diamonds that came to his possession. Faced with them too. <br /> <br /> The best reason to see Istanbul is to hear Nat King Cole singing and playing the piano. Most people today do not realize that Cole was a jazz pianist to perform, they only think of him as a singer. Actually, it was a first pianist, the song was a reluctance. Istanbul is an action / adventure movie for people who are fans of that kind of movie.
