This film shows how racist John Singleton is. It shows white and other non-black race as evil that exists in our educational system. How quickly she forgot that she was the same education system that made her what she was and was failing in her. The Cube Ice Cube is the epitome of a black instigator man who has been responsible for most of the violence in this film. Singleton barely touched on the relationship between white and black characters who tried to reach each other. When Omar Epps says "I need to be with my people," which racist remarks spoke volume. And John, do not think for a minute that the picture of Thomas Jefferson in the tower staircase did not get my attention. Nice touch!
