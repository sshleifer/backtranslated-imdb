Just a stilted rip-off of infinitely better "Murder, he writes", it is absolutely amazing that this malicious writing was lasting for a full eight years. I'm sure most of those who watched this incompetent crap were in the sixties and sixties and just tuned in because they had nothing better to do, or simply remembered its star from old Dick Van Dyke Show. Van Dyke, who only had a decent career in the 1960s, was never very much an actor at all (not her own admission) and she was already far too old to play a doctor when the series was starting in 1993. It looks absolutely ancient as a result of years of smoking and heavy chain years. It talentless real life barry child, a wooden actor who was rarely in anything that did not involve his father, plays his son in the series.
