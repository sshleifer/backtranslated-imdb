This clunker in a movie sets out a new standard for bad movie. Jared Rushton gives an adequate performance to a very poorly created character in a sick-unfortunate film, thereby creating a complete effect in a very bad movie. The main movie crowd is how a boy's temporary breakout in the Canadian desert after surviving a solo crash plane allows pioneering adolescents to cope with the anguish of discovering his mother's extramarital affairs. Unfortunately it becomes a rare collar of random "surviving events" (including two specially hokey scenes involving fighting a bear) and weird delusions that make you wonder if this kid is not just sitting at a somewhere about dreaming to dream up this whole movie (and what a nightmare it is!). In addition, despite the ads in some viewable reviews of the family of the movie, there are several scenes not suitable for small children or family watch, including a graphic scene in the underwater pilot underwater and one of her eyes, apparently exploded .. <br /> All in all, a terrible movie that nobody should have to undergo, much less innocent kids.
