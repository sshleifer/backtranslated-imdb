Manipulative drama on a celebrity model (Margaux Hemingway) who was raped by a stranger musician (Chris Sarandon) - whom he introduced by his younger sister (played by real life Mariel sibling), whose music teacher is . While the central action keeps the attention - thanks largely to a commanding performance by Anne Bancroft as Hemingway's attorney - the film is too often simply brilliant, but also dramatically compelling: the jury officially takes the musician's side to a) the girl invites assault due to the sensuous nature of his profession and b) he offered no resistance to his interim aggressor when his sister arrived in the apartment and inadvertently saw the couple in bed at the same time. What is the f *** !; it was clearly tied - what resistance it could be realistically offered? The second half of the film - involving sarandon's rape in the sister, which curiosity anticipates IRREVERSIBLE (2002) does not reach a tunnel - is rather optimistic: the character Mariel should have been known better than trusting Sarandon after what he did to his sister, but Margaux herself insisted the reelection of the work that was indirectly leading to her humiliating experience almost immediately! The highest point - in which Sarandon becomes his just desserts, and margins turn suddenly into a fearless lookout and resource - is, however, a crowd-pleaser in the style of DEATH WISH (1974); Meanwhile, the ubiquitous Italian film Mogul Dino De Laurentiis was behind both films. <br /> It's worth noting how the two Hemingway sisters took turns wildly different (this was the first movie in both): Margaux's career never took off (although it can not get good results with his involvement here) - while Mariel would soon receive an Oscar nomination for the Woody Allen Manhattan (1979), and, interestingly, would himself play a glamorous victim of bad violence when dodging the role of real life "Playboy" to Dorothy's life Strats at Bob Fosse's STAR 80 (1983). With the added pressure of a couple of weddings failed, Margaux took refuge in alcohol and would eventually die in a drug overdose in 1996; chillingly, Hemingway's family had a suicide story - especially grandfather's sisters, celebrating Ernest Ernest, who died in a bullet wound executed in 1961.
