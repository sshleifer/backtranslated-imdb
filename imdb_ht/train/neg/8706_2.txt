If this is the first time you have the wonders of the movie, if you've never seen a "Moving Picture" before, you'll think that this movie is a child of the gods. And if you've seen a movie, a TV show, even the Barney Dinosaur, then you will not be very impressed by this movie. Heck Barney's dinosaur was even more realistic than the dinos in this flick of films. <br /> Now I love Cinema B. I just looked at the "Giant Gilla Monster" right before I watched this swill, and I loved this movie much better. He works as a movie B. He has dialogue diameter, hikier act, cheesier effect and an honest gosh real Gila monster as the monster! Carno 3 just does not pack a lot in a movie punch B. She has some gore, and that Polchek guy comes close to being funny a few times but this movie is underwhelming, almost .... wet. It's the Little Motor that was not capable of dinosaur movies. I do not say you should not watch the movie. <br /> <br /> Some people can look gum crisp on a sidewalk and feel entertained. If you are one of those people, then give this movie a shot.
