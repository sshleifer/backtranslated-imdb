First of all when I saw the neck trailer for Wendy Wu, I was definitely excited. Brenda Song, one of the hottest girls on Disney Channel, should make martial artists and I was fine with that ... until I saw the movie. The action was wrong constructed, the film could not have been achieved for anyone, the fight was unrealistic and aspired ... along with the plot. If you really think about it in a wannabe Buffy Vampire Slayer, a girl who is another vibrant woman, a girl wants to ignore her call, she wants to become queen's queen, on the lookout who is her bug to prepare for a great fight against some evil elders. The idea just was not all that original, the movie is waste of time.
