I chose this one because the music was made by Hans Zimmer, a client of Metasonix modular synthetic (made by a dear person). Art of jacket says "version in 2003". <br /> I give her a point for a strong woman, one point for dying dialogue and one last point for eye fetal meg, which has a lot of shots. <br /> It was fun to see David MacCullum relaxed swimming (the pool has a plexiglass look!), while Lady's love was chased by a psychic in Greece. <br /> <br /> The sets were very impressive-that is, the rich home of L.A. and Mendanassos (Sp?), where the castle was. I found myself asking how they could keep up the cleansing and all the dust blowing around. The wind was not too fierce enough to be my creditor. I kept thinking that the animal creature on the furniture would be embarrassing ... etc. and realize that the movie must be very boring if I ask the things when the scheme is supposed to unfold. I stumbled on things like why he lit a fire, blow out the match, then throw the match to the fire? Dumb things like that. It was the best clunky. Oh well. Robert Morely got to have a bit of fun with his geooker kooky character and a nice vacation from it.
