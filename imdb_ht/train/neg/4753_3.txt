Director F.W. Murnau wisely stuck with the silent film medium he knew well to cover this story in the native island life of the South Seas. The documentary style works very well for the first half of the movie. The beautiful scenery, and the daily life activities of the islands are interesting to watch. The movie loses momentum, though, when it begins to focus more on the narrative story of two condemned lovers. The scenario just never becomes interesting, despite being occupied by Murnau. There was an Academy Award for Best Movies, although the award probably would have been for better scenery. You can not really get the DP credit to get shot in such a beautiful place.
