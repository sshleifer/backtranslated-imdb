I rent this back in the 80's and honestly can not remember anything specific about the movie - only that it is the worst movie I've ever seen. This is not the one who "it was so bad, it was funny". This is not the one who "it was so gory, it left you with a bad mood" movies. It was not even one of these people "what the heck was that?" cinema. I can not remember the performance of the actors, but it was wrong to inject, the story was disjointed, and it had no definite style. When it was over, I was upset that I was wasting the time. <br /> I saw many movies I did not understand because of familiar culture, styles and / or story-tellers, but it was clear that these movies had some of these properties. The incubus is no. <br /> I'm actually gaze NOT to comment on this "piece" for fear that one can watch it out of curiosity, but I have to warn anyone who appreciates this movie skipping this movie.
