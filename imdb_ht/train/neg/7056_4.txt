This movie is a great example of how even a very funny joke can go terribly wrong. I really hope at least something out of this movie after seeing the addict was funny as hell, but the movie was not half as good. The strange part is the actually funny jokes, the parody of the smoking smoking, Jo Bole ... etc is really good junk but I do not know who to blame this movie flop over. The first candidates can: - 1) Hammer (actors) and Hammeresses (actresses) and not the same type of comic 2) The Principal 3) The guy who drives the actors and / or the director Anyway if you really really bored and I means to really see this movie, or else find a copy of each and every ad of this movie and your butt laugh because that will be far funnier than the movie. <br /> <br /> The only ps grace saving in this movie is mahesh manjrekar and the funny chappu bhai
