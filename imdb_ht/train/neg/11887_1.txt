The world can end. Unfortunately this movie survived as yet another testament to Canada's inability to make movies that go beyond the discharge. Maybe it's because our really good people (Norman Jewison, Martin Kout et al) go to Hollywood.) In fact it's too bad Short did not throw in this movie apallingly pretentious and banal. He could give him some credibility. The Canadian government should achieve --- and this movie is a great example --- that trash money in the trough does not provide good movies. If the people lapping up public funds had to compete, they might have been forced to come up with something refreshing. As it is being produced another embarrassing snickering.
