In addition to its series "Tarzan", Burroughs prolific Edgar Rice has written many other books, although annotated by the popular "On Earth's Core", some of which were filmed. An exception is the novel entitled "The Ladies and The Lion", brought to the screen as "The Man Lion" (1936), an on-bench, static, old-hat, slow-moving rather dull movie, despite being filmed on real desert places. Actually "film" is the word of wrong. The narrative does not move, but the amount of snail speed in an abrupt range. For example, at least five characters provide elaborate opening scenes and then just disappear. Even more frustrating for fans of keen film, the characters are making an impression of type (such as breaking the Hall and Wine Drugs) but being adopted by non-credited players! The crediting credits generally come off worse than the unknowns. An exception is Australian actress Finis Barton who gives a good account of the Harem kidnapped girl who delivers young Fairy Masters. Admittedly, most of the cast is sealed with atrocious King James dialogue that must be heard to be believed! But the way to play this garbage is tongue-in-cheek, a stratagem that does not seem to have been designed to single one in the movie list of players with no talent. Maybe J.P. director. McCarthy scotched this idea. Anyway, it's sad to see Kathleen Burke's handsome forcing them to trade line with the likes of Richard Carlyle (her father) and Jon Hall (she allegedly). Admittedly, Mr Hall delivers its lines and is more bold than Mr Carlyle, but there is no recommendation.
