I start seeing a sample of the films I give a 1. They are almost all movies that my wife made me look. Maybe I should stop having faith in his taste in movies. Anyway, this is typical drivel aimed at pre-teen girls but does even more harm than normal. Again, the writer broke the cardinal's rule in any movie. He / she has made the main character incredible. It starts by being a complete b * Tch of his friends at the beginning, and then getting out when it gets 30, that it is basically a * tty (with artifacts, etc.). Why would the F we feel for this person? OK, let's say we can get past. Jennifer Garner is as far from attractive as you can get without some sort of flaw. I do not know if he or she is the writer, but her character goes far beyond my threshold for annoyance. Here's a tip for filmmakers: The next 13 years NOT fun, they're annoying. Far and far the most embarrassing moments of the film came when they danced in "thriller". The Holy Ghost has been painful. She showed her practicing dance at the start. Which explains why he knows it, but a club is full of people? Argh !!! The Macarena would be more credible! All of a sudden it is completely incompetent and there is no sign of how to do it and there is no single remark? At least Tom Hanks' character on "Big" had a job that made sense to a child. These body-switching / child gets older movies either really getting out of hand, and this is by far the worst one again.
