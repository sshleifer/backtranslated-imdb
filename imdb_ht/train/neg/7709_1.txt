Never see this movie. <br /> It tries to be a parody about scy / thriller films in the 1950s and 1960s but all of it succedes in doing you wish really badly that you've looked at one of them and not it. <br /> It is very lame. A parody has some aspects that have some quality above it. This movie has no aspect. <br /> <br /> Save yourself. It's too late for me but just do not look at it.
