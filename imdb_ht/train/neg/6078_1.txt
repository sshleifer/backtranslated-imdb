I rarely comment on film but I have read the comments and others I can not believe that people applaud this celluloid garbage. I know there are certain people who have their own agenda but are allowed to take it on merit; The wrong act, the injection and the story felt as the director made it up as he went along. I will not focus on the sexual aspect of the film involving small children as the musicians in the movie obviously knew what they wanted and what they would like to hear. All I can say is a horrible movie, the content is poor and offensive, the output is unprofessional and I'm glad they could not make a movie like this legally today
