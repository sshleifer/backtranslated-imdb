I thought the movie was good at parts.the start was interesting .the first 30 minutes of the film was good. The camera windows in the first 30 minutes were weird and I did not like it causing them to not cover the actors entirely. I think the last 25 minutes of the film was really not great from what we expect so much in the movie. <br /> <br /> The dyalok did not make sense and I do not think they were very witty. <br /> I felt as though trying to copy such phonebooth films of dialogue, but failed miserably.it seemed as though many of the scenes between the actors were set for her sake and did not no sense in the story. <br /> <br /> The movie all features only laws and cats. <br /> I do not think it was a waste of time, it's an OK movie, but not gr8
