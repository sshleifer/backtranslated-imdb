A most famous but decent actor (Morgan Freeman) was not filmed for four years. When invited to participate in a new project, he asked the sick cousin of the director to release him in a Latin American neighborhood of Carlson in search of the manager of a small supermarket. She sees the gorgeous Spanish cashier's caretaker (Paz Vega) and gets attracted to her abilities. His driver never returns to catch him and red gives a ride to the actor. But before he has a job interview for the position of secretary of a construction company and the actor to help him to be prepared; Then they spend the afternoon together having a nice time. <br /> I'm a big fan of Morgan Freeman and Pegas Vega. However, the freeware "10 items or less" is absolutely disappointing. This low-budget film does not seem to have a scenario, and is supported by the chemistry and improvisation of Morgan Freeman and Pegas Vega and actually nothing happens about 82 minutes. The conclusion of clear open limits is simply ridiculous, and the character of Morgan Freeman returns to the level of its level spoon and tells the simple worker that they could never see each other again. Was she afraid of having a love affair with her and destroying her perfect world with her family? Or was it a clash of class, and realized that his fancy neighborhood would not be adequate to a simple worker in the lower classes? My vote is four. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "For Astro in Minha Vida" ("A Star of My Life")
