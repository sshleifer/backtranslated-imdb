The comment by "eliz7212-1" hits the proverbial "nail on the head" for this turkey in a program. But it is a stomach to watch William Shatner "cavort" and "dance" (yes, "the marks on the dance dance are needed for what Bill does). This show would be a big skit on SNL or MAD TV - and it's a few stars for a look, or so, to see Shatner, who seems to have taken "camp" in new heights - whether in a role or as himself. But the guy is funny. <br /> <br /> The girls in the hobbies and the data rolls data will be very much out-of-luck then turkey canceled - unless there is a revival in Vietnam whiskey-to-go -and, with a resurrected request for young young women to dance in cages once more. <br /> I watched the first competitor, who was annoying, and literally "dumber than one: post," again in absolute luck, walked away with a thousand miles or so. The second competitor, a bit smarter, but would likely get $ 1,000 on Jeopardy!, Got zonked by the card that asked to answer a special question - which he did not know, and so left with the island. <br /> This is a lot of game shows, which balance, and sometimes premium, large sum of everyday people, admitted a cheap effort, in general, to try woo viewers. Though the host is well rewarded and given away from six figures in an average episode, I suppose that revenue can be favorable - since you do not have a sitcom cast where several stars will receive six or seven figures per Episodes, and some great residual contracts as well. But I suspect even the best ones are going to wear thin before. This one has already been very attractive to this point. I think its offering, especially with James Spader, and others on Boston Legal should give us a lot of satisfaction in Bill Shatner's offering. Again, the above rating is simply appropriate to see Bill hoot and take off, perhaps one time; that should be enough.
