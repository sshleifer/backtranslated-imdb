First of all there are Gujarati Theater then there are Bollywood. Both have the strength and the fans. Director Vipul Shah should look elsewhere instead of Gujarati Theater when performing a Bollywood production. First it did Aankhen (adapted from a Gujarati play) - which had a unique scheme, but could not be kept as a Hindi movie. Now he has adapted another Gujarati play and call it Waqt - a race against time. In sum, the emotions are aliens. The scheme development is not for the Hindi movie. For example, playing the role of father and son best left in Gujarati theater - does not bring him into a Hindi movie. Even the comedy track is best left for the Gujarati stage. All performances are average - nothing is called over - prevent Shefali Chhaya Shah which is fantastic.
