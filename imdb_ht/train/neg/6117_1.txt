I can not say this is the worst movie ever to do, but personally I think that way because when it was originally released in the theater, (1) the first buzz was positive enough that my girlfriend insisted go see it, and we actually don't get the ticket for tickets, and (2) it's still the only "serious" movie I remember where the audience started snickering at a certain point and basically laughed at film in the rest of the way . Once we got to the scam (and endless) scam scene, I think everyone was given. <br /> <br /> Only positive I can concede is the lush where shooter. Oh, and there is also the Kiss Kiss, although it acts so wild that the nudity is unerotic and not more than a pectoral playback. The "dramatic tension" of this film is between the horrible kiss acting with her husband's terrible directions. The snake's fight must be one of the most incompetent "action" sections that have been filmed. However, this is one of those films that's bad enough, it can be worth looking at the level of unwanted humor. Definitely the worst movie I ever paid to see.
