I can not see why movies are remodeling this movie. The movie 1972 and McQueen and McGraw are almost a classic. Steve McQueen was an outstanding actor and Baldwin is only a shortage of actors. He has no passion in his play. Also the action of the original "Geta" was fantastic. Noticed by no action! It is almost boring despite the fact that film-making in 1972 was more difficult than in 1994. <br /> I do not understand how Baldwin is imprisoned in Mexico. I think this is a mistake in the story. So I think there was no need to notice it, or if they decided to notice a classic, they must choose an excellent actor for the first role, such as Johnny Depp or Brad Pitt.
