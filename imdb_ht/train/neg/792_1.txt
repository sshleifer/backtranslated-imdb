Thanks to the BBC for this show. I used to suffer from an inferiority complex, I was hated leaving home, talking to new people and I had an overwhelming sense that people hated me. However after watching an episode of 4 bloons that have no chance I started to change. After Episode 2 I started applying for new jobs, wearing fashionable clothes and I actually felt talented. When the end of the series I ran the sales department to work, hit a crowd of women and often won the karaoke competition down my premises. If you ever have a confident crisis and do not know where to turn then take a trip down to Poundland and pick up the DVD it's only 99p.
