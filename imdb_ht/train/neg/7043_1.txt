I was prepared to laugh during this movie as a science theater theater experience, but it was just boring. It appears that the producers had lots of enthusiastic friends biker, and in the casually decided to make a movie. <br /> It is often shaded. Many of the cyclists have climbed onto a dirt road, and the music played repeatedly. Unfortunately, Renee Harmon is barely in the movie. Harmon probably would have livened things. Maybe he had other commitments that day he filmed. Of course, cyclists are terrorizing a small town. Fighting, murder, a coward bull, a jump mechanic, etc. One of the cyclists still puts a soccer ball, a weak attempt to distinguish it from all the other bans. <br /> <br /> The script has nothing to offer. A scene features a biker attacking a woman, yelling in the lady's face "You're all the same! You're all the same!". We turned to the scene a minute later and again stated "You're all the same!". Could not the writer think of something more creative to say ?? At the end of the good guys killed the bad guys. We also learn that the marriage between middle aged Joe mechanic and young Susie was canceled. Susie goes to college, and we suddenly learn that Joe's wedding is still over (but with a different bride). End.
