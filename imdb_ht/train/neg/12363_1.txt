This is one of those movies that apparently was trying to artistic martial arts waves. Kinds like Billy Jack I guess. However, whereas Billy Jack had one remarkable martial arts scene no one in this one unless you consider some gentleman debates and regroup as such. We present in the star who described it as having learned the navy judo. I was in the navy and while they are very established in boxing, I really do not remember any emphasis on judo. As a result of the antagonist James Macarthur, referring to the judo when he offered an excuse for why he, a state champion wrestler, was so easy to beat. Lame.
