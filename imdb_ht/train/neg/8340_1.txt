One of the worst movies I've ever seen. Got so bored that I changed it to the Midway to watch the news. When I switch it back, I fall asleep. The movie begins with a dream, continues with a dream, and ends with a dream. Then there are a few more dreams in between. Come, what should I keep in mind? A movie needs to be an interesting reason. The minute you felt the movie was just a dream is when any movie-sensitive tender changed. Ever been someone insisting on telling you the dreams and what it meant? This is her press <br /> <br /> Absolutely terrible.
