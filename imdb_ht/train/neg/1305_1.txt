"Demons III: The Ogre" is not related to their pre-end on the "demons" and "The Demons 2 are cool classic 1980 classic" Demon III: The Ogre "is very stupid, bored, cheap monster confused about the writer is "Demon III: The Ogre" (Lamberto Bava and Dardano Sacchetti are poor quality and stupid writers who bored William Shakespeare's ghost or egg demon from the internet spider or what Huhuhuhuhu make the small dream Fi) .I am very sorry, I bought the special special box called "Demon" about 3 so-called "Demons III: The Ogre", "Other Hell", and "Black Demons" were not closed titles and subtitles cost $ 14.99 from the best shopping mall in Downey City. Why the Lamberto Bullet and Dardano Sacchetti are quality writers who make the movie as stupid almost like "Halloween III" by Michael Myer monster but the people wear Halloween. the "demons" and the "demons 2 are better stuffed the stupid" D emons III: The Ogre "is not part of the" demons "and" the demons 2 "They are even spirits. <br /> <br /> Thanks Juan Antonio De La Torre
