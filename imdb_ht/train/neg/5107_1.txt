There is a UK edition that shows that is rather less than the US version. The recipient will find a new kitchen or maybe bedrooms and bathrooms and are very grateful for what they have. The US version of this show is everything that TV reality should not be. Instead of making a few improvements to a home that occupiers can not afford or make the whole home become rebuilt. I do not know if this show tries to show what a disgusting welfare system exists in the U.S. or if you ask so much enough you will receive. Placement of rather vulgar products that takes place, particularly by Sears, is also uncalled for. Rsther spent a single family in a private area of ​​вЂ <вЂ <potential millionaires, it would be far better to help the community as a whole place instead of spending hundreds of dollars on one house, building something for the whole community ..... maybe a place where worthy and power tools can be borrowed and returned together with building materials so that everyone can benefit from their wishes. Providing it all one can cause great resentment among the rest of the local community that still lives in the same run down the houses.
