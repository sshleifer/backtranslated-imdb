Not really thriving in my opinion, but I wanted to cover myself, nevertheless. As executive producer, Morgan Freeman wants the audience to ignore the many absurdities of her character in 10 articles or less, a movie that has an intentional indie-feeling, and just to absorb into your all-this-you-case counselor term. She plays an alternate universe, semi-wash up the real version Morgan Freeman, who drives into an old Econovan by a kid all the way from Carson, CA from Brentwood to research his next movie role. Why Carson, is a jumping mystery. Residents of Cal. He could save the trip and go anywhere in the San Fernando Valley and found the same elements. Vega Pegas is beautiful to watch, a cross between Salma Hayek and Penelope Cruz, playing a grocery store in a big but slow down market that apparently is the ultimate source for Moragn Freeman's research. His character is only known as "Read" to talk about how actors are considering when they meet in real life by average people - "ps, this is 'him,' etc. Unfortunately, I was too distracted that he had all kinds of worldly wisdom and advice but there was no serious return back to his home in Brentwood, brought cash or debit cards, or was wise to keep a cell phone with him .. If one has such a High views of their own that they have an answer to everything as it does, then I have to see cash and a Blackberry showing intelligence and survival instincts good to preserve that big month that it definitely has. There is nothing really happened to this movie. I do not believe that either of the main character was substantially changed by meeting each other. It flirted with the idea of ​​adultery, but then thought fizzles. That I was the same as Steve Martin's shopgirl, without the sexual affair He was self-reliant for Freeman and Compelling Audience.
