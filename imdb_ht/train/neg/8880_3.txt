This movie was o.k. but it could be better. There are some spooky moments but not enough of them to make me ever see this movie again. Some scenes you might be fast forward and do not miss anything. The biggest flaw is that it is so predictable, and that's the reason why I rated it so low. She looks over but does not expect anything great.
