Pokemon 3 is little more than three or four episodes of the TV series, strung together without the usual ads. The story is typical of Pokemon (conflict, battle, and a resolution where all are happy at the end), and nothing original or strange in the animation. Some of the holes in the plot are filled in (on credit to close!) Without explanation, and everything is just a bit too sweet. <br /> Why do you see it on the big screen? The only reason is to be a part of your child's world. Both of my sons enjoy Pokemon, and by me showing an interest in what they love, we are closer. Seeing a movie in a theater is always different than seeing it on the tube, and my son enjoys the full movie-filled experience. I gave the movie a 4, especially in my child's point of view
