I am sad that a period of history is so fascinating and so rich in film material can be done at an event-hum. Wm C Quantrill has barely shown in the film, probably the most recent figure in the period. Frank James has never mentioned, Cole Younger, ditto, and bloody Bill Anderson, who would cry for his murder murdered every time he joined the fight was completely absent from the script. Instead, we were forced to look at things that never developed into anyone we care about. how sad. The costumes were beautiful but, however, as they were shot in Missouri. I hope Lee Lee will make another film of the period and try again, or some other movie markers will look at tremendous wealth of materials to write a screen play on.
