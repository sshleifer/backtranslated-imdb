Until now, the worst movie I've ever seen was Ben & Arthur. You really should check the reviews for this movie instead of this one. The statistics reviewed for this film were skewed positive in a relentless and dishonest push by some of those involved in making it, proof of which is fairly easy to uncover online. At least anyone who made Ben & Arthur was honored enough to let her stand on its own unstable, instead of dishonestly promoting it for suckers like I would buy it. <br /> <br /> All about this movie is terrible, the script, the story, filing, acting, the direction, the photography, the correction, the music ... what else goes to a movie? Whatever it is, here is as bad as it gets. If it was not so unpleasant it would be ridiculous. I continued to think he thought he should get better, because I did not yet discover that none of the positive reviews for his are serious. <br /> It does not take much money to make a big movie, nor a low budget means a movie has to be bad. My favorite experience in a kick-buddy is amazing Gus Van Sant Mala Noche, but there are many others. Secret Sidelire ?? Cutting the Principal or the Original is bad not because the people who made it had no money, but because they were acute aggression and no talent for anything at all except self-promotion.
