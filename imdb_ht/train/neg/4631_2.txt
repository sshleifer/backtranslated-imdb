Although Ayers Misty (strip strip) is certainly attractive as the blond lead, this flicker is just an excuse to leave her strip down in her panties a few times (no stripping in 1954 then film made, by 1965 ). <BR> <br /> The guy who hired her to work in a whorehouse resembles Abbott Bud at Abbott & Costello. Most of the other women are unpleasant, and the drunken woman is semi-fun in a creepy way. <br /> A 2 out of 10. Ms. Ayers has a curvacious physique, but you can not judge any talent acting because the film is totally post-armed. Some of these "movie films", usually made later than this one, are interesting in some ways, but this is really a firm firmware. South Melton (MADE FOR DADDY) LED. Some samurai-like facial expressions and interesting apartments, but there's really no here.
