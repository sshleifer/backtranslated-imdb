Salvage is the worst so-called horror movie I've ever seen. There is nothing far horrible about it. It does not deserve to be in such a fine genre. First of all I do not see how many people can think this piece of crap like a big movie. If I have written something like boring and absolutely ridiculous as this should I laugh at and too embarrassed others' questions in the sort of it. Secondly: the act is terrible and the lead actress is excruciatingly ugly. Third: The story sucks, used before, and the excuse that a cheap film it is not an excuse. It's summer on the back of the case, it reveals the whole story. I do not recommend that you watch this movie unless you have 80 minutes of garbage on something that will let you regretting that you watch it. I feel really bad for those Crooks and the irony of their names. All hail Anthony Perkins !!!!!!!!!
