An anthology is always risky business and I think this effort should be praised. There are a lot of talents involved here. A great many talented actors, directors and writers. Unfortunately, I could not really enjoy this movie based on three issues I had. <br /> <br /> First of all, the segments vary greatly in tone and quality. And unfortunately some of them conflicts with others. <br /> Second, several segments feel underdeveloped me. Like pills in good stories that never come to fruition. I'm not talking about happy endings here (or even an ending period) but rather lacking basic basic or even solid setups that draw you in. Last but not least, I did not feel New York with her they were well portrayed. <br /> <br /> What you are leaving with is film-high short cuts that can still be of some interest, but will let the average viewer satisfy.
