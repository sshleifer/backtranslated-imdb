I guess that "Gunslinger" was not quite as god-terrible as most of the movie "Mystery Science Theater 3000" show, but western fairs are not Roger Corman's stronghold. Portrayed Rose Hood (Beverly Garland) became Sheriff in an Old West town after her husband sheriff came to murder and has to fight off the villain, the movie is pretty predictable. John Ireland is the new hubby Rose, secretly working for incense Allison Hayes (yes, the 50-foot woman). Also appearing briefly is Corman co-star Dick Miller as a mailman (Miller nowadays star of Joe Dante's movies). <br /> I want to say that you'll probably want to watch the "MST3K" version really enjoy this movie. They had a great time with her.
