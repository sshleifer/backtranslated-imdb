Beautiful actor. <br /> <br /> Lousy script and not too big direction either. My main problem is I simply did not care about any of these people. Not the killer is not the victim. The settings were pretty drab. Dennis Quaid's character was so badly written in, I did not even care when the end came. He made his kid back. Big deal! I wanted my money back.
