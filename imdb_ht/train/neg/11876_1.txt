I think this is almost all I need to say. I feel obligated to explain my actions though. I've basically never seen such an artisan production, and I mean that in every sense of the word. Although physical camera work, MIC boom operations and other technical aspects of this movie are ridiculous, unfortunately it's not the only areas. <br /> <br /> Unlike some classical independent films that have been saved by the characterization of large and drawn characters, this unfortunately has a terrible script, terrible act and worst of all, annoying characters. It's a crime that per the independent film that gets, such distribution as Haiku Tunnel, has a 101 other independent films that die silent deaths. I do not know which Kornbluth clerk is aware of Sony, but this can only be my explanation of how this amateur family production has ever received distribution. I'm quite bemused as to why they have chosen this up. <br /> <br /> The only part of this movie that holds out any intrigue is its title. However, the reason for this is even a down. I hope that this review will save a few people who can be intrigued by this movie title from going to watch it. I've seen a lot of movie in my time, and I'm very forgiving when in the movie, but that was too much. I will never forget 'tunnels', marking an important point in my life experience in movies. Shame it is like a low point. <br /> <br />
