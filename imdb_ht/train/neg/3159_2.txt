I'm sorry to guys, I've already written my opinion in this movie but today was the first day I watched some of the other comments. There is quite a lot of people who agree with me but what's awesome is that some people really look like this movie. I do not like writing nasty reviews or criticizing other people's opinions but I think it only just cautions anyone who can handle if you do not see this movie. This is not a good movie. I really love movies and I'll just look at anything but this movie made it to the incredibly short list of movies I watched and was happy to leave half. If you really are tempted to tempt, watch the trailer ... this is the mistake I've done because the movie is all in essence of the trailer ... then there are no surprises, just some chokanye dialogue wasted time. I love Michael Vartan in aliases and would hate to criticize him but I think it's my duty to stop others wasting hours of life on a movie like this !!
