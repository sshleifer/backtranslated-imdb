First of all there was not really anything in this film that grabbed me really. It was not a bad movie, just another movie where I said "Well, that was nothing special" after I saw it. There was probably drama and stuff, but she simply did not grab me but more seamed semi-dull. As I said in the title it seamed very cheap in a way. The quality of the movie itself (the images) seamed as a low quality and reminds me more of some cheap make for TV movie than a well-respected English movie maker. The angles and vaccines were very amateur as in my opinion. There have not really been any vaccine or effects as they produce interesting scenes. I did not see many English films and what I saw did not really impress me more than this and seamed similar kinds of do with the camera work, colors and so. "Games" tried to be more cool, hip & smart (see my review of "Lola Rennt" on this optional), but did not succeed for me either. In general just a little indifferent movie that was not anything special (at best, I'm scared) and basically unfortunately more than two hours wasted.
