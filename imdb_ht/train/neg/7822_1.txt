This movie is a very poor attempt to make money using a classic theme. I used to love Superman movies, but this one made me want to shoot myself. Very poor act, outrageous special effects, and a draw equal to zero. Summary: Superman left the earth, because scientists discovered pieces of his home planet, some were in space (duh), telling no girlfriend before leaving (duh yet), taking in a spaceship (?!?), Come back I think 5 years later, and look forward to hooking up with her girlfriend again (who now brodle her son, son, in my humble opinion at least 7 years old). And what about that Lex Luthor? Try to grow a new continent in order to sell land? Please !! <br /> I vote 1 out of 10 for this movie, only because I'm not allowed to vote 0. If you have anything else to do with your time, do not go to see this movie, and even if you have nothing Other things to do, stay home and watch TV!
