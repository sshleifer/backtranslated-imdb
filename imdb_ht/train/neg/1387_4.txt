It's hard to believe an "action" packed Jet Li film would be so boring, but this was transcendent waste. The plot is an addition to other Hong Kong chopsocky flicks. The martial arts are all special effects and no human talent. <br /> It's a funny book story about a group of super-human soldiers who must be killed because they are mentally unstable, one of the numbers (Li) kept in an incompetent army to save and rebuild a life like a Pacific librarian . Killer rescues rescue with a Austin quality scheme may take over the world, and He sheds his new life to save the world. <br /> <br /> This version I saw was armed, and that might have accentuated the cheesiness of the wafer-thin and humorous-scheme 25-cent special effects. But I suspect the same Ninja-Turtle-watching 8-year children who have found this juvenile and hollow.
