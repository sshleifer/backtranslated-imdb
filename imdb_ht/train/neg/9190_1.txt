This is far from the movie I've ever watched. I've seen some very awful movies in my time, but this takes the cake, no, wait, I mean all the damn baker. It's so bad that I believe a word describes how you will feel after watching this atrocity has yet to be created. Please just make yourself a favor, if you ever get the urge to watch this and watch thirty minutes in this annoying Barney dinosaur, then multiply that thirty times fold, and you would still only get a small fraction of The horror you should be in store for. In summon, I guess you really can call it a horror movie, but only if you want to be horrendous by worst acting in the business and free bloody story. <br /> <br /> Real Rating, -10 Excavations
