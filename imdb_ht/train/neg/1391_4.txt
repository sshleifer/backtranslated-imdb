Before that was made for TV movie started, I had relatively low expectations. It's because he did after the final episode of the series was revealed and many of the original series were gone. There is no President Sheridan, Delenn, Lennier, London, Vir, G'kar or Lyta. If you remember, in the second of the last episode of the series, all the regulars except Zack, Vir and Captain Lockley left B-5 forever. Now, for this film they brought back Garibaldi (who was not in the B-5 latest film) to join Zack and the Captain and the doctor to make a brief and irrelevant appearance. But because many go to the old chemistry, this film is already very disabled. The film is about a Hunter Hunter (Martin Sheen) who leads to Babylon 5 in search of a full globe and soul stolen from a reclamation hidden by an archaeologist (Ian McShane). A lot of spooky mumbo-jumbo things happen, but frankly it was all pretty funny and pointless. Yeah, yes, the station almost blown up but was saved and all but frankly I felt like it was a case "had to do that - and to do this a lot better in the past". <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />! tried pressure to close them, was slapped with a lawsuit. This was fluffed, but it gave a few laughs - something drawn to other sad was surely missing. <br /> <br /> By the way, Sheen first did a great job playing the Hunter - and her wild eyes with rare deliveries. However, repeatedly throughout the episode he dropped out of character. This should have been spotted and corrected. So the final verdict is this only for the total dead-hard B-5 black (like myself). Others see that he might assume that the series is aspiring - that's a big injustice. This is a great example of a show not knowing when to quit.
