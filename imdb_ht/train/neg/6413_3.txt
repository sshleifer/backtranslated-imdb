My friends and I went to this movie do not know what to expect, but hope for the better. When we came out, we were only a little more informed about what the scheme of the movie actually was. Though not the worst movie I've ever seen, I definitely do not recommend spending your money to see it in the theater. Perhaps a friend has to rent it for you (it's not even worth the rent, either) if you really want to see it. <br /> <br /> When a movie is so complicated that you have no idea what's going on until the last five minutes, there's really not much to say in its defense. The act was decent, more than you would expect to get out of this movie, and some of the shots were good, but it was all bogged down to a bite sketch and script script. actually so bad that as soon as it came out, I went and bought a ticket to see a good movie just cleanse my mind. I recommend that all of you just skip the first step and go see a good movie instead.
