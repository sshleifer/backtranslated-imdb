If Todd Sheets should be out and admit that this movie has intended to disrupt the zombie genre, I might change my rating to eight. Try to imagine a movie where every scene, line, and even every nuance current was designed to be a funny parody. I could probably crap out alphabet soup, rearrange what was left in the letters, and still have a better script. Two scenes in particular come to mind when I think of this movie. SPOILER ALERT! One is when Mike's dad and other dad walk, I repeat down a stairway filled with zombies. This is a staircase and even if they blaze up against the flailing honors, nothing happens. When they reach the end, the former sailor turns around, says "Your God is a horny battalion," and one shoots. The other is in the military complex. The girl seeks a zombie with a machete and is immediately surrounded. The camera is moving around for about forty seconds, while it is surrounded by zombies in the arm's length. He then almost relaxed running out of the crowd and joins the others. SPOILER ALERT pass! These scenes must be viewed as believers. Still, I enjoy this movie as much as almost any comedy just because it's so damn funny. Kudos's Todd Sheet to find many people in her movie and she has the drive to do it, but not really for anything else.
