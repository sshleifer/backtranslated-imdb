This movie sucks! They took something out of my childhood, and rape on a floor! This movie was so bad I wanted to go home and keep "dukes" my dvds and cry in a corner. The cast was awful! He was not the "princes", he was Stiffler and Jackass driving a car. When Was Hogg Boss Evil? When did Rosco a tough guy? They've never been! Boss Hogg was greedy and Rosco was a fool. When did Jesse smoke? He never did! Now, do not get me wrong, I'm very liberal and nothing wrong with a little chiba, but she had no place in this movie! The only good thing about this film was the trailer before the movie and the end credit. It was a waste of money and time. Avoid at all fees !!!!!!!!
