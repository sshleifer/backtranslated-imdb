I thank God I did not go to the movies for this movie. I would be very sorry for the money I gave. I saw it on TV and I could not expect my eyes. I wonder if any movie can get worse than this one. They spent a million dollars in this movie for nothing. terrible act with terrible scenarios. I think the others who wrote the comments are the man working in this movie company;) it's great great debacle! in the year 2000 can still laugh at this kind of movie? anbarasan ...
