Interesting movie about an actual event held during the Civil War in Vermont. She kept my attention to the end and I do not regret her look. I never read any of the incident this incident so I was curious to see if the rebels pulled it off. I like the historic movie in that era. My complaint is with Uniform Confederation. They look too good !!! The act was a little stiff at times. I love the old man eating potatoes breaking because he did not have any tooth. The injured wounded soldier play with a hound was a little weird. In general, it was a descent movie.
