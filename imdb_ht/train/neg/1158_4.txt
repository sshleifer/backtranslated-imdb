Tenants Two writers struggle to complete the books in a home but not empty. They first help each other and then slowly tension between them to start building. This is based on a Bernard Malamud novel and unfortunately everyone speaks as if they are in that novel. Very little in the dialogue is natural, its purple and romantic with shades of sense. It is as if a major English college with a full head of the script's script's pretense. It's terrible and I get to instantly immune to anything the movie has meant, which is a shame since the film is populated with great performance in head to bottom. Snoop dogs down are fine forms, unfortunately none of them may be about to come the falseness of the words and quotes. <br /> I can not really recommend this movie. While not really bad, its very preachy and pump at the point of making you want to walk away. I lost interest less then a third of the way in and struggled to reach the end. If you are interested I would try it on the cable, but I would not put out good money to see it.
