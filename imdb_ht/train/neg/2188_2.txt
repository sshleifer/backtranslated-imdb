After a car accident, an angry scientist (Jason Evers) holds the head of his fianc√©e (Virgina Leith) alive. Then he goes on the rode looking for the perfect body to do all his work again. Pretty lame all the way around, there is nothing to deliver here. Also at the disposal are: Leslie Daniels, Bonnie Sharie and Bruce Brighton. Someone should have helped put this one out of its misery. Let him die.
