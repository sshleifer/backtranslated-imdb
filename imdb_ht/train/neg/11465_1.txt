Without a doubt, this is one of the worst pictures I've ever paid the money they see - the type of flick you choose from despair of the mall movie theater during a Christmas holiday when you missed the times to start for anything good but still dead put on seeing a movie! And it's exactly how I came to see this stink bomb ... In the distance of the best part of three decades I can always smell the rotten fish that constitutes this story line. Unbelievable conspiracy - that a killer whale brings a bad one against the sea - is mockingly. And this over all, except for a term "love theme" completely out-of-place that plays on the finish of a movie that devoid of a love story. At least Charlotte Rampling is beautiful (in a two-dimensional role) but Richard Harris just tied the scenery. He had no Captain Quint (Robert Shaw) and this is no "jaw". Thanks, I've put most of it out of mind and when I run across it on TV when my TV moves on instantly. "Danger, Do Robinson!" See current t.v. commercial showing a candle-looking husband and wife ("Orca - I love Orca ...") - at least it's about sixty seconds. This flicker represents 92 minutes in my life that I will never get back.
