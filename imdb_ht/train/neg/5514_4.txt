I do not know about you, but what I love about Tom and Jerry Cartoons is the (often violent) interaction between the two characters. Mouse in Manhattan sees Jerry leaving Tom behind to have an adventure in New York, and as far as I'm concerned, this one definitely suffers from a lack of cats! <br /> As magic as Jerry's exploration of 'Big Apple' might be for other T & J fans who have commented here on IMDb, I could not wait for this self-indulgent trash at the end, So I could watch the cartoon on my DVD. In fact, the only part of the entire episode that I really enjoyed was when Jerry almost 'bought the farm', hanging prefabricated on the end of a broken candle, hundreds of feet above a busy road.
