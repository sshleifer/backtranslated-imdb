Flight in anger starts as General Tom Barnes (Angus MacInnes) organizes an official test flight in the X-77, a new infiltration fighter and the ability to literally turn invisible. General Barnes gives his own pilot to Colonel Ratcher (Steve Toussaint) and everything goes well until the X-77 disappears, even more literally Barnes wanted as Ratcher flies to Northern Afghanistan & delivers it to a terrorist group like Black Nut to lead by Peter Stone (Vincenzo Nicoli) who plans to use the X-77 fly in US Airspace to undermine & release some bombs that will kill many. General Barnes is worried by the loss of his plane and sent to one person John Sands (co-writer & executive producer Steven Seagal) to get it back & kill all the bad guy in the process ... <br /> / This American, British and Romanian co-production led by Michael Keusch & was the third film in which he led Seagal after the same terrible Shadow Man (2006) & Attack Force (2007), Likely for someone to decide the partnership did not work with a unsuspecting publicly illuminated killing any further collaboration between the two. Apparently the flight of anger is a remake of almost-word-for-word scenes in Black Thunder (1988) starring Michael Dudikoff and many of the same character even share the same name exactly the same dialog could be used without The makers even have to change things like names although I have to admit I never see Black Thunder and therefore can not be compared to that. The anger of anger is a horrible movie, the harm done and writing waste in time by Seagal specialized in those days. It's boring even though it's not slow, the character of the poor, it's full of glowing, things happen at random, the plot is poor, the reasoning behind the events is not existent & it's a very lazy production he never once convinced the viewer that they are anywhere near Afghanistan or the appropriate military procedures have followed. Scenes of action are lame & no real stimulation of it, the bandits are boring as their heroes & it's right down there with the worst Seagal made. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />! Very abruptly as it's all too obvious we are watching clips from other (best) films in Hell, Seagal never even go anywhere near an aircraft in this. The action scene comprised of shot-outs that seriously edited it hard to say who is who & of course Seagal breaks arm peoples. The whole production feels very cheap & too. <br /> <br /> The IMDB estimates that there was a budget of about $ 12,000,000 which I think total waste, I mean if so where all the money goes away? Although wearing in Afghanistan is a war torn arid desert flight fury seems to have filmed down the local woods, it was actually shot in Romania and the Romanian country by making a convincing Afghanistan. The act is terrible as one would expect & Seagal seems armed again. <br /> <br /> Flight of anger is a terrible movie movie that is boring, amateur & is a nearly scenic scene-to-scenes movie movie anyway. Another really lazy and bad gambling action product from Seagal, why do I even bother any more?
