After life is a miracle, I did not expect much. It's hard to believe that these films are made by the same male as you remember Dolly Bell, for example. Zavet is two hours of antique funny with no history. Humorous and unbridled wildlife in Underground seems to have degenerated into pathetic buffoonery here. It appears that Kusturica has gone steadily since it started trading life-affirming, starting with Black Cat, White Cat, which I think was great, but already had some disturbing signs of demeanor. I liked her movie very early, and that's why it's especially disappointing to see something like this. Let's hope his next will be great.
