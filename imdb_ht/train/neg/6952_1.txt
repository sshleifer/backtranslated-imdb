Really the most terrible in a huge range. It should not have been called Battlestar Galactica, because it's only the same in name alone. Too much change in just having change. You have characters turned out to be male and female, the Asian black silk all in a way to "attract female audience," when there were already strong female characters that could just have done much. Gone is Egypt's feelings. Gone are the quest for the earth. Lack of silence to the Terminator rejects the film, especially when someone makes a fembot. Granted the original show had a lot of cheese in it, but it had a big one. They tried to keep on the following, but giving their fans nothing to work and basically spitting in their faces as they make it their own story. Changes are good, when doing something better, not just doing them.
