There was more interesting polish documentary on worm farming, in brail_ !! The competition (worm farming) has a better draw and characters more interesting. I was physically ill after watching this movie. The cheating husband (I think doug__scott_) was a joke of all the words in the word. Poor Jennifer needs to really work, and that was with the accent !!. Places and random meetings reminded me of a high school prank, and showed humility in a 10 year old cooking class. It was bad that I thought I would write the end named "This is not a laxative". Thanks to listening it was a great weight of my consciousness.
