This "movie" is more like a music video. Kusturica said in an interview from 2004 that when she made movies, she feels like making music, and when she's making music, she feels like making movies. The best thing to "Promise me this" is the music, written by Stribor Kusturica. Kusturica said in the same interview, for his dialogue in these films, it sounds like noise. "My Promise" has very little "noise". <br /> I love "life is a miracle". It also includes music videos for the first 30 minutes and at some point later, but it has a nice draw. "Promise me this" no scheme. I was waiting for this movie and great expectations, because I read, that the script was written by Ranko Bozic - one of my favorite love scriptwriter, who also participated in "Life is a Miracle". Ranko Bozic writes great dialogue, but for Kusturica are "noisy", and many of my regrets, I've seen only two dialogues, which I could identify as written by Ranko Bozic. The other part of the script was used by the director to make his chaotic music video for the music of his son Stribor. <br /> <br /> Gordan Mihic (the man who wrote the scripts for "Time of the Gypsies" and "Black Cat White Cat") said in an interview that Kusturica never followed the script. "Black Cat White Cat" was the only script, for which Kusturica said, that he will not touch it. According to Gordan Mihic, after all Kusturica comes back to the script, and if he does not, he does not make a good movie. And I think this is the case with "Promise me this". It should have followed the script in Bozic Ranko. <br /> <br /> "My Promise" is billed as a "comedy" but there are very few moments that make me laugh. Comedian moments are in the same style as "black cat cats", but are not funny at all. I think the difference comes from the reality, that "Black Cat White Cat" was written by Gordan Mihic. However, I know some people, who love "Promise me this", found it very positive film.
