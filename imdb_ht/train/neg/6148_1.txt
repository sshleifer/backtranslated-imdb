The first, the movie was not true to do at all. I just saw the documentary in a few days earlier and the movie was nothing like it. First of all, Nash was a genius in mathematics and that's what the film should be about by a story about a man who was healed and found love in the end and so on. Also there is a lot of scenes that were just plainly wrong - the scene where he was up beside a bike at the campus that happened in the university year earlier it was not after him. In my opinion Russell Crowe did not fit into that party at all since it does not look the intelligent / individualist type, therefore, he really could not play one. It would be great if it would focus more on the math (like Pi) and not the lovelife over-dramatized. At this level ABM was too Hollywood-ich and too superfaced to be great. Personally, I think it's not crazy nor paranoid and it's been something since someone in this caliber tends to know more than our "younger mortal". 5/10
