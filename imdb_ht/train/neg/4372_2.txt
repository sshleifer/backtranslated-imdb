I love Don Knotts, let me just say that up front! It is an enormous talent with the best of what he does, which is a nervous show, lovably befuddled deficit cast into a position of authority. It is fabulous in this role as Roy Fleming, the astounding astronomer, but the movie is very dull, really, though like a kid to my brother and I'm happy to watch this and its other movie. It is always worth seeing but really it is a movie that is best enjoyed by children. I would categorize it as a 100% family-friendly and something you could sit and watch with your kids on a family night. <br /> Like all Knotts' films, there's a great throw of beloved actor characters and you can not help but smile when Knotts gives one of its shock, open-mouth stars, no matter how old adult and jaded you. <br /> From an adult perspective, one thing I think is great about this movie is how it captures NASA in the 1960s - all new modern buildings, the hope, the optimism, the future! And I was surprised at how suave and studying Leslie Neilsen was back then. Only the complaint about the story is Roy's favorite interest, a rather threadbare, unlikeable woman who can not give him the day until it becomes a big shot - if you are like me, you'll hope it gives him shove- to the end. Be cautious - you will whistle melody in theme for the day after watching, it's catchy.
