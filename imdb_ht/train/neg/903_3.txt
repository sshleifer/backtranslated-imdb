The "Stella Dallas" 1937 and Barbara Stanwyck have not exactly aged enough how one thought a semi-updated version of the story would work right now is a real puzzler. Perhaps they were accompanied by brutal Better Midler could do something out of it, but this secret script beat him. Plot on a female bartender who has a baby from marriage, and later years gives the young girl about the rich father of the child so she will have a shot of a better life, can not escape tattoos, old-fashioned trappings and feelings. Midler works best with a movie director who can control his excesses but failing to come here; Stephen Collins is stolid as the man who changed his life, but Trini Alvarado is well driven as Midler's daughter. This is what used to be referred to as a "woman's photo", a wall, but it does not pass correction because it remains too loyal to its 1930s backgrounds. * 1/2 from ****
