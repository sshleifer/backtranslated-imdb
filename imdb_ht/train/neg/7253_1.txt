We rent the DVD is expected for a good west. The film was beautiful and the scenes were reasonable, but the ideas were very bad. Here is my problem with the movie. <br /> <br /> In the first part, why exactly did the bad guy kill me the landlord? Not really connected with the movie except for establishing how it was sick and having a cache. The bank's employee goes wrong just too bad for convincing to decide to hire the assassin of his employer. At least keep we guess. No character developed at all for the bank owners or employees of banks. <br /> <br /> Very long delay in much of anything happening. <br /> <br /> Absurd quote that Martin still needs to see the judge after the gang was confessed to killing in-laws. Even more absurd he confessed to judges and judges will not listen to the sheriff guy. Even more ridiculous that his Martin hangs and breaks rest, then the sheriff takes him to gunshot finally head back to his town and saves his wife from the bad bank employee. Is it not just to return after the rapid relief of the gang to save wife and arrest bad guy guy? Just send the judge a note that gang confessed before being killed on trail ???? !!! In general, very sad to act and no film is available.
