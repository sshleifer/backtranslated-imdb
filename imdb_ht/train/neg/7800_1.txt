Beyond Livy cheap, this injection-on-exercise video in incompetence was hard to get in. He got the typical gorilla that you would expect in a zombie movie, but none of the atmosphere needed to make it worth while. What's strange is that this is a German amateur video, and the version I see is English-armed! The doubles seem to be American fans (the German peninsula!) Who can not decide whether they want to play it right or turn it into a comedy. A character (a German white, of course) is armed by a black guy apparently, who speaks with thick ebonics! 'Kno wahm sayin', Comrade?
