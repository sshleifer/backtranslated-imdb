I really tried to love this movie. It deals with a significant problem in any society: sex addiction. <br /> In this story we learn that you can lose everything when you are addicted to sex. In this case, our main characters and heroes, for non-stop sex and all kinds of women (crazy, crooked, neurotic) endangering her marriage, work, and even her life. Their production value is terrible; especially the act. Oh, you will not enjoy any of the sex scenes, many of them doing in very poor taste and you might think you're watching a movie made flick. <br /> Second, the plot is just non-essence. How could a smart and beautiful wife stand up all the nasty things of her husband? How can he believe it ?! The threesome situation is priceless and it will make you chuckle for a while. <br /> Also, the stage and assistant of theatrical film is just freeware and will let you think "wtf?". <br /> <br /> Scene like these you will get a lot. <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie. Please avoid it; It's not soft core, it's not a document, it's not a dramatic feature. It is a pretentious attempt of a so-called documentary director or whatever. <br /> Only Mrs. Kinski's leg on the exhibits are worth the look. I keep it on HBO and I'm glad I did not spend my money on it. But these 90 minutes in my life will not come back.
