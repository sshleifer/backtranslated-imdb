This would be the worst movie ever to do, and is perhaps worth seeing for this alone. Streisand is incredible as a young woman who owns a man in order to study Judaism. The band is tortured, featuring Barbara belting out some of the feather legs ever put in film. And do not even find I started on the field. You will actually get more chuckles from this film than many comedies because it is soooooooo terrible. The rampant season at Streisand, thought he could somehow lift this stinker at Oscar Heights, lead to this disaster. I am very sure that the novelist, Isaac Bashevis singer, has hated this film and never forgives Streisand. I can not blame him. This film is like watching a car crash in slow motion for two hours and the sound of the 'sound of music' being played back on an old ground dish. It's really bad. I'm surprised that anyone from Streisand enjoyed this film on the level he intended.
