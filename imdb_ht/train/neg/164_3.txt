I'm not a big fan of Star Trek, but I was looking forward to that. I was intrigued by the pre-hype descriptions of the Enterprise, its submarine-submarine style and rough technology side by side compared to the treats we used. <br /> I did not see anything all that interesting in this pilot. I found the plot to be confusing and confusing. <br /> I'll admit that I've done as some of the character development - the representations of the people as a 'adolescent' species ready to bitch outgrow were fun. Cow Vulcan has a hell of an incredible shelf. <br /> But I do not think I'll get hooked on this series. <br /> <br> 3/10
