what type of sh * t this? Power Rangers vs Freddy? He watched with as good as the first movie ever since the beginning of the party where the protagonists found super power in their dreams, and began to be childish. This should have been rated PG or PG-13 rather than R. I hope to see some very mature things but it's only for 1/3 of the movie. The rest is for small children. Plus it focuses too much on Christianity. I know Freddy a demon, but there are so many religions that have different ways to fight the demons. Why is it still Christian? This is Orientalism total and full of white / Western superiority. Do not watch this, show it to the little kids who love guard power.
