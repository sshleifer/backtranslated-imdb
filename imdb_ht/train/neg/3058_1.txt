When I was back in the 1970s, a local theater had Matinees Children every Saturday and Sunday afternoon (no one remembered?). They showed this one year around Christmas time. Me and some friends went to see her. I hope a cool movie Santa Claus. What I got was a terribly armed (you can say) and really climb movie. <br /> Something about Santa Claus and the Merlin magician (do not ask me what these two are doing in the same movie) Battle of Satan (some Joker in a funny devil suit complete with horns!). The images made me cramps in my chair. I always find Santa Spooky to start with what did not help. The guy in the suit of Satan did not help. But what really frightened me was the wooden hacking that pulled the sled Santa. When she was wounded up with the creepy sound made with the movements - I remember to have nightmares about things! All these years I still remember walking out of that theater much more than slightly affected by what I saw. My friends were also in fear. I just saw an announcement for her on TV and all those nightmare came roaring back. This is a creepy, disturbing small Christmas movie that will probably scare the pants to any kid who sees it. Avoid this one - unless you really want to punish your kids. This gets a 1.
