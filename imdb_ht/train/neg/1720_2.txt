A handful of nonprofessional actors are terrorized by a prehistoric creature. This creature looks at about thirty seconds in the fringe stop-motion animation, but oh how long you will be for that margin when the rest of the movie is the animation replaced by production assistant lifting into an inner tube and tooth. No time for horrors then film will be half aircraft by these commercial pirate delivering boating locations, which suddenly become the lead characters; but yet you have to admit watching them to try to be funny is better than plodding around the sheriff. Only at the end of one of them gets to eat and the other is sitting on a stone crying tears of solitude - this is no fun!
