a movie that tries to be far smarter than its musicians can produce. The movie twist and turns into Miriad draws "surprises" to a desperate attempt of the puzzle puzzle audience, offcourse the keen "scheme" and steamy scenes they thought would help him along. <br /> <br /> james belushi is involved in this pseudo-intellectual attempt and just sleeping in the movie. even apply to the other "actors". The draw is quite funny and tacky. Whih in itself is not such a crime, but towards the end, the tremendous tremendous scouts are very tedious and boring. <br /> However, the movie manages to generate some interest in the middle. at all worth a lazy look on a really boring day, but not cold if you miss this one. <br /> <br /> a rather lame 4!
