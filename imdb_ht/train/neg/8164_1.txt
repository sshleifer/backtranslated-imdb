I saw this film in a real movie theater (probably $ 2.00) and my cousin and uncle. We've been around 11 and 12, I guess, and really in scary movies. I remember being so excited to see him because my cool uncle let us choose the movie (and we probably never did that again!) And soo shame after that !! Just boring and not afraid. The only thing I can remember was Corky Pigeon from Silver Spoons, and that was not all that great, just someone I recognized. I've seen bad movies before and this one was still stuck out of my head as the worst. This was from what I can remember, one of the most boring, non-scary, gambling in our collective $ 6, with a movie waste. I read some of the reviews saying it's worth a look and I say, "It's too much of it," but I would not even have to bother. Not even so bad it is good.
