A question for all your girls out there: If someone you never encountered before accidentally phoned you to the goal and continue to do so in the most unspoiled moments you should be intrigued by him or so freaked out the `D Phone Police ? Yeah what I thought so I would not be able to swallow the idea of ​​Marti Gerrard setting up with the unwarrented attention of Connor Hill <br /> <br /> ***** MILD SPOILERS ***** < br /> <br /> This is a really dumb story. Connor Hill's wife is murdered and the plot turns on the question is Connor Martha Marti so he can have an alibi? But there's a massive space in logic here, did not Connor worked a hit man? Something the prosecution seems to have been ignored. And there was no forensics in the murder scene? So why do the rest of the whole trial of Connor speaking martyred at the time of murder? Dumb. Dumb. Dumb. And it`s as predictable as it is brainless <br /> <br /> Memory to respect this movie is that for someone who did the winter Olympics Marti Gerrard is a really crap skiing downhill
