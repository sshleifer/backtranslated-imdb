Any movie that has a title like ridiculous as the "Tackle" should automatically attract the attention of any bad movie lover, but the plot is far different than that one can expect after viewing the DVD cover. The bush is not a good movie. It falls into the category of similar films (and probably was) filmed on a home video camera. The act is terrible. I have not heard and seen such a wooden act since Trol 2. There are many scenes and stripping and gender, but they are clearly flying in too fast. Characters are morons and entirely forgettable. The last (which I will not spoil) can be easily anticipated after watching the very first scene. Due to the cheesy nature of the movie, there is nothing aside of the terrible production value is really scary (terrible attempts at Gore Realism, a driving scene where the car is clearly stationary, etc.). Recommended for bad movie affiliate only.
