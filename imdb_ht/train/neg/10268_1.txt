Without a doubt this is one of the worst movies I've ever wasted on! The plot is, am sorry, I said there was a draw? The horrible moment was when ..., nope can not think of one! The best special effect that hides me under the bed covers was ..., nope can not think of one for that either. You knew who the killer was right from the start. There was nothing scary about the entire movie, in fact only the two exciting wave bells were when you saw the kid, Misty, in the shower and when you saw Toppan nurse seduced. This movie should only look to get an idea of ​​how not to make a horror movie !!!
