Unashamedly ambitious sci-fi from Kerry Conran, for this person is clearly a work of love. Unfortunately it's just not that good. It all starts quite well - with a note but note delay, a mix of Lucas and Hitchcock style editing and the brilliant movie in a Spielberg. The movie also references numerous pulp sci-fi novels, series and films as diverse as the Earth Day was still, superman, metropolitan, planet in the pockets, giant farm, star wars and the spy who loved me. The movie however, fails to be as good as any one of these for many reasons: being the primary that it's such a job of love, so concerned and throwing everything in the screen and creating a new brave world, Conran actually forgot about making a movie. There is little or no tension, atmosphere or magic on offer here despite aerial battle, dinosaurs and race-against set-time pieces. Even the elements have fallen flat. This is a great way to look at things though - these elements mostly weaken because nothing feels it all real and so obviously the false-green-screen just looks like a video game half the time and it's obvious The actors were stuck on. The actors do not get much either - Jude Law is wild, Gwyneth Paltrow is annoying and stupid, Angelina Jolie is wasted - and it's all because of a terrible script - the clown explains almost everything. It's a decent experience and some can find a nostalgia feel but ultimately this is a free stage in the world of yesterday. Nice finish though.
