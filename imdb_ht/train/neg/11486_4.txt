Because some people, like me, like to know everything about a movie though they plan to see it, including the finish. Anyway, here's the finish as I remember it, because I could not have been over 8 years old when I saw it for the first time and single on TV. But I'll tell ya, she sure scared the kid that I was, and I thought about it for days later, and it still means in my mind that day, though some of the details is a little wave. Abe Vigoda was in this movie? I do not remember that! I did not even remember that Barnabus Ol was in this film, and I love black shadow. So, in the end, the lead character (Belinda Montgomery?) Was attracted by the Judge (Joseph Cotton, I guess, though I remember it as an old family doctor or something instead of a judge; see how memories disappear?) to the wedding place, how do I remember it is in a cave of some kind? Perhaps I was wrong; and Shelley Winters have laughter, and the Judge has a cape on, and the camera edge is kind of looking up on it, and it launches back the dress, and has goats, and it is announced he is actually his father, Devil and he played right in their hands (Satanic culture), because the "mortal" guy he fell in love with (I guess this Robert Foxworth) turns out to be the guy Satan wants to get married to him , The demon and yellow eyes, and yep, sure enough, to show Robert Foxworth, with his eyes lit yellow. There are a lot of pre-ups in the last few minutes of the movie. Everyone is laughing and rejoicing, except for Belinda Montgomery, who is very happy, with cry or cry or something, and that's the end. The bad guys have.
