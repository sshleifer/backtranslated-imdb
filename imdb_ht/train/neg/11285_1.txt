I read James Hawes book. It was very clean, not great, but fun enough. Without reading the book I would not have the slightest idea that was going on, and it was still a stretch and awareness. <br /> <br /> Literally every element in this movie is abysmal in my way of doing so does not have the ability to describe. Half digested fish could make a better movie with matchsticks and lipstick dayglo. <br /> Never before or since as a movie made me feel so angry. Mattress attacks came closer, but they never reached the depths of those who suffered as long as this earthquake did. <br /> Since wasting 90 minutes in my life witnessed this plague on my human nature now can even look into any book by James Hawes without feeling angry. This is the depth of hate I have for this piece in * t. No, that's unfair. Let me excuse in all fecal matter to compare you to the otherworldly evil Rancid Aluminum. <br /> <br /> Plain and simply a cancer on the world of movies.
