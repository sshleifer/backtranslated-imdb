Well I must say this is probably the worst movie I've seen this year! The jokes were very rude (not expected to come from as PG films) (Rated PG in Canada) and were not funny! With this great cast I at least expect some good act but I did not even get that. I'm a big fan of Rainn Wilson and this is the first time I was very disappointed by his performance. Both characters Luke Wilosn or Uma Thurman characters are little bit likable and I really can care less of what happened either in them. I did not expect this at all as in the past I really liked other movies by this director (six days, seven nights for example) This movie was NOT worth $ 10 to cost me and I encourage you do not see this movie. I guarantee that you will be like me asking for this movie to be on.
