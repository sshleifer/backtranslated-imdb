Everyone who wants an editor should watch this movie! It shows you about all mistakes by making a movie editing! Granma I could do better than that! But that's not the only reason why this movie is really bad! (It's actually so bad that I can not write a sentence without marking!) If the first episode of Visitors was a good familiar familiar comedy with funny jokes and cultural dialogues, this end is cheating seriously the reception in the first one. The funny parts can count on one hand and maybe half of it. Keyboard is over-acting his role even more than in the first part, Robin tries to act like Lemercier (because he has replaced it), but this ?? Grotèsk '. Lemercier se Lemercier, Robin is Robin! Though Muriel Robin can be funny by himself on stage, he's not in this movie because he does not act as he acts. I know that it would be difficult to replace someone who was good in a role (Lemercier obtained a César award for his role in the first movie) but he made a big mistake: instead of playing his role, he played ?? Lemercier plays it the role '! As for the story, it's just too much! Of course we knew at the end of the first movie that there would be an end but Poiré and Keyboard should have tried to try to write a simpler story like the first episode. The gags are repetitive, kids and dejected. No, really, there's no more than 3 funny parts in this. Only good things can suit them with some special effects. So, you have only 2 reasons to watch it: 1) if you want to learn how to edit awfully a movie, 2) if you want to waste your time or if you really need a 'brainless' moment! 2/10
