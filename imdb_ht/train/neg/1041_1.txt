How many more of these movies "slices in life" have to be done? Hopefully not too much. Victor Vargas is a very self-conscious attempt by the director Peter Solett to garner the attention of Hollywood. There is nothing wrong with that in general. What's wrong with this particular film is that it ignores the audience with piles on every cliche in the book of supposedly "Freaky" Hollywood independent production. <br /> It's supposed to be "real" so let's shake camera "style documentary", except any documentary would shake the camera on purpose ... <br /> It's "edgy" so let's not waste any movie lighting time in. <br /> It's the "hip", so let's have kids use sworn words like Al Pacino in Scarface ... <br /> <br /> So, and so forth. All you remain and is a very self-conscious attempt to impress Hollywood who will not impress anyone outside of the "rarefied" self-inducing people that seem to rigidly reputation on every bad movie.
