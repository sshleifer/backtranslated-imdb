Down enough with some stylish imagery but the small budget prevented things. <br /> I also found the impression they tried to shock you with some of the awesome graphics perv websites. <br /> If you like animated particular things like cyber cities and the police law then this might up your street. <br /> But basically it's low budget matrix budget but not entirely devoid of its own style. <br /> Great band of some unusual in Grunj / Punk / post grunge bands. Worth check out if only for the soundtrack.
