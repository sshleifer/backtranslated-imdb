We went to the movie with a group because the game we went to was canceled. It is undoubtedly one of the worst movies ever. Not that I do not like my cinema-movie. But nothing happens in the movie. One does not feel any connection with the characters as well. endless times without dialogue. And the car. How do thay bring a large tent and chair beds and clothes for each day in this car? It's a seater of! I said however the scenery is beautiful, but not in a movie, the director should make a photoshoot in the movie, so we could jump over 80 minutes in useless times and nothing happens anyway. <br /> /> I would not recommend it, as it is a waste of your time
