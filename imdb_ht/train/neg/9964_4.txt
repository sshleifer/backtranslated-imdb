In a recent biography of Alec Guinness I could not get too much about Paris and love. I'm sure Guinness has made the movie to get a free trip to Paris from it. The film has no other reason for existence. <br /> <br /> Paris weddings are nicely photographed and wonderful wonders of Guinness and her son drive down the Elysee Champs and Arc De Triomphe in the background. Unfortunately it goes down from there. <br /> There is just no chemistry in between Guinness and the girl who has a short throw and in Paris. According to the recent biography of Guinness by Piers Paul Li, Guinness positively obtains the girl, found her conduct unprofessional. How Odile Vernois thought of his co-star, no files are available. They have as many chemistry as two neutered cats. Guinness has a good time in the movie that's right out of one of his Ealing comets as he climbs a tree trying to retrieve a badminton shuttlecock. But I would not wait in the movie for her. At least Alec got a trip to Paris from the deal.
