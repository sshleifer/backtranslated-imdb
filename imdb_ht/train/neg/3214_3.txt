First of all, I would like to tell you that I'm funny, animated, animation and things. It is true that everyone has their own preferences, but you can trust me on this movie. I'll be goal. To start with the story - it's OK. Follow the story line in the comic books as far as I'm familiar with them. But the animation ... Well, it's not actually terrible, but it's definitely cheap and mediocre. It would be a lot better if they did not try to imitate the style animated and sticked in the original drawing drawing style book. If we pretend not to see the serious bloody effects like fire and lightning you might say that the film is about ten years ago and even more. Look a bit like the original Vampire Hunter D from 1985. Take a look at Heavy Metal FAKK 2000 for example - 4 years ago made a movie that looks a lot better hell! In addition to the voice talents does nothing remarkable, the music has nothing special. So, all in all - it lacks atmosphere. I look at her, but I can not say I really love her. It just does not take you. There are lots of blood and violence, but that's not impressed at all. May it be shocking for someone who never looked more mature oriented animation and it looks like bloody for the first time (with anyone around?), But I do not think this is the audience for this movie. So they could add a little nudity and spice it. The chicks around Lucifer were quite tasty, and hell, we have Lady Death itself! Some look sexy, but that's not enough. Instead of Bill Brown's music I think he would look better on a hard rock / heavy metal band. All in all - the movie is not that bad, but if you want something better to take the original heavily, Heavy Metal FAKK 2000, Fire and Ice Ralph Bakshi or Wizards maybe. And of course - Vampire Hunter D: Bloodlust
