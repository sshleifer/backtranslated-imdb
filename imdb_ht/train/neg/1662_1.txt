This is no doubt one of the worst movies I've ever seen. This makes your run of the movie TV movie like inefficient dog. Based on a book by one of only Britney Spears and her mother this is trash and nothing gives a reasonable performance from Virginia Madsen (I hope you got well) to save it. The story of a country wheel gill wheels that wins a scholarship at a prestigious musical school is little, but a Ms Spears car pedals pants the consumer's pants and generally agree to the forehead of the road. There is nothing good going on here and all beating them as predictable as those night. Never again.
