I had no idea what the film was about before I saw it because Tashan had only wear necklace while being encouraged. So I asked my friends if they knew anything about it and said "It's the first director of Vijay Krishna Acharya who wrote the scenplays for Dhoom 1 & 2 and Ibrahim's son Saif Ali Khan's first He's in the movie by playing it as a kid in his flashback. " <br /> After watching it, I understand why they were not a suitable trailer because there was nothing in the movie to show. The story was very dumpling and even a 10 year old child can come up with a better story-line. There was hardly any action and the camera shook at each angle possible and there is hard to figure out who killed who. Also the action was daft & unrealistic, e.g. 1 person with a gun has managed to kill about 100 men and machine guns. While I was watching Tashan she reminded me of 3 films: <br /> <br /> Sin City: During Koyla's opening credit: Anil Kapoor's awful credit like Amrish Puri in Koyla. <br /> <br /> Jhoom Barabar Jhoom: The jokes are incredibly ridiculous that are not even a funny comic. <br /> <I also heard the budget is 40 crores that are the same amount as Dhoom 2 and I do not know where all the money went on. Anyway, if you did not like Dhoom 2 then there is absolutely no chance that you will love Tashan. The race was hot on the heels and this is one million times better. <br /> Only two good songs are Dil Haara & Challiya and both songs are shot in Greece in good places, but what is used in it in a movie waste? Even the awful English Anil Kapoor could not save this dysfunction.
