What's wrong? I think I have to write "Alert Spoiler" and then "Reveal" the F-word used a lot of this movie - as in two phrases. I did not like this movie at all - too many suggestions about sexual perversions, sidesteps and cheating. And who swore he was totally out of the window. I gave this movie "3" and two of these points for Mira Sorvino's sexy movements on the dance floor.
