Really there is no reason to examine this much more because of some very blatant and bold statement statements. A perfect example is when the movie claims "Saul" or Paul in Tarus (writer of the Hebrew Scriptures) has no idea that Jesus is or was a person, this statement is either purposely false as he accuses others of the present , or it is ignorant of what the "Bible" says. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> which reads a quote "If Jesus were on earth, he would not be a priest", hence here He lay the ignorant visitor and unlearned to accept his fake presentation .. why? He does what most of the so-called Bibles believe he accused of doing, the same. This is something from context. <br /> <br /> One verse of Hebrews 8 is; 1. "Now, in the things that we have spoken, this is the sum: We have such a high priest, who sits on the right hand of the throne of heaven in heaven" The above count CLEARLY is speaking of a Jesus who was earth and ASCENDED in heaven after his alleged resurrection. <br /> It has nothing to do with how the movie wants the viewer to take it out of scripture context. Here he offers a foundation, that "Paul was not aware of a man Jesus, but one in the" heaven "<br /> <br /> follow? <br /> <br /> allow see if cinematographer is being honest; Hebrews 7; 14. "For it is clear that our Lord came from Judah; Which tribe of Moses did not speak of the priesthood? "But was it not the creator who just wrote to the Hebrew writers to try to show this writer's books to no knowledge of a" Jesus man "? It is easier still to Paul Paul did not write Hebrews, but I will not go in here, but the movie maker catching Paul did, and that's the quote of the given point. <br /> It's not like this maker movie does not make decent points in some areas, it does, but it's Engaged in the same blind blindness in the religion he is bashing over .. Once he engages in such tactics, in my strong opinion, he loses credibility as the religion he chooses out, and the film is not a documentary, but an opinion personal, and a bias in the maker movie, nothing more, nothing less.
