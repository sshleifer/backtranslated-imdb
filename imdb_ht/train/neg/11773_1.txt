I have been from many years in cache on these frames due to the absolute lack of intelligence that is communicating in the reviews that periodically appears on IMDb this movie space. I saw movie cinema movies in the movie theater this year, watch Vital, Snake in June, CHA NAME AIGI, Survival Style) and were grateful every day that a scene in which movie is filmed itself from back In my mind, it becomes a living memory. <br /> I'm sure you can read a summary of the film cut into Subway Cinema, which is probably why I made the mistake of dragging my friends to the movie. The description builds up the type of horror movie that I've been craving for a while, one that depends on absolute horror rather than cheap shopping. P was in fact different. He relied on cheap laughter. The incredibly annoying announcer has described this movie as "team leagues up in fighting monsters." Completely true. There is a subplot built up in this movie making it seem like the relationship between the girl and Pookie is actually going somewhere. More lies. This movie looks like a short one for "Are you afraid of the dark?" The story is ridiculous, and only succeed in laughing elitement and confusion at the audience after they finally return the attempt to see this movie and any pretense of gravity and try to forget the $ 9 that are wasted on the door. I almost wish that was not the audience so I could laugh at him and ask him why he wasted 5 years in Thailand doing a malicious horror-pornographic pornography that belongs to the spice channel, which only succeeded found the exclusive actress of her family, and caused a minor disruption at the belgium movie festival. The only stir that this was caused was a gurgle of the lower intestine as it could not extract itself from SH * was that it is. Anyway, I hope I can dissuade anyone from making the mistake of seeing this movie, it's really one of my 3 worst movie experiences, knocking out for the number 2.
