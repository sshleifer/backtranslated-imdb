In fact, it never happened. I'm not sure why Billy Crystal wanted to recreate a vicious comedy 1940. What a ugly steam! None of these people come close to a Cary Grant, Spencer Tracy, Katherine Hepburn, etc., and anyway, today's audience is not like the receptive easy movie. Writing is trivial. The superb plot is thin and obvious razor. The chemistry between leading characters is non-existent. It is interesting that Julia Roberts seems to think that it is a reincarnation of some big stars from the "Golden Age of Hollywood", whenever that can be. It's a tremendous and overlooked effect with Richard Gere of Runaway Bride.
