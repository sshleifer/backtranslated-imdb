Movie about a small town with equal numbers of Mormons and Baptists. The new family moves into, the replica replica dialogue, mediocre act, green jello salad and shredded carrots, and all other 'inside Mormons' jokes known to humans. Anyone outside Mormon's culture will have a hard time stomach movie. Anyone inside the Mormon culture will be a little amused with a chuckle here and there. You will better watch Hess's other movies (Napoleon Dynamite, etc ..) Trying to sit in this one. The act is mediocre. Jared Hess had his hands on pure films such as "Saints and Soldiers," and "Napoleon Dynamite". I would recommend both movie about this strike.
