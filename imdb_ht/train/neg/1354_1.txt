I saw her movie at the Ann Arbor Film Festival. I'm a movie student at the Univeristy in Michigan so I know something or two about film. And the Glover's Crispin movie is outrageous. It basically exploits the mentally challenged. Not only the Shirly anti-Christ temple (which I admit is a little funny) say mentally challenged to kill each other, but there is an obsession with killing snails. Crispin also plays with the idea of ​​being in love with one of his actors how to all, mentally challenged. PETA and Human Rights should all be this. It's not 'counter-culture' as Crispin states at the Ann Arbor Film Festival, it's exploitation.
