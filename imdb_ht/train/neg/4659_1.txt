This film is a waste of film stock. Do you believe that the card in a plan of a military mission should be placed on an easel on a large age patio for anyone with length or camera with a zoom lens to see? It happened in this film. Do you believe that someone DEAF would actually register in the active duty army in Europe during WWII to serve in a "Negro" unit ... cooking, supply service, funeral details, etc.? It happened in this film. Do you believe that a black (with supposedly intelligent) officer would choose the same DEAF K.P. to be part of an active combat mission to protect a dam from being destroyed by Germans before the allies arrived? It happened in this film. Would you be surprised that the DEAF soldier did not realize that a German plane was approaching from behind and would criminalize it and kill it? It happened in this film. Would you be surprised that a group of U.S. soldiers held-up in a barn at a German farmhouse that had been spent on SHOUT out the emotions of the German soldiers 'eyes was just 50' away? They made it to this film, and left any barrier to the German barn could be totally unprotected. Would you believe that, on the waves and in English clearly, the Captain mentions the General Range, if not his name, as he spoke with and that the general, in plain English on open wave, said that The dam was there to protect the next day? Maybe they should just be sent to an emissary to say that the direction of the American attack would come from just making it a little easier on the Germans. The so-called films should be placed on a list of the 50 most films. If so, I'm sure he would do well. Look at it at your own risk.
