Dysfunctional families go home for the holidays and killings and destruction results. Violent sexy Milligan at her most own home. Little is better than a home movie (like many of the Milligans movie). This is a trip to 1960's abravity style. Notable for the luxurious nudity and sex of this movie is neither sexy nor really, playing now more as quaint (though it is obviously rated). The film suffers from its uneven cast and in the cheapness of the production. (No one ever was sure where the money went on his movie since he was still breaking down). It is a bad movie that is not worth seeing except as a complete Milligan or because it has some good looking men catches around.
