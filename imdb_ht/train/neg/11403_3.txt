I love film movies, low budget, 50, 60, 70, 80 .. but how can one think this is a supreme movie very good? Let's compare it to headlines in a movie that looks like veins-haunted house. the haunt, the change, the shining. or for a similar film-based technology that was FAAAR better, (though still FAR out of big) Devil Seeds. OK, I'll just let's compare it to make-for-TV TV movie! Do not go to sleep .. waaay creepier and better do. Many salems, stalkers at night, gallery nights, even do not go to the basement or crowhaven farms were far better. * SPOILERS * first of all, for as a good scene like the Blood Shower scene, there was a scene like the opening scene .. oh boy! The garden tire comes alive to tire some young adolescents! TERRIBLE. Also, just what we understand about the house .. it apparently needs to use its video camera to see what's going on, and it's a very emotional home. not a spirit, or devil, or entity, it's a "owned" home, but not what? Do we lead to believing an inanimate object learned to love suzie / margaret, our protagonist? Now that I'm on the topic of Suzie .. another scene that totally bothered me, this poor old mad lady comes, tell you he's been your nurse, pouring her heart out, falling into the boiling pool , difficulty in agony for 45 seconds, and what does margaret do? Does he risk his hand to save the poor woman who came to warn her life? No, he stands there and watches! The acting for the most part was better than average for a horror movie, but that's where the positives are over. For at least one manure film more interesting, and fun on an unnatural object that kills watching death beds: the eating bed. I have a feeling that those who have rated this so very either did not look at it since it originally revealed, or remembered it horrible as the kids. This film was pretty much worth less.
