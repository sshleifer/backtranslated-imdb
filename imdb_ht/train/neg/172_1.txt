Return to the cabin by the Lake by, in any way, stand in front of the original. With only one main character (Stanley) returns for the sequence, the movie is not even worth the 2 hours of your time. I'm a big fan of the movie first, the story line and act was really good, but this is one movie that I will never look again. It is basically equal to what the sequences of legendary urban and blair witch were like, but with much worse acting. I personally saw the best act of soap opera, it is so pitiful that you just have to laugh. I, in any way, recommend this movie to anyone, watching it will just divert from the first.
