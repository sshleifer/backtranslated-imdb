So he came to this. Fast, expensive cars that only above 1% will never drive. The girls pose around them in gear magazine. Second-tier and non-name actor. Good appearances promoted by people from niche culture. <br /> <br /> This is the garbage that Hollywood has to offer. Do not get me wrong; I love the mindless flick of action and hot chicks as much as the guy next. But please, the collective green Braintrust will be suspended, counting ten, breathing, having a hearty "Woooooosaaaaaah", then revoking twenty-fiven years and remembering what made cinema enjoyable once over time? Then actually do some movies like that again? I have nothing against poker, but all the pop-culture blast he enjoyed over the past five years is ridiculous. Everyone and mother think Maverick is now (not that half of them will even find that reference). Some executive said, "Hey, what demographic do you want to lean $ 9.50 out of?" "I know, gentlemen, March 18-35." "Ok, let's give them poker, girls, and fast cars." "Brilliant idea, gentleman." The result? A movie that I saw once without late at night on Spike TV, and more often than not, begins Dolph Lundgren. <br /> <br /> Now do not despise me; I'm not a movie snob. More than-in-head artsy as the Englishman does not float my boat, but generic films that would not even be made straight to the DVD scramble the hell out of me too. Only adolescents will have the engine to revved this, and I imagine the ones in the higher end of the IQ range will see this for what it is: a junkyard.
