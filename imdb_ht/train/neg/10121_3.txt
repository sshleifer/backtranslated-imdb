Bored Londoners Henry Kendall and Joan Barry (like Fred and Emily Hill) receive a breakthrough on a legacy. They use the money to travel. Their lives become more interesting as they begin relationship with exotic Betty Amann (for Kendall) and lonely Percy Marmont (for Mrs. Barry). But they remain as boring as they were before. Ajitably bored director Alfred Hitchcock tries to live the titled (as quoted in the movie, from the Shakespeare's "Tempest") "Rich and Strangely" by ordering some camera factories. An opening tribute to the "Vid" movie is the highlight. Low points may be eaten by couples on Chinese cats prepared. <br /> <br /> *** Rich and Strange (12/10/31) Alfred Hitchcock ~ Henry Kendall, Joan Barry, Percy Marmont, Elsie Randolph
