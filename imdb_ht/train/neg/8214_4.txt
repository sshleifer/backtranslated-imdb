This does not properly lead the depths of Creepshow 3, but it comes close. He uses the same technique to use some of the same actors in multiple roles throughout the anthology, which is distracted to say at least. It was also rather irritating to the Twilight Zone (whose bookshop was comparable to the Serling Night Gallery). Unfortunately, the producers and writers forget that Serling would build sympathy for his character before their pity on. None of the characters are particularly sympathetic or interesting until the last segment. <br /> <br /> History frame: Adam West is ... well, himself. It does not go to Bruce Wayne / Batman road to the 60s camps, but it rarely does. It simply plays non-particularly enigmatic "Jay" (having a spine-chilling name to compare with the likes of Dr. Terror, Eramus, and the Cryptkeeper), and make some sluggish / creepy statements. <br /> Abernathy: Won Rod Serling's "Stop at Willoughby"? Then you saw this. The red herring in Nutso's wife is presented in no purpose, but even the friend's main friend identifying him as a wave. As well as directing as expected, but basically incoherent. <br /> <br /> Nex's Diner: Reminiscent of various stories of Serling travel, mixed with Steve Allen in "A meeting of spirits." Most of the actors are not too bad (except for Josh Astin as Cassius, who managed to walk, talk and even clumsy even), and the idea is mildly interesting. But like Abernathy, it does not go anywhere. The main character raises some relatively reasonable questions, bugs out a bit (that would not?), And for some reason it ends up captive in a nuclear desert. <br /> <br /> Life Replay: It's not a bad little bit, and managed to predict both Click and Creepshow 3. I suppose saying something that people are captured by the magical properties of remote control. The main character is lite sympathetic. There is nothing remarkably innovative here, but it's okay. <br /> <br /> Fighting Spirit: You see the twist comes a mile away but like the main character, it has some heart and it's a decent story of defeat and redemption. /> <br /> Final: So ... why people finish off cold storage in silver army costumes? Do not know. And it does not make sense. So ... all the protagonists traveled to the bookstore and was blocked? Kinda undermines the happy ending with the boxer (thanks, guys!), And the guy in the first segment died. So how did he get trapped? Did he visit the bookstore before he died, was trapped and ... did not die? What? Huh? I suppose this is not expected to make sense because it's supernatural. But still ... <br /> <br /> In general: basically not dissimilar from the much larger Twilight Zone series, or some episodes of Tales from the Darkside or Monsters. The last two stories and part of the second are probably worth your time. But there is nothing really spectacular here.
