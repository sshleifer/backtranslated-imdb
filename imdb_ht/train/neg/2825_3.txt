This week, I just thought it would be fun to catch up with Corey Haim, and just saw the movie "movie boy" last week and all. Not that I'm a boy fan - not far away - but I did these two Coreys in some movies back in my early teens. So I'm preparing myself for three films to start her. Unfortunately, I chose "dream machine" as a first (never seen before), and it was so awful clairvoyant, I just decided to close Corey back in my closet and let it moderate again first, before I pop to another thing in it. But I managed to fight my way into this movie first. I had the impression he desperately wanted to play in the same league as "Ferris Bueller's Day Off" (1986), but was kept in its own hallucinage. Practically the movie all he wants to be a comedy and near to end it hopelessly trying to be a thriller. The only good thing about "dream car" is the quote: A body dead in the trunk of a Porsche. All the rest fails so badly, it's embarrassing. Even more for Haim. I can dig her up with her young, very enthusiastic, but at least when she comes up with some legal guidelines. This clearly was not the case in "dream car". So, we have a perfect car, yes, that black Porsche. Mommy perfect girlfriend? Just a blonde chick who hardly has any line in the movie. The perfect murder ... almost? Some dude has fallen flat on her ass like the villain of the movie, trying to film all of them to steal the body back from the trunk, never really succeed, and then the end of the movie thinks it is Michael Myers (less William's white Shatner mask) and Corey Haim's mistake for Jamie Lee Curtis. Do not think they could make this cops any lamer if they tried. A stupid, infunny movie and a story that leads to nowhere is directed by a director who does not know how to direct his cast. Great achievement! <br /> A last question for Mr. Haim: Who was your idea to smile directly to the camera at the last shot in the movie? You or the director? So do not do.
