Officially a movie that predicts the upcoming trends of British folk music, it's wrong on many fronts that it's ridiculous. Tommy quickly? Honeycombs? The film does include a song by the Spencer Davis band, two by the animals, and one angry on live films in the Beatles are making live versions of twist and call (all 1:20). But all in all, an awkward display of British music circa 1964. Oh, and Hermes Herman.
