Ever looked at a movie that lost the draw? Well, this did not even really have one to start with. <br /> <br /> Where to start? The scarcely tiring scenes of our heroine sit at home and actually have no sense of threat or even foreboding created even as the apparently constant storms (which are unusual never actually heard in the big double-glazed house)? The house which is apparently only a few kilometers from a town yet is several hours walking away (?) Or the third girl who serves no purpose in the plot except giving quick rapide as soon as Tedium becomes unbearable? Or even at the beginning that suggests a spell of 20+ killers in all areas though it is apparently the killer never initiatives away from home? Or the rare ceremony with the salt & pepper is pretty much sum up most of the movie inherent lack of direction. <br /> Add a lead actress who can not act but at least is willing to do some completely irrelevant showers nude and this video is really embarrassing, but not in the way you expect. <br /> <br /> Give something simply for being banned from the UK in the 80 's (mainly because of a surprising final on protracted murders) it offers nothing but curiosity value - with one classical' Daft ' kill people (do not worry-it's telegraph at least ten minutes before). After a walk through the Woods our victims come in a rather steep rise to the slopes that are obviously letting up. Half of them see a figure at the top of the black dresses and brandishing a huge machete. What to do? Slide down and run like the rest of us? No, of course, they struggle at the top and stand upright and upright in the murder weapon. <br /> It's really just a movie as they say.
