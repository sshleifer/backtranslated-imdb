Journalist Justin Timberlake (as Joshua "Josh" Pollack) believes when a whisper court accused "Thanks" to testify officer LL Cool J (as Ruffle Heading) as he left the witness. In the sequences open in this movie, you are given the explanation. You'll see the Cool J detective partner Dylan McDermott's partner (as Frances "Laz" Lazerov) decided not to kill Damien Dante Wayans (as Isaiah Charles). The cops in the city of "Edison" are so corrupt to suspect them, steal their money, and snort the drugs. If it comes from impressing his girlfriend (here, called "pussy") or winning a Pulitzer, the city's corruption does not sit well with Mr. Timberlake's nobleman. <br /> Timberlake decides to investigate the corruption that occurs in both unexpected and threatening levels of life. Writer / director David J. Burke keeps the movie above, but just barely. LL Cool J beats the Timberlake "star of star movie star" (aka "rapper of actors" progression). Mr. McDermott has fun with his role. The gravity laws for the procedures are worthy to support actors Morgan Freeman (like Moses Ashford) and Kevin Spacey (like Levon Wallace). F.R.A.T. means First Assault Response and Tactics, but it's more important to know that "Edison (Force)" star Justin Timberlake and LL Cool J, by Morgan Freeman and Kevin Spacey (similarly lost). ** Edison (9/17/05) David J. Burke ~ Justin Timberlake, LL Cool J, Morgan Freeman, Dylan McDermott
