Mass foods are just one of many recent mediocre zombie films to be after your hard-earned dollar. Suggestions? Keep your hard-earned dollar and let's say that old Old Theater has taken one for the team on this one. Guess what's the cemetery about? Zombies take over. This time though, for the sake of originality (?) This movie takes place in Rhode Island, and to be honest I'm not sure I've ever seen a zombie-based zombie reputation in Rhode Island. A television station, controlled by the government, is supposed to keep up "normal" emissions so that any remaining citizen will not think there's any problem in the world, that is, people who never watch or go out of it all way. I'll say though that some of the ads emitted by this station were probably the most fun part of this movie. There is actually a bit of this story but I do not bother with that because after a while you will either not care or have fallen asleep. At any speed, this has a lot of terrible acts to throw on top of all "seeing it all the stuff" stuff that gets scratched outside the camera. Believe me, you can find many other things to do with your time spent watching this. 3 out of 10.
