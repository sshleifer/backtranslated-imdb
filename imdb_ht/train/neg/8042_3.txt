The secret is ... this movie course. Sorry, but it just did. <br /> <br /> **** SPOILER **** <br /> <br /> In this bad reef I know what you have been doing nowadays with SCREAM, Animals, Played admirably by Dorie Barton , join several friends on a Break Spring tour. The group rents a fancy home and try to enjoy a fun vacation. Then death begins. First one then another then another of their friends is murdered, leading to a sad and frustrated climate with predictable results. One note, Dorie Barton is the poor man Reese Witherspoon ?? It looks like Reese, acts like Reese and was able to spend for Reese in a police lineup. Maybe how to throw it? Anyhow, decent movies and just acting could not well make up for bad dialogue and terrible writings.
