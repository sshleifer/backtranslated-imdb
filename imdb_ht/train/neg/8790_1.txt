I saw this on cable lately and as enjoyed it. I have read the comments here and it seems that everyone likes the second half over the first half. Personally, I liked the first story (too bad was not extended.) The second story, I thought, was clich√©. And that "California dreams," if I hear that once again ... Chungking Express is okay, but it's not something that mainstream audiences will catch on to see, such as "Tanga Crouching."
