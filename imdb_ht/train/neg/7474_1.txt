This program did not do it for me, although I'm a fan of the genre. The biggest factor that shame me was that there was not a single scene that was not dominated by the main character. This was done a bit two-dimensional and I gave before the program ended. <br /> I was hoping to leave criticism I have as I have no movie critics, however, guidelines on IMDb states that you must put in 10 Lines of Book. He reminded me of Hudson Hawk in the way the main character is in every single scene, and I hope the writers of this program can employ some more diversity engaging with viewers. I do not doubt the talent of any of the cast and crew, it just that after looking things like the "thread", I came to expect big things from cop dr.
