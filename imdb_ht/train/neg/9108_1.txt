This so-called prequel is just a rumor seriously made in a better version of dangerous Langer. The scheme is identical to most of the script. I liked the book based on it, and I loved the movie first, but I'm not even going to bother with the 3rd movie. The freeware plot between the two main characters of the prequel was completely predictable and unoriginal, and ... I just can not stress how bad the movie was. If you do not want to take my word for her, just look at her, and you'll see what I mean. If you read a review saying 'If you like the first one, you'll love the second one' the only reason that is because it is the exact same! Although the plot is not as good. They have taken many lines of the movie first, It's hard to say which movie you're watching.
