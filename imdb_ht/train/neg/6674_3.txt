I should admit that the plot of this film is director Eduardo Sanchez, who eliminates the wildly popular Blair Witch's success. In addition, this is an alien movie of sorts, and sounding something like Dream King Stephen King, one of those movies that critics have hated, but I enjoyed. <br /> But, unfortunately, I felt that for the most part, Altered is a waste of time, so I'll keep that review brief. Locals are always promising, and Altered does not differ. It tells the story of a group of people who encounter strange encounters when they were younger, and as usual, others will take you as something captivating imaginative. History of abduction aliens still have to deal with sensors in the orifices, so I will not go into detail, but you will find floating in it uncomfortable, and something you would like to forget. Do you give a chance to revenge? That is, you manage to successfully hunt down, and take one alive. What are you going to do? For this group, it is a gleeful payback time, or for thought. And this is where the movie begins to develop into a snoozefest, and bad, uninspiring dialogue, and even worse act. Even though it's low budget, there are not many factors to recruit, be it the storyline force, or any help from the cast of making the characters just an exciting tad. It's the cardboard ticket fare from a vanilla clear clone, coupled with some silly shopping tactics. <br /> <br /> What's fine though is the makeup. Many efforts have been put into doing some of the things that I will not mention, because it will spoil just the few elements of what makes this movie laudable. Other than that, there are normal cheap special effects, bloody and captive moments that have nothing to do before. <br /> Look at this only as a last resort. Compared with the other monster movie in town - Feast, this one is less fun, and persuades it too badly. Bogged down by an uninspiring direction, you've been warned.
