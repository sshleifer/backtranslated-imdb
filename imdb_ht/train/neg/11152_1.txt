Why harass this movie, if you have big movies to see. It's a total waste of time and money. The movie is so bad that I felt bad for wanting to watch it. Everything in it is BAD. The actors were bad. Script was really bad. The story is stupid. With the worst CGI ever. The only good moments were the first 60 seconds of the film at the strip club. Something interesting is that there is a character that we want to die because, it is so stupid that we get enough of it. (I do not remember the name but it was BOYFRIEND in the "Chosen One".) /> <br /> NOTE: If you want to see a good movie, this movie is not the right choice. 0-Stars out of 10
