Hopelessly inept and dull in which the characters stand around in room or a rocket boat and infinity talk. You might think things would glued up when exploring Mars but the scenes filmed in a heavy red / orange filter that made everything very quiet. Martian travel / vegetation is mostly in drawing and monsters are entirely compelling. There is echo in the 'bride of the monster' when the heroine carefully winds the octopus as tantak in a plant eating meat around it before facing broadcast, the difference being that the Wood Ed film is a hundred times more fun. The best ear placed when watching the 'sci-fi' scores note the music, repeating infinite, will drive you crazy. If you find yourself unable to sleep one night just slip this one in the VCR and your insomnia will be healed in no time.
