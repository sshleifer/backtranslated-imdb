As a movie critic for several Dutch websites, I have to see lots of movies, and not all very good. Some movies are so bad, you will not be surprised that they are right on video. With taboo, I'm surprised that it is released on video at all. This is really bad budget bad bad habits written writing. <br /> A young group playing a game of taboo. They write the most desirable or acting desires, and later on the murderers for their taboo. The question is, should we believe what we see? <br /> <br /> The film has an interesting plot-twisting potential, and I will not give it away here. But what might have been interesting to remain stupid, wrong acting and without reason. <br /> Some of the actors played in the first big titles, so why did the world sign up for this? If you see that anywhere, try to dodge it. There is no logic, no human sense of quality in this movie.
