Derek has over the 1980s produced a few decent decades to get the title "Worst Movie Forever", and this is probably the first progress in these stakes. In fact, this film can be considered as the "so bad, it's good" category, right up with the products in love of Edward Wood Jr. or Doris Wishman. This explains the IMDB voting model for this movie and some people come out top marks. Anthony Quinn has made the odd dodgy movie in his time, but this performance as a randy ghost is so incredibly bad, it has to be seen to be believing.
