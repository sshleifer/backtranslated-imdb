.... as it's a level of understanding about what comedy is operating. Rarely even the length of characteristic, "Can I do it ..." until I need glasses "is a collection (especially) jokes. Many of them are so short that you can not believe it when you realize that the punchline was supposed to be (eg: the Santa Claus gag); others are so long that you can not believe it when you realize that they need so much time to set up punchline (eg: student gay prizes). And almost all are directed without any artistic. Do not get me wrong: about 1 every 10 jokes actually managed to be funny (the one / phone one is probably my favorite). There are also some wonderful full-frontal stripes that prove, again, that the female body, especially in its natural form, is the best thing about this planet (some funny but naked or well). And I agree with others that the intentionally stupid song is actually extremely damnful! But none of these reasons enough to give this movie anything more than * from 4.
