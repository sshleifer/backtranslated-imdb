This film is about a cop (Ching Wan Lau) trying to catch a super-smart thief (Ekin Cheng) that blackmails a carrier has in mind a Kelly Lin. Basically, regardless of the plan's plan try to steal somehow knowingly in advance. This film, covered by beautiful lead actors, beautiful lead actors and good camera shots in Hong Kong scene, really has no substance at all. It's all flash, and the flash quickly gets dull. I lose all a third interest in the way in the movie, and there is no redeeming quality then except for the cinematography, which looks good. Only consider seeing this movie if you can do this for free. Also, consider standing watching the movie 20 minutes in the movie because it's all the same at the end: boring. 6/10
