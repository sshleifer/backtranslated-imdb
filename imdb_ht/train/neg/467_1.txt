There are bad movies, horrible movies even boring movies ... I can look more and put up to the end, not this time. Avoiding this like the plague, harassing music at all, terrible correction, no comedy, its tackier than a cup of dew ... miss me wanted to look this thought it would be legally blonde material or something kind of look , but never better than average, chick flicker movie. The first time he asked me to push the button off. <br /> <br /> The girls, well, were not nice to start with (Denise do OK in Stars troupe with wild things), but you plunged the gravel. I feel like a cup passed over 30 minutes on that ... Pamela Anderson is almost subconscious after much construction work in her face. Please take my advice if you want to avoid wasting valuable oxygen and brain cells. Enter the utter thread on the screen.
