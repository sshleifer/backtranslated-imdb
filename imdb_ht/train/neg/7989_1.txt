I had great expectations of these "my nice laundrette", "bend it like Beckham" and (less so) "East is East". The stories of British Asian Fitting at home adopted were very good running on the big screen, as well as a number of excellent TV and radio sets (Goodness of Mercy, etc.). This one falls flat. Inspired by a good start it quickly descends down the hill. <br /> <br /> Finally this was a horrid typical BBC effort, complete with strong regional emphasis, whacky on-act characters, a "such day's" band, and many of "trouble" in an attempt must be worthy. <br /> I found myself cringing at many points during this movie. The word is predictable. Each possible cliche was dragged out and revealed. In fact, I have trouble thinking of any cross-cultural / cross-generation device that might have been used that did not. The characters were thin and kishich: the unique nonconformist minister; the meaning of well but finally racist old woman; on weight, overbearing aunt; pushing American parents; the working neighbor; 'wise' grandmother; The Thug riding motorcycle. The script was weak, and all the luck to the audience's racial and racist dialogue survived from the two charismatic sculptures of white racists. And why he had to wear in the 70's (apart from an excuse for the band of the 70's) is a mystery. Maybe it makes a little more credible character of those born after 1979. I do not know. <br /> Even things aside, good acting could be brought in this respectable obscurity. Instead, the usual "BBC comedies" suspect were wheeled out to become his. "Bend it like Beckham" was far better comical act (and serious act, in fact) than that, with a normally unknown cast. <br /> In summary, a lazy script clone, about acting, in a predictable story story. Give her a miss. <br /> <br />
