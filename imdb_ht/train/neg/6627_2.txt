What happens at RGV? It seems to repeat itself in every movie. Does it run out of creative ideas? If he has, the time to take a back seat. Wanted to see the movie with a great anticipation - of course not once I imagined it would be anywhere near the original. I knew it would not, the Promos said it all. But even then I thought it would be a great RGV treat, after all is not the same guy who led Sathya and Company? Or is it? I have doubts about watching Aag. I will not talk about the plot or the story, as most of it is taken from the original, if you are really dying away and seeing this one, you could play a fun game with friends: identify the scene from in the original one and give evaluation to your own! So Veeru gets Heero (how corny is that?), Devine Heeru would not sound great. Ajag Devgan is quite a disaster as Heero, the comedy is bribery and swollen speech that really was effective in sound fake companies. The chemistry between Heero and Gunghroo (Nisha Kothari) does not exist at all. In fact Nisha is best trying to be the more disappointing she gets. This occurs at a peak at the end. Rage is in fact not as bad as compared to others, it is a guy to look into the future. I was really disappointed with Amitabh Bachchan as Babban, she looks like a cartoon in Gabbar Singh. There is a scene where he drinks something from a bowl all covered in a shawl, instead of inspiring scary he looks like a beggar with his bowl. The only performance that really stood out was Mohan Lal as Inspector Narasimha. I'm afraid I'm not patient in writing more.
