Simply put, this is a simplistic and one-dimensional film. The title, the wrong upset, should tell you that this will not try to be anything deep or doing so much with Hitler's character. Instead, from the first minutes of the film where we see babies Hitler looking evil and music playing the background, they give us a look at Hitler who introduced him as a Cartoony supervision, seemingly torn right from a Saturday morning TV show. The movie really wants to make its case that Hitler was wrong, but does anyone need a movie to convince them that Hitler was wrong? Ultimately, doing it as a single dimensional evil character is both boring and confusing (one must ask how insufficient, the phsycotic feature of the cold movie ever convinced a nation to follow him or to be called time man of the year). This film has a great opportunity to take a face that has committed some of the horrendous acts of the 20th century and try to dig into it. Instead, it basically just says, "Hey! Hitler was wrong! Just thought you would like to know ..." about them and over again. The great ironie is that the movie is always attacked to introduce too sympathetic to look at the character. Give me a break.
