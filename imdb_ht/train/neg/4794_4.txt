Why look at this? There is one reason and that is for the greatness of John Saxon. I love acting. I love his adventures in Nightmares On Elm Street 1.3, and 7 as Nancy's father a cop, Black Christmas as a cop, and from west to Dawn again as a cop. When I was rummaging at my local auction center I came across Zombie House's death movie and I quickly saw it back, but before moving on I noticed that John Saxon was not just an actor in this movie but for the first time I ever heard of a director. This was my intrigue (Also cheap $ 9.00 tag price) and I and I had it. When they came home I realized that this film did not live up to Saxon's other work even his actions, which could be hurt by the added pressure of directing. But it was not just his other actors aspire. It seemed as though they were all pulled out of a recent porn shot and he said now your guy really has to act. The same movie looks like the 80's porn quality. I can not trust that this movie is casual viewers, but if you are a fan of obsession in the 80's missing out on the culture that came from that era was not late, or a fan of crap movie than that is one. Also if you dig John Saxon as I do.
