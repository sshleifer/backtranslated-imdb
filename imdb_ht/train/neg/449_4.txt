I'll admit I've just looked at a handful of episodes, but each one seemed completely different from the next. It seems after the first season, the producers decided to completely retool the show, drop character, featuring new, and rewriting the show all dynamic. As you've probably surmised already, the show is about originally, Holly (Amanda Bynes teenager) is unpredictable that moves in with his high-ranking sister sister Valerie (Jennie Garth) in New York City. Decentness is sufficiently quoted: odd couple + fish out of water + high jinx. While I miss the sitcom at yore, this show is unfortunately missing the mark on comic repeating, and it's sad because of some decent talent. On top of everything, they insist on changing the show (Val lived with a regular bf a cast season, then it was suddenly gone, so it opened a baking? what?) When things change that high, you get the feeling that even the * show * knows it's bad. I mean, completely new layers, new characters and show rules! <br /> <br /> On a side note (this is just nitpicking), I know this is a TV show and not real at all, but Val and Holly finish living in a large debt store (there are stairs) and a terrace ... in MANHATTAN! You are serious !?
