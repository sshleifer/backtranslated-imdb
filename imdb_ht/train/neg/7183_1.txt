This is the worst adaptation of a classic story I've ever seen. They need to upgrade it and some points are actually just sick. The songs rarely move along the story. They seem to be thrown off at random. The flying scene with Marley is useless and funny. <br /> It's not just one of the worst movies I've seen, but it's definitely the worst music I've ever seen. <br /> /> It's probably only considered a classic because "A Christmas Carol" is like a classic story. Just because the original story was a classic does not mean that some cheap adaptations are.
