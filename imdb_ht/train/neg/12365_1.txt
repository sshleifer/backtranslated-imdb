I think this piece of waste is the best evidence that good ideas can be destroyed, why all American animators think that the kids in those days want to stupid GI Joe's version of good stories ??? The Looney Tunes are some of the favorite characters in history, but they have not been created to be Xtreme, I mean come in !!! Tiny Toons was a great example of how an old idea can be updated without opening it to the original charm but this piece of waste is just an example of stupid corporate decision that only wants to create a cheap show Idiot that kids will love because hey !! ! kids love superheroes right ??? The whole show is just a waste of time in which we see the new versions of the Looney Tunes, but this time in superhero form, this does not sound too bad but the problem is that this show tries too hard to make copies series such as animated batman, or the new justice justice, the result ??? Wrong bad copy (the road runner) or superman (which other bugs Bunny) was the problem that Looney Tunes was not meant to be dramatic, they were supposed to be funny !!!! as I said before this series sucks, and many people wonder why animated is taking the whole world ??? This show is trying to be dramatic and action packed, but that's something that some series and anime can do, if you want to see a good upgrade in an old show watching Tiny Toons, that's an example that it's Possible to bring back to life old character, but with a good story and respect the original roots. Too bad that shows is already dead, another wise decision I suppose.
