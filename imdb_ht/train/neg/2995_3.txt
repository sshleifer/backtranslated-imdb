Only on a very rare occasions an episode of the x-files fail to generate any excitement or make the episode there is nothing that is just totally boring to watch.A detective and his former partner both dead in unexplored circumstances. Deaths are linked to the presence of a girl who was there when death took place.Mulder had invented a theory that a policeman was murdered by colleagues turned into reincarnated as the little girl and is precise to revenge. , for the bizarre bit.The girl has no connection at all and it looks just a random person selected as the reincarnation. I think this was a little written lazy by the writers and this episode Hang as one of the worst in x-files history!
