This movie is the worst excuse for a motion picture I've seen. To begin with, I would like to tell the front cover this movie is not all misleading, if you think you are about to see a horrible horror movie with a monster sort, you are soooo evil. In fact, the killer faces not even slightly resemble the front cover, it's just an image to be found on Google and thought it looked cool. Speaking of the two things found and thinking it look cool, there is a scene in this movie where some of the gang seeks friends in the old woods, then suddenly scrubbing the screen into a scene where there is a deer mother feeds her teens in a glisten in the sunlight ... I mean seriously WTF ??? How is this important in the dark woods are losing the way? I bought this movie from a man in a market hoping it would be fun, if it was not horrific then at least it would be funny right? WON! The next day, I gave it to my work of colleagues pulling myself against the disease called S.I.C.K <br /> <br /> Below is the line: do not watch this photo !!!
