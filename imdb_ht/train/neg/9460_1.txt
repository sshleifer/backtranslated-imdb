This movie has made me angry! When I think cats in the hat. Im thinking of cats in hats of the books. You know, one in a few years back that his parents in the children. Well, I'm sure this film would be a lot like that! But many of my suprise I did not like the books! Insted it is more like young adult movie humor. In one chat party talking to a gardening tool (how) chat sits on it as it is to him (adult adult adult). Named in his car I'm all so though was a little untastful for a movie child. Under the rating you will find: humorous mood humor and some double-entenders. I think that in short this means humorous humor. I wish I could return this movie! Wal-Mart said they would not because the movie was open. If you are thinking about buying this I suggest that maybe rent before you buy.
