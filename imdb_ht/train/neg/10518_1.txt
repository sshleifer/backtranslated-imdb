Oh boy, where am I going with this one? Active act, weak scheme, deadly death, freeware need ... <br /> <br /> This is not entertainment ... this is hell. <br /> <br /> Hell. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your money, time, or life on this hole in evil. <br /> It's just ... god damn is this horrible movie! Tom Savini, why? Why would you waste your life on this crap? This movie is not worth it. I would rather snort crack and crush my head up on a wall than look like this ... this act again! <br /> <br /> Please, take my advice and stay f # @ away from this elephant turd of a movie. No, do you know what? I should not even have to call this movie a movie! Just stay away!
