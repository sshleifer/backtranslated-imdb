I do not know what the rest of you guys look at Steven Seagal cinema for, but I watch them because, as funny as they are, they're at least always good for a laugh. Why would you like this movie a 1 out of 10 based on the duplication, then what kind of stuff is exactly what makes a movie like this in a favorite cult that you can laugh at in the silliness? Force assault is not a great movie mean, but I felt like it deserved a Steven Seagal car as much of his other movies; In fact I did not think it was one of her worst not a long shot. It was, most of the time, a half-way concave line drawn, and it was, most of the time, fundamentally interesting. The finish really sucks, but even having some garbage element entertainment. At the end of the story itself did not deliver what he promised, but I actually thought that act, characterization (if I could use such a great word) and the rest of the output values ​​released exactly what a true Steven Seagal fans would expect. Seagal herself in particular was exactly the rock-faced, no-nonsense man that we had come to expect, and the rest of the cast backed up very well, without ever up- l '. This, people, is what a Seagal Steag film does. Deal with it. Or even better: laugh at it. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10.
