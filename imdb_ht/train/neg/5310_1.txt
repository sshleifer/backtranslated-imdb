I did not do this other review. That's definitely not a movie movie, in fact, I do not think there was one decent girl looking at her. No, it's just cheesy, wrong-minded, Ed Wood-style science fiction schock. And it's bad. I can not even begin to tell you how it is. I saw him late at night on cable, and I was in shock. The fact that this film has never been released is a reproach to all of us. The actors were either friends of the producer or mentally delayed, the special effects are a joke, and the pace is insanely slow. For me though, the music itself is all. A monkey could write a better term with a game xylophone. Do not rent this thing, but if you ever see it on the cable, look at it. You will be surprised at how bad a movie can be.
