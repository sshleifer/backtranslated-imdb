This movie is terrible. Each line stolen from 8MM (the Italian armed version, at least). If you love garbage ... real garbage, give it a try; but caution: this is not "so bad it's good" flick type. In its cheapness, it can really look like a porn but, believe me, if you are looking for "mourrish", s & m, hardcore, softcore ... or even an ordinary erotic thriller, go get something else in stores! I tell you this, 'cause the absolutely unenspired and compelling shot, act, draw, dialogue (the only good lines, as I said before, are they stolen from 8MM Joel Schumacher!) Making you at tears a few minutes and "happy ending" is absolutely rioting! I'll give him one star: a half for the sudden shot of the scene back, after the "eye victim" monologue (stolen from 8MM as well) and a half for sexy mother & daughter's body ( which did not manage to keep me completely awake while watching this turkey, anyway!)
