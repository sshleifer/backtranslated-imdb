That is quite an obsolete film that aims to show immense youth of freedom in some British school disasters. Oh yes it's like the army, you learn to obey and do what you're asking. Yes the young dream of something else but it breaks their dreams and sweeps away the optimists on the threshold of their lives. Great. <br /> <br /> Basically this is how you could sum up the beautiful intentions of Si ... Nice intentions that arouse no cinematic challenge: the result is a filmmaker movie. Do you see how boring I mean? At least Oldie helped Kubrick throw McDowell into a mechanism mechanic, a movie that has a truly powerful social satire and no independent sentimentality.
