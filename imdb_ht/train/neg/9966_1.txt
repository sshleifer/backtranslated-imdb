Even though I never love the sort of person who negates another's personal taste; If you like something, that's fine. But this movie was terrible and there is no way around it. I do not like Ani Difranco too much, but she is a great guitarist and songwriter, that I can admit. But I can not admit that they had any kind of redemption of this film. Many ways that it is an accurate portrayal of issues facing high school students. Perhaps, but everything is described too far-fetched. There seems to be an attempt at a "Nude Gun" - type of esque of comedy, but the distribution is off; There are too many spaces between each actor line, as if they're caught up to laugh (there was no). The script writer was all around. They tried to tackle many controversial issues together in one movie, almost never completely developing any of them (especially the girl received unforeseen by a teacher). I did not laugh at this entire film once. I was too insulted by the attempt at humor and satire doing nothing but rolling my eyes off the screen.
