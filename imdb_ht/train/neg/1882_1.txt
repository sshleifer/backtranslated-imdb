What a tough piece of garbage! Who are all those blubber about how good this is? Yes, it's "ati"; and yes, it's "alien", but .... that's not enough. The plot is boring and lunch, as a reality show but not so slickly made. <br /> <br /> People are intrinsically worthwhile; but as the characters do not have enough depth feel sympathy for them. If they are based on real people then I feel very, very sorry for them. The <br /> <br /> The violence (and some of it is very violent) looks quite exaggerated and free.
