Another variation and improvisation over their famous and beloved childhood stories, La Bete (1975) aka the animal tries to imagine (in very graphic and what may seem offensive and disturbing but in reality rather funny and funny way), actually happened between Beauty and the Beast? I am amused by numerous reviews and comments that seem to look too deeply in this movie. I would not go so far as saying it is a serious and black exploration of subjects such as sexual frustration, longing, progress, or satirical criticism of the Catholic religion. I would not even call it a horror-erotic movie. It's more of the parody about it as it touches or mentions even though it has some shocking moments in all departments that are sure to stay in your memory. Time (long too long) the scene between a young Aristrak woman and supposedly worried but the most ridiculous I've ever seen in the movie cinema and really impressive ... quite anatomically, is set in the keyboard of the Scarlatti and is hysterical . My husband and I both laugh out loud at the exaggerated details of the meeting. The morality of the scene is - beauty can and will defeat the monster. The question is - who is the target audience for the movie? For a erotic photo, it's too much interpretation; for an art film - it's too much jaw-dropping the absolute sheen scene and I'd say a late ending. IMO, the movie's creator did not mean to be a serious drama. As an imitation of art / horror / erotica home, it is odd and certainly original. Make a good laugh and try not to look for some deep meaning. The story of the curious beauty and the lustful creatures certainly do not recommend co-watching with the kids. The opening scene that can shock a preacher viewer more than the sadness scene of socializing can be successfully used On discovery channel for the program such as "In the world of animals - mature habits and horse riding."
