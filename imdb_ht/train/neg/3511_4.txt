'I'm working for a disaster making industry in the future and I start to get confused about who I really am, sh * # t! I had a headache and things would be wobbly, or here comes another near subliminal fast-cut touching hurt in significant yet cryptographic images ... '<br /> I rent this movie because comment The few out there have all been favorable. Why? Cypher is a cheap, derivative, dummy movie, put in a twist to realize futureworld future, with wooden drive, and an unhappy end. An unusual sense of something exciting may be about to catch you watching an increasingly funny and compelling series of events, before the movie makers slap you into the face and end that combines the worst of bondage with a Duran Duran video. It's painfully obvious that they have eked out the production using Doctor Which style etc. special effects in order to include a few good (if a little Babylon 5) CGI set pieces. This club fights sub, under Philip K Dick's future noir thrills effort for a wider dimension than its modest budget will allow. Cool blue moisture uses skin-facing gravity - disappointingly mute. This is not smart sci-fi, this is the plot of a computer game.
