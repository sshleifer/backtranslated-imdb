This was a filmable film but draw was a bit weak and most of the jokes came from some of Rodney's earliest movies. With that said, it was worth the time to look. I gave this a 5 out of 10. So basically, its one of these movies is that you do not go out of the way you see, but if you find it on the tube, take a chance.
