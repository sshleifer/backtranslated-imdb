Where to start, there are very bad and terrible about this movie I'm not sure where to start. Well, the stooges have written this pepper. Joseph Green and Rex Carlton, first they could not make up the so-called spirits for a name. I guess they split the difference, and that's why the main headline is BRAIN that would not die, but the end screen says head did not die. Nobody knows anything about the medical profession. After all the doctors swore "do nothing wrong". Killing a woman for a head transplant would be considered "wrong". Plus, a little thing is called blood and matching tissue. Rejection would spell death to John in the pan. Plus that keeps a piece of patchwork. Which medical school has made Bill Graduate, FRANKENSTIEN UNIVERSITY? Old FU, or MAD SCIENTIST TECH? The monster had no name, which the hell flew out of me. Plus, the brilliant doctor Doctor Bill Cortner does not know how to keep a patient sedated? All and every disaster in a movie, it's incredibly stupid and indisputable, except on MST3K. I give him the THANKSGIVING TURKEY.
