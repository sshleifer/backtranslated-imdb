So I heard from some people that this film was brought in tears in the theater. As I watched her for the first time I hoped another romantic, tear-trembling Barbra Streisand movie; Something like our way. I was certainly wrong. The chemistry between the two main characters, Esther Hoffman and Jan Howard, was nonexistent, making it impossible to get attached to the characters. There was nothing romantic about it. Streisand's character fell to an addictive drug drug that could not sing a single note without making me want to hit the button fast. At one point he finds her husband in bed with another woman and forgives him about five minutes later. There is nothing romantic about a dying stone star and a woman who can not seem to realize it until she actually dies. Part of the movie seemed to drag on and off, and I kept asking myself when he went to the end. <br /> <br /> The death of John Howard was completely predictable. There was totally obvious present in his reckless behavior early in the movie, and when he died I felt no emotion as well. It was not a tragic accident, it was him basically being a fool. Not to mention the whole movie I was distracted by beard himself. <br /> <br /> The only parts of this film are worth seeing the Streisand songs. The movie movie when she sang "With a more look at You / Look Now Now" was the reason I gave this movie a whopping 3/10. Those 7 minutes were the only part of the movie I actually felt another emotion than irritation and anger.
