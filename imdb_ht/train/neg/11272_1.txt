... the first movie I walked out on. And she had been discarded with the pre-screening equipment (Not that I was involved, I hastened to add). I did it in the first hour, so I decided I just qualified to comment, but that was my limit. <br /> <br /> Like other comments here, how did this happen to any QA type. An accumulation of the worst in dialogue, the hacking of wood acts, shakes terrible, all wrapped together without a draw. Tara Fitzgerald's filing was scarce, almost comical. He owns the worst Russian accent of film history. <br /> As I left the screening, the director and producers were drunk at a bar outside the cinema. They obviously could not sit in it anymore. <br /> <br />
