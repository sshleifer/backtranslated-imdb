There was nothing about this movie that I liked. It was so obviously low-budget and bad lighting and camera work (almost like Blair Witch Project, only he was not supposed to be that way). There was not really much of the plot, and the movie just drugs on and off. I'm currently fast-sent to the last 1/3 of the movies, but that did not help much. It looked like it might be good out of the box, but I must say again: anything about this movie would look good. No good actors, the special effects were so fake, the camera work was terrible, and the dialogue was terrible painful. On my own personal scale, I give this movie a 0 of 10. Yikes!
