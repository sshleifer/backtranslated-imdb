What's God's name here? How does one go about creating this is practically a cheap knockoff in Redneck Zombies? Zombie '90 has always meant to entertain someone ... anyone, or even make a dollar profit? But especially, what happened here? The '90 extreme disease 'zombie was directed by a fool by Andreas Schnaas, specializing in film Gore-Gore, and Anthropophagus 2000, with some of the profane titles. In the Gore department, this one is not much different than the rest. Although, the level of incompetence ... well, earth-crushing. <br /> <br /> The zombie '90 Extreme Evil Disease is as fierce as the Dead-alive Peter Jackson is gory, thinking about it. /> Getting too specific and the story should be a waste of time. An injury, involving chemicals that cause the dead to come back and live in the living. Never has the concept been treated in a way. The weakest effects are a whole, new low. Just a Z-class nightmare. I can not say if, or not this was originally meant to be funny, somehow, I doubt the English dubbing was very true to the original script, but the strange things happened. The only thing to remind me of an injection-on-video introduction in a movie Troma, except it lasts a lot in a lot more. <br /> I saw one movie that was worse than this, the Chooper. <br /> For proof that Andreas Schnaas is a real director, I would highly recommend Nikos Imperer If you think you have no standard of what you look for in a bad movie, give extreme pestilence a try, but you've been warn. It takes the steel nerve to make it all the way through. And if Gore is all you here for, then you might be able to abolish this one. Other than that, there is no atmosphere, no, and I mean there is no budget, no entertainment value, but mostly, no pride. Show some pride, Schnaas. 1/10 <br /> <br /> Update 7/5/09: After some more zombie look '90, I had a change in heart, or I guess I just got it right now. Zombie '90 is hilarious, so nevermind the harsh words, Although, Extreme Wars lose still merely a star.
