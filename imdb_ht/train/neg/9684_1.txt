Inclined, stagy, weird and opaque, if visually striking ... a whimsical-erotic fantasy. Really boring, too much nadity way (including father-son incest), and just a sort of uncomfortable cynical. I will confess, however, that certain passages of dialogue, taking on their own terms, have a lulling, haunting kind.
