The first thing first: I'm not a conservative. And even though I never referred myself as a liberal or a Democrat, I was opposed to the war in Iraq from one day. I think it's safe to say John Cusack and I would probably see eye-to-eye on politics, in fact, I'm sure we would drink buddies if we ever got to talk about how big BBC Adam Adam's documentation. My point is this: do not discredit this review by thinking I'm not part of the korus who preaches at War, Inc. There are no political policies that are tailored to appeal to my demographics, but the problem is, adapting to the subconscious and film of Cusack's co-authors, products and stars, fits worse than a cheap costume. As they say "the way to hell paved with good intentions." Cusack, co-writer, director of Joshua Seftel and even the actors involved, no doubt had the intent to make an anti-war film every bit as biting and funny as Robert Altman M * A * S * H, unfortunately for the viewer, they ended up with one as unfunny and unintelligent as Michael Moore's Bacon Canadian. The current state of US policy, foreign policy and the war "effort" is already absurd and, as a result, tragic, and, regr√©tably funny - just watch the daily show and see for yourself. The bottom line is: You can not write as humorous material as Bush's administration gives us a daily basis, so why try to compete? <br /> <br /> The main problem with YES is that it feels he has put together in a hurry. To get it done, Cusack basically cannibalized Grosse Pointe Blank (one of her best films), changed the setting and stacked in a shopping list of ideas arising from the collecting work of Naomi Klein. Most of these ideas are rammed down to your throat in the first twenty minutes of the movie and so they are so obnoxious is not one of the jokes or gags or spells obviously the reference to Halliburton, the neo-account and the US occupation In Iraq, they are imaginative, intelligent or funny. Writers are so blind by their own dogmatic feel that by simply referring to these issues the film would be funny and subversive. The problem is ... it's not. Now these ideas are news of yesterday and unless you've lived under or rock or are so blind by ignorance, refusal and sheer absolute (read: a Christian wing), these ensultingly simple jokes. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> As it is, the jokes and the eye gags all surface and are so bad, with little little, intricate or satirical cruelty, they did little more than make me groan. Homer Simpson once said "It's funny 'cause it's true" and the show every day proves this every night; War, Inc. however proves that just because it's true does not make it funny. The bottom line: Hyperbole is not required when it comes to lamooning US / neo-conservative politics ... it's already a great joke. <br /> http://eattheblinds.blogspot.com/
