Unlike the "Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai", or "The Big Problem of Little China", or the "Conan Barbarian", which is horrible film that has a certain calmness and humor deprecating humor that turns them into cult sensation, the Golden Tim is just plain bad. <br /> <br /> The situation itself is not unworkable, and there are some funny moments. But here's Eddy Murphy's "flip attitude" just to blame any feelings of tension or danger in the story. And the special effects are comical enough to make more damage to that strain. "Mystic Secrets" Tibetan Buddhists are love rather than drawn on forcing. <br /> <br /> Without a feeling that anything is at stake, or that the characters are facing no real danger, why should we care? br> <br /> Who should watch this movie: <br /> <br /> - big fan Eddy Murphy who can not help themselves <br /> - I can not think of anyone else < I'm going to give this movie a 4 out of 10 for the occasional joke that worked.
