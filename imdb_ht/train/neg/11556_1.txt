Oh, these Italians! Assuming that movies about aristocracy and unusual fetishes, the castles were drowned in gothic atmosphere, and back-stabbing family tries to get their hands on an inheritance are naturally exciting at all! If you've seen one movie of this type, you've basically seen them all (the favorite MST3K "Screaming Skull" fits the mold, too) ... and "The Night Evelyn came from the tomb" formulic, not-numbers, and dull in hell. Even the appetizer Bling Apart from being wasted here. <br /> <br /> zero / 10 <br /> <br />
