Worst shows I've ever seen. The story is about a group of teens who, for some reason inexplicable, have super powers, and when using some special devices, they are morphed in strange, costly harm done. Acting when not in the late-looking costume is decent. Definitely not good, but not worst act I've ever seen. However, when wearing the costumes, acting actors from bad worse; much, worse. The too-animated heistists have a myriad of unnecessary motions to do. Even when they speak they seem to be in crisis. The villains are stupid than the Rangers. Each episode, some weak, idiotic villains come up with some plans to destroy the Rangers. He / she then sends a force of ultra-animated aliens to attack the Rangers. The Rangers then initialized their 10-hour animation to transform, then they annoy foreigners. Then the evil man is born, which can either be a harmless writer who actually resembles evil acts, of a human-like human-like animal and trumpet attached to his back showing obvious signs of mental retardation. Power Rangers fight the cruel off, then the cruel turn into Godzilla, whether it be by a rain cloud or a nuclear missile (yes, fire nukes of animals and animals are turned into giants). Power Rangers over 5 minutes acting hyper-animated and summoning the Zords that are obviously the game that producers in the show use special effects on making them look real. Power Rangers have, the villain gets mad, they all teach a "valuable" lesson, and the show ends. That's it. Twenty-five minutes of brain-wash, fake kung fu fighting.
