Despite the reputation on the DVD coverage of the version I borrowed, this movie was a disappointment. Yes, it is far more realistic than other film films in the period for describing the mud pit, and the frustration of the grunt, but unfortunately one comes out and thinks it is all there to have this movie. There is no scheme and the dialogue is monotonous. It's not that a good movie movie needs to have a battlefield every five minutes. One of the best film World War II, "Twelve O'Clock High," has very little action. But it offset by drug defense and psychological tension. Exceptions to the "G.I. Joe Story" are a short battle segment (titled "Citywide Underground" on the DVD) that takes place in Italy. Admittedly it is one of the fast-paced and convincing combat scenes in any movie war. But alas, the rest of the movie is not worth watching just for this highlight. Another turn-off is Pvt. Dondaro, played by Wally Cassell, who is meant to be a "romeo", but comes in a pervert. Conversely, the Sgt. Warnicki is a sympathetic, defective, man. As Captain Walker (Mitchum) volunteered for another patrol, "Every step forward is a step closer to the home." But what are the steps? one patrol too many ?? drives him on the mental side. Too bad the rest of the movie does not do justice to some otherwise good touches. As for Meredith's painting in Pyle ... it is practically comet.
