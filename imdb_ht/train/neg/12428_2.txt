I loved the first movies, but this movie was just a waste of time and money (for me and the studio). I always wonder why this horrible movie was created. The thing with the plastic gun and the game machine, which can go to another ridiculous house. Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern in the first two cinemas were so funny, but the terrorists of this one are so stupid and not funny. Believe me this movie is just a waste of time.
