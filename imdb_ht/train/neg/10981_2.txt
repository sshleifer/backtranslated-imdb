Or listen, for this matter. Even the band is a do. <br /> <br /> Honestly, this is not the worst movie I've seen (that would About Billy), but it's down very close to the bottom of the barrel. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />. It's not that the plot is busy - in the hands of a good writer he might have worked. . . It certainly could be more fun. There is only one point you can not see coming for ten miles down the road. The dialogue is flat. The old jokes. To add insult to injury, it's full of one dimension, stereotype gays. <br /> <br /> Nothing in this movie convinced me that the situation or relationship of driving was possible, much less real. There was no chemistry, no dynamics, in fact there is no evidence of why driving they love each other. . . we just say they're in love. Difficult face when they have nothing in common and not compatible sexually. They like the same book? Huh? <br /> <br /> The act is not totally bad, but the rhythm is excruciatingly slow. I mean, almost Jarmusch- Ralanti, but without quality Jarmusch. In fact, that would be a good barometer for you. If you like Jarmusch movie, avoid this one.
