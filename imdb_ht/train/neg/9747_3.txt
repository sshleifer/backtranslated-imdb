Ok first of all, this movie sucks. But let's examine why. The proposal that a machine capable of transforming subjects into energy, storing it, and then transporting it and reassembling it is in the least intriguing. But this as far as to take this quote. Instead of delving into what might happen if someone made this kind of machine, they broke the damn thing. This could be a good thing. Living with responsibly this kind of power, and dealing with the constant temptation, means the invisible man. But no .. they break the stuff damn. And Lembach wants to leave. So then the Jerry-rigs doctor returned the thing together and tried to transport herself. Only have her goofed up by her handsome but dumb secretary, (duh). That would not happen if Lembach had not decided to leave. So now it is roaming the countryside to kill people because his little experience failed, and would not give him money. Wah. Then make the movie worse, dropping into a British political circle between the semi-competent teachers to help him. Between love sessions, they make a couple of half-hearted attempts to get it while killing off half of London. All of this could have been led by breaking down the damn car, which would never happen if Lembach did not leave. This movie tried so I gave it an honest 2 star for effort, but it would be best if they did not break the damn car, making Lembach leave, making it try again. Damn ou Lembach !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
