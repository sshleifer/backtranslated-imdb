I can not believe that this movie has ever been created. I think at the point the director tries to make it an artistic piece but that's just making it worse. The zombies seem to have implemented many eye makeups. Zombies are only in the movie for a few minutes. Finally, there are perhaps five or six total zombies, definitely not a nation. The best part of the movie, if one is definitely credited because the painful experience has finally ended. Again repeating other user comments, the Voodoo priests are weird and do not make much sense in the entire movie. Also, there is a scene with a snake and a romanian girl who just does not make sense at all. It never explains.
