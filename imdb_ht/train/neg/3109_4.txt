This movie was not terrible but it was not good. I'm a big fan of Toni Collette I think he's a very beautiful and talented actress. The movie starts off on Robin Williams who is a writer and gets a book from a 14 year old kid. The book is great and can not believe a child has written it. Toni Collette plays children's custody that you do not know if this kid really exists or is doing it all up. I will not ruin the movie but I'll say this movie is not scary. <br /> <br /> The act is very good and Toni Collette's performance was awesome as well as Robin Williams. The movie was a big disappointment in my opinion I would wait for it to come to DVD.
