Well let me say that I've always been a fan of Seagal Steven and his movies are usually great but that's just not measured up to the rest. This in my opinion is very stupid I did not like it all. The biggest reason I do not like it is because it is very flawed and I do not make much sense. The very bad act even Steven Seagal does not do good act, the rest of the actors I can see because they just do direct to video movies. It does not follow a straightforward scenario everything happens at once so why it does not make much sense. That's barely any action in it at all and in order to make a good action movie you usually need action in it. Special effects are very bad and you can say they are fake. So all of this has the worst movie movie so so if you want to see a movie Seagal Steven does not rent this one just to pretend it does not exist. So just avoid this movie. <br /> <br /> Overall note: ** from ********** <br /> <br /> * from *****
