Eric Rohmer 'Lady and Duke' is based on the newspapers of an English aristocrat who lived in the French Revolution. But it is a matter that makes itself, and its unusual, painted adorned and accustomed to tone conversation. Most notably, this portrait of horror portions takes place almost entirely of one withdrawn from the actual action; one sees many of ordinary people in this film, and little of the disorder, poverty and terror that unfolds away from the drawing rooms of persecution, but spoiled, aristocratic class. The result is often dull, and ultimately unenlightening on the forces that sometimes drive society to the great destruction; it's a disappointing movie from an acclaimed director.
