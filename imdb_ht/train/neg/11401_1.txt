The script was very weak and / or character enough to take care of a bit about the characters or what's happening. The script is way too talk and not enough gore or action even calling it slow to rhythm. The story gets to the point that you just want everyone to close and die as quickly as possible so you do not have to listen to talk about this very muted, stiff dialogue. On a technical note, the music mix is ​​a high way and makes it hard to understand what is being said most times. Then again, this can be called a blessing. In general, this same story could best be said in a short film / a run time under 30 minutes. The obvious "in your face" homage Sam Raimi and "Dead Dead" would have been good to have been more subtle, but here they look more like a bald faced Rip. C'mon, this kind of 35mm budget and this is the best that could do? Still, the cinema, lighting design and vaccine were very well done.
