The question, when one sees a movie this bad, is not necessarily, "How does a bad movie get done?" or even, "Why did I see this terrible in the first place?" but, "What did I learn from this experience?" Here's what I've learned: <br /> <br /> - Just because the "rules" of horror movies have been catalyzed and satirized countless times in the last ten years by means of a person will not go ahead and make a movie that uses ALL of them, without a little bit of humor or irony. <br /> - <br /> - If your movie has to be described as ** ** wounds ** based on the video game, you have script problems. <br /> - Black characters can not always die first, but the Asian character still knows kung-fu. <br /> - While you can be proud to figure out how to do the "Matrix effect" on a budget, which does not necessarily mean you should use it over and over again. <br /> - When Ron Howard's brother does not guarantee the role of choice. - Whenever a scene is not modified together, just use some footage in video games, no one will notice. <br /> - If your rap-metal cousin offers you to write your movie theme for free, politely decline. <br /> <br /> - Zombie cinemas are not a zombie kill man. They are about murder zombies, preferably in the most possible way possible. That's what they are PROPERTY. <br /> <br /> - White people can pay $ 1600 to get to a worthy rave of death. <br /> - If you find an old book, it will tell you all you need to know. Anything else you will evaluate on your own two lines after someone asks, "What was that?" or, "Where are we?" - Breasts with no horror film panacea. <br /> <br /> - A helicopter boom shot and a licensing contract with Sega Magically transform your movie from "student film" to "drop-off studio". Try it! <br /> - Just because you can not drop all three "Living Dead" movies, which do not make you George Romero. Or even Paul W. Anderson. <br /> I saw worse movies, but only because I saw "o combat: cancellation."
