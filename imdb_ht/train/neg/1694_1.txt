This film may seem scary about advertising, but the actual movie was a cause for vomiting. This is a lower than average, (even lower than that) and there is no scheme. I mean every home can make you feel scared and sure, a Japanese Japanese woman would scare the pope out of you, but so what? Make a movie that would appeal to watch and not only show scary images with some hair (dead Japanese woman). Can you say "terrible rip-off in Samara (the ring)"? Not getting started with the "dead child". Not even scary! So, what? He has a cat and he can imitate it, great deal franchise! Just bury the poor zombies and save some lives that have the potential to be hurt by the rudge! 1/10! Yuck! >. <
