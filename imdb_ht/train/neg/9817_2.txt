Wow ... absolute glossy .. <br /> Turn a suspense / suspense / horror to comedy. <br /> After I watched this, I never laughed so hard in a previous horror movie ... a ridiculous plot with 3 characters that was just insanely developed - either by writing in depth or too much depth. <br /> <br /> If you want to watch a movie movie written absolutely written and stupid dialogue, messed up draws, useless scenes, wasted characters, bad sounds and disgusting developments in general, then this is one of them look. <br /> <br /> Make sure you keep focused on the classic "processor" stage and the fully investigated police investigation scene. /> <br /> This is a remarkable new bar of screen performance and writing and to sit in it for the entire duration to make you either stupid, daring or brave.
