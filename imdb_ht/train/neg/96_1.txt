.. Oh wait, I can! This movie is not for the typical movie snobbies, unless you want to brush up on your typical cynic definitions, such as "continuity correction" and "geographic match". I could not tell where I was in this movie. A second will be in the present, the next minute alleged in the 70's to drive a modern SUV and wearing what looked like me like 80's style dress. I think. I could not pay long enough attention to her since the act was just awful. I think it only got attention because it has a 3D that I did not watch. If you are a movie buff, and not b-movie I mean BAD movie, then this movie is for you. It's home-movie and every non-sense style will keep you laughing for as long as you can stay awake. If you taste more for Goddard and Antonioni, though, just jump this one.
