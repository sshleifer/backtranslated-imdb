A movie that you want to throw yourself on a sword. I have seen slocks in my time, but after watching the nasty mess I do not think I can ever watch another movie again. God is the mercy of the souls who have done this. <br /> <br /> The first-ex-army quiet stud, character character character character (actually acting) goes looking for the girl who sends him a Xmas card while serving in the military. The ground and barrel living-granola type of family needles. Family takes it and takes 2 hours of our time for the chick to see it's a better catch than it's liberal looking, drinking French wine, porsche driving, loud cell phone talking, lazy, slicking city, Jewish looking fiance. > <br /> The bad-1d characters, 1d themes. When you beat on the top and the pro-military theme. Ed Asner. <br /> <br /> Good trading breaks were long. Peter Jason. He finished.
