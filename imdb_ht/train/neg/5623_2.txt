Hollywood's attempts to turn Jack London's life into an adventure movie "Jack London" is not a bad idea; certainly, it has led an interesting, and sometimes adventurous, life. This movie, however, winds up flat and unsatisfactory. Most importantly, it lacks integrity. Michael O'Shea (as London) has some Londonesque speeches; and, it's nice to see her Jack krinad receive "call in the wild" after spending some time alone, in the snowy mountains, and her dog, "buck". Virginia Mayo and Susan Hayward are both pretty. The film draws unfortunate "Yellow Peril" parallel between London's and World War II, which is both welding and insulting.
