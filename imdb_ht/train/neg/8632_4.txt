I'm a big fan of Charlton Heston. It is without a doubt one of the greatest actors of all time, but what he thought when he made this movie. Normally if he made a bad movie I could blame it on the seniorist or director, but in that case it's all his. Suckiness in this movie is all her fault. It proves that not even Heston can make an interesting Shakespeare story. I wasted 2 and a half hours of my life on this recurrence and I will never get this time back. This is far FEST Heston movie that I've ever seen. If you're a fan of Shakespeare maybe you'll get this fun movie, but if you do not waste your time, you'll regret it in the long run.
