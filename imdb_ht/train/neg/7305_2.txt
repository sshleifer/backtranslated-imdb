The situation in Fever Cabin starts as it may have something to offer. A group of young colleges after final (in the fall?) Go to a resort cabin in the woods where one by one is attacked by an invisible meat virus. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the first paragraph is where any remote element to stop movie quality. Cabin Fever is little more than college-seeking college, bottle, talk that does not stand on anything, and see how many F-bombs can be found in 1:40 minutes or however time disorder is. Children <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> One of them for example discovered that the skin virus has infected his legs, so what does he do? He keeps his babies from taking good medical attention to his injuries. The scene is little more than a gross out. In another scene, Strong Rider from "Boy Enemies World" has bitten on the hand by some kid who only says "pancakes" and loves to make karate kicks on people sitting next to him. If you can figure out why why the kid's "kid" was included, I would like to know. Anyway, pet rider a wild dog and go to wash my hands in a creek that is most likely to contaminate. Another child likes to drop F-bomb to react to everything around him and shoot squirrels. Why? Your desires are as good as mine! <br /> <br /> Strong rider is the only kid with any recognition of this movie. He tries to calm people down in between the call and screaming with F *** Y **! bombs that people are throwing around. When children do not cry, they have or talk about sex or talk nonsense for other adult characters that are more than (if possible) idiotically than children! The fool fool and an IQ in the best 60 might be one of the active WORST works I've ever seen in a movie. You talk about those who do not play with a full deck, this dork does not even know how to get the cards! LOL! I was like, "Are you PLEASE closed already!!" It makes the kid actors seem genius! The only part that I sort of liked the scary story's story (although gory) on the bowling alley core. In an interview, Rider said he had a great deal of respect for director El Roth. But the problem is that Mr. Roth appears to be little more than shock and Gore. There are so many bad things about this movie for Mr. Roth for getting credit. I wish I could agree with rider and find something likable on this movie. Maybe the landscape falls from the beginning? Actually, JUST Jumper Riders save this movie from them a 1! Hopefully, he has been rewarded for this junk!
