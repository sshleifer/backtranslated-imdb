The haze is confused by mumbo-jumbo who wants it so hard to be the worst victim of Bruce Campbell's references several times. The problem is, it is simply not in the same league as this film is terrific. This film is nowhere near as original. The plot was used before, by Kevin Tenney at night of the demons, and that was a lot more fun. This flick of excessive waste time and intricate exposure before getting the kids into the spooky castle and starting to be the devil. Brad Dourif is, as usual, does not give much to do here, but when he's on his screen puts on another over-the-top performance that would make Christopher Walken jealous. As for the children's affairs, it's barbecue but there is no good means. The unstable camera work is more annoying than smart or atmospheric. There is a good moment when the first guy gets owned and launched around some deadly material while sending his victim, but he never fears for the second time. The great level is mid-range bar, but the director tries to make up for not showing the topless actress a few times. All in all, just okay if you have 87 minutes of garbage.
