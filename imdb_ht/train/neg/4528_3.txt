This worldwide version was the cheapest of what the NWA under Jim Crockett Junior and Jim Crockett promotions made back in the 1980s on locating the Big 3 Stations during Wrestling Craze / Morning Wrestling Day. When Ted Turner got his hand on Crockett's failed version of NWA and turned him into the World Championship Tournament and proceeded to release all NWA referrals altogether. NWA World Wide and NWA Pro Wrestling have been relocated to the WCW logo and moved on the Disney / MGM Studios routes in Orlando, Florida, and eventually came to nothing more than boosting showers for Nitro, Thunder, and Saturday Night. Worldwide, the official WCW program was under Turner's weekly weekend tournament at WCW from Vince McMahon and WWF. Today all NWA World Wide / WCW Worldwide Video Tape Archive and all NWA / WCW video tape libraries generally lie in the graves at WWE headquarters in Stamford, Connecticut.
