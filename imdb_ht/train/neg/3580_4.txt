The memory banks in most of the reviews here must've short-tide when trying to remember this cubic Zirconia in a gem, because virtually everyone managed to misconduct Lloyd Bochner's Walter Thornton, when in a fit of peevish anger , she hurls the phallic mouth of her new wife, Jerilee Randall-Thornton, (an almost comic Pia Zadora) who used her sexual assault earlier in the movie ... but I'm getting ahead of myself. In any case, poor Lloyd could have snarling this line at the speechless speech as much as it puts on the co-star. <br /> Hard as it is for most of us believe, especially those days, nobody in Hollywood sets out to intentionally make a bad movie. This is certainly not the most defensive argument to do, since there just seems to be so damn much of them out. But then again, there is the movie that one must imagine during the time of its creation, in writing, casting and direction, must have been cursed and equivalent to the cinemas trying to shoot during the Ides of March. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />! Here we have all the ingredients in a guaranteed recipe to produce a falling monument fall: Pia Zadora, a marginal singer / actress to determine that he must take seriously, that he would take on practically anything that could put him apart from his comrades her class (which movie certainly did!); a somewhat high-profile novel written by the Trashmaster himself, Harold Robbins (in the CARPETBAGGERS and DREAMS DIE FIRST FAMILY); a cast that probably thought they were so likely to be working at all, that they tried to play this touch as he was Clifford Odets or Ibsen; plus a director more than likely was a hire gun that kept the moving disruption just collecting a check, (and probably the compulsory contract was required by the use of Alan Smithee's moniker to protect what was left in his reputation.) Like Lamont Johnson's LIPSTICK, Meir Zarchi i jump on your damn, BARBARELLA Roger Vadim, Paul Verhoeven's SHOWGIRLS or grandmammy's really hurt movie, Frank Perry's MOMMY DEAREST, LADY'S LADY is usually often-discussed, (usually with disgust, disbelief, laugh fears, or a unique combination of all three), yet also challenging deserters, descriptions or even straits of Hollyweird. Nobody knows how it was, how it has ever been released in a single single theater, or why it's still here and almost impossible to get rid of, but taking it or leaving it, it's here to stay. And I do not think that lovers of movies really good BAD would have it any other way.
