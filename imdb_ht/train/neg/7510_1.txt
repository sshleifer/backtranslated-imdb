The film is a collection of clich√©s about just about anything out there. It has no focus any, there is no purpose, no real message. Symbolism is pushed to the top and stereotypes are abundant and outrageous. This film can not resist the temptation of making drama that does not exist. Each small exchange of words gets instantly in a long, unfounded dialogue that is so typical of a rehearsal class acting. Where there is no substance in this exchange, the actors (regardless of how good they are normally) can not help but offset with exaggerated emotions, aka "raising the stakes". Over acting, simply wear it. The principal has no help here. Nothing can save this story from history. It is forced, fake and boring with tears. Enchanting of rock punk portaraying and Who, pierced with 90's flashy team. Blank characters without a role, detail and motif. Localities are arbitrary. This is Boogie Nights as the Good Fell and Night Saturday Night, with meaning and art torn out. <br /> <br /> Good DP. I'll give it that. <br /> Some films have flaws. This movie is Lee's fault. It was sold out, like the rest of them. Has become irrelevant. It's nothing to worry about. <br /> I have no idea to see anything yet out of this guy (who I'm going to avoid being nominated from now on).
