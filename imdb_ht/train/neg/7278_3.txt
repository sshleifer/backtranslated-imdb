This film is apparently a bit bit of a bit later. None of the segments are good, but at least the first one was lustrous fun, and the middle was somewhat imaginative. One final one was just plain brutal, and after sitting in two weak commercial shorts, the third was really painful to look. Even by low standards in a National Lamp Movie, this one seemed especially boring and happy.
