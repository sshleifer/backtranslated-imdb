Spoilers will be in this. The movie could be best if they had just had a different script, director, and CGI provider. Not much right? The movie has a man starting his own theme park ... err ... zoo on a desert island where people can see dinosaurs ... errors ... Sabretooths and so-called Jurra ... oops ... Primal Park. I do not mind rip-offs, because there is no original idea for these kinds of movies, but this one just bumps you in the face with it, R epe a tedl y.There are the same "top top pencil on design" the thing. The Sabretooths, non-sabertooths according to Mr. Primal Park (Just ancient cat kill), are rather junky but the crowning achievement is one of my "sloggy". Because after the throw of one big cat, a hero relaxing a little because there is one left. Join the guy eating unusual saying, Nah, we did three, the third being a monster that pulled herself around with her front legs. Great, groovy. A group of college students are also on the island for a hunting scavenger, having tests to get into the frat or clutter clicks (Always thought to need a short nickname). From those who live, one has completed their work, so I got a kick out of that. Oh yeah, the binding "evil capitalist must die" clicks are in force and not one, but two of them! Mr. Primal Park is the most ridiculous thing you will ever see in one of the films as a loose slab of the Sabretoth (courtesy of sloggy), reculiting a few sizes, and manipulating the man in the throat. If I only gotten away so easy. I love "Sabretooth" better than this turn-off.
