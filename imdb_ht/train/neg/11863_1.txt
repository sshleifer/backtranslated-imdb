I thought that this movie was a disappointment I expected it to be so much better than it was. I'm glad I did not pay to see this film and that I did not sit in a movie theater for this one. Where to start on this movie, acting in this movie was average, the humor was terrible and just the overall scenario of this movie was not special. I thought that this movie was thought to be great, but it was not much more than a cheese garbage in time. I think the act of this movie was terrible no of the actors in this movie was chemistry, it just was not there. I think if we had a different Kirk acting actor than Jay Baruchel it might have been better, but the whole time I watched this movie she looked high and I did not get the feeling that he did not act in this movie. Now Alice Eve did a great job as an actress but there was no chemistry between her and Jay. All the actors in this film did not have names and there were very little impact on this film. The humor of this movie was not funny at all, there was a few stuff covered in this film that was OK but nothing worth saying to your friends that they would understand. I think Jim Field Smith had a hard time with this because he could not decide if he wanted a romance or a comedy. I honestly think it needs to stick with the Burger King advertising. I think that this movie could be best if the writers would go to a different director. The scenario of this movie is just like any other hot girl just OK guy love story ?? boring I think it would have been better if it had more originality, but what a nothing there. I honestly would not recommend anyone to watch this movie. I think you would have more entertainment at the dentist than in this movie. So save yourself the agony and just do not see it.
