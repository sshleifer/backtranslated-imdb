I have not seen the original, but just wanted to drop a quick note to anyone who goes down this far: Man Wicker is the worst movie I've seen this year. Maybe even in two years. I wish I could ask the theater for my money back or turn back time to warn myself not to see it. <br /> I'm going to give him two positive nodes: sarcastic of Cage's character at least got some laugh out of me and the scenery of the island was beautiful. Sorry, that's it. Here comes their jeers. The film scheme is only thrown forward because other characters will not give any direct cage - and put up with this !!! How that could go on for an hour of my time (much less day in the movie) is beyond me. <br /> <br /> Do not mention that the plot is full of holes. You leave the theater with unanswered questions to fill out a library. How could someone read this script and think, "Yes, people should pay $ 11 to see the shadow plan in which a movie should look like" is beyond me. <br /> Do not go to see this flick. Or even rent it on DVD.
