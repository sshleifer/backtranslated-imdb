One should ask if at any point in this movie production a script existed that made any sense. The rough 3 hour cut was <br /> long and was trimmed by the incoherent mess that survives? <br /> Why would anyone finance this chaos? I'll say Tom <br /> <br /> Wlaschiha is a good looking young man and he does what he can to <br /> with the dialogue and dramatic (?) Situations given. But the characters come and go for no apparent reason, continuity is <br /> non-existent, and acting, cinematography, and their direction is (to put it politely) . Not one sleep is an unfortunate <br /> choice of title as it will probably prove that they should not be anyone <br /> actually actually try to watch this movie.
