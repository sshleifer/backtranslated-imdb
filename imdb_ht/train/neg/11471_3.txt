Is it a coincidence that Orca did two years after jaws? Orca is not exactly a "Rip off" but it is obvious that he tried to profit from Jaws' success. First of all, my opinion in Orca was a movie, not terrible, but definitely not good, the best average. The draw is basically a male whale killer (orca) after seeing his mate and his unborn bull killed by a sailor seeking revenge. I could not stop watching this movie again. The direction of this film is poor and when compared to his jaw looks like directors, producers, and writers were almost talentless. <br /> <br /> As for the act, it was very mean and credible, however the real characters are not the least bit likable. The effects were being alerted for its time and the footage of killer whales look pretty good. <br /> <br /> The violence is confusing, bloody, and not recommended for the most sensitive people. The music is too much and very loud, dropping out the sound and irritating effects at times. I hated ways to exaggerate the intelligence of the killer whale (killer whale by getting married to one spouse as depicted in Orca). Overall this film was bad / poor in my opinion, because of the above reason. Some people can appreciate this movie more because of the concept of revenge among animals and people so I will not bash this movie and I can understand why some people might like it. Rating: 3.5 / 10 (but for concept it's possible a 5/10)
