I bought this DVD for Â£ 1 and now I realize why. The act was the worst I've seen in a long time. The lighting and sound are shoddy at best. The plot makes little sense even when moderate (WARNING: I do not advise watching this movie when mild.) This movie feels like watching a movie at someone who does not get much. It really is a shame that all of the money spent on this project went to such a waste, I look forward to seeing if any of those involved are still a career, other than long-term eva who is only "stars "in this movie that was apparently not hit with the acting actor. I'm sorry that none of this criticism seems constructive but I'll say one thing to James Cahill, do not try it anymore. In the words of squirlyem "It is severely lacking in the good department".
