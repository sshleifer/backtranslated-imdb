Well - when the appearance of cameo in Jason Miller (looking even more eroded than it did in Exorcist IV) is the high point in a picture, what did you get? <br /> It's a little country, a little stone roll: mix two drunks and money that drag the kid all over the place with a mog-dried mummy (do you calculate that out again - DRIED in a boon?) In the basement, Christopher Walken and a bad job, and a girl who might have been an interesting character if they would develop it. <br /> I understand - sort of - that they will return to visit his family. Then .... <br /> <br /> Problem: There are several interesting things that I must assume is her mother being killed in a car bombing (I think). This is never connected with anything. <br /> <br /> Problem: What do you need the grandma for? Now the grandmother can be interesting. He speaks Gaelic, or Celtic, or something. Maybe you can do something in it. The best thing to do is that he had a tobacco habit. That's all. <br /> <br /> Problem: Thrown a real shifty character as the husband. Did he cast the type (he will sell his wife to the devil? Maybe he can look forward to the trust fund he manages for it) or he cast against (after all, has a good couple and beautiful clothes)? He drinks, hes hesates. It's not a bad guy. Not a good thing. But particularly. Why did not they do something to him? <br /> No problem: an old companion shows up. The husband struck him down. He comes back to knock down the husband. (It becomes very stupid, but at least this character has motivation.) Now - it's an alcohol, it's an alcohol; he could only get married for his money. The grandmother is locked in the bedroom. The blind uncle took our heroine into the basement to show it to the mummy of a witch (you who follow this?) That can come to life. In fact, you know it will come to life, the music swells. A girl lives in the home, takes tea in the grandma (open the door to do that) and gives grandma and cigarette. Periodically, grandma comes out. But nothing happens. <br /> <br /> Husband and wife lost the kid in the house, immediately lost their bedroom. Uncle gets her throat off of the basement. The leading lady has nose-hemorrhage. Mary's cocktail. They both drink. In the face of all this, the terrible truth suggests in the first on-voice is - omigod - an abortion when the leading lady was twelve years old. <br /> <br /> In spite of all these pendant-thread ingredients, nobody managed to get a story on the screen. There is no bridge between situations, there is no graduation from serious disturbances of terrible horrible, slow-paced scenes that go nowhere .We, really, take care of - they had places to go with that aspect - the innocent kid In the charge of drunks, the grandmother would be locked because she is a monster, but no, her worst fault is to smoke. It has great hair, good makeup. <br /> <br /> In short, no scheme. Just a little random (predictable) violence in a dark library, with the rain gushing, and the sound of cuing us in. You need more than a few drunks and Christopher Walken to make a movie. Their production value was good. Oh. Nice scenery, good wardrobe. The cameraman, at least, knew what he was doing. <br /> I bought it. Poor me.
