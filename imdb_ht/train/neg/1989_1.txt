I would like to give this film a zero but that was not an option !! This movie sucks !!! Women can not act. I should know she was going to suck when I saw Bobby Brown. Nobody in my home can believe I have not changed the channel after the first 15 minutes. The idea of ​​black women as gunslingers in western days is ridiculous. It's not just something race, it's also a sex. the combination of ridiculous.I sorry because some of the people in the movie are not bad actors / actress, but the movie itself was terrible. it was not as a movie movie. it might be 'fun' in a certain group but not in this group. lol. and using a huge line from a big, great movie ... "That's all I have to say about that."
