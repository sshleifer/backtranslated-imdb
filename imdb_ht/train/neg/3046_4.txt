The first time I saw this film when I was about 10 years old. My mom bought her at our local Kmart because she was on sale for $ 5 on VHS. She thought it would be a nice Christmas movie for me and my brothers to look. This movie, however, frightened the hell from me. You can ask yourself, how could a movie about Santa Clause scare anyone? The plot of the movie revolves around Satan sending one his minions, pitch, to the ground in an attempt to kill Santa and ruin the Christmas. That's right, Satan sends a demon out of hell to kill Santa Clause. Santa's footsteps all Christmas Eve in his attempt to trap him on earth when the sun rises on Christmas day, because if Santa does not make it back to his home in space, he turns to powder. Do not get me wrong, the movie is fun and fun entertaining, however, the image of evil spirits and demons dancing to the depths of hell (which occurs at the start of the movie) is just downright creepy.
