I chose this movie by the cover that was a bad move. It was not funny at all and the main characters were reckless. The girl was beautiful but the story and the act was terrible. It has absolutely nothing to do with navigation. Terrible film and a "theme" surf that had nothing to do with surfing and no real surfers. Catherine Zeta Jones was beautiful and the movie will probably see a resurgence just becuase it is in the now limelight, being married to Gordon Gekko and all, but if you have not seen it does not waste your time. A bad movie with GREAT surfing, REAL surfers and amusing, beautiful movies were in the hands of GOD.
