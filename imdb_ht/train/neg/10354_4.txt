I was browsing Netflix and stumbled upon this film. Having good memory in the book as a child, I decided to check this out. This is a movie that you should really spend on. It is just not worth seeing. It's very boring and refreshing. I feel that it might be the same way young children. It has no magic that the book has. This movie is not terrible, but you'll just find yourself not taking care of ten minutes in it. There are just moments coming in as strange. Witch's character is not very good. The family acts like it is not great deal that odd things are happening. I know this is a movie child, so as an older audience we should not look too deeply in things, but the movie all just feels like it was written and produced by people who never had any movie experience first. <br /> The DVD that I started jumping at the final moments of the movie, and instead of trying to fix it I just turned it off and sent it back to Netflix. I really did not care how it ends. Skip this movie and read the book instead.
