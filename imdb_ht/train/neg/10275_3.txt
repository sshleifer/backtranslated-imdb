Most of all, it is amazing and some of the act, notably Sally Kellerman and Anthony Rapp, are good ... but this movie is close to unwatchable. The music sounds like it comes from some sort of free citizen site online and lyrics as if they were written with a rhyme dictionary open on the leg. Most of the song is off-key. I think they may have been filmed with the singing acapella and put in the music under his ... The dialogue is really stupid and trite. The movie works best when it is actually talking about the real estate, but unfortunately it's often lost in stupid sub-scheme. I found myself checking my look after the first twenty minutes and after 40 asking 'when is it ever going to end.'
