Need I say - it's a stinker! (I gave it a rating of 2) <br /> Only look it if you suffer from insomnia. There are many mill sceneries and hamming it up, but not much else happens in this movie. There is no suspense, no deep, shocking secrets reveal, there is no real threat to the heroine's well-being. A few disagreements, little up in voice - that's pretty much it. Secrets are nothing that could not happen to anyone - the latest "secret" revealed in the movie is totally predictable at that point. <br /> <br /> The plot, as it is, turns around a young woman named Faith (Meg Tilly), who is an artist, who is hired to paint a series of wall panels in a salon great in a vast mansion by a very, very wealthy, older woman, and a relationship that kind of mother / daughter older women craves with her. He turned out to be the older daughter, Cassandra, who died. You can very well fit the rest of the pieces together. Even the scenes with the mysterious men threatening our heroine does not move to the point where you're really afraid of her security beyond a second or two. Why it still hangs around years after Cassandra's death is a good question. There is also the question of the fact that in this vast castle there is one servant, a faithful butler who looks like everything - cooking, cleaning, serving the food, answering the door, etc. All except apparently blocking the door - since This should be the only explanation of how one of the characters just walks in a room where Faith is. There is nothing that will have you bracing your seat arm, and leaning forward on the edge of your seat, because there is no "mounting" tension in this film - just bland, pathetic revelation that gets tossed from time to time. <br /> <br />
