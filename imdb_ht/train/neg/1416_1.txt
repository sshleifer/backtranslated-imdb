Strange ... I love all this movie crew and black humor movies; but not like this one at all! It's terrible, terrible and surely not funny at all. Mercy can not make a whole movie draw, disguise either. And it was really boring. Long empty vacant film; he could remove it. It should have been in a shorter, concise format. Perhaps I expect too much from the crew - like saving the lol movie -. It was also full of clocks used in characters and situations ... I did not find it why people loved it ... "Poetry", "Hope"; nope 'mam, did not see anything like that! ^^ All in all, it's empty and rude, pitiful and hopeless. Oh tell this one ........
