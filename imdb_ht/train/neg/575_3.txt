This movie is not very good. It's boring, and not much blood for a horror movie. The plot just trods together with not much passing. And I think the girl vampire was so stupid. It was likely to kill the vampire hunters since it has lighting like reflexes. But every time she has one of the estimates, she just takes time and something is still happening where it does not bite. No wonder this went straight to cable. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> You are a sucker if you waste your time on that.
