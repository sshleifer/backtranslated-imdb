I'm a big fan / fan, I enjoy some horror films some people are considered stupid. I love gore. The more merrier is as long as it has a point. After reviewing the others on the site I was sure that this film was going to be a small gem. But many of my deceptions have proved to be one of the most pointless films I ever watched. The act was terrible, the dialogues were stupid, the plot was pointless, the special effects were useless and the correction was probably done by someone who died for the past 2 years. Generally I find that all these features make a great movie horror b. But not in this case. <br /> I was waisted 11 EUR to get this DVD. <br /> <br /> Unless you actually enjoy unnecessary Gore (for example "violent sh * t" films) avoid at any cost!
