Another of a long line of flicks is made by those who think that how to operate a camera is the same as telling a story. In 15 minutes, the entire site is set out in just a few lines, so there is absolutely no mystery, which eliminates a whole facet of the suspense. Only half of the competent actor's performance was killed 10 minutes into the movie, so we're leaving with stupid characters running around doing stupid things. Low budget films can not afford special expensive effects, so the CGI servings are impartially unimpressive, but at least one valid attempt. The animal costume is awful, as seen when it falls on the sidewalk, and the director keeps emphasizing the eyes, which are not the same red color shown in ice vaccinations. The dialogue is clumsy and uninspired, with some remembrance lines of aliens or Terminator. The last action section takes place at a police station, also a rip-off from Terminator, and everyone is hiding in one glass lane that the Darkwolf office does not break through. In the end, the girl calls the hero "a good protector," but she gets both her partner, the original protector, and at least three other civilians, not to mention a dozen cops, all killing without getting a decent shoot, in spite of an arsenal of silver bullets and a submachine gun. But here's the real clinic for writing bad: They might have killed the animal right after the credit starts when it holds the strip while flashing its red eyes. Instead, they took him to prison?!?
