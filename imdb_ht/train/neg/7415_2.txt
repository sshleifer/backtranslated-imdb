What do you call a horror story without horror and story? <br /> <br /> This is the most irritating thing about the movie: I find the feel of the writers never really decide what actually goes on in the movie! It is something different to know it, giving hints to the audience and not fully revealing it, but here, you get the feel of the screenwriters do not know it, characters in the movie do not know it and hearers see no one knows! (Remembering "Cube"? Even this film has known more about himself.) I have consume a lot of 80 movies / manure films and this film certainly has its root deep in these films. But many important things are missing. We really know anything about the characters. They keep repeating empty lines on and over again. The story does not really develop - it never goes anywhere. B-act is OK in this kind of horror movie, but there's not much to act in the script. We do not care about the characters. There is nothing to remember about them. There are not even cheesy humor or sex unnecessary. And most importantly - there is no emotion, no thrill. <br /> You only get some elements commonly used in the horror movie genre. They show Lordi monsters one by one, but the characters do not really contribute anything to the story. <br /> I believe honestly that this amount of history, character development and atmosphere can be achieved with the minimum amount of crew and equipment. Oh yes, movie makers use this - and much more - some 20 years ago! I felt the embarrassment shared in the audience as the movie ended. Too bad really.
