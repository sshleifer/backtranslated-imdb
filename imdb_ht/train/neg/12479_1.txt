DEATHSTALKER is perfect for B-Fantasy movie fans; This striking about 80-minute film-making features everything Hecklers may require - non-existently drawn, awful acting (saved for at least one old-breasted-old lady), skrupulous scripting and corrective correction, and bargain -Other style background style. There is no character that comes at all as likable or interesting (in particular, the lead has nothing to appeal about), and the actors are assembled barely doing anything up above the F-class material. If not enough, then how about the lack of a compelling plot (which movie is nothing of the sort) making DEATHSTALKER eligible as a major turkey? I've also been offended that the women in this movie barely serve any other purpose than 1) be topless and / or scantily clad; 2) get rape; 3) sex with the hero; 4) all above. In addition, the background music is hideous; a rare mess in electronic noise, chorus cheese bursts, and blockage orchestra cacophony. Early Engagement Engagement Engagement Engagement Eye, DEATHSTALKER is probably best suited for looking for something to laugh at (and believe me, there are many of that here). Otherwise, I do not recommend this 100th-grade CONAN to any person at least.
