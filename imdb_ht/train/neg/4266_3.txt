Certainly, some of the best horse rides, swordplay, and scrumptious scenes are likely to be seen, but this is not a good movie. It helps but the story shines on top of things. Then, Nomad surprised. <br /> <br /> The story has gotten, giving it a sense that she has to put together simply to make a "cool" movie that "looks" great. Not to mention that many of the main characters do not come from the region in which this story takes place (and it is flagrantly obvious with names like Lee and Hernandez). If film makers want to grow up in a culture like Jugars and Kazaks, they are best suited to the actors / actresses who watch the part. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> where in favor of the next battle sequence, scenes of next horse action, or the splendid beauty of landscape. <br /> It is worth mentioning that some important changes have been made by Nomad during his filming, especially the director and cinematographer. Ivan Passer (director) was replaced by Sergei Bodrov, and Ueli Steiger (cinematographer) was replaced by Dan Laustsen. In one respect, Laustsen seems to have the best eye since his vision of the countries made the final cut that we see here. Definitely a good thing. However, the change on Bodrov as director may not have been the most wise choice. From what I see here, the focus is on the battles and not the people, which I sense out of Bodrov's eyes and not the Passer. A true travesti. <br /> <br /> The most shameful aspect is that this could have been a really fantastic movie, with both characters and action concentrated. Unfortunately, the higher-ups apparently decided that such actions were needed and took good way (intellectually speaking). Even though I can not give this movie a positive rating, it is worth watching simply for the amazing movie work. But that's all.
