I think this is probably one of the worst movies I've looked at in a long time. Try to get the 'same characters' and different people * like * a bad idea. If they could not find Sarah Michelle G. and Ryan P. in this one, they should have just cut off the losses and tell them he and it. Instead they find NEW awful actors of what they did. I felt badly as I was in a high school or (bad) college playing with the leverage of acting those people out there. <br /> <br /> Where to find some of these people? Was it the first movie? It certainly seemed like it. <br /> This film is also the original parallel to a few lines of speech. I just made it look at the first one and popped # 2 in. I was all excited to get to look at the second one and it ended up being the worst show I had seen in a while. I'm not always ever * close a movie, but this one definitely goes after about 30 - 40 min.
