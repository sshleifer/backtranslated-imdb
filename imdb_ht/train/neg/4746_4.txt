There are several things that are wrong with this movie - the character Brenda Song was one of them. I do not think that the girl is a disgusting actor - I honestly do not. I believe it gives poor lanes. It is just supposed to be "prosperous, rich girl", and while it is funny at the TV show she plays in, she can not even get a dry laugh from me here. way, I really should know what to expect when I sit down to watch this movie. The movie was not terrible ... initially. Wendy's reaction to Shen was completely natural. I mean, how would you feel if a man, claiming to be a merciful mercury, chase you around your commander to put a medal and insist that you need to fight the "evil one" and save the world? Which brings me to another point. I know this movie is entirely fiction, but it still has a foundation in Chinese culture. It looks like all the "warriors" in Wendy's family line were women. Correcting me if I'm wrong, but I'm sure the monks would just be okay with that. Sure, maybe they could have worked it somehow, but also offered any explanation. By doing this, they just contributed to the many attempts of autonomous cheese made by Hollywood and the media. <br /> <br /> Never, that, however - let's continue. <br /> <br /> Wendy's character gets more unbearable as the movie goes on. Yes, she is a teenager, and she is close to resident-I mean, who wants to fight evil while resident? The problem is, when the "evil" begins to manifest itself, Wendy does not seem as freaked out as it should be. It is very negligently-even for someone like it. She continues to care for her training. I will use this conversation as an example, Shen: "If you do not win this battle, evil will take over, and all good things will go away." Wendy: "Well, talk about pressure ... well ... let's talk about something else." Yes, let's Wendy. Let's also dance when we should train. Of course Shen allows her, but her character has an excuse. It is better that she cooperates with her, than she does not, and she does not train at all and finds them both killed. <br /> Oh, talk about that. Shen also told Wendy that she was destined to die for her in battle, as she had for my grandma (I accepted this part). This makes Wendy's actions more unforgettable. br /> <br /> As the script writer would have it, Wendy's residents and this "big fight" are about exactly the same day. Do you know what Wendy does? You even have to guess? Yes, he ends up in the fight, so when he tries to leave for residents, the monks (which Shen was trapped in the body of his coach and teacher because he "felt strange to fight an old man") to inform him that Shen went to fight alone, so he went to save him. <br /> <br /> We initially saw some half-decade fighting, that's actually fun. Until finally, the great evil comes from the Wendy's-for-homecoming rival body, and creates the actual embodiment of his head from the breaking pieces of the bodies of his ancient warriors. <br /> <br /> Do not ask. <br /> <br /> Anyway, Wendy gets all "panicky." Then Shen goes and defends him from this guy - forgive me to forget her long Chinese name - and manage to get herself dead. Wendy captured Shen as she made her long descent from being comfortably upset when she called the title to tell the item. <br /> Now ... it was bad enough that Wendy became powerful far, far too fast. No, I will not let it be excused because it was her "destiny" and it was the "power of" it. <br /> <br /> Since, though, she has learned to heal? No, worst ... since he could resurrect people? So, Shen raised from death. Then Wendy and he fought the guy. <br /> It loses easy ways. The worst part is when they jump together, and kick him at the same time, and it is giving you forever. Then the clergy congratulated Wendy on his sacrifice. Two things, # 1: By the script writer and the director knowing that a fight needs a little more "delicacy" it? # 2: What Sacrifice? The fact that he did not go to Residents? Because the girl did not break a sweat, or even bleeding. I mean, coming in now, this movie was PG TV, I wanted to see someone get hurt. <br /> <br /> Ah-ew ... moving over .. <br /> I know it sounds like maybe I should have given the movie one, based on my comment. Part of criticism, you must know, though, is breaking something down. You do not necessarily try to look for the bad, but if it's, you pay attention to it. This movie has a lot of bad, but something funny happens when you never really expect something to be all too big in the first place. So I suppose it was all right. Not that I did not say it was not all right would have stopped anybody from watching her.
