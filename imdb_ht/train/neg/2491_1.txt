Maiden's trip is just that. I would like to say straight that I was looking at 5mins in this before I just could not stop it again. As already stated in another comment, this film does not fall at all "so bad it's good" stuff, it's just bad. The act is terrible, the SFXs are poor, and the story is bland and stupid. Even their support jumps, "guard guards" and these appear to hold weapons like water pistols. <br /> <br /> Do not even bother watching this movie, the only thing special about it is that, no matter what you expect, you will always be disappointed.
