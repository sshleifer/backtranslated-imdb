Really, movies movie really bad. Someone psychotic to escape from an asylum. Three years later he killed a sociology teacher, at the end of the stage. One semester yesterday later (hey, that's the title card said) a new sociology teacher is in the school. She makes friends with another female sociology teacher who works, and starts dating another teacher. Students are all bored, just as we are. <br /> There are a number of four titles indicating how much time has passed. Scenes are very short, and cut different characters elsewhere, make for small progression of any kind. A lot of scenes involve market characters and talk, or sit down and talk, and serve small goals. Despite the passage of time, many of the characters are still wearing the same dress. Sometimes clear passage of time means when we see a body for a second, we ask ourselves: how long has this body been? Also, at least one of the dead does not seem to have been missed by others. <br /> <br /> The assassin managed to kill one person by stabbed him in the breast, another by stabbed him in the side, and another did not slip his forehead. Is his knife poisoned or something? The video clip cover has a cheerleader: no movie. The back cover has a picture of someone in a graduation cap and ominous grooming a group of women in a dorm room. The central redhead of the picture is in the movie, but nobody is wearing such an outfit, and there are no such scenes. The assassin is forbidden one-on-one.
