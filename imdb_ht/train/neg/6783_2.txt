There seems to be a surprisingly high number of 8-10 stars reviewed here from people who never wrote an IMDb review before or since. Given the very low average rating given by the movie by others, I think you can draw your own conclusions. <br /> This is a very bad movie. I'm going to admit it, I thought the concept was kind of beautiful, and I was pleased to see the actresses who played Eve and Harmony on Angel getting jobs, but he did not take time for the sheer terror of this movie to make himself known. <br /> <br /> Interesting: The leads seemed competent enough, but everyone else? Terib. <br /> Trot: Chock full of holes enough to drive a truck. <br /> <br /> Direction: non-existent. <br /> Humor: Did they really think people were going to laugh? Oh boy. <br /> <br /> Candy eye: OK. there were some really beautiful women in this movie. Not only the three main characters, but right around the board. It was as if the producers hoped that the landscape would keep viewers so distracted they would not notice how terrible everything else was. If so, they fail miserably. <br /> <br /> In the right hands this could be nice but slowly funny classic camp. It was not even closed.
