Of course, "Flatley" is already not exactly the ideal name for a dancer, but I think Michael is really pushing the envelope of irony with this new title: "foot in flames" <br /> One really can not resist recommending Desenex Foot Spray in the Retired (and clearly, ill) Flatley. <br /> I could add that, much like this London cheetah (not review below), I am extremely upset about this being his last live performance. <br /> <br /> "Hinting it to be the last live performance, Flatley is celebrating on a London enthusiastic crowd." ~ Perry Seibert, all movie guides
