When this BBC's first show was over 30 years ago, it would be something quite different for the time. So, some people would find it quite scary, and may well have been impressed with the special effects? <br /> Look at the play of this day and age, It does not seem to be all that scary again, even the special effects can leave much to want. <br /> <br /> Can a train really be allowed to pass a RED light in a dark tunnel? I do not think so ...... But if you watch this play again, you'll observe that the first train that enters the tunnel, rushes right into the red light! (maybe it's how it was in time dickens)? <br /> You will also notice that the footpath that leads down to the Signal Box is very steep and in a poor state. Surely there would be a series of suitable steps and railings for the signalman to climb up or down to the cut. (I can not help but notice things like that) <br /> I will not take anything away from the act, both Denholm Elliott (signaling) and Bernard Lloyd (the traveler) have given wonderful performances. > <br /> I am not at all sure what is going on ...... I mean was the traveler's ghost, or what ??? Anyone really understands completely this story rather confusing ??? (well maybe I am the only one who does not) <br /> <br /> To sum up ..... <br /> <br /> The play has a wonderful atmosphere at all, with great character. It suffers from not fearing these days, and a little if not very confusing in places, and it has some strange signal practices ... <br /> <br /> Thanks for reading my review.
