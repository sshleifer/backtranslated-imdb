What a horrible movie! The idea of ​​robot fights with each other is cool, but the scenario is ridiculous, real human action that is ridiculous, acting non-existent and special effects (on which this type of film should depend) are reactionary. I thought he must have made around '80-'84 and was amazed to see it was from 1990. That's 5 years after Aliens! OK, many said it was good to consider the budget low, but I just think 'what's the point?'. it looks totally unbelievable. I would not mind seeing a remake with special modern effects and a story completely re-writing because I still love the idea of ​​great robots to beat crap from each other.
