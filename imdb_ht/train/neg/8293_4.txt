Yes, I know - you're quivering with excitement. Well, * Secret Life at Dentists * will not upset your expectations: it's solidly made, but essentially inimaginative, true but dull. It concerns the story of a married couple who came to be dentists and people who share the same practice (already a recipe for problems: if it was not for our separate work life, we would all spit our spouses from irritation absolute). Campbell Scott, whose whiskers and mindset do not remember Everyman so much that Ned Flanders from the * Simpsons *, is mild-habitable, uber-father's husband, and Hope Davis are the bored-housewife that channel frustrations of amateur opera. One night, as Dad & Daughters go to one of Davis' performances, he discovered that his wife is channeling his frustration over more than singing: he witnessed his wife kissing and flirting with the director of the opera. (A nice touch: we never saw the opera-director's face.) Threatening prospect for establishing procedures for separation, divorce, and childcare hearing - Profitable only by the lawyers - Scott chooses to pretend ignorance of his wife's imperfections. <br /> Already, the literary middle of you is starting to give up: Ho-hum, another story about the Pathetic, Sniveling Little Cuckold. But Rudolph, who took the story of a novel Jane Smiley, hopes that the goodness of the material will be compensated for by a series of flashlights, touching postmodern. For example, one of Scott's beer patients (Denis Leary, holding relatively - and blessed - in check) will later become a sort of construction imagination of the dentist, emerging as a Devil-on-the-shoulder advocate for old- fashionable menswear ("dump b --- h!", etc.). When not egged-on by his imaginative new imagination, Scott is otherwise tormented by fantasies including his wife engaged in a three-way and two-dancer-male men who work in practice. It will not be too far to say that this movie is * Eyes Wide Lock * for Real People (or grown-ups, at least). Together these lines, Campbell Scott and Hope Davis certainly recognize human beings as compared to the glamorous pair of Cruise and Kidman. Further, the script for * Secret Life * is clearly more important than the Kubrick. As proof, I offer the deposition of children to dentists, particularly the youngest who is about 3 or 4 years old, and whose main pronoun is "father of dad father father dad! This is family life, all right , with all its charms.The film would make an interesting double-billing with Kramer vs. Kramer *, as well. One can easily draw American Men's feminism from 1979 to 2003. In this movie, Dad is wife The married woman as Kramer * *, but she is in no way dispersed by the domestic role, unlike Dustin Hoffman, who was too manly to make a break. Here, Scott gets all the lead treatment, such as wiping up childbirth (and without writing the book of directors, it just takes a look at them), <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The movie has virtues, mostly having iron and verisimilitude. However, it has been dragged down from magnitude by insisting on trendy distractions, which unleashes At a long stage where a flu hurt in five days to make the judges at home. We must endure the free fantasy sequence, initiated by Leary's imaginary leader. Whose existence, by the way, is finally reminiscent of the character Brad Pitt in * Fight Club *. Then finally drove the movie home to other major flaws: lack of originality. In this review, I realized it was too easy for many other film references. Granted, this film is an improvement on most of them, but still. * The secretive life of dentists * is worth seeing, but does not get too excited about it. (Not that you're all that excited, anyway. I guess.)
