Just this PPV'd. I do not want to tear too much time on this as most of the posters here put it better than I ever could, but I meant to say a few things. <br /> <br /> I did not know that was funnier: Redgrave chase small butterflies and tripping on her nurse; Closed plainly that his boy "precious" (who he and the gentleman decided was a drunken loser) returned to roadkill; the tone-deaf of Ann Schmoozed and Peggy Lee; or the lurid CGI of Crypt Keeper Annie looked at his own lesser! <br /> I never bought Danish as the least redgrave. I did not buy Richardson and Collette as sisters, either. If Meryl Streep's daughter wants an actress, she's best to get Mama give her some lessons! I had zero idea why any girl (or Buddy) would fool about themselves on the stupid stud of Harris Day! Ann's daughters are like wounds and thoughts like her, Luc is a sneaky delay on crack, and I did not give a rotten on any of them! Evening gives Chick Flicks a bad name!
