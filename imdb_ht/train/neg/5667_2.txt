Had I checked IMDb BEFORE renting this DVD from Netflix, I'd have a couple of hours in my life back. I'm frankly suspicious when I see that a movie director also wrote it. In this case, according to the credits, the same guy was "bitter and director" - unfortunately, an indication of the overall quality of this production. There was a momentous momentum (for example, Judy Tenuta's scene reminded her early comedy comedy that took Judy-Ism) that led me to this star of one rather than one. But these moments, however, were few and far between ... and I almost did not get to see them because the opening opening was almost incomprehensible, not to mention the illness of its violence. I admitted I went back to look that part again to see if I had missed something that would help me figure it out once I'd seen everything there. Nope, though I at least recognize that the characters were that would turn out to be important later. The "revolving camera" technique was overused and essentially pointless. I find myself talking to the TV screen: "What??" or "For good sake, get over with it!" Not recommended.
