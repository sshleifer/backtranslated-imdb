Director of the Sidney J. Furie was created in Hollow Point by a post-modern absurdist who challenged and constantly surprises the audience. Sidney J. Furie dares ask the question of what's happening in the conventional tedious paradigms of 'drawing' and 'characterizing' by removing the crows from 'motivation' and 'reasons'. The result led me to say that my opinion of him could not possibly get any higher. <br /> One and a half stars. Nothing in this movie makes any sense, the law enforcement agents flatten out contrary to the organized crime crimes.
