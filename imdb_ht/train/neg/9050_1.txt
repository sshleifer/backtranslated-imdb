I saw this movie in its entirety in the 1960s and 70s, yes it is really, and it can be the proximity of the famous "Faces of Death" series in the 80s & 90s. Considering the state of so-called "driver education" these days, this one should require that everyone who is prepared to learn to drive. When you see violent death in all gorts & horrors, you certainly (if you have any tenderness at all) get a clearer perspective on the responsibilities needed to drive safely, which instant one of the obnoxious or inattentiveness of the wheel can do . I worked for Bell Phones in the 70s and 80s, and at one point was assigned to make a safety class. I found this movie in the company library, showed it to the session, a number of people who were physically ill and left the room! Incredibly, most of them later said "I never knew a car crash would be so awful!" This movie, and another, "RED ASPHALT", certainly the reality of its most graphic form. I will never forget it, I just wish I could get a copy when my kids went to "High School Driver" in high school!
