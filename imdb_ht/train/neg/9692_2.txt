Sincerely Bonjour covers similar lands as 'Members of the Wedding.' Yes, a daughter owns trying to prevent a relationship from forming a beloved family member with an interloper. While critics like 'Members of the Wedding', I get Julie Harris to be a jumbo-drag and a adenoidal, landscape-chomping thespian in everything she's been in. This disappointing show, rich idiots as of last year in Marienbad, but this time it's a traveler. <br /> In this sequel premier film developers, but characters do not. For the first 30 minutes it's content to flutter the father-child relationship between Seberg and Niven, which makes her comfortable sex uncomfortable. Once the conflict is presented, Seberg can not save the party's demand. Kerr pulls out and turns the movie into 'endless love'. Seberg's Rogue Warning is such a thing of strange weirdness - it's not good. I really wish someone else than Niven was in his role. She spends a lot of time normalizing British orthodoxy behavior throughout her film, she never gets around the character. <br /> In the most memorable sequence, an evening out dance gets a free-for-all at a port. Bertolucci steals the entire scene for her empty exercise, 'Conformist.' Kerr is on board for her but it shows another great pain (as in Black Narcissus, Night of the Iguana, King and I, in the Sky Knowing Mr. Allyson, Tea and Sympathy, etc. etc.). Really, Kerr was a terrible actress. I wish every movie with him could end up with a fatal car accident, or even better, starting with one. <br /> <br /> People who are uncomfortable with ambiguities should avoid this.
