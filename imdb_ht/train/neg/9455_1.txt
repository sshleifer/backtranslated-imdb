Well I guess I know the answer to that question. For the money! We were so bombarded with cats in the Hat Hat and Merchandise that we almost believe there is something good about this movie. I admit, I thought the trailer looked bad, but I still gave it a chance. Well I should go with my instinct. It was a complete piece of Hollywood trash. Once again proves that the average person can program to believe anything to say is good, to be good. Aside from the fact that the film is only about 80 minutes long, it obviously started with a glass of scripting food. It's full of trauma to failing attempts of humor, humor and horrible pastel scenery. He skips all over the universe with no destinations or directions. This is then composed of, ............................ yes I will tell it, BAG ACTING! I could not help but feel like I was watching "talking coffee" on SNL each time Mike Myers opened her mouth. Is the Cat intended for a middle-aged woman? Spencer Breslin and Dakota Fanning had no price either, but Mr. Myers would have to disappear under a rock somewhere until he's ready to make another Austin Powers movie. F-, no stars, 0 on a scale of 1-10. Save Your Money!
