This film is one of the movie-time films that have been movie ever. Dolph Friggin 'Lundren with a Japanese accent is oddly enough, but adds true buddy buddy buddy to the mix, a unique and over-the-head cruel, a subklot love-loving client and one of the worst endless evergreens , and you've got the tune of suicide-inducing yourself for those who enjoy their lives, and, until they look "confrontation," have never looked at themselves with a straw. <br /> I do not know if it's just me but subtext of all homosexuals is not too subtle. There are constant references to genital males, and not women, either.

"This is rarely funny and big fun thing if you're someone who enjoys receiving root canal from unconscious dentist , without Novocain. It's on par. Great fun for the whole family!
