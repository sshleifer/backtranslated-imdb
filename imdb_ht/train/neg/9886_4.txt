This movie is Peter Falk. Period .. I was 10 years old when this movie came out; I was already a movie maven at the time. Of course neither my parents nor I saw this movie when it came out, but I was in love with the tipface of its announcement & the aura that this was an important movie. Well, 34 years later I've finally seen the movie - never seen any Cassavetes-directed movie already. It's a hack, in general. Zero sense of distribution, correction. Gena's performance reminds me of Dustin Hoffman's stint at "Rain Man": technically on par, but entirely one-note. As Tom Cruise stole "Rain Man," Falk takes the cake for this movie. <br /> I was annoyed with Gena's performance, really at all - it seemed best suited to Awakenings. Not all his fault: it is a basket can come from the first stage. We never find out why? But Falk's character looks like real and does miracles by Falk as a seriously flawed man. <br /> <br /> Roots at least an hour (an editor needed!), And this would be a portrait of a woman caught under the influence, but in a simple, Cro-Magnon, man comes to grips with a wife who does not work & yet can not cope with her three children and her husband's long at work. d rather remember Cassavetes for the "dirty dozen" or "Baby Rosemary." It would be a better director to snipe his own trends for excess - as it shows much to this movie. <br /> <br />
