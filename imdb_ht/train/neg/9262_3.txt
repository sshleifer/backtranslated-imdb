On the surface the idea of ​​Ommen 4 was good. It is good to see that the devil child can be a girl. In fact, sometimes, as in the exorcist, when the girls own or are demonic it is very effective. But in Omen 4, he stunk. <br /> <br /> Delia does not make me think she could be a toddler, rather it is a child with problems. Problems that may be just a therapist, rather then a priest could help. It does not look frightening or damaging. Instead, it seems sulky and moody. This film was potential and if it was done by the same people who made their previous movie movie it was able to work. But it instead insults really to make an end to one of the most favored horrors of the trilogy, as a made for special TV movie. <br /> <br /> On many levels it lets go down. It's good looking, the act is rude and the typical effects of a TV drama. Characters do not bring any sympathy, and you do not go for them. I just looked at him after someone brought it to me for Christmas, and it was dating scratching. <br /> <br /> If you think of watching this, then I would suggest that you do not. Look at one of the others, or watch the exorcist, or look good to the child. Just do not waste your time on this drivel!
