The fact that I watch this entire movie says something about it ... or me. It's not a good movie. Terrible in fact. But terrible in the way that kept my attention in the way that perversion is analogous look at a tragedy and not being able to look away. It would make a great MST3K subject! <br /> Most of the things that make an awful movie enjoyable here are: bad dialogue, appropriate music, compression sequences, ridiculous pseudoscience. You will be thrilled in the sequel to the deaths of the poor, the poor victims and agape mouths and waaaaaaaay too much time contemplating their next bankruptcy, facing the redemption of their deaths. Your heart will be warmed by old acting action scenes as when two women are struggling for a gun and it's off, but what is the SHOT? Both look at themselves, then the other, then themselves, then (seemingly 15 minutes later), one finally drops. You will sing together (in Latin courses) and the street carolers that turn into a deadly death chorus that, for a moment, threatens to turn the movie into a tight music. So if you believe I do that as movies get worse to get better, then this might be a decent choice for you. It's not as funny as current Sci-Fi favorite Schlock, "They Live" featuring Rowdy Roddy Piper, but it's more fun to watch than luke-hot movies like omen II or III. <br /> I give it 4 out of 10.
