Went to watch this movie awaits a 'really really many' flicking movie, there are still many shame. The opening scene promised a little action and a coloring of comedy. It keeps you hooked for the first half until then you're expecting that now it's time for the kick kick action. Well, nothing of that sort happens. The movie jumps and ends in just thumps you down to a point that you get annoyed. Ask what was thought to the director. Make no sense. The movie was lacking in every aspect, there was no real storyline and it seemed pretty hollow, though "rambo" was in it, I do not think he could have helped the rating at all. There is simply no logic in the movie. A perfect way of wasting your time and money. By far the worst movie I've ever seen and I'm sure there will be others who will have the same opinion after enduring it. Definitely not for people with a little movie sense left in them.
