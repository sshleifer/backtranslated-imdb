I will not say that this movie was bad, but it was not good either. I hope a good thing but I guess Hum Aapke Hain Kaun was better than that. This was old fashioned old. At each stage of this movie, I hope for some twist and what I get? The girl burns and loves her aunt. <br /> <br /> Although being engaged, they must be allowed for every little move they have made. They are so daring to shy even after many meetings. I expect the aunt to be more brutally than that. Everything he did was crib frenzy. <br /> <br /> Hey, we have kids too, but we do not look at them and have tears in our eyes still. This movie is a dream. Happy woman, a wicked woman, good law and one who loves her to death. In HAHK Anupam Kher was the father of the poor bride and now he is vice versa. And I somehow knew that Mohnish Behl would be in this movie. Anyway, I believe I waste my time. I give it a 2/10.
