I find it the Diehl character is spaced for a microcosm of America itself - seeing Arab terrorists under each stone, only to find out at the end that it's his own actions altogether who got him in that state siege and really if it's good practice-will for everyone everything will rainbows and lolipop. Your Wim forgiveness has made amazing movies in the past that remain neutral in politics and for good reason, your weaknesses are weak and they weaken that a well-filmed, stunned film and absurd character, dialogue and draw. Best chance on your next flick. Another thing that has invaded my corner was the point in the homeless section of LA being there for hunger reasons, these people do not get enough to eat. Certainly these are not regular foods but the real hunger as such is a spiritual hunger, an emotional hunger, a mental hunger. They need self-respect, self-worth, dignity that you can not give to someone. Yeah people are hungry and if they need it readily available. The fewer cases of hunger in America, I would say it is the more drug center, drug abuse, mental suffering and economic devastation. Dealing with hunger although a noble endeavor is tape-helping a most problematic systematic society with old-age people in homelessness. Bill Diehl was good if Michelle Williams was beautiful as the youth (clich√©) old souls.
