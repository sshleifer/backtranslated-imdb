I failed to see the appeal of this series (which is supposed to be sci-fi). It's really just "Let's see what soap operational happens this week" and oh, the Cylons are participating in flashbacks. <br /> <br /> Cylon in "babe" who holds nailed to the other guy is very lame, it's very obvious that T & A added to the show. Every time she pops up I'm worried as WTF is supposed to be over. And do not even try my bullsh * t on "story arch". It's a soap opera and some cast-in castes. This is not science fiction aside from the original. <br /> <br /> This series is not everything it worked-up to be. If you love trendy, noble, dodgy, jumper, wave editor-on-crack camera work, this show may be for you. Since the nerves seem to be grievous about this show, it's a clear indication that voiceless nerve views have changed from TNG Picard.
