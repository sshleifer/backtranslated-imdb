This movie is bad. I do not just mean 'bad' as in; "Oh the script was bad", or; "The act of this scene was bad" ... I mean as bad as someone would be held as criminal responsible for foisting this unmitigated pile of gross steam over a unsuspecting public. I will not even dignify it with an explanation of the (Draw ??) if I can refer to it as such. I can only think of one other occasion in some 40-odd years of film watching that I found Need out my spit on a movie. I mean, after all, no one goes out to intentionally make a bad movie, they? Well, yes. Apparently they do ... and the guilty person is writer / director Ulli Lommel. But the worst of it is that Blockbusters is actually renting this customer! Take Advice. Leave this crap where it belongs. Glued on the shelf, pick up dirt.
