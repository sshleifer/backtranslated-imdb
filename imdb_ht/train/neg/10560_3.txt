A lot of other reviews here, including many whose opinions I respect, keeping this tranche of European horror sleazy in great consideration. Personally, I did not like it at all. It is an incoherent attempt at an atmospheric period between gender and violence. Jess Franco at best makes these types of films very well. Unfortunately, slave OS slaves Joe D'Amato does not. The best known films D'Amato are infamous for the high-grossed quotas. This, an early film by him, does not have the constant disgusting scenes that his most notorious "Anthropophagous" and "Beyond the Darkness" have made. Finally, an incoherent film that does not manage to involve the viewer in any way. Without the sleaze factor either, it becomes very boring. As I said, others enjoyed this movie, but I just found it to be a perfect example of writing extremely lazy. <br /> There are some pluses for the movie. Hula Aulin (from "candy") is in it, and it looks very hot and is often naked. However, film film Klaus Kinski is completely wasted in a subplot that has no connection to the main movie. It seems bored with the role and does not have the manicure intensity he does in his finest. The music note is beautiful and there are some short moments of gang involuntarily funny. Still, this is a pretentious and pointless film that is managed to be incredibly boring. (3/10)
