If you were to judge based on the movie alone, the committee that gave the "A Chorus" Award to a Pulitzer Prize, and Broadway hearing held the horse war running for 15 years, were all about heavy narcotics , because a unique sensation this particular film is NOT. What owns anyone who thinks Richard Attenborough was good fit for this material completely mystifies me, but it does make a music that is almost entirely on motion just sitting on the screen like one flowing of clay. <br /> Not content with the original note as it was originally written, someone decided that what the movie really needed was a new song song to the movie in some zip. So we are attacked with the Oscar-nomination (!) "Surprise, Surprise." Well, surprise, surprise, song, and so the movie. <br /> <br /> Grade: D
