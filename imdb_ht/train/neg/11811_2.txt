You know when you are on the bus and someone decides to tell you life stories, and you sit there with a pathetic smile on your face when all you really want to do is crazy crap and walk over? Well I had a similar sensation while watching this movie. Well, I was actually choosing to go and see Aprile, and I knew about tasting Nanni Moretti for making himself star in one and only from Caro Diario, but after about half an hour at last this slice from my memory I was willing to give Moretti to all the bumps. Caro Diario was funny, weird, and at least a couple of other characters managed to get a word in the corner. In Aprile, however, Moretti may be exclusive to the dialogue, so that all you have heard for an hour and a half is a great-nevertheless bride going on on how his politics are best, or that original piece of culture The popular tickling fancy it At that moment. He also found the time to slap in films that he does not like, something I thought was reserved for losers like me. Surely being in such a position as you would think he would try and make a point on the movies a little more intelligence than that. Do not make a good movie perhaps, one with some ideas and a decent structure, or perhaps one that is not entirely dominated by his annoying voices. But when she started to fumble about her newborn, I just wanted to go and be in the company of a normal person, preferably by a top-obsessed film director with an unusual tendency for tacky music. Next time someone you do not know trying to tell you life stories, give them a slap in my hand. Each blow will be a small victory in the fight against Moretism.
