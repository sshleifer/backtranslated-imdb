Padon. Someone said it. This really is / was a dull movie. Notably, but dull. I was almost crying with boredom when watching her. The act is very stressful, the story draws out and predicts the score and camera-work totally standard and unexciting. It's one of these movies you can not hate (because it's about people who is disabled), but hate it I suspect almost everyone does. It's interesting that the critics were so good in this movie. I suppose they are not allowed to targets. This was done to win awards - which I remember he did well. But it's neither fun nor fun. I have not seen the game so they can not compare.
