I'm very politically correct guy, so when I say sexist I really mean it reduces the female invitation lead, Dr. Miranda Jones played by Diana Muldar. In spite of all its assumptions and self-control, there is nothing more inside, but a great, jealous baby reasonably prolly had the plot now, after his Sidekick Marvik technique, also a lover, bending out when he tried to kill the Medusan, Ambassador Kollos, from a jealous man, but first glimpsed it instead. (You think he could just walk around the room and shut his eyes and phasered the box, too easy) he took the Enterprise into un-navigable space outside the galaxy before the boys could prevent him. Well, the boat stuck in limbo, at this point they could go to the proper doctor-lig lady and discuss it. "Spock has to make an idea of ​​Medusan so we can get home my way like tart you want to stay decree until we run out of material and die?" But the lady of true Star Trek star is a jealous monster that whines and victories when the idea is hacked, even when idol Medusan has told her to close & go along with them. So, the treat comes out of releasing despite the spelled melded that caused him to forget to put on his visage that Spock went crazy. Kirk, of course, figured out what a total twitch he was and shame him in fixing Spock up with his superior telepathic power. Of course, in the late Lady and Medusan left and forgiven. You almost want the President from Battle Star Galactica to show up to the witch's jolt out of a series of destructive cascades. But in land chariots, ladies are allowed to be totally unreasonable and wicked, but at the same time supposedly have sexual equality. This is what I mean by sexist.
