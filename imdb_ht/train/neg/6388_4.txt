Quay fees are directors, judging by conventional thinking, should be stuck in making short films. I myself actually really liked the first features, the Benjamins Institute, but judging by their sophomore efforts, the Piano Tuner in earthquakes, I want to agree that they do not come close to equal lasting geniuses of characteristic features. Piano Tuner is, without a doubt, a gorgeous movie to look at, and often to listen. Unfortunately, it's painful toothbrush to sit with its normal convoluted and glistening pace. Reading Summary of the scheme, it sounds like a very good story. But the brothers are miserable to bring it to life. One thing to consider should be avoided completely in the future: dialogue. My God, it's terrible here. A great bust.
