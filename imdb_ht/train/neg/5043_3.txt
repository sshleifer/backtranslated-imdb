I'm a great Ziyi Zhang fan and will go to any movie to see her who is what took me to Butterfly Butterfly. As much as I wanted to love this movie, I must agree with many others who commented on it. It is very confusing and also very slow. Because all the film seems to be fired with a hand-held camera, its important portion of focus is focused. <br /> <br /> The movie has very little dialogue and what there is is not much to tell you. There are endless scenes of people who are just standing around smoking cigarettes or sitting in a room staring at each other with no conversation. The movie time schedule is also very confusing and difficult to follow. Even having read a number of reviews in advance and having a general idea what the movie was about, I still had a tough time understanding what was going on. <br /> <br /> I knew in advance that the film did not remotely similar to Ziyi Zhang before filmmaker started but was looking forward to seeing her in something different, but unfortunately I was finally disappointed. She never smiles in this movie although admitted most of the time she has nothing to smile about. I could do without the sex scenes as they were about as sexless and without any obvious sentiment between the participants as you might expect.
