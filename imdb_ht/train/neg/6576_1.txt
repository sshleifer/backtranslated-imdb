I totally agree with those comments that said this is a good movie. This is a totally sucked movie. I mean SUCKED - S.U.C.K.E.D. The story development is strange. Mia Kirshner changed from an innocent girl to a party-fun chick looking for no compelling reason at all. In addition, all the actresses look too old for being college students - college students seemed like over 30 years old - you know the rest. I watched only about ten minutes and started quickly transferring to look for sex scenes. All the sex scenes are lame, sharply and, most importantly, no front at all. All the sex scenes are ridiculous, consider how many clothes were on. Make yourself a favor - put it down and save yourself a few bucks. Conclusion: History - 0, Sex - 0, Acting - 0, Notes - 0 August 10.
