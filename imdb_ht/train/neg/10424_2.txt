I should like this movie. The act is very good and Barbara Stanwyck is great but the movie has always seemed very trite to me. The movie is working class people look low and cheap .The tail that the daughter is ashamed of her mother and that the daughter does not ride above she always makes me a bit uncomfortable. Barbara Stanwyck as the mother worships the daughter, but the daughter requires a loving mother to find happiness and well-being to her father's family. I wonder how many others have seen this movie feeling in this way about it.again the act was very pretty and worth watching. I really do not like the story line. just a personal preference .thank you
