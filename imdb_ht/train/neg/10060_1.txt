The author lays on a "tour of discovery" of his "root" in the southern tobacco industry because he believes that the movie "Completely and Meritorious" films "Bright Leaf" is about an ancestor to it. It's not, and it's in fact discovered nothing of the same mild interest in this movie is absolutely comical and self-indulgently glorified, suitable for the screening of (director) reunions family drunken but certainly not for commercial - or even not commercial release. A good reminder of why most independent films are not picked up by major studios - because they are boring, irrelevant and with no interest to anyone, but the director and / or immediate circle. Avoid all costs!
