Remember the good animated batman show in the 90's? One of those who praised? One of the people of all ages can all appreciate? The one that has been shown to batman as a real detective instead of the mountain in a bat suit? One of those bandits you might have to deal with? One of which was cruel and real motives? <br /> Well, Warner Bros. do not do that. Hence this also. <br /> <br /> Honestly, do these people know anything about batman? Did they even look at a comedy batman before? Are they known to Batman mean to be a 'detective'? Put together 2 indications by making you a detective! That makes you a little intelligent monkey! <br /> This is the basic layout for an episode: <br /> <br /> Penguin steals something. 'Opening Credits'. Batman finds the help of death gifts where he is. Batman goes there and get in trouble. Sales. Batman finds obvious roads / stupid out of it. Penguin saves. Penguins do something obvious again. Batman follows. They make kung-fu (not everyone in style, and I mean everyone knows kung fu). Penguin Batman punch a. he gets to knock out. go to arkham. (Note: It's usually a different cruel every episode) <br /> Well, as you may have noticed in this, Batman is not a big detective. "Joker left this piece of cotton candy on the ground, maybe it is in the old amusement park!" Yeah maybe it has been 6 times the past. <br /> <br /> And I've already mentioned this but, everyone knows Kung-fu! ANVAN PENGUIN! where to think? (probably because it's the person who made that Jackie Chan animated series) <br /> What's really upsetting is that the show is just action. No smarts. None. If batman needs to think, it will use technology, then do some kung fu. But hey, let's not forget the bandits. And what would be batman be without his locker gallery? <br /> <br /> Well, first, I have to say, kudos for originality. I do not think other media should be viewed by Joker and a monkey-locked monkey man, riddler like an emo, and poison ivy as a minor (which is kind of confusing when you think about it, not sexuality it means to be the main force it?) <br /> What's even more crap however is that, every character is now a 2-dimensional, stereotyped thief. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Croc Killer wants to flood Gotham for no reason. <br /> <br /> Man-Bat is a hungry mad scientist who is obsessed with batons for some reason unreasonably. <br /> <br /> Penguins just want to steal everything. There is no reason. <br /> <br /> But the most insult was to be Mr Glaze. <br /> <br /> Do you remember the Emmy award winning 'Heart of Ice' episode from Batman: The Animated Series? The one who gave Mr Freeze the motive for his crimes? The episode was so good that it was used in the comics on its original story back (mad scientists)? The one who made him a victim, with a goal? Hell, even Batman & Robin acknowledged that, using this as Mr Freezes origin in that P.O.S. movie. Well this series says "F # ck that" and make Mr Freeze a jewel thief before his injury, and wealth only to himself, then gets frozen and give him the power to do these cold things. Then he continues to steal precious stones for any reason, while saying t lines like "Make an ice day." Maybe they watched Batman & Robin after all. Hey, look at the bright side. This series makes you feel nothing for the villains so that you are a good person. Good for you.
