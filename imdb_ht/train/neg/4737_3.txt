I liked the first "Azumi" movie. I saw Ms. Ueto in a variety of TV shows and I saw my fair share of samurai and ninja cops. I must say that this movie was weaker than I expected. <br /> <br /> Throwing the movie and setting up "Azumi", should have been able to do a better job with this movie, but instead it was slow, plodding in parts, and poured with lots poor, compelling, and sticky act. <br /> <br /> When the first movie reference is being tackled, they did so in a very loose and weak manner. In "Azumi", the title character is the best of a group of superheroes. In "Azumi 2" it seems somehow reduced and less-impressive. <br /> <br /> That does not mean it was a total loss. There were a few decent fighting scenes with some over-the-top characters. Unfortunately, the film suffers from the simple reality of Shusuke Kaneko and Yoshiaki Kawajiri by Ryuhei Kitamura and Isao Kiriyama. The two letters really captured the "manga" feel in the scenario whereas the former never got "got it."
