Have I ever seen a movie that is most strikingly non-structured? I can think of much that is equal to this one, but no one has managed to pass it. Throwing is a very awful stereotype that is very slow and flat dialogue. I'm ashamed of everyone involved in doing so. Each person puts an expression of fear not produced in the draw, but by the realization that this project could easily correct their careers. Even the many charms of Ms. Diaz do not give a proper reason to this yourself topic. Avoid, it's obviously a style of American films have not really got a hand in. See the final outcome if you must, and you will see what I'm talking about, but DO NOT say I did not warn you.
