This movie is one of the worst comedy movies I have ever seen. I hate these Napoleon rhythm-compromises. Just to face it the mute humor had already mastered. Do something new for once. All of these new comedies are just awful. And coming out of SNL Andy Samberg is not ready for a lead lead again. I hope he can bounce back from this horrible movie. And character Arnetts will be just plain bad. Hey Will, you read the script. The plot is really the worst ever written. Now you tell me if this is strange. (this is the movie) Dad's father Kimble's father's death stage and the family needed $ 50,000 to pay for heart surgery for Rod is planning this huge jumps to earn money for Frank. Only so that Rod can beat Frank in a fight and prove his mate. Yes that movie, you tell me, u u spend $ 7.00 to see that piece of crap! <br /> <br /> 3/10 just awful <br /> <br />
