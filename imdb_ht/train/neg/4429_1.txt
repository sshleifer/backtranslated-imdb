What a piece of stupid flip. <br /> I will not even waste time assessing any of the points in this show. It is not worth the time. The one comment I'll do is - why find such a DUMB, inarticulate doofus to be the star?!? <br /> There is not much testimony plus the involvement of mental deterioration in the networks than the fact FOX claimed it will not bring back John Doe (a decent series), but it will bring back brain-dead drivel like Joe Millionaire to yet another round of killing the brain cells in the American public. <br /> <br /> lost it, IMHO.
