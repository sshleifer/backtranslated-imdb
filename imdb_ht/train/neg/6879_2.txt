Rosie wasted a lot of television time talking about the Tainos as if they were super influential in the dynamics of Puerto Rican's modern day. They did not. The truth is that the Africans and the Hispanic were and knew it. What kills me is that he stands on the screen looking like some light light midnight black chick (with an obvious black father, cousins ​​and uncle) to pretend to really recognize the real sense of what makes them modern day Puerto Rican, but barely mentioning how African influences Spanish ways to talk, eat and music. It is so typical and I lose much respect for her and will not support anything else she does. Also, since he wants to dance around African-ness he then does not need to take more roles associated with clouds (according to Lackawanna Blues). We can find a prideful Black Latina next time (thanks Zoe Saldana, Gina Torres, Gina Ravera and Melissa DeSousa). <br /> <br /> For Puerto Rican here who are said to be African and not "black". ... thank you. We "black" certainly have nothing in common with "you" so no love is lost. But since you are probably in the United States and have benefited from civil rights movement we would like you to refuse any decent human treatment you received from the blood, sweating and tears in the backs of the "blacks" you share nothing and. <br /> <br /> If I correct Puerto Riken has a terrible image in the media, but we do not spend time trying to humiliate you because we know that the media like to exploit the low points and behaviors of all minorities to maintain generalization mindless. However, you obviously ate in the hype that your one is somehow white or superior ... or not. Also, you somehow feel obliged to believe that black culture is BET ... yet you are inaccurate and need to take a vacation out of the hood. Try to visit Atlanta, Ga, Houston, Texas, Charlotte, N.C. Do not trust me in those blacks wanting to claim your "culture" either.
